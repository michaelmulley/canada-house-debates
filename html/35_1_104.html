<P>
	The government is proud to talk about the sanctity of our 
universal health care system. However, when one of the towns in 
my riding advertised to replace a retiring surgeon for over a year 
it met with no success.
<P>
	By and large Canadian doctors seem unwilling to settle and 
work in the north. Consequently northern communities have had 
to increasingly rely on foreign physicians who must weigh the 
opportunity of working in Canada against an uncertain future 
caused by short term work visas.

about 160 to 1 in Vancouver.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, at a time when the <I>Toronto Star</I> announces that social 
programs may be cut by up to $7.5 billion and when the poor are 
justifiably worried, the government makes a point of reassuring 
the rich who have family trusts and do business in countries seen 
as tax havens. The chairman of the finance committee said 
yesterday that he did not see anything unfair in maintaining 
these tax shelters.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Are we to 
understand that the chairman of the finance committee acted 
yesterday as the minister's scout and that the minister, despite 
what he said back when he was in opposition, has decided to 
overlook the continuation of the privileges granted to these 
trusts?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, the government's 
attitude toward family trusts is very clear. That is why we asked 
the finance committee to hold public hearings on this issue. We 
eagerly await the committee members' findings.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government's complacent attitude goes against 
what they promised to do when they sat on the opposition side. 
The finance committee did not prove anything. It simply showed 
that the Minister of Finance does not want to review the issue, 
does not want to know how much money is kept in these family 
trusts or what our tax losses amount to. Obviously, lobbying 
efforts by the rich have paid off, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Is the minister suggesting that the possibility of using these 
family trusts, this powerful, outrageous tax planning 
instrument, to defer paying capital gains taxes for 40, 50, 60 or 
even more years is not an undue privilege?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, what raised the issue at 
the outset are certain amendments to the existing legislation that 
were made by the previous government, the Tory government.
<P>
	If pressure has been exerted by lobbyists for the rich, it is very 
clear that this was done while the Leader of the Opposition was a 
member of Brian Mulroney's Cabinet. If there was such 
lobbying, if figures are available, it is his government and the 
person who took his place following his resignation that really 
changed the law.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think I will have to send my c.v. to the Minister of 
Finance so he will know that I left the  government in 1990, 
while the privileges granted to the rich by the Liberal 
government in 1971 were extended in 1992.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> The Minister of Finance does not know how to 
count.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> The Minister of Finance cannot keep track of 
dates, so it is not surprising that he cannot keep track of deficits.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance not admit that he is flouting the 
most basic principles of fairness by maintaining this tax 
privilege for the rich, when he is thinking of increasing the tax 
burden on the middle class by taxing RRSPs while getting ready 
to reduce the level of social protection for the poor?
<P>

number of deficits while the Leader of the Opposition was a

	It is very clear that we, in our last budget, eliminated 
loopholes such as the $100,000 capital gains exemption. We 
understand full well that there may have been some inequities in 
Canada's tax system. That is why we are launching the most

constructive suggestions.

fishermen have no choice but to comply with the limit imposed 
by the federal government. However, following changes made to

of the conservation measures imposed by Ottawa.

lobster season to 10 weeks, his colleague, the Minister of

which is to eliminate the unemployed instead of eliminating

Party that the minister gave a detailed answer to the question 
yesterday.
<P>
	Let me repeat for the benefit of the Reform Party and the 
House that the Federal Court made a decision in this case and the 
minister concurred with that decision. As the hon. member 
knows, the minister did everything possible under the law to 
protect the public in this case. Furthermore-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party is not 
interested in trying to find out the truth and the answer.
<P>
	We cannot discredit the whole immigration system for one 
case like the Reform Party is doing. There is a Canada-wide 
arrest warrant for the individual in question. Once he is 
apprehended, we will be proceeding in due course.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I would appeal to you for short 
questions and short answers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this is not just one case. It is typical of many cases and the issue 
deserves an answer from the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The federal government has spent over a quarter of a million 
dollars supporting the so-called right of Mr. Mendoza to drag 
out his stay in Canada. Now the privacy commissioner has 
launched a taxpayer funded inquiry to determine whether Mr. 
Mendoza's right to privacy has been infringed upon by 
immigration officials, the media and the member for Fraser 
Valley West.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister, compared with the hundreds of 
thousands of dollars being spent on Mr. Mendoza's behalf, how 
much is being spent to repair the lives of Mr. Mendoza's 
victims.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alfonso Gagliano (Secretary of State (Parliamentary 
Affairs) and Deputy Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can only repeat the answer the 
minister gave yesterday and the answer I just gave. There is a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6559"> 6559 </A></B>
<P>
Canada-wide arrest warrant for the individual in question. Once 
he is apprehended we will proceed under the due process of the 
law.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the answer to my question was not on the paper, and so it was not 
necessary to read the paper. My last question is still to the Prime 
Minister.
<P>
	The immigration minister and the Prime Minister cannot dog 
responsibility for Mendoza and similar cases. They cannot 
continually shift the blame for these cases to the police, the 
courts or the refugee board.
<P>
	As the head of the government, when is the Prime Minister 
going to hold the minister of immigration directly and 
personally responsible for the multiple failures of his 
department?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have laws in this land and we have a Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms that protects the citizens of Canada and the people 
who are legally in Canada. We respect the law.
<P>
	This man is not legally in Canada at this moment. He will be 
found. We have asked the police to find him. We have issued a 
warrant for his arrest across the country. When he is arrested due 
process of law will follow.

	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Solicitor General. Last night, while watching 
the <I>Fifth Estate</I>, Canadians were stunned to discover that the 
committee monitoring CSIS was aware of the activities of 
informant Grant Bristow long before what was recently 
revealed. Back in 1992, the department of the Solicitor General 
already knew about the illegal activities.
<P>
	Will the Solicitor General explain why Mr. Jacques Courtois, 
chairman of the Security Intelligence Review Committee, said 
in his last public statement that he did not know that Mr. Bristow 
was working for CSIS?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we are dealing with allegations about matters that took place 
years before this government took office and before I became 
minister, but I will try to be helpful to my hon. friend.
<P>
	I did not see the program. I am informed there is a reference in 
it to a matter reported on in the public report of the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee in its 1991-92 report. That was 
tabled in Parliament. It is a matter of public record and it speaks 
for itself.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	Furthermore, Mr. Courtois is the head of a committee 
operating at arm's length from the department and the 
government. I think he is in a better position to explain his 
answers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> Mr. Speaker, what is 
going on at CSIS? How can Canadians have  confidence in CSIS 
when the president of the Security Intelligence Review 
Committee refuses systematically to answer legitimate 
questions from members of Parliament?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the chairman of the committee is bound by the law passed by 
Parliament. He is in no position to ignore it unless and until 
Parliament amends the law.
<P>
	The Security Intelligence Review Committee informs me that 
it is looking into all the allegations contained in the CBC report 
of yesterday evening. I do not think it is fair or reasonable to 
pass judgment on the work of SIRC in this matter until we have 
the report. At that time we will be in a better position to pass 
judgment on its work.
<P>
	So far I think we should let the committee finish its work. It 
wants to make a report this month. I look forward to receiving it 
so that, if any corrective action is necessary in the light of 
factual findings showing definite problems, I will be able to take 
that action.

Could the Solicitor General tell us whether he was aware of Mr.

	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House

have already pointed out that the allegations, and so far they are 
simply allegations, refer to matters that took place years before I 
became minister and years before this government took office. 
That is why I am very pleased that the arm's length independent 
Security Intelligence Review Committee, using the wide powers 
it has under the law, is looking into the matter.
<P>
	I do not think it is fair or reasonable to pass judgment on the 
quality of that work before it is available. Once it is available, as

I think it is well known that the law prevents anybody from 
talking about whether somebody is connected with or working 
with CSIS.
<P>
	It has not been confirmed that Mr. Bristow is in fact linked 
with CSIS. I think this is a matter we should leave to the Security

shortfall the government has only two choices: cut spending or 
raise taxes.
<P>
	Last weekend the Deputy Prime Minister said that social 
programs spending cuts would not go to reduce the deficit. I ask 
the Minister of Finance: Should Canadians take this as a sign 
that the government is preparing to break its deficit reduction 
pledge, or is the government planning to raise taxes as much as 
$10 billion?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

the first question is, as we have said, we are going to hit our

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of the 
areas the government seems particularly determined to tax is the 
retirement savings of individual Canadians. This will force 
Canadians to rely on the government's dangerously underfunded 
Canada pension plan and old age security program.

	In reply to a question I put to the minister yesterday to find out 
why Quebec did not have an economic diversification assistance

and its budget?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

plays a crucial role in the community of Saint-Jean, and through 
the Minister of Defence and the Minister responsible for Public 
Service Renewal, we will provide $5 million annually, money 
that is vital to development. The minister also announced that an 
advisory committee consisting of local authorities has been 
established, which is crucial, if we really want to diversify the 
region's economy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister's answer surprises me.
<P>
	Would the minister agree that the amount he mentioned for 
Saint-Jean was $5 million for building maintenance and 
organizing French courses, which has no connection with an 
economic diversification assistance program like the one the 
government set up at Cornwallis and elsewhere in Canada? I

that his position is nothing more than a cover-up of a Liberal 
election strategy gone bad?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, the use of the word cover-up 
sometimes is a little bit strong. I would hope that other terms 
might be considered when posing questions or answering 
questions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, I even find it more incredible that the 
Reform Party would be supporting the position of a previous 
government of Brian Mulroney with respect to the Pearson deal.
<P>
	The Reform Party seems to forget that there have been public 
hearings on the bill. The public has been heard, the facts have 
come out and we have reports that indicated the deal was not in 
the public interest.
<P>
	We believe we are on the right side of this. The people of 
Canada believe that we need to cancel the deal. We have and we 
intend to get on with building Pearson the way it should be, in 
the public interest.

	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
response to questions put to her in this House as to whether 
Canada had passed legislation on double hulling, the Minister of 
the Environment asserted in a sarcastic tone of voice that such 
legislation existed and had in fact been passed in 1993, did she 
not? How can the minister reconcile this statement made in this 
House on four separate occasions and the one made in 
Vancouver yesterday, when she said that there was no act on 
double-hulled ships and that, if such an act did exist, it would 
have the effect of shutting down the port of Vancouver?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was hoping that would 
have been the last question on double hulls. As I pointed out to 
the member, I not only sent him a copy of the bill but the bill in 
question which was passed in 1993 deemed that all newly 
constructed oil tankers must have a double hull. That was the 
law of the land adopted in 1993 and I sent the member a copy.
<P>
	What was suggested in Vancouver and to which I objected was 
that unilaterally Canada should prevent any ship coming from 
any other country that was built before 1993 that did not have a 
double hull for oil tankers.
<P>
	What I suggested very clearly in the port of Vancouver is that 
when we move on double hulling, and my colleague the Minister 
of Transport is very interested in this issue and understands that 
we need to have an international agreement, we have to make 
sure that the port of Vancouver has the same chance to compete 
as the port of Seattle. That is why I made the point.

Kelly's lawyer, but more fundamentally to order an independent 
review into the Kelly case.
<P>
	Will the justice minister commit to this House that he is going 
to order an independent inquiry and if so, when and what form of 
inquiry?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member is a little late. There has already been 
a press release issued. The Minister of Justice has appointed a 
special counsel to look into the Kelly case, both what has 
transpired and what will transpire. The investigation will

GOVERNMENT SERVICES ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from October 4, consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-52, an act to establish the Department of 
Public Works and Government Services and to amend and repeal 
certain acts, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee; and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I was 
saying yesterday in my presentation, the minister has already 
invited all members, be they from the other side of the House or 
from this side, to get on the open bidding service.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The minister has also introduced in this bill clauses in the 
contracts effectively eliminating the practice of contingency 
fees and securing government contracts. This will go a long way 
in curbing the influence of lobbyists in this area. He has also 
introduced sound guidelines with respect to purchase of 
advertising and public opinion  research which brings the 
procurement of these services in line with general purchasing 
practices.
<P>
	These and other initiatives taken by the department have 
already had a very positive effect on the partnership between the 
government and the business community. They have gone a long 
way toward reassuring the general public that the government is 
conducting its business in a fair, open and efficient manner.
<P>
	Public Works and Government Service Canada is committed 
to seeking out more opportunities to co-operate with the private 
sector and to establish strategic partnerships wherever possible.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, in the past year, the Minister of Public Works 
and Government Services has achieved convincing results in 
support of government goals and priorities by increasing 
operational efficiency, eliminating duplication, establishing 
partnerships and restoring trust in our government. This shows 
among other things that integrating the most important common 
services into a single organization makes sense.
<P>
	Bill C-52 will give the department the legal foundation it 
needs to pursue government objectives in order to better serve 
all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do 
not want to let the member mislead this House. It is completely 
false to say that improvements were made in the Department of 
Public Works to make it more transparent and to reduce the 
influence of lobbyists.
<P>
	Furthermore, for members of the Bloc, for example, it has 
become nearly impossible to obtain information on how Public 
Works awards contracts. As members of Parliament, we would 
like to have access to this information and we are prevented 
from having it. We get the feeling that there is not only lobbying 
and patronage but that there may also be a lot of inefficiency and 
waste.
<P>
	So when the member says that the Department of Public 
Works is open and efficient, that is far from true.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, the purpose of this 
bill is to bring together four organizations in order to reduce 
costs for the government and to provide taxpayers with better 
service at lower cost, so this bill is worth presenting.
<P>
	I hear that there is no openness, but the open bidding service 
exists and all members of this House have been invited to use it. 
This computer system provides access to the information at any 
hour of the day or night. It does not cost much and even your 
constituents and business men and women can subscribe to it. It 
gives you information on the kinds of contracts available, their 
value, who bid in the past, how many contracts have been 
awarded in the past few years and also the value of the contracts 
that were awarded. If that is not open, I do not know what it is.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6569"> 6569 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Mr. Speaker, as far as openness is concerned, 
again, of course this computer system provides information on 
contracts, on some but not all contracts. Many contracts are 
submitted by other departments or by public tender; maybe in 
some cases, maybe not in others, we do not know. Many 
contracts are not on that information system. Of course, an 
electronic listing of government contracts is not a bad thing. Of 
course not. But how do you go from there and say that merging 
four organizations in one department, Public Works and 
Government Services, will improve the efficiency of awarding 
contracts or even the openness of the process, when we have to 
know if there is really waste or inefficiency?
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	I even hear from some people who worked in the department 
that the regulations and their application are so confusing that 
they are afraid to disclose what goes on inside the Department of 
Public Works. There are all kinds of regulations in the 
government, but actually implementing them is another matter 
and that is where waste and inefficiency and patronage come 
into the Department of Public Works. And we know it. We said 
many, many times before that if there is one department where 
patronage and waste are a problem, it is the Department of 
Public Works and Government Services.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, in the registration of 
contingency fees, since May of this year Public Works and 
Government Services Canada has put in place that every single 
person who bids for contracts in the public service sector, of 
which there are almost 175,000 to the tune of $10 billion, must 
state clearly that they have not hired lobbyists to influence any 
contract.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Sometimes I am also shocked because since the Bloc 
Quebecois came on the scene, it has been criticizing us 
federalists on this side of the House and saying that we waste 
money and that there is so much duplication throughout the 
federal system. This bill is intended to eliminate duplication and 
make the service more productive, that is make it provide 
service to the Canadian public. We will save money with this 
system.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I find it appalling at times that they criticize. When we do take 
the initiative in this government to group together three or four 
levels of service under one roof to provide that service so vitally 
needed, not only for the business community but for our 
taxpayers who ultimately pay the final bill, the hon. member on 
that side of the House has the audacity to criticize us for doing it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate on the bill to establish the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services. As you 
know, this is an incorporating act which,  by tradition, is not 
considered to be very controversial legislation. Not so with this 
bill. The Bloc Quebecois does not have to follow any such 
tradition: We are here to question everything, even what appears 
to be a mere formality.
<P>
	In fact, the seemingly neutral character of this legislation 
conceals very important considerations. This tool to restructure 
the Department of Public Works and Government Services 
should have been used to develop procedures ensuring true 
transparency regarding the management of public money. Such 
transparency is conditional on extending the role of MPs. Let us 
not forget that this department is among the top solicitors of 
goods and services.
<P>
	In the 1994-95 budget, expenditures for this department were 
expected to reach $2.3 billion, under the program for real 
property services, supplies and Crown corporations. In 
1992-93, through the Quebec procurement directorate alone, a 
total of 17,400 contracts representing an estimated value of 
$269.9 million were awarded. Cheques totalling over $34 
million were also sent out in the form of benefits, payments and 
tax refunds.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	Stocked items representing $3 billion were sold, as well as $4 
million worth of surplus assets, through the Crown Assets 
Distribution Centre. But are there any monitoring measures 
involving elected representatives?
<P>
	In other words, this bill should be based on the fundamentals 
of government transparency, follow-up and monitoring, in the 
riding, by the member concerned. Unfortunately, this is not the 
case. Early last summer, I asked the Minister of Public Works to 
provide me with information on his department's activities in 
my riding of Châteauguay. Like my colleagues from the Bloc 
Quebecois, I thought this was a very reasonable request, since 
one of the major roles of a member of Parliament is to ensure 
proper management of the taxpayers' money spent on federal 
government operations.
<P>
	After a long wait, I was really surprised to get from the 
minister a rather terse and disappointing answer. He told us, and 
I quote: ``Unfortunately, the information you are requesting 
cannot be found in a single document only- In short, your 
request would represent an excessive workload for our 
department-'' This goes to show what the government thinks 
of follow-ups by members on expenditures made in their 
ridings. How can a member of Parliament carry out his or her 
duties and functions when he is unable to get follow-up reports 
or information on the operations of this department in his or her 
riding?
<P>
	This lack of transparency is what people concerned by the 
integrity of the public system have been decrying for some time 
now. This lack of transparency can be noticed even in our ridings 
as it affects civil servants and contractors. Let me give you two 
examples from my riding of Châteauguay. Early this year, the 
director of the  Canada Employment Centre in Châteauguay 
called me to ask if I had any objection to the Centre being 
moved. The offices were getting crowded it seems. Of course, I 
said I saw no drawbacks, but I would have liked to know the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6570"> 6570 </A></B>
<P>
criteria that were used and be informed before the decision was 
made.
<P>
	Some time later, the manager of the building told me that he 
could have provided more space to the Centre, making the move 
unnecessary. How much did this move cost? How could I check 
and interfere in this matter without the proper documentation? 
At a time when it is no longer possible to waste taxpayers' 
money, why is the member constantly fighting to obtain 
information?
<P>
	I have another example. I have learned recently that the 
Canada Employment Centre in Châteauguay had asked a 
non-profit organization, namely the Société de développement 
économique de Roussillon or SODER, to manage the 
independent workers assistance program. It did not take long for 
some people to come to my office complaining about decisions 
made under the program. When I asked the director of SODER 
for information regarding the budget, the number of 
applications turned down, the reason they were turned down, the 
name of the applicants, etc., he told me that all this information 
was confidential.
<P>
	According to him, he was the one who made the decisions. Is 
it possible that an employee working under contract for a federal 
government agency can decide what an elected member of 
Parliament has the right to know? I talked to the director of the 
Employment Centre. He was supposed to know whether this 
situation was normal. I have been waiting for his answer for 
several weeks. I am now convinced that I should go to the 
minister and ask him again to be more open and to have more 
respect for the role of the member of Parliament.
<P>
	Similar examples speak for themselves. It is not surprising, in 
these circumstances, that about 87 per cent of Canadians no 
longer believe in politicians. What do we do? What can we do? 
The bill before us today gives us a golden opportunity to change 
direction. With this merger which, according to the government, 
will lead to savings, it would be possible to put in place control 
mechanisms accessible to members of Parliament in order to 
make the system more transparent.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	The minister was worried about the cost of transparency. He 
even used this as an excuse to turn down my request. I suggest 
that transparency, and to me there are no ifs and buts, is a real 
way to save money. Today, how can we be sure that budget limits 
are observed? This is not about challenging the way public 
servants implement policies and regulations. It is about 
exercising our vigilance as elected representatives.
<P>
	The government should use this bill to set up the appropriate 
mechanism for exercising that vigilance. The Auditor General 
of Canada has already pointed out the department's 
shortcomings in this respect. In 1991, leased  office space 
represented over 40 per cent of the total and required annual 
rental expenditures of $379 million. The Government of Canada 
procured goods and services for a total of $8 billion annually 
and participated in the administration of major projects valued 
at $23 billion.
<P>
	According to the Auditor General, the department awarded $3 
billion worth of non-competitive contracts annually-three 
billion dollars that were not subject to the rules for competitive 
bidding. Furthermore, there was no corporate system to record 
and report on supplier and product performance. What action 
was taken on the comments and recommendations made by the 
Auditor General?
<P>
	Whether the project is in its initial stages, during the bidding 
process, or in its final stages, when the books are closed, access 
to information is not available as a matter of course. Much 
depends on the good will of public servants, whose workload 
was not planned to accommodate this much needed 
transparency. However, whether we are talking about agencies 
or individuals, when funds are allocated from the public purse, 
public funds and the public interest are involved, so we must be 
able to account for the ways such funds are spent.
<P>
	This lack of transparency casts some doubts on the integrity 
of the entire system for awarding contracts. Transparency is 
essential to prevent any possibility of patronage, conflict of 
interest or undue privilege. Look at the Pearson Airport case. 
Look at the bill to control lobbyists, a bill was watered down as a 
result of very effective representations made by those same 
lobbyists. Look at the proposal concerning grassroots funding of 
political parties which was dismissed out of hand by the 
Liberals.
<P>
	The management and control of government contracts must 
be a priority for us, for the sake of both fiscal responsibility and 
openness. Recently, a Canadian Press dispatch indicated that in 
1993, that Coopers &amp; Lybrand, a very prestigious firm, 
contributed to the then leading federal parties: $107,000 to the 
Liberal Party of Canada, and $150,000 to the Progressive 
Conservative Party. During the 1992-93 fiscal year, that same 
firm was awarded government contracts for a total value of 
$3,771,917. If you are good with arithmetics, you can figure out 
that Coopers &amp; Lybrand's total contribution of $257,000 is 
approximately 6.8 per cent of all the contracts awarded. A pretty 
good return!
<P>
	I have another similar example. Again according to the 
Canadian Press, Ernst &amp; Young also participated in the funding 
of the two major federal political parties in 1993. It gave 
$64,000 to the Progressive Conservative Party and $44,000 to 
the Liberal Party of Canada. During the 1992-93 fiscal year, that 
firm was awarded government contracts worth $272,132. The 
ratio is much higher in this case since the total of $108,000 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6571"> 6571 </A></B>
<P>
contributed is 39.6 per cent of the contracts awarded. I leave it 
up to you to draw your own conclusions.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	These two examples stress the need for openness in the 
government contracting business. As things stand right now, all 
government contracts over $25,000 for goods purchased or over 
$60,000 for capital projects are handled through the Open 
Bidding Service, the OBS, which is an electronic service 
available only through subscription. If contracts are less than 
$25,000 or $60,000, invitations to bid are sent to the chosen few 
who are listed on the suppliers file.
<P>
	Of course, there are transfer payments published in the Public 
Accounts, but that is not readily available and is out-of-date 
when you want answers on what is happening right now, today. I 
must admit that the Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services is right when he says that these tools are meant to 
ensure the efficient management of the tendering process, they 
were not designed to give members of Parliament or the general 
public access to information on that process.
<P>
	This is precisely for that reason that the parliamentary wing of 
the Bloc Quebecois is asking for a monitoring mechanism which 
would scrutinize the contracts and implement what we are 
asking for in our amendment: openness. A contracting-out code 
must be included in the bill. In particular we demand that all 
members of Parliament, irrespective of their political 
affiliation, be consulted or at the very least informed, when 
government contracts are awarded through this process in their 
ridings. Finally, the Department of Public Works and 
Government Services must establish a system whereby periodic 
summaries would be made widely available.
<P>
	I would like to mention another particularly damning fact 
about the way the federal government manages public spending, 
and consequently the questionable administrative practises used 
in the Department of Public Works and Government Services.
<P>
	One of these practices, unfortunately not publicized enough, 
is to accept advance payments by government agencies to allow 
them to keep their annual budget allocation. In order to do so, 
they pay in advance for services to be provided in subsequent 
years and, as a result, they can maintain the integrity of their 
resource envelope for the fiscal year.
<P>
	Last month, the President of the Treasury Board wrote a letter 
to the Minister of Public Works and Government Services 
indicating that questionable practices, namely advance 
payments, were going on in his department. In so doing, the 
President of the Treasury Board was forcing the Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services to look into this practice 
involving among others the Canada Communication Group.
<P>
	In a press release dated September 19, he said the following: 
``In mid-August, officials from Public Works and Government 
Services Canada (PWGSC) contacted Treasury Board officials 
with information indicating that an internal audit showed that 
the Canada  Communication Group (CCG) might have accepted 
irregular advance payments. They asked for advice and 
direction on this issue. Treasury Board officials responded by 
explaining that this practice was indeed contrary to government 
policies, and gave direction on the actions required to rectify the 
situation''.
<P>
	By emphasizing the seriousness of the situation, the President 
of the Treasury Board drew attention to a problem inherent to 
the administrative practices of this government. In a letter to the 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services 
accompanying the press release, he even made the following 
comments: ``This situation is, of course, very serious. Of 
particular concern to me is the question of apparent disregard 
for existing principles of financial management and control 
within government and Treasury Board policy. Therefore, I am 
asking you to look into this matter personnally; have an 
independent review of the matter undertaken by your internal 
audit organization and report back to me within a month on your 
findings''.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	In summary, we have here a convincing and damning example 
of shameful waste of public finances. It is really regrettable that 
the ongoing inquiry was limited to the internal level. I doubt that 
this inquiry is being done correctly; it is obvious that the 
procedure used to examine this serious problem of fraud is 
deficient because it is limited to the internal level. How many 
such cases never get discussed in public?
<P>
	A conclusion must be drawn immediately about this major 
incident. The administrative practices of the government, as 
they appear in the present case, are in no way transparent. This is 
why the Bloc Quebecois asks in its amendment that all the 
expenses of the Department of Public Works and Governmental 
Services be made known to the public. I find deplorable and 
charged with consequences the fact that the government has not 
considered amending Bill C-52 in this way. The same thing 
could be said of the transparency, so often promised by the 
Liberal Party of Canada during the last election campaign, but 
which has gone unheeded since the Liberals took office.
<P>
	The control of public finances necessitates such mechanisms. 
Without them, members of Parliament cannot have free access 
to government contracts that are in effect in their own ridings. 
Without transparency mechanisms, how can we make officials 
accountable for their spending?
<P>
	The amendment of the Bloc Quebecois is therefore the 
expression of that new philosophy which should inhabit us all: 
to find a new way of administering public affairs in order to put 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6572"> 6572 </A></B>
<P>
aside the old traditional practices that are responsible for our 
$508 billion deficit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Bloc has repeatedly talked about ``transparency'' 
and ``openness''. I find very interesting that, since last Friday, 
not one Bloc member has accepted two proposals from the 
minister which would allow them to obtain the information they 
want. Not one member of the Bloc. Perhaps the Bloc could tell 
me why? This would cost them only $37 a year.
<P>
	On the same subject of transparency, committees such as the 
Standing Committee on Government Operations on which sit 
two members of their party can ask for any information they 
want. This is another mechanism which helps ensure 
transparency.
<P>
	As for the advance payments, what happened? The minister 
himself called for an investigation. The minister himself 
accepted the recommendations. The minister himself has 
already begun to make adjustments. The minister himself, with 
the President of the Treasury Board, is conducting an 
investigation in order to make further corrections. We have 
listened, we have heard and we know that there is a problem. We 
have taken steps to correct it.
<P>
	I find interesting that, when my colleague talks about 
transparency, he seems to want to use as an example the 
donations we have received from some companies. They know 
who our financial supporters are. That is why they put the 
question. We do not know who theirs are.
<P>
	Therefore, when talking about transparency, it would be 
interesting to know their reaction to that.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to make a last comment. When they 
talk about the data they want, riding by riding, they refuse to 
understand that we are in the process of amalgamating a number 
of departments where there were different systems. They are not 
yet all integrated, but progress is being made.
<P>
	I would like to hear what my good friend thinks about the 
questions I just raised and about the points I just made. Does he 
not think that he and his colleagues are going a bit overboard? 
This department is transparent, this minister has listened and 
has taken steps to make necessary adjustments.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Godin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank my colleague for his 
questions. I agree that his government is trying to be 
transparent, but we cannot see any results. It is the results that 
we would like to see much more quickly.
<P>
	The hon. member said that there were ways we could use to 
get the information, but this is not exactly what I want. In fact, 
what I would like to know is exactly what is happening in my 
riding, and how to go about finding that information.
<P>
	The computer system is often mentioned as a possibility. This 
is a good way to get information while the process is going on, 
but once it is finished, we cannot  confirm anything with this 
system. It does not work anymore.
<P>
	On the second question, I would say that yes, the minister is 
changing these things, but the point of our amendment is to 
avoid the need to provide for a mechanism that would force us to 
pay millions when it is not necessary, each time the minister 
notices-or fails to notice-that something is going wrong. We 
simply want to ask him to establish a framework that would 
allow the minister to do his job without having to check to see if 
there are any problems.
<P>
	As for the contributions we get, that makes me laugh. Since 
we raise money two or three dollars or even 25 cents at a time, 
you can be sure that we would much prefer to get $140,000 or 
$150,000 all at once. I would like that a lot. It would make me 
very happy to present you with a list. But unfortunately, such is 
not the case. For our part, we raise 25 cents or one dollar at a 
time; and I can tell that, at this rate, the list on your desk would 
be rather long.
<P>
	I think that this sums up what the member was saying. I would 
simply like to point out that on July 5, I wrote the following 
letter to the Minister of Public Works trying to get some 
information concerning my riding: ``am writing you with a view 
to obtaining information on the activities of your department in 
my riding. I would like to have the list of service, procurement 
and rental contracts issued since October 25. I would also like to 
have the list of federal properties located in my riding''. I did 
not ask for much. It was not complicated. This was the 
minister's answer: ``I thank you for your letter dated July 5, 
1994 requesting information on the activities of my department 
in your riding from October 25, 1993, to this date. 
Unfortunately, the information you are seeking cannot be found 
in one single document. In order to be able to answer your 
questions, we would have to conduct extensive research in many 
areas of my department and in the numerous data bases which 
we have inherited following the amalgamation of the four 
different agencies which now make up the new Department of 
Public Works and Government Services.
<P>
	Moreover, the costs involved in collecting data and preparing 
reports for MPs could run as high as $168,000. For the most part, 
this data is not computerized. In short, it would unduly increase 
the workload of our department. I am sorry to inform you that 
the department simply does not have the human and financial 
resources to collect the data you are seeking''.
<P>
	In other words, what the minister is telling me in his letter is 
that it is not possible for the time being. This is precisely why we 
would have liked to see the bill amended, so that we could be 
able to get the information we need, whenever we need it.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
simply wished to congratulate the member for Châteauguay. His 
speech was excellent and his reply to the member for St. 
Boniface most effective. He quite rightly pointed out that in 
refusing members of the Bloc access to information about 
contracts awarded in our own ridings, the Department of Public 
Works merely confirms its complete lack of interest in 
transparency. It is as though the department wished to conceal 
information.
<P>
	So I wanted to congratulate the member for Châteauguay on 
his speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Godin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member 
and tell him not to take it too much to heart. When, in a speech, a 
member points out a flagrant lack of control, however tactfully, 
it is never well received. I, too, wish to congratulate you on your 
speech.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. Resuming debate. The 
hon. member for Outremont has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin Cauchon (Outremont):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the light 
of the hon. member's remarks, I must say that I note a pattern in 
the Bloc Quebecois policy, which is essentially a double 
standard policy. Take the list of people who make donations to 
political parties for example. What is good enough for us -I 
want to emphasize this point, but I did not intervene when the 
issue was raised earlier- may not be for them, as we could read 
in the papers this morning.
<P>
	Coming back to the bill before the House today, I should point 
out that during the election campaign we promised to rekindle 
the spirit of co-operation between the federal government and 
the Canadian provinces.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, we made a commitment in the red book, 
and I quote: ``work closely with provincial governments to 
reduce duplication and improve service delivery''.
<P>
	This motto from the red book was quoted repeatedly by the 
Right Hon. Jean Chrétien, Prime Minister of Canada. We went 
even further-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order. I would ask the hon. members 
not to refer by name to a member currently sitting in the House 
of Commons. Ministers and the Prime Minister must always be 
referred to by their title. I would request the co-operation of all 
the hon. members in this matter. I give the floor back to the hon. 
member for Outremont.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Right Hon. Prime Minister of 
Canada then. We went even further in the famous red book, and I 
quote: ``This means identifying which level of government can 
best deliver what services''.
<P>
	No matter what the opposition claims, I can say that since 
October 25, that is exactly what we have been doing, as a truly 
responsible government. Day in and day out, we are wrongly 
accused by the opposition parties of  wanting to centralize 
powers in Ottawa. They keep wrongly accusing us, day after 
day, of not taking appropriate steps to cut costs. Day after day, 
they wrongly accuse us of encroaching upon provincial 
jurisdictions. Today however, they have a golden opportunity to 
tell us we are on the right track. Today, they have the opportunity 
to show that their constituents are well represented by 
supporting Bill C-52.
<P>
	Canadian taxpayers-as well as ourselves for that 
matter-have had enough of confused and slow services. They 
do not have the patience any more to tolerate overlapping and 
duplication. In fact, they demand that their government serve 
them better, faster and more efficiently.
<P>
	That is why, since the House reconvened, we have been 
looking at restructuring the public administration with a view to 
reducing costs and improving services.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	The government is confident that it can meet these goals by 
working essentially on four fronts: first, streamline the delivery 
of many services and programs; second, tackle overlap and 
duplication; third, define each sector's responsibilities; finally, 
transfer some activities to other levels of government, when 
necessary.
<P>
	Changing systems, work procedures and people's mentality is 
no easy task. You need energy, patience and a great deal of 
willpower. But, with good will, it can be done. The fact that, at 
their very first meeting last December, the ministers agreed that 
their priority would be to improve the Canadian federation's 
efficiency is a case in point. We have achieved very interesting 
results so far and the signing last June of bilateral agreements 
including an action plan to eliminate overlap is the best proof of 
that. This plan contains a detailed list of elements and objectives 
as well as a schedule in some cases.
<P>
	This intergovernmental agreement is a very important step 
toward a more rational and effective approach to public 
administration in this country. It is also a very significant step 
forward which, at the end of the day, will benefit all Canadians. 
It will also benefit all Quebecers, which is why the members 
opposite should, in my opinion, clearly support the 
government's initiative.
<P>
	What will be the precise impact of the bill before the House? 
What are its objectives? The answers are simple and obvious. 
The bill before us today meets the following goals: first, make 
policies and programs more effective, affordable and accessible 
to our clients; then, determine with the provincial governments 
who is in the best position to deliver a specific program or 
service; and finally, make adjustments to respect priorities and 
account for changing circumstances specific to each province.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6574"> 6574 </A></B>
<P>
	These goals are precise, realistic and totally focused on 
improving service to clients. There is no doubt that, with the 
provinces' co-operation, we can make rapid progress in this 
area. There is no doubt either that reviewing all our programs 
and services in order to reduce duplication and overlap is very 
important for all Canadians. In general, Bill C-52 will simplify 
administrative procedures so that we can conclude agreements 
with all provincial governments.
<P>
	Further to the agreements reached in July, the Department of 
Public Works and Government Services will soon begin 
negotiations with the provinces to determine just how 
government services will be shared. Among the priorities 
already identified are data processing, supply and real estate. 
The outlook for this co-operative shared approach is great. We 
are convinced that it is important to harmonize computer and 
information systems. We believe that we can save large amounts 
by sharing premises and services with other levels of 
government.
<P>
	Also consider related services like security, storage and 
reception, which, when combined, can save us millions of 
dollars a year and give everyone better service as well. All 
governments at all levels have budget problems. All 
governments must find solutions to the growing deficit. Of 
course, in the past, each one wanted to have its own structure, its 
own window and its own service outlets.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	We cannot afford all this infrastructure any more. Even before 
the recently announced agreements, provincial and municipal 
governments as well as public agencies asked us to help them 
get goods and services at a lower price. Indeed, the public sector 
increasingly realizes that we must be careful with our taxpayers' 
money.
<P>
	In fact, we are receiving more and more financial assistance 
applications from organizations, because the system is working 
fine in many areas. At present, we have co-operation 
agreements concerning the purchase of police cars with some 
municipalities, for example, and similar agreements for the 
purchase of pharmaceutical products and shared standing offers 
for goods and services.
<P>
	This is why this bill before the House allows the department to 
purchase equipment and services on behalf of other federal 
government agencies.
<P>
	Given the high level of international competitiveness, we 
continually urge Canadian businesses to improve their 
efficiency and become more competitive on both the national 
and international markets. These principles must also apply to 
the government and all the machinery of government. More 
importantly, it is crucial to put to good use each and every dollar 
the Canadian taxpayers entrust to us and make some wise 
investments.
<P>
	This is why I am particularly proud, as the member for 
Outremont, to support Bill C-52.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was rather surprised by the comments of the member 
for Outremont on the department's transparency. I want to 
remind him of the situation of a member elected to represent his 
constituents who asks a minister for information on his 
department's activities in that riding. This is not an extravagant 
request. We are elected to represent our constituents in this 
Parliament and we simply want to have an overview of the 
situation.
<P>
	The minister does not tell us he will ensure we get the 
necessary, and appropriate, information under the 
circumstances, so as to have an idea of the whole situation. He 
tells us: I am sorry, but the department simply does not have the 
human and financial resources required to gather the requested 
information. I find such behaviour to be unacceptable on the part 
of a minister. The minister is answering, in this House, to an 
elected representative asking for information concerning his 
own riding. If we start challenging the right to information of 
elected MPs, we will undermine the foundations of our system. 
Such an answer is tantamount to saying that we will not sue 
someone because it would cost too much, considering the 
amount of the fine that will have to be paid. This is totally 
unacceptable.
<P>
	I can easily make a connection with the comments made by 
the member for Outremont at the beginning of his speech when 
he talked about transparency and the funding of political parties. 
We do not have contributions of over $100,000 from the Royal 
Bank or RBC Dominion Security. However, we are not prepared 
to listen to these contributors more than to our constituents.
<P>
	Our constituents want to know about federal investments in 
their riding. How much is the federal government investing? 
What buildings does it occupy? What are the activities of a 
given department in our riding? The minister is not answering 
because he has to do some research. He was elected a year ago, 
but he still has not managed to put the pieces together. He will 
not even give us that answer. Rather, he says: No, I cannot 
provide that information because it is not available in a 
document. Goodness gracious, let him hire some researchers to 
do the job!
<P>
	The minister's position is an attack against the role of a 
member, who has the legitimate right to ask a minister for 
information on what his department is doing in the member's 
riding.
<P>
	In the past, similar questions were asked concerning other 
departments and answers were provided. In the case of Supply 
and Services, which involves the whole issue of procurement, 
that information is not available. Instead of admonishing us, the 
hon. member for Outremont should go to his minister and 
request the same information to see if he can get it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6575"> 6575 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am always amazed at how 
members of the Bloc Quebecois seem to miss the point.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	The purpose of my speech was to explain to the public that 
this bill is in the best interests of all Canadians. What we are 
seeking to do is to eliminate duplication and to make 
government more efficient so that the taxpayers get better value 
for each dollar they invest.
<P>
	It is obvious that members of the Bloc Quebecois are unhappy 
about this and that is why they are trying to attack us today on 
the issue of transparency when there is actually no such problem 
in this department. There is a policy regarding access to 
information and it applies to all departments.
<P>
	Members of the Bloc are missing the boat today. It hurts them 
to see a government which advocates a cost-effective 
federalism, a co-operative federalism, a progressive 
federalism. It hurts them to see a government which is willing to 
work in partnership with other levels of government, as we did, 
for example, with the infrastructure program, as we did last June 
when we signed a domestic trade agreement with an exception 
for culture in Quebec. It hurts you because you are not here to 
work for all Canadians. You are here for one reason, and one 
reason only, that is to try and reach your very partisan goal: the 
separation of Quebec.
<P>
	If, instead of thinking about the separation of Quebec, you 
began right now to think about improving how things are done in 
Canada and moving towards a viable progressive federalism, I 
am sure that taxpayers throughout the province of Quebec would 
be a lot prouder of your work.
<P>
	I am a bit disappointed to see that the only members who truly 
represent the interests of Quebecers are the ones on this side of 
the House, and I mean the government side.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
also very surprised to see the hon. member for Outremont praise 
Bill C-52. He might think we are progressing, but it seems to me 
we are not moving very fast. If this is a sign of federalism being 
profitable, I feel it is being sort of a slowcoach.
<P>
	It is more than obvious that the public works department is a 
total failure in terms of openness. It is very difficult to obtain 
information from the minister. We asked over and over again for 
information on contracts awarded in our ridings, which is 
something quite basic I think.
<P>
	Given all the waste, the patronage and the enormous deficit of 
this country, which everyone knows about, we must take all 
possible measures to deal with these problems and with 
inefficiency. The minister of public works did not see fit to 
include any provision in this bill which would make his 
department more efficient. This bill contains minor changes and 
nothing that would make a real difference.
<P>
	The decision to amalgamate four services will not make 
federalism more profitable and will not convince Quebecers to 
remain in Canada. For heaven's sake, this bill does not even 
touch on the main problem. That is why we propose that a 
committee be set up to monitor and supervise operations within 
the department. We all know that. It is obvious.
<P>
	When you ask questions to the Minister and hope for answers, 
you only get systematic rejection. Is that what the federal 
government calls transparency?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> That is not the question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> It most certainly is, because that is the 
problem. The problem now with Canada and the federal 
government is the $533 billion debt and the $40 billion or so 
deficit. We must control expenses and reduce waste. This is the 
basic thing to do. This is another example showing that the 
minister of public works do not wish to do anything in order to 
get his department in order and curb all the waste and patronage. 
We would be willing to cooperate, if only we had the proper 
information. We could work with this department to identify the 
areas where there is patronage and waste. While government 
clearly stated it was in favour of transparency, there is none in 
this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cauchon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be brief, because I have 
already answered. I want to say, as I did several times, that I 
have a great respect for my colleagues on the other side of the 
House. I also respect what they represent and why they were 
elected. However, I feel compelled, at this point, to point out 
once again that the only problem with the Bloc Quebecois at the 
present time is that, unfortunately, it is not working in the best 
interests of the public as a whole.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	As my colleague underlined earlier, they have had the 
opportunity for the last four or five days to go and sit down with 
the department and discuss the bill that is before us, to discuss 
some of the problems that they saw in that bill. They refused to 
do that. So, it is an unwillingness to co-operate. In fact, there 
was no question.
<P>
	I simply want to say that it is a shame that those people cannot 
decide to do their share and work in a co-operative and 
constructive way with the federal government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
comment by the hon. member for St. Boniface, who said that the 
hon. member for Gaspé was always very frank and forthright. I 
certainly intend to live up to that reputation.
<P>
	Before I start my speech in this debate on Bill C-52, I would 
like to remind hon. members opposite that Quebecers follow the 
debates in the House very closely, and there are even children 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6576"> 6576 </A></B>
<P>
among our listeners. I imagine that occasionally they must find 
what is said here in this House rather hard to take.
<P>
	Speaking of children, if I may be allowed to digress and take 
advantage of modern technology, today is my son's birthday, 
and since I have to work here in Ottawa, I would like to take this 
opportunity, offered by the cameras and with your permission, 
Mr. Speaker, to wish him a very happy fourteenth birthday.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dhaliwal:</B> I hope he is a federalist.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> The purpose of the bill before the 
House today is to amalgamate the former departments-that has 
happened before- of Public Works and Supply and Services. 
Public Works Canada was in charge of two other branches, while 
services were something else, and government services is 
something else again.
<P>
	This is just to say that when we amalgamate entities that are 
criticized for their lack of transparency, that does not 
automatically make them transparent. To me, this is basically a 
housekeeping bill. However, it is not at all what we expected. In 
fact, the party in power, the Liberals, missed out on this one. We 
are sorry but we cannot support this bill for the reasons I will 
mention.
<P>
	The government has missed an opportunity to make the 
process of awarding contracts more transparent. The 
government has also missed an opportunity to limit the 
influence of lobbyists. And again, to do some thorough 
house-cleaning in its contracting out procedures. That is why 
the Bloc Quebecois presented the following amendment, moved 
by the hon. member for Québec-Est. I would like to repeat it, 
since we have a different audience at this time of the day. The 
motion reads that: ``this House declines to give second reading 
to Bill C-52, an Act to establish the Department of Public Works 
and Government Services, and to amend and repeal certain acts, 
because the principle of the bill does not provide for a specific 
code of ethics to be put in place aimed at making transparent the 
contracting process and the acquisition of all goods and services 
by the Department of Public Works and Government Services 
Canada''.
<P>
	When I say there is a lack of transparency and when they tell 
me that they intend to provide that transparency and make it all 
nice and consistent, we should remember the principle that one 
cannot be judge and jury. Bill C-52, as it is now, at page 3 in 
clause 7, assigns all powers to the minister.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Allow me to read it. Clause 7(1) says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In exercising the powers or performing the duties or functions assigned to the 
Minister under this or any other Act of Parliament, the Minister shall a) 
investigate and develop services for increasing the efficiency and economy of 
the public service of Canada;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	How can he, in his own bill, creating this department by 
merging various agencies, be both judge and judged?
<P>
	What we are asking for, should he intend to do something, is 
that he does it now, so we can judge what he will be coming up 
with. I think it is basic. Even my 14-year old son, who has not 
gone through law school yet, could understand that.
<P>
	We reject this bill for several reasons. Basically, we want 
openness. I said it, but I will repeat it again and again. In 
Quebec, for example, the legislation on political party financing 
and the very strict rules regarding the awarding of contracts 
have made us accustomed to a much greater openness than what 
we can see in the federal government. Even Liberals recognize 
the shortcomings of the system. I would like to quote from the 
red book, that I cannot show, page 95, where it says: ``We will 
follow the basic principle that government decisions must be 
made on the merits of a case rather than according to the 
political influence of those making the case. We will take an 
approach of openness in decision-making''.
<P>
	I think they just missed the first opportunity they had to put 
this into practice. They missed it. If openness had really been 
their intention, they could have included it in this bill. We play 
fair, so we will give them another chance, we tell them: ``Scene 
one, take two. Take back your bill, add to it something which 
will ensure openness and then, we will work with you''. That is 
what we call co-operation, at least in the riding of Gaspé.
<P>
	Unfortunately, this is not what we hear from members 
opposite. The government might mean well, but it missed a 
golden opportunity. It is conceivable that my friends opposite, 
the Liberal members, are pleased with the system as it is. Maybe 
the friends of the Liberal Party like it that way. Maybe-
<P>
	There is another point I would like to make again, even if it 
was already mentioned by some of my colleagues. I, too, have 
written to the minister-I worked hard last summer-to try to 
make him understand that we wanted changes. I tried to 
understand what was going on within Public Works Canada. I 
too wrote to the minister to try to find out what were the assets of 
the federal government in the riding of Gaspé. I also wanted to 
know about its activities but, just as my colleague from 
Châteauguay who spoke earlier, I received a letter informing me 
that it was impossible.
<P>
	What angered me most was that the letter mentioned the cost 
of retrieving this information. It was said to be $168,000. 
However, I was told that this is what it would cost to inform 
MPs. Am I to understand that informing 295 MPs would cost 
$168,000? I want to bring to the attention of the members that 
contracting-out in the federal government is a $5.2 billion 
industry. And yet, this government refuses to spend $168,000. 
What percentage is that? I do not have my calculator, but I am 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6577"> 6577 </A></B>
<P>
sure that it represents a minute fraction of what it costs to 
manage a $5.2 billion industry.
<P>
	And while we are asked to make an act of faith, to write a 
blank cheque, to give our support, we are denied the very tools 
we need to do our job.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	Is this what you call being transparent? All I can say is that in 
the riding of Gaspé, this is definitely not transparent.
<P>
	I would also like to comment on standards governing the 
awarding of these contracts. As far as I can see, there are no 
uniform standards. It seems that the only existing rules are 
internal to each department, but they are easy to get around and, 
most of all, they are far from being clear. Since there are no 
uniform rules, no limit on the use of outside resources, 
contracting-out is taking place in an unhealthy and vague 
environment.
<P>
	A modern government should do business the modern way. So 
far, so good. Contracting-out is one such modern methods. I am 
not questioning the use of contracting-out, but the fact remains 
that one has to know how to use this tool and that any new idea 
can lead to abuse. Hence the need to use contracting-out 
cautiously so that it will not become an instrument of 
corruption. I think we should give ourselves the means to 
oversee contracting-out.
<P>
	This means that the government must clearly state its policies 
in that regard and explain how it plans to implement them. To set 
rules is one thing, but to ensure they are implemented and 
complied with is another. I see nothing to that effect in here.
<P>
	This bill clearly missed the point in our view.
<P>
	There are other inequities. I noted two, the juiciest ones in my 
opinion, as you can imagine.
<P>
	For example, I am informed that only 15 per cent of all federal 
contracts were awarded in Quebec. Fifteen per cent, Mr. 
Speaker. But there is another figure to which I would like to 
draw your attention because for us, in Quebec, the Outaouais is a 
region dear to our hearts. It is an integral part of Quebec but, 
sadly, according to two thirds of the Quebec electorate, at the 
federal level, this region is an orphan. I want to tell the people of 
the Outaouais that only one per cent of all federal contracts 
awarded in the National Capital Region go to the Quebec side of 
the Ottawa Valley. Unfortunately for them, they do not have a 
Bloc Quebecois member to stand up for them. Maybe someday!
<P>
	These two examples speak volumes, but I could go on, There 
is a long list, but I can see that time is running out. I will 
therefore move on and make a few constructive suggestions 
which, I hope, will help the other side improve on their bill. I 
have not talked about any clauses because we are asking that the 
bill be totally reworked.
<P>
	I have three constructive proposals: first, a political review 
committee on contracting out; second, a contracting-out code; 
and third, a consultation process for members, who are, after all, 
accountable to the  people for the budget and for management 
activities. In this regard, it is very important.
<P>
	You now ask me: What would be the powers and especially the 
characteristics of this political committee? It could, for 
instance, be made up of people who can get involved. What does 
this mean? It could include experts in government 
administration processes and members from all political parties.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	It would have the power to inform and especially to protect 
the public interest, since we are all working for the people. It 
would also have the power to issue regular public reports to 
ensure government openness, without having to wait for 
someone to go look somewhere for this report, assuming he can 
find the right subject. There is no openness, at the present time. 
The report could be indexed by riding. As far as I know, Gaspé 
people do not live in Ottawa-Carleton. These things should be 
straightened out. As my grandmother used to say, ``The white 
socks with the white socks, the black socks with the black 
socks''. Things must be straightened out; we should show 
respect for the people by putting everything in the right place.
<P>
	Cases for contracting out should be clear and clearly defined 
in the bill, which could be used as a working tool by the review 
committee. Members should be consulted because they are the 
ones who pass the laws and who must face the people. Since they 
represent different political parties, they should also be 
consulted on this kind of thing.
<P>
	In conclusion, we want a little more openness here in Ottawa. 
Earlier, some members said that, as sovereignists, we play the 
bad guys from time to time. But we hope that Canada, which will 
still be our neighbour when Quebec becomes sovereign, as I 
firmly believe, will be well run, because in business, what is 
better than dealing with someone who runs a clean business.
<P>
	I would like to say something else about the credibility of 
parliamentarians. As MPs, we stand to gain from this exercise of 
openness. The red book said that, but it is starting to fade. Very 
few of its promises seem to be kept.
<P>
	I want to quote what the red book says, on page 91, about the 
credibility of parliamentarians: ``If government is to play a 
positive role in society, as it must, honesty and integrity in our 
political institutions must be restored. The most important asset 
of government is the confidence it enjoys of the citizens to 
whom it is accountable.'' Mr. Speaker, let me say that the French 
version of the Liberal Party's red book contains a mistake when 
it says: ``-tout en étant comptable de ses actions-'' I 
understand that they meant the English word ``accountable'', 
which in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6578"> 6578 </A></B>
<P>
French should be ``responsable'' or ``imputable'' instead of 
``comptable''.
<P>
	So we have to restore the integrity of our political institutions. 
Before October 26, 1993, the people opposite cared and boasted 
about their red book. Today, I put it back under their nose and I 
ask them to use this bill to carry out their promises. It will not 
cost a lot. I am not asking for $1 billion. I am not asking for $5 
billion. I am asking for honesty. Where I come from, honesty is 
not expensive and, what is more, it is rewarded. Those who are 
not honest will have to pay for it one day.
<P>
	To continue, some of our fellow members just mentioned the 
names of some members who are still here. I would just like to 
say that perhaps we had five minutes of political fantasy just 
now, when the member for Outremont mentioned the name of a 
member in the House. Perhaps he was referring to a time after 
this mandate. If the member for Outremont is back then, perhaps 
he can say the name of the person he just mentioned but whom 
you do not want us to name now.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	With that-my voice is giving up, but not my interest-I hope 
that we will have a chance to talk about this bill here again, but 
that it will contain what it should then.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
first of all I should ask the hon. member to carry our best wishes 
to his son on his birthday. I understand he is 14 years old. I have 
a 13-year old son at home so I know exactly what that is all 
about. It is about aspirations. It is about his future. It is about 
where he is going to be when he finishes his educational process.
<P>
	My son looks ahead with great anticipation and has all the 
confidence in the world that he can do whatever he sets his mind 
to do. So far whatever he has set as his goal, he has been able to 
achieve it.
<P>
	I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, that he has great admiration for 
this country of ours, this Canada of ours. He knows and loves the 
great province of Quebec, as he does his home province of New 
Brunswick, as well as every other portion of the country, 
whether it be east, west, north or south. He considers it all very 
important and significant.
<P>
	I have heard the hon. member and his colleagues in the Bloc 
mention time after time after time, let us do something about 
duplication of effort. Let us take some action to eliminate some 
of the duplication. The very bill we are talking about today is to 
do exactly that. The creation of Public Works and Government 
Services Canada brings together those four entities formerly 
known as the Government Telecommunications Agency, Public 
Works Canada, Supply and Services Canada, and the Translation 
Bureau.
<P>
	It is not just a coincidence that they are brought together. 
Once this full integration is completed and all four entities are 
brought together under the one Department of Public Works and 
Government Services,  we can look at savings of approximately 
$180 million a year.
<P>
	My question to the member across the way concerns the fact 
that in my riding of Carleton-Charlotte $180 million a year is a 
lot of money to my constituents. Any savings in that area which 
can be made in the department we are talking about today, or any 
other department, is certainly worth while.
<P>
	While the hon. member talked about a number of other steps 
in relation and subsequent to this point, does he not feel that the 
opportunity to save $180 million a year on a regular basis is 
something that would be supported by the taxpayers of the 
province of Quebec as well as the taxpayers in every other 
province?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question and his kind wishes regarding my son.
<P>
	I think that the presence of Bloc Quebecois members, 
sovereignists and Quebecers is very healthy for the parties 
opposite. We are the ones who raised the very costly issue of 
overlap.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	We, the sovereignists, have pointed to that problem for so 
long that members opposite are now beginning to think that we 
may be right. They are saying: Let us see what it means for us 
here in our own little world, in our federal departments. I used 
the word ``little'' not to refer to the department itself, which is a 
large one managing large amounts of money, but to say that it is 
a small step, considering our objective. To eliminate overlap is a 
monetary measure, but it also involves respect for a nation, a 
community and a province.
<P>
	Canada did not listen when Quebec said: Let us manage the 
way we want what falls within our jurisdiction. We are now in 
the third period-as the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean and 
the premier of Quebec say in reference to sovereignty. They 
used to say ``the Bloc in Ottawa and the Parti Quebecois in 
Quebec City''. Indeed, we are now in the third period and I am 
moving along the boards.
<P>
	We figured out the problem a long time ago, but this 
government is only beginning to get a grasp of it. But this is not 
enough. On the top of the savings which it can make in Canada 
and in Ottawa, how about a little more transparency? When we 
first 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6579"> 6579 </A></B>
<P>
told them to be careful and to eliminate overlap, they said that 
no such thing existed.
<P>
	Today, I am giving the government a second piece of advice. I 
say: Add transparency and it will begin to make more sense. We 
will continue to give you good ideas and ask you to accept the 
decision of Quebecers gracefully when they say they are ready 
to be on their own. I do hope that you will be able to listen to 
them.
<P>
	As a Quebecer, I will be happy to visit other provinces and, 
perhaps, act as a consultant representing Quebec and inform 
people from other provinces. I see that an hon. member would 
like to ask me a question. I will be pleased to listen to him.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary 
to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
closely to the hon. member for Gaspé. I have the honour of 
serving with him on the fisheries and oceans committee.
<P>
	I spent most of my life before I became involved in politics 
working on contracting and specifically providing services in 
government. This is a good step toward consolidating some of 
the many government departments, as I am sure members of the 
Reform know.
<P>
	If we consolidate, billions of dollars worth of contracts will 
be accessible to every Canadian under the open bidding system. 
Right from the computer we will be able to access the number of 
contracts that are being bid on right across the country, whether 
it is in Halifax, Vancouver or any other part of the country.
<P>
	Is the hon. member going to tell the small business people in 
his riding, the people who are now bidding for contracts, very 
good companies from Quebec who bid on contracts in Quebec 
City, Vancouver, Edmonton or Halifax, that he wants to take that 
opportunity away from them?
<P>
	What is he going to tell them in his march to become 
independent? Now they have access to billions of dollars worth 
of contracts, as this open bidding system consolidates to include 
other government organizations such as crown corporations. 
Even contracts and opportunities that exist in other parts of the 
world like the U.S. or Asia-Pacific are put on its bulletin board.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	It creates tremendous opportunities for business people in 
Quebec, for new people, perhaps his own son who would like to 
get into business providing services for government, whether it 
is in construction, whether it is consulting or any other type of 
service.
<P>
	What is he going to tell them? That he wants to take that 
opportunity away from them, the billions of dollars of 
government contracts they get to bid on competitively on which 
if they are the low bid and can be shown to qualify they will be 
awarded the contract? That instead of looking at an expanding 
market and giving them more opportunities even beyond the 
borders, limiting them to a smaller market, limiting them to 
fewer opportunities? What response would the hon. member 
give to all those  small business people in Quebec and those 
people who do work for government and are involved in 
government contracting?
<P>
	They understand the tremendous opportunity which exists and 
the changes that will come about in the new infrastructure in 
terms of the information technology and the instantaneous 
access to that information. As we build that infrastructure these 
departments can be very important to consolidate the services 
that people have access to and the contracts and the business 
opportunities that exist.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member what his response to them 
would be.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must admit that it will 
be very difficult to be brief, but I will try to respect the wishes of 
the Chair.
<P>
	Two questions were raised by the Parliamentary Secretary for 
Fisheries and Oceans. First, what about the future of my son and 
the future of Quebec? The answer is that my son will be 
delighted to work as an international consultant, if Quebec is a 
sovereign, different nation.
<P>
	Second, before we talk about the future, about what will 
happen in the months and years to come, what about what is 
happening today? They tell us: If you agree to stay, you will 
have access to a huge market worth $5.2 billion in contracts.
<P>
	I said earlier that Quebec only gets 15 per cent. How much 
more will we have in the future? The rules of transparency do 
not seem to apply. What explanation does the parliamentary 
secretary have for the Outaouais region, which gets only 1 per 
cent, while 99 per cent goes across the river? This does not bode 
well for the future.
<P>
	Perhaps if members opposite and the minister agreed with our 
suggestions to include transparency in the bill, and if they also 
agreed that the procedure should be more standardized, then we 
would have some basis for discussion. Meanwhile, Quebec pays 
more than $28 billion in taxes, and that is a fact. When those $28 
billion stay in Quebec instead of going to Ottawa, it will be 
easier on the gas to go to Quebec City and find out how we can 
get contracts. In Quebec, the process is open and transparent. It 
is administered by a public commission. With the $28 billion in 
taxes we will keep down there and a well-oiled machine to 
manage the money, it will be marvellous.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when our government took office a year ago we made a 
number of very specific commitments to the Canadian people. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6580"> 6580 </A></B>
<P>
Among them was a commitment to deal with questions of the 
efficiency of government-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. My profound apologies 
to the member for Windsor-St. Clair. I neglected to read 
something I have to read before five o'clock.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the 
House that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of 
adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for 
Frontenac-Party Fundraising.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Cohen:</B> Mr. Speaker, among the commitments we made 
when we came to power was a commitment to deal with the 
question of the efficiency of government operations, some of 
which over the past few years and particularly with the last 
government had become sluggish, fat and really not very 
efficient at all.
<P>
	Our government was and remains determined to reassure 
Canadians that tax dollars are being spent in a manner which is 
efficient and cost effective and designed to produce the best 
results for our citizens. More specifically, our government 
pledged to work for a country whose governments are efficient, 
innovative and co-operative; a government which will meet the 
challenge of doing more with less in the new reality; a 
government which would provide improved service delivery in 
all areas where we were involved. At the same time we want to 
reduce the cost of government operations as a way of 
contributing to deficit reduction.
<P>
	When we think about it this is a very liberal approach to a very 
difficult problem. Innovation is clearly necessary in order to 
uphold liberal principles in tough economic times. Those 
principles will be upheld because those Liberal campaign 
promises will be kept.
<P>
	This government has worked vigorously and successfully 
over the past year to make good on these commitments. It has 
done so in a number of ways such as eliminating duplication in 
government services and building stronger intergovernmental 
co-operation.
<P>
	One of the most fruitful areas for improving government 
efficiency lies in broadening the use of up to date technologies 
to communicate information and to deliver our services. This 
government has made continued progress in developing and 
implementing a number of these money and time saving 
applications of information technology.
<P>
	One of the key players in furthering this process, one of the 
key players in developing new ideas and new applications is the 
recently formed Department of Public Works and Government 
Services.
<P>
	As the government's main common service agency, Public 
Works and Government Services Canada currently supplies 
about 70 per cent of federal telecommunication services. An 
important element of the new department, the government 
telecommunications and informatics service is a major centre of 
expertise for  these services and a key supplier to the entire 
federal government.
<P>
	This department will operate in partnership with the private 
sector to manage infrastructure services for other government 
departments. These services can be enhanced and expanded with 
a view to establishing an integrated government-wide 
infrastructure. Clearly, Public Works and Government Services 
Canada has the key leadership role to play in re-engineering and 
streamlining the government's communications and service 
delivery system.
<P>
	I would like to briefly outline a few of the specific 
applications of advanced technology that have been introduced 
by Public Works and Government Services Canada and that are 
already saving the taxpayers of Canada millions of dollars every 
year.
<P>
	One of these is the direct deposit method of payment. In his 
role as Receiver General for Canada, the hon. Minister of Public 
Works and Government Services must issue approximately 193 
million payments every year. In the past these were issued by 
cheque. These would cover salary payments to government 
employees and a variety of payments to recipients of 
government programs such as old age assistance.
<P>
	Needless to say, this has been traditionally an expensive, 
although necessary process. In a move to reduce costs and 
improve these services the department has introduced direct 
deposit through which funds are deposited directly and 
electronically to the recipient's bank account.
<P>
	Direct deposit has proved to be very popular and today more 
than 30 per cent of payments made by the Receiver General use 
this method. About three quarters of federal public servants and 
more than half of our pension recipients are now on direct 
deposit.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	The system saves money for the Canadian taxpayer and is 
convenient for the recipients of these payments as well. The 
department estimates that over the past three fiscal years it has 
achieved savings of $45 million through reduced postage, 
production and financial costs. Cost savings are only a part of 
this story. Cost savings in and of themselves while important do 
not provide the whole picture here.
<P>
	Direct deposit also eliminates the problem of lost, stolen, 
destroyed or forged payments. It further eliminates problems 
attendant to any disruption of postal service for instance. It is 
convenient, reliable, safe and is environmentally friendly. 
Direct deposit is an excellent example of an application of elec-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6581"> 6581 </A></B>
<P>
tronic technology that both reduces costs and improves service 
to the public.
<P>
	Another example of communications technology introduced 
by Public Works and Government Services and which has 
growing application in the federal service is the use of electronic 
or E-mail. It now links more than 120,000 public servants 
across the country.
<P>
	E-mail provides a system for exchanging information that is 
fast and efficient and that significantly reduces the paper burden 
within the government. It facilitates quicker decision making 
and faster service and it saves money, an estimated $55 million 
per year in time saving and improved efficiency.
<P>
	Public Works and Government Services has also introduced 
during the past year a national video conferencing service. This 
service is now offered to all government departments and 
agencies at seven Public Works and Government Services sites 
across the country. Based on the enthusiastic demand for this 
new service, the department plans to expand to as many as 20 
sites in the near future.
<P>
	A major client of this new service will be Radian, the public 
service learning and communications network. This network's 
mandate is to save the public service time and money by 
encouraging long distance learning and video conferencing 
throughout the federal government which would then save on 
the costs associated with travel.
<P>
	Although still in its early stages of development, this new 
service shows great potential for improving communications 
between various government departments across Canada at 
greatly reduced cost. It responds to the government's goal of 
cutting costs through the creative application of new 
technologies.
<P>
	Members present may recall that in the autumn of last year 
and the spring of this year, the human resources development 
committee spent a great deal of time communicating with 
people across the country in an effort to establish a baseline of 
concern over the new social service review.
<P>
	Part of that discussion and consultation employed this 
innovative new use of technology. I am pleased to say that the 
first witnesses to testify came from Windsor, Ontario. Instead of 
spending in excess of $8,000 to bring those witnesses to Ottawa, 
we were able through the use of this technology to spend 
substantially less and not to disturb them or have them travel.
<P>
	The human resources committee will commence travelling on 
November 14 to all parts of the country in an effort to speak to 
people in their own locale and to see the situation across the 
country. While we are there we will continue to use video 
conferencing reaching even further into the country in order to 
give everyone an opportunity to be heard on this very important 
subject.
<P>
	Through this technology the public works department has 
allowed us to communicate directly with Canadians and 
Canadians to communicate back directly with us in a very real 
form of direct democracy.
<P>
	This department has also been active in expanding the 
application of new technologies in its business dealings with 
thousands of Canadian companies and individuals. As the prime 
procurement agency of the government, Public Works and 
Government Services purchases an average of $10 billion of 
goods and services each year on behalf of as many as 150 federal 
departments and agencies.
<P>
	The department has instituted a number of automated systems 
to make this process more efficient and less costly to the 
government and to its suppliers. One of these is the recently 
established open bidding system or OBS.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	This system provides an electronic bulletin board as well as a 
tri-weekly publication called ``Government Business 
Opportunities'' which is designed to give Canadian businesses 
fast and equal access to information about government 
contracting opportunities.
<P>
	The adoption of OBS represents a major step toward fulfilling 
the government commitment to provide a contracting system 
that is fair, open and transparent. However by reducing the paper 
burden involved it also saves taxpayers an estimated $3.5 
million annually.
<P>
	This is one further example of how the application of 
electronic technology cannot only improve services but cut 
costs as well. Another application of technology in the business 
field is the department's electronic procurement and settlement 
system known as EPS. EPS links client departments within 
government to the suppliers and to a central control system 
allowing them to do business electronically, including ordering 
without requisitions, supplier payment without invoices and 
electronic journal vouchers without paper forms.
<P>
	When this system is fully in place within the very near future, 
it will result in massive savings to the government and the 
taxpayer, estimated in the range of $176 million. It will create 
even greater savings for private sector suppliers, most of which 
will be passed along in the form of lower prices for government 
purchases.
<P>
	These examples of the steps being taken to improve efficiency 
and service through new technologies indicate clearly that our 
government is living up to its commitment in this area. They 
also indicate the key role that the Department of Public Works 
and Government Services is playing in the process.
<P>
	Initiatives such as the one I just described mean even more 
efficiency in government operations, better services to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6582"> 6582 </A></B>
<P>
public, better access to the government by the public and less 
cost to the taxpayer.
<P>
	Here are even more good reasons why we should pass Bill 
C-52 so as to give the department a clear, legislative mandate to 
continue its work in this area.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
always astonishes me when I listen to speeches like the one my 
colleague has just given about how to save money in 
government.
<P>
	We spend so much time in speech in this country talking about 
a $3.5 million saving from reducing the paper burden. I am sure 
it could be a lot more than that, and a possible $176 million 
saving in other efficiencies.
<P>
	I guess the Liberal government does not get the idea here. We 
overspend the revenue we take in by $40 billion a year. That is 
40,000 million dollars. We have a half a trillion dollar debt load. 
Our interest payments are well over $40 billion a year.
<P>
	What really gets me is that the Liberals come up with this 
much money to actually handle a problem that is this big. I guess 
my question really is this. Will the $3.5 million saving-I hate 
to talk about such a small amount here-or $176 million ever be 
reflected as a reduction in any budget in the government? Past 
experience shows that none of these budgets has ever been 
reduced in 20 years.
<P>
	Where are the efficiencies? Do not come into the House and 
talk about saving money. You have done nothing but blow 
money since the day you got here. Would you mind answering 
the question?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before recognizing the hon. member 
for Windsor-St. Clair, would members please, when saying 
``you'', refer to the Chair and not to the member opposite.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Cohen:</B> Mr. Speaker, I only have eyes for you, sir, I can 
tell you that. I am happy to speak to my hon. friend through you 
and to remind my hon. friend that $3.5 million plus $3.5 million 
plus $3.5 million adds up.
<P>
	It is one saving on top of another on top of another. We could 
do what the Reform Party suggested in its campaign and just 
knock billions off the top indiscriminately, thereby destroying 
the economy and putting people out on the street. We could do 
what the governor of Michigan did, for instance, and lob money 
off the top.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	I would like to invite my hon. friend to come to Windsor 
sometime and we will take him over to Detroit. He can watch 
people who have suffered under the kind of regime that the 
Reform Party suggests. He can watch people living in the streets 
when it is cold and when the weather is inclement. He can watch 
those things. Or he can watch us save $3.5 million here and $4.5 
million there. He can watch us reorganize the government and he 
can watch us deliver.
<P>
	This is not the last nine years. This is the beginning of a very 
long period of time for the Liberal government and a very long 
period of time of Liberal efficiency. This is the beginning of a 
new life for Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member talks about the beginning. Let me remind the member 
that it is almost a year since the election. The beginning was a 
year go. If the Liberals had been serious about real cuts they 
could have cut the budget by, let us say, $10 billion.
<P>
	The Reform Party laid out a $15 billion program to cut the 
deficit. If it had been implemented, the interest costs on the debt 
alone, assuming an interest rate of 7 to 10 per cent, could have 
been $1 billion ahead in the bank just by reducing interests costs 
by really aggressively attacking the deficit.
<P>
	We are talking about $3.5 million here, $100 million there. 
Just by getting the job done the hon. member could save $1 
billion.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development tabled a 
discussion paper. He has been working for a whole year and all 
he can produce is a discussion paper.
<P>
	When can we expect that we will move beyond these 
minuscule paper saving propositions that make a minuscule cut? 
When can we expect the real stuff that is going to prevent the 
economy from collapsing under the weight of debt and interest 
that we have to pay?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Cohen:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is true it has been almost a year. 
October 25 will be our first anniversary. During that period we 
have had an opportunity to assess and to see the precise situation 
in which the government has found itself.
<P>
	The full integration of this department will result in savings 
of $180 million and 4,000 full time equivalent jobs between the 
1993-94 fiscal year and 1997-98 representing a reduction of 
about 25 per cent of the current complement.
<P>
	The emphasis is on reducing overhead through streamlining 
and eliminating duplication. These targets will not affect the 
delivery of services but will result in savings of $1 billion over 
the next few years. This is not chicken feed. It is a lot of money. I 
am very sorry if we did not do it as quickly as the other side of 
the House would like.
<P>
	Everything is simple over there. Somehow you give people 
guns and they will not shoot each other any more. We will have 
law and order. Knock 20 per cent off the budget and people 
starve in the streets and I guess we do not have as many people to 
feed. That is a very simple view.
<P>
	Over here where the responsible people live, we can say that 
we have studied it, we have looked at it and it has only just 
begun.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me pleasure today to speak to Bill C-52, an act 
to establish the Department of Public Works and Government 
Services and to amend and repeal certain acts. My colleagues 
and I in the Bloc Quebecois think that the Liberal government 
has missed yet another golden opportunity to honour its 
pontifical promise to make our political institutions transparent.
<P>
	After the Pearson affair-I think you would do well to 
listen-and Bill C-43 on registration of lobbyists, now the 
Liberal government confirms its lack of transparency with Bill 
C-52.
<P>
	I have a problem with the bill not because I am against the 
principle of integrating two departments, but because the bill 
does not go far enough. Although I have been sitting in this 
House less than a year, I have enough parliamentary experience 
to see that such a bill should really go further. Allow me to 
explain.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	It is important that our legislation in this area be stringent. 
About two weeks ago, I received from the Minister of Public 
Works a reply to a letter I had written, asking him for 
information on his department's activities in 
Berthier-Montcalm. Having been elected in this riding, I 
wanted to know what was going on there, who was being 
awarded contracts, whether there was waste, news on buildings 
and so on.
<P>
	This request for information from a member of Parliament 
was entirely legitimate. I will simply read you a short paragraph 
from the minister's reply. He wrote: ``Unfortunately, the 
information you are looking for is not contained in any one 
document''. To provide you with an answer would require 
intensive research in the many and varied branches of my 
department as well as in multiple data banks, the number of 
which has increased considerably since four separate entities 
have been merged to form the new Department of Publics Works 
and Government Services Canada. Moreover, the costs 
associated with information retrieval and the preparation of 
reports for members of Parliament could exceed $168,000, and a 
large part of the work is not computerized. All in all, this task 
would put an excessive load on the operation of our 
department''.
<P>
	I wonder, and would it not be ironic if it were the case, if the 
minister based his calculations on his own hourly rate and add 
on computer time to get this $168,000 figure. The acme of this 
department's inconsistency was reached on April 18, when my 
hon. colleague the member for Laval East received her response 
to a letter she had sent to the same department asking for a list of 
names, addresses and phone numbers of businesses located in 
her riding. In response to that letter, the minister made no 
reference to the fact that her inquiry would cost $168,000 or 
some other amount to the taxpayers. He did not say that 
answering her inquiry would prove impossible because of the 
number of  documents that would need to be analyzed before an 
answer could be provided to the hon. member.
<P>
	Nothing of the sort. The minister wrote back stating that the 
information she had requested was attached. I asked myself 
whether his department had double standards. Information 
considered as not overly compromising and of no consequence 
is released, while the rest is not. I sure hope this is not the case. 
At any rate, the hon. members opposite who sit on the industry 
sub-committee on Bill C-43, the lobbyists registration bill, tell 
me that members of Parliament make the best lobbyists when it 
comes to obtaining this kind of information.
<P>
	I note however that this statement does not apply to ministers. 
I wonder if Government Policy Consultants would not charge 
less than $168,000 to provide me with an answer to my question. 
Moreover, I think that an in-depth analysis of certain aspects of 
the answer received from the department on September 21 is 
essential. The minister responsible for Supply and Services 
Canada says that the information I am requesting does not 
appear in a document per se. Where can the information be 
found then?
<P>
	I will give you a few hints. These answers may be in the data 
bank of some lobby groups very familiar with Parliament Hill. 
These lobbyists make thousands of dollars a day-up to $10,000 
a day in some cases-to advise companies hoping for 
government contracts. As my colleague from Québec-Est 
proposed a few days ago, if Public Works and Government 
Services Canada were to issue monthly reports guaranteeing the 
federal government's openness in awarding contracts, we could 
probably, in the long term, save a lot of money and eliminate 
patronage in that department.
<P>
	If lobby groups make so much money giving advice and 
explaining how the system and its institutions work, it is 
because the system is very complex and not open enough. The 
members opposite and the minister himself will tell me that 
merging the Department of Public Works with Supply and 
Services will simplify things, but I say that Bill C-52 does not 
provide for any mechanism that would open up that department. 
Furthermore, this bill will not encourage public servants to 
denounce cases of shameless waste at the future Department of 
Public Works and Government Services.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	It is not normal that, in 1994, people and the members who 
represent them are not informed of that department's 
contracting-out activities in their own ridings. Openness in that 
depart-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6584"> 6584 </A></B>
<P>
ment appears to be a fine source of patronage. In any case, that is 
what my grandmother would say in such a situation.
<P>
	In the red book, the word ``openness'' appears almost as often 
as the word ``employment''; it is surprising that it is nowhere to 
be found in Bill C-52, and it is not in Bill C-43 either.
<P>
	Legislators must look at the goal of openness as a whole. The 
government's right hand must know what the left hand is doing. 
Yet, in the red book, they talk about the citizens' confidence in 
the system, the undue influence of lobbyists; they talk about 
openness, the sacrosanct integrity, involvement, etc. The red 
book should not be quoted just for wishful thinking. We need an 
appropriate legislative policy. Now is the time to take action 
while we have a bill before us.
<P>
	Why make laws amounting to half-measures? Bills C-52 and 
C-43 as they now stand are cases in point and deal with two 
closely related subjects. There should be a legislative link 
between the two. Government contracts, procurement and 
buildings automatically remind us of lobbyists. The Bloc is 
probably the only party in this House to see that link. But it is 
there!
<P>
	The Pearson affair, which this House is very familiar with, 
shows what happens when you mix government contracts with 
lobbyists' pressure. Will we prevent similar situations with Bill 
C-52 before us today or Bill C-43? No, Mr. Speaker, not the way 
these two bills are now written.
<P>
	Laws are supposed to mean something and not be just 
rhetoric, so a law should be passed to change things and not just 
to put up a smoke screen to hide shameless patronage, like what 
has been going on in those departments for decades.
<P>
	Something else that would contribute to the much-desired 
openness, which is just wishful thinking on the part of the 
government, could be a reality or well on the way to becoming 
reality if the financing of political parties was reformed as 
suggested by the Bloc Quebecois member for Richelieu. But no, 
we saw the government's true face. It refused the hand that we 
extended to it on this issue.
<P>
	Although we could say more about the pretense of openness 
desired by the government, I will return to Bill C-52 and 
probably we will have a chance later to talk about this famous 
openness that the government would like to have. However, it 
never acts openly when it has the chance.
<P>
	What we refuse to do is to give second reading to Bill C-52 
because the principle of the bill does not provide for a precise 
code of ethics to make the contracting process transparent and to 
show how the Department of Public Works and Government 
Services acquires all the goods and services.
<P>
	For this purpose, we propose five things that would provide a 
basis for obtaining this desired transparency. The Bloc's five 
proposals are as follows: one, create a public supervisory 
commission; two, a code for contracting out; three, consult all 
federal MPs; four,  make public servants accountable; and five, 
control advance payments by the government.
<P>
	Sometimes I hear ministers say that the opposition never 
makes any proposals. Well, here I am making proposals. 
Besides, we often make proposals but you do not listen to them. I 
am giving you some very clear proposals and I will explain 
them.
<P>
	Let us take a closer look at these proposals. The first one is to 
create a public supervisory commission. Among other things, 
this commission would submit monthly reports on all 
government contracts that go through the department. With such 
a system, the frustrating delays currently experienced with 
requests submitted to the minister under the Access to 
Information Act would be avoided. These periodic reports 
would help streamline government operations. This would be a 
simple, accessible and understandable process.
<P>
	Finally, this public supervisory commission would have the 
power to question any vague or obscure contract violating the 
applicable rules of procedure. This judicial power could also be 
used in cases of influence-peddling or patronage.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	Also, the proposed code for contracting out takes into account 
the fact that this activity represented a $5.2 billion market for 
the year 1992-93 alone. Such an important economic sector 
must be subjected to some government guidelines.
<P>
	This issue is too important for civil servants, trade 
contracting firms, as well as Canadians and Quebecers to be 
taken lightly. In that regard, the Bloc would have liked the bill to 
set rules, or at least a legal framework compelling the federal 
government to adhere to specific standards regarding 
contracting out activities. If the government is prepared to do it 
for the lobbying industry, which is not a $5.2 billion market, it 
can also do it for the contracting out sector.
<P>
	Canadians, unions and management could only win if there 
were specific rules in that sector. And do not try to tell me that 
contracting out is a cyclical thing. When such a practice has 
been in use for ten years, it is there to stay.
<P>
	I would like it if someone could tell me why parliamentary 
committees use private printing companies to publish their 
reports when that service is provided here in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	Then there is the consultation of federal MPs. I believe we are 
here to represent our constituents. We could be asked to do 
more, and that would be a good thing. As a third element for 
transparency, the Bloc Quebecois suggests that all federal 
members of Parliament should be consulted. This proposal is 
based on the Liberal commitment to enhance the role of 
members of Parliament. Hence, it is important to give more 
responsibilities to members of Parliament and to inform them of 
the contracts placed by the new department in their ridings. Such 
consultation outside the House of  Commons will provide 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6585"> 6585 </A></B>
<P>
members of Parliament the opportunity to monitor and confirm 
the impact of the bills on which they voted.
<P>
	Consequently, members of Parliament will not be consulted 
only in the House of Commons or in parliamentary committees. 
I was democratically elected to represent the people of my 
riding of Berthier-Montcalm and I must have all the necessary 
tools to fulfil my mandate. Information on public spending is 
one of these tools. How can members of Parliament play their 
roles adequately if they are not even aware of all government 
expenditures in their own ridings? Cleanliness starts at home, as 
we say, but when you do not know what to clean, it is hard to 
look clean to the public.
<P>
	I reject the argument used by the minister who claimed that it 
would cost too much, because I think if members of Parliament 
were to closely monitor what is going on in their ridings, they 
could surely find some waste to eliminate. We could quickly 
come up with the money required to provide this information to 
members.
<P>
	Fourth, accountability for public servants. This would be 
important. Public servants must be responsible and feel 
accountable to Parliament. We must clearly give more 
responsibilities to civil servants. No one is in a better position to 
expose all the awful waste occurring in federal departments. We 
have to find ways to encourage public servants to denounce such 
extravagant spending by the government. The right to expose 
public waste must be addressed by this House and very soon at 
that.
<P>
	Since most contracts will be executed by the Department of 
Public Works and Government Services, it seems to me that Bill 
C-52 should have covered this issue.
<P>
	Federal public servants must realize that, as taxpayers, they 
also pay for unnecessary spending they are aware of.
<P>
	Here is a good example to justify the cleaning up, which, as I 
said earlier, should start at home.
<P>
	I invite the Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services to visit the back entrance to the Confederation Building 
to see for himself what is an immoral spending.
<P>
	Public Works rebuilt the access ramp for handicapped people. 
Although I completely agree with the principle, I am outraged 
with the end result. Instead of a simple efficient and functional 
slope, the contractors have created a huge labyrinth not 
accessible by wheelchair. Moreover, I am told this 
non-functional labyrinth cost $170,000.
<P>
	That shows how some expenses are fit for a transcendental 
world.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	Finally, I would like to say a few words about advance 
payments by the government. The purpose of this practice by 
senior officials is to make maximum use of the resources 
available to a function within a department in order to ensure 
that the same level of resources will be  allocated to that 
function in the next budget year. Government officials do this 
because they are afraid of having their annual budget cut if they 
do not use all the resources available to them in the current year.
<P>
	The whole issue of advance payments concerns all 
departments. Moreover, it becomes clear that the Department of 
Public Works must take the bull by the horns and exert strict 
control over government expenditures.
<P>
	While Public Works and Supply and Services have 
historically been considered the ideal departments for 
patronage, the new department must now do everything it can to 
become the department of transparency, and it has to have all the 
necessary tools to be able to do that.
<P>
	Again, the Liberal government is watering down this 
objective and, in this particular case, it is drowning it. Instead of 
being a watchdog as it should, the Department of Public Works 
and Government Services is playing an unhealthy game that 
prevents it from being as transparent as we would like it to be.
<P>
	Another example that I find appalling concerns some 
electricians from Public Works Canada. I was outraged when 
this information was made known to me. It would appear that 
some electricians keep the copper from the electric wires that 
they dispose of, melt it and then sell it to pay for the big party 
they throw at the end of the year. I think this kind of practice is 
unacceptable in 1994.
<P>
	Another quick example, Mr. Speaker, because I see that time 
is running out-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> I want to ask a question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> I will be glad to answer your questions, if I 
have the time.
<P>
	The other point I would like to mention concerns something I 
noticed when I moved into my new office in Ottawa. My 286 and 
386 computers were replaced by more efficient and modern 
systems. In my riding, I have a number of community 
organizations, women's groups, youth organizations and other 
groups. They had asked me how to go about buying those old 
computers from the Canadian government. It is quite difficult, 
as I found out. It seems that those computers are auctioned off, 
but that they end up being bought by employees in some 
departments or their relatives and friends. As a result, taxpayers 
and community agencies across Canada who would need those 
computers and 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6586"> 6586 </A></B>
<P>
could pay a good price, much to the benefit of the government, 
never even get a chance.
<P>
	The reasoned amendment moved by the Bloc Quebecois truly 
reflects the need for that greater openness all taxpayers in 
Quebec and the rest of Canada would like to see in that 
department, which has always been considered the mainstay of 
patronage under Liberal, Conservative, and other governments 
alike.
<P>
	The time has come to put an end to such practices. We should 
pass appropriate legislation so that openness, and not patronage, 
prevails in that department. Since past deeds speak to the future, 
it is sure to remain the patronage department, if this bill is 
passed. This has to stop. I ask my colleagues on the government 
side to urge the minister to pay attention to the Official 
Opposition's point of view.
<P>
	I will now take my seat so that my colleague from 
Saint-Boniface can put the question he so badly wants to ask.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South)</B> moved that Bill C-256, 
an act to amend the Income Tax Act (transfer of income to 
spouse), be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House of 
Commons to present for debate at second reading my private 
member's bill, C-256.
<P>
	Every member of Parliament looks forward to an opportunity 
to bring before the House matters of importance not only to 
themselves but to all Canadians. Bill C-256 is a proposal which 
is foremost about the family and which also has implications for 
jobs, child care, tax equity and the cost of health, social services 
and criminal justice.
<P>
	The United Nations General Assembly has proclaimed 1994 
as the International Year of the Family. However, in my view 
this is not as much a celebration as it is a warning.
<P>
	In the last 30 years changes in our social and economic 
environment have been dramatic. Family and social values have 
clearly eroded. We no longer feel safe in our communities. 
Demand for social services has expanded beyond our means and 
family breakdown has become the norm. Everyone knows a lone 
parent, but did you know that 60 per cent of them are living in 
poverty?
<P>
	In 1961, 65 per cent of families with children under six years 
old had one stay at home parent. In 1991, 30 years later, this type 
of family structure accounted for only 12 per cent of families. In 
addition, today more than 70 per cent of preschool children are 
now in non-parental care arrangements on a regular basis while 
parents work.
<P>
	Much of this movement has been caused by economic 
circumstances. Growth in incomes has been stagnating in  real 
terms since the mid 1970s and younger families have been hit 
the hardest. Their incomes are in dramatic decline and the 
incidence of poverty is increasing. For example, among families 
with a head under age 25 the incidence of poverty nearly 
doubled from 21 per cent to 37 per cent between 1981 and 1991.
<P>
	I am therefore extremely pleased that today the Minister for 
Human Resources Development reaffirmed our commitment to 
the elimination of child poverty. He has clearly stated that this is 
our top priority in the restructuring of our social programs.
<P>
	It should be noted however that as personal home parenting 
becomes increasingly uneconomic, it is being portrayed as 
decreasingly desirable. Instead of recognizing that there may be 
problems with our priorities, we somehow rationalize that the 
choice is best for the children.
<P>
	In addition, there are a number of other contributing factors to 
the family and social ills we are experiencing today. We appear 
to have designed most of our services to kick in after problems 
become apparent. By then the need to respond is urgent but the 
remedial efforts are often unsuccessful.
<P>
	According to the May 1994 report of the Ontario premier's 
council on health, well-being and social justice, critical 
development outcomes are rooted in early experiences and 
influences. These outcomes include good physical health, the 
ability to learn, the ability to cope with stress, being able to 
relate well with others and to have a positive self-esteem.
<P>
	Where, how and with whom children spend their time in the 
early years has a major impact on their healthy development. A 
secure attachment to a nurturing adult is essential and who is 
better than one of the parents to provide that care.
<P>
	Dr. Fraser Mustard, chair of the Canadian Institute for 
Advanced Research, has long advocated focusing some of our 
limited resources to children in the first three years of life. Their 
extensive research shows dramatic links between future 
problems and poor child care during infancy.
<P>
	Dr. Mustard cites a 19 year study of early childhood 
enrichment in the United States. As a result, the group of 
children had a higher proportion who graduated from high 
school and went on to college. There was a 50 per cent lower 
incidence of mental health problems, 40 per cent fewer on 
welfare, and there were 50 per cent fewer teenage pregnancies.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6587"> 6587 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	Dr. Penelope Leach, renowned author on child care, 
masterfully stated the case when she said: ``The real issue is not 
motherhood or career, but something closer to parenthood and 
paid work''. Today, children are more a part of paid work than of 
home life. As such, they are currently of secondary importance 
in our society. Those priorities will have to shift.
<P>
	The critical importance of quality child care is particularly 
dramatized by the facts related to young unmarried mothers. 
Each year over 20,000 unmarried women aged 12 to 19 give 
birth with the majority choosing to raise the children 
themselves. As a result, most do not finish their education and 
are likely to become dependent on subsidized housing and 
welfare. Their offspring are at a higher risk of being premature 
or low birth weight, more likely to experience difficulty in 
school, and more likely to become single parents themselves.
<P>
	These facts raise serious questions. What has become of the 
traditional family? Are we fully aware of the potential 
consequences to our children's future development by having 
both parents work? Is it really up to governments to take the 
responsibility for the future development of our children? Has 
society decided that managing the family home and caring for 
preschool children is no longer important?
<P>
	Who would dare say that a stay at home parent does not work? 
A parent working in the home has chosen a very honourable 
profession which contributes more to the quality of our society 
than most jobs. Yet it is a profession which is not specifically 
compensated in recognition of the value of the work done. That 
is the reason why I have tabled this bill. It is an attempt to 
provide a modest financial benefit to families who choose to 
have one parent work in the home and care for preschool 
children.
<P>
	As a consequence of the bill, jobs in the external work force 
would be freed up for those who urgently need them. In addition, 
child care spaces would be freed up to partially address the 
critical shortage we are now experiencing.
<P>
	Take the example of two working parents with two children in 
day care with the lower income earning spouse earning $25,000. 
After income tax, child care expenses and the cost of 
employment, the net take home pay is less than $100 per week.
<P>
	Parents in this situation often question why they are 
sacrificing so much for so little. Their lives are driven by a child 
care schedule. They rush in the morning to get their child ready, 
they rush to deliver the children to day care, they rush to work to 
put in a full day and they cannot delay leaving work because the 
children must be picked up and taken home to be fed dinner. By 
the time they settle in the home, it is time to get the children 
ready for bed. Parents may want to spend family time with 
children but often it is the case that the children are  too tired or 
not in the mood to play when the parents have the time.
<P>
	What do parents do when their children are sick? That much 
stress cannot be helping the family unit. The amount of time that 
parents and children spend together has dropped by 40 per cent 
in a single generation. As a rationalization we dreamed up the 
notion of quality time. However, that implies that to spend a 
small amount of time with a child is satisfactory if it is quality 
time whereas if you are around the child all of the time only 
some of that time is quality time. That kind of thinking is simply 
flawed.
<P>
	Economic considerations are important, but in certain 
circumstances parents are struggling to decide whether the 
modest take home pay of the lower income earning spouse is 
worth all the family sacrifices they are making. Although the 
vast majority of parents do work, a 1991 Decima poll found that 
70 per cent of women would choose to provide direct parental 
care if they could. This bill would provide a financial bridge to 
assist those parents, and I stress, who would like the option to 
make that choice.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	It should also be noted that our present income tax system in 
fact discriminates against one income families. The child care 
expense deduction permits two income families to claim up to 
$5,000 of child care costs per child under the age of seven 
regardless of how much income they have. No such deduction is 
available to one income families due to the false assumption that 
they have no child care costs.
<P>
	Child care costs exist not because both spouses work but 
rather because children exist. The child care expense deduction 
has an inverse relationship to need. That means that the higher 
the family income, the higher the savings to the two income 
family.
<P>
	Consider also the case where two neighbours each have 
children. One neighbour can be paid to take care of the children 
of the other neighbour and vice versa. Each family then gets to 
claim the child care expense deduction because they care for 
each other's children. Ironically, however, you do not get any 
deduction when you care for your own children. This favoured 
tax treatment may produce financial savings for those who care 
for the children of others but it does nothing for those who care 
for their own children.
<P>
	The child care expense deduction should be means tested and 
extended to all families to address the profound inequities in our 
Income Tax Act. This initiative would provide equitable 
benefits to all families based on financial need. Accordingly, I 
will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6588"> 6588 </A></B>
<P>
shortly be tabling in the House a motion to effect this change and 
I hope it will have the support of all hon. members.
<P>
	Bill C-256 specifically seeks to amend the Income Tax Act to 
permit one spouse to split up to $25,000 of their income with the 
spouse working in the home and caring for at least one 
dependent child who has not commenced full time attendance at 
school.
<P>
	As a result of the graduated tax brackets presently in our 
income tax laws, this would result in a lower tax burden on 
family income. Depending on the level of incomes and 
deductions the benefit could be as much as $3,500 per year or 
about $65 per week.
<P>
	In the example I cited if instead of forgoing $100 per week of 
net take home pay it were reduced to only $35 per week the 
option to have one parent work in the home would be much more 
attractive to the family. The income split with the spouse 
working in the home would be treated as self-employed income 
and as such would not be eligible for unemployment insurance. 
The income would however qualify for the purchase of RRSPs.
<P>
	Under the Canada Pension Plan Act this income would not 
qualify for CPP benefits. I have however tabled in the House Bill 
C-269 which would change the CPP act to make such earnings 
pensionable. That change will require approval of two-thirds of 
the provinces representing 50 per cent of the population, plus 
Quebec which operates its own Quebec pension plan.
<P>
	If we truly believe that working in the home and caring for 
preschool children is an important job, should we also not 
acknowledge the fairness of providing pension benefits?
<P>
	The benefits of this bill do not stop there however. This is not 
just a bill which would give a tax break to some Canadians. If a 
lower income earner withdraws from the external workforce to 
work in the home, a job would be freed up or created depending 
on how we looked at it. With 10.7 per cent of our workforce 
unemployed the importance of job creation cannot be 
overstated.
<P>
	Furthermore the person filling the vacated job will likely have 
been on UI which can be up to $429 a week, or on welfare which 
can be up to $663 per week. Under these circumstances the 
government will in fact be saving on the cost of these social 
benefits. As well the new taxpayer would not likely have the 
same level of child care expenses, which means that more tax 
would be paid by the person on the same job than by the person 
who formerly held that job.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	A further consequence of the bill is the freeing up of child care 
spaces. In its red book the government has committed to create 
50,000 child care spaces per year for three years following the 
achievement of 3 per cent growth in GDP. Since that growth will 
be reached this year these 150,000 spaces will be created at a 
cost of $1.4 billion split between the federal and provincial 
governments. That represents $9,600 per space per year.
<P>
	It is also expected that the users will pay $2,400 per year for 
the space. Therefore, in total each of these spaces will cost 
$12,000. That is a fair indicator of just how much value should 
be attributed to caring for a child in the home.
<P>
	While it is certainly true that more day care provision would 
increase the number of mothers in the external workforce, it is 
also true that more financial help with the costs of being a parent 
would reduce that number no matter how much affordable day 
care was available. In the long term it is crucial for us to realize 
that direct parental care will also contribute to savings in the 
areas of health, social programs and criminal justice.
<P>
	Each year it costs literally billions of dollars to respond to the 
problems rooted in poor child development. Today we face 
serious challenges related to the family which are complex. We 
must however remember that there are no simple solutions. We 
need a range of initiatives spanning both preventive and 
remedial approaches. Bill C-256 represents an important 
preventive approach which recognizes the value of work in the 
home, creates jobs and provides child care spaces.
<P>
	Since introduction of the bill over 160 members of Parliament 
have indicated their support for having the bill referred to 
committee. In addition, thousands of Canadians across the 
country have told us through letters and petitions that they want 
to see the subject matter of the bill pursued.
<P>
	In the year of the family I believe the House of Commons 
should embrace every possible opportunity to examine 
initiatives which may help Canadian families to raise our 
children who are of course our future.
<P>
	Private members' bills require unanimous consent of the 
House at second reading in order to proceed to the next stage. 
Such consent is very rarely achieved but the value of the process 
is the extensive dialogue generated not only in the House but 
also among Canadians interested in the subject matter.
<P>
	This morning I had the opportunity to speak with the Minister 
of Human Resources Development about the issue of benefits 
for those who give care. I have his assurance that the subject 
matter of Bill C-256 can be addressed as part of the review of 
the social programs outlined in his discussion paper tabled today 
in the House of Commons. This will allow a broader 
consideration of the issues and the options to Bill C-256.
<P>
	One such option to spousal income splitting is the creation of 
a caregiver tax credit which would be available to those 
Canadians who provide care directly rather than relying on 
extensive social services. Caregivers would include those who 
care for preschool children in the home or who care for the 
disabled, the chronically ill, or seniors requiring continuous 
care. These 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6589"> 6589 </A></B>
<P>
Canadians have put their family members first, ahead of their 
own interests, and they should be recognized.
<P>
	I am grateful for the opportunity to continue the fight on 
behalf of parents and all caregivers who provide care in the 
home. The dialogue has just begun. I thank all hon. members for 
their interest and their support.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy 
to take part in this debate concerning families and particularly 
the twin roles played by many mothers as both educator and 
provider. I will thus limit my speech to families with children of 
school and pre-school age.
<P>
	The figures on working women are constantly changing. For 
example, in 1969, only 30 per cent of both parents had a job, 
whereas in 1990, that figure had soared to 71 per cent. Thus we 
see that a large majority of mothers in two-parent families are 
now on the job market. In my opinion, this is due mainly to the 
financial requirements of the family. Canada wide, in 1991, 4.1 
per cent of double income families had an income under the low 
income level.
<P>
	If it were not for the spouse's wages, the rate of low income 
families would have been close to 15 per cent. The situation was 
more serious for two-parent families with children under 13. 
Indeed, in 1987, 12.6 per cent of them had an income under the 
low income level, whereas if the parent mainly responsible for 
child care, usually the mother, had not had a job, that figure 
would have been as high as 25 per cent.
<P>
	So we see how vitally important it is for a large number of 
families that mothers work outside the home. However, this 
presence on the job market is threatened by some factors, 
including poor child care services. A background document 
produced by the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of 
Women in 1994 revealed that, according to data from 1988, 
child care problems can have an effect on parents participation 
in the workforce and on their productivity.
<P>
	It also said that those problems could affect the productivity 
of mothers or their participation in the workforce three times 
more than fathers. So, we see that families need the work of 
mothers and that it must be supported by adequate child care 
services. A second explanation of the increased participation of 
women in the workforce is their desire of fulfilment through a 
career. Women now represent the majority of B.A. holders. So, 
they naturally feel the need to apply the knowledge that they 
received during their studies.
<P>
	This CACSW document provided the very conclusive results 
of a poll conducted on female teenagers from across Canada. 
Almost 90 per cent of girls in the 8th, 9th and 10th grades 
expected to work full time ten years down the road. Also, more 
than half firmly believed that they would work for pay long after 
completing their studies. So, women work to address the 
financial needs of their families and because they want to and 
can contribute to the development of society.
<P>
	Having done this very brief overview of the participation of 
mothers in the workforce, let us examine the bill before us. This 
bill provides for the distribution of income among spouses, from 
the bread-winner to the spouse staying at home to take care of a 
child who does not go to school full time. The real purposes of 
this legislation are to create employment and free up daycare 
spaces, to give credit to homemakers and to enhance the quality 
of life for families.
<P>
	Before I comment on these, allow me to review briefly the 
monetary situation of women living as part of a couple. In 1991, 
in 75 per cent of all two-income families, the men were earning 
much more than their spouses. Therefore, in most cases, the 
recipient of part of the spousal income would be the woman. I 
will analyze the bill with this in mind.
<P>
	We do not agree with some of the intent of this bill when it 
comes to lowering the high unemployment level and dealing 
with the problems resulting from the shortage of spaces in 
daycare centres. Of course, these problems are real and we have 
denounced them repeatedly. However, they must not be used as 
the basis of an argument against women. Quite the opposite. We 
should acknowledge the problems of mothers who stay home 
and take the necessary action to make sure they are 
economically and socially equal. Women who stay home feel 
isolated and lack social support. They are affected by the lack of 
contacts with other adults.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	They are also strangers to the influence networks that are so 
vital to job search. We know that 75 per cent of all women who 
find jobs have access to a network. That is just as true in politics 
as it is in other areas.
<P>
	We also know that the immediate result of years devoted to 
housekeeping and children is a considerable loss of income and 
various problems with re-entry into the labour force: the women 
need updating of skills and retraining; they have no relevant 
experience.
<P>
	Finally, when children leave, mothers have to face the empty 
nest syndrome. It is true for those who are still married, but 
much more so for women who also face a divorce or a 
separation. Their emotional problems will greatly increase their 
ordeal before they can get back on their feet.
<P>
	This bill seeks to increase the number of women staying at 
home. Who would benefit from such a measure? Neither women 
nor society in general, which would be deprived of their positive 
contributions. On the other hand, when we consider that families 
need the mother's salary, we must conclude that the proposal of 
the member for Mississauga-South is intended only for families 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6590"> 6590 </A></B>
<P>
where the father's salary is the highest of the two. The male 
bourgeois dream lives on.
<P>
	What about the situation of women who are victims of 
conjugal violence? We know how determining is the control 
exercised over the victims in this kind of relationship. The bill 
provides for the spouse who works to share his income. How and 
when would this be accomplished? There are reasons to fear that 
this situation would tighten even more the financial and 
emotional control exerted by an abusive man over the woman 
who shares his life. We must be careful not to make matters 
worse for women with this legislation.
<P>
	I tried to briefly explain the reasons why I oppose Bill C-256. 
I am sure the author of the bill had good intentions and was 
committed to improving the situation of these families. 
However, I think the considered changes will not do so. The 
evolution of society is closely linked to the improvement of the 
condition of women and what women want is greater financial 
independence. They want their specificity to be recognized, as 
well as their contribution to the life of their community. They 
want to be equal, and equality is achieved through 
independence, not subjugation, whether financial or otherwise.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to speak briefly to the bill and express my views on the 
importance of the initiative of my colleague.
<P>
	Those in the House who know me will know how very 
strongly I feel that the work I do in Parliament and on behalf of 
my constituents is extremely important. The work all of us do as 
members of Parliament is important and valuable to the country. 
We should never downgrade that work.
<P>
	I have had a previous career in my life to which I give even 
more importance. That has been raising three children 
fortunately with, so far it seems, very good success. I will never 
stop saying that has been the most important thing I have done in 
my life. I was fortunate enough to be raising my children at a 
time when economically we had the choice, or I certainly had the 
choice without feeling I was depriving my family by staying 
home and raising them.
<P>
	That is a choice many women do not have these days. As the 
member for Québec has said, the majority of women with young 
children are now in the workforce. Whether women raise their 
children on a full time basis at home or before and after 
completing a full day's work, it does not change the significant 
economic value of the work they do in raising their children and 
keeping their home, which receives absolutely no recognition in 
society.
<P>
	That is the fundamental issue my colleague's bill is 
attempting to address. I suspect my colleague has motivations 
for the bill that I would not necessarily share, including 
encouraging more women to stay home and look after their 
children.
<P>
<B>(1800 ) </B>
<P>
	What I do want to encourage, however, is choice for women. I 
want to ensure that whatever choice they make is valued by 
society and its economic worth recognized.
<P>
	What happens now is that through family law across this 
country we have recognized family income and family assets 
accumulated during a marriage as joint and divisible assets. 
Unfortunately we only recognize that in reality when the 
marriage breaks up.
<P>
	We have all followed the Thibaudeau case very carefully, the 
taxability of child support payments. We all know very well that 
there are large numbers of parents raising children after a 
divorce who do not receive the support payments to which they 
are entitled.
<P>
	The fact is we do virtually nothing while a marriage is intact, 
when a couple are raising children together to acknowledge that 
the stay at home parent is contributing as fully to the economic 
well-being of the family as the parent in the workforce earning 
an income.
<P>
	This is one way of trying to recognize that. I think it is 
important that we have this discussion because in the last few 
years I have increasingly heard resentment from women who are 
fully occupied and working full time raising three or more 
children. They resent that they are forgoing income to make that 
important contribution to the lives of their children and I believe 
to society. Yet because they made that choice, from their 
reduced income they are required to contribute to support 
children of other parents who choose otherwise.
<P>
	That kind of resentment between women in society is not 
helpful to the equality of women, but it is a fact. It is a fact that 
will only be changed when we really address how to recognize 
the economic value of the contribution women make as mothers 
and homemakers.
<P>
	This bill before us may not be a perfect solution to that but it is 
at least the start of discussions. The result of not recognizing the 
economic value of that work is far reaching and lasts a lifetime. 
It is a major contributor to the poverty of women that they 
interrupt a career, interrupt the opportunity to build a career 
either for a short or long period of time and they never recoup. 
Even if they go back into their career they never recoup 
economically.
<P>
	As a society we want the next generation to be born, yet we 
penalize women who are the only half of our race capable of 
producing that next generation.
<P>
	As I said, some of these are not the arguments of my 
colleagues presenting this bill. However, they are certainly 
mine. The result is that poverty is a women's issue and this is a 
cause of it. That very important work they do in child bearing 
and child rearing has no economic value in our society and that 
has repercussions throughout the workplace. It means that when 
women do go into paid work they tend to be slotted into the kind 
of work that most closely resembles mothering, looking after 
the needs of somebody else. Therefore, we  underpay that kind 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6591"> 6591 </A></B>
<P>
of work in the paid workforce that most resembles whatever 
comes closest to the mothering and supportive role. Therefore, 
we create pink collar ghettos in the workforce as well.
<P>
	I honestly think that is only going to change when we do start 
addressing and valuing economically the work of women in 
raising children and creating a home.
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	I said it lasts throughout a lifetime. One of the things I find 
extremely attractive about this bill is that it gives women the 
opportunity to provide for their own financial security in 
retirement. It gives them the opportunity to contribute to their 
own pension plan. One of the major causes of poverty among 
women and particularly of elderly women is that they have never 
had or have had limited opportunities to contribute to pension 
plans.
<P>
	For a number of reasons the motivation behind this bill is a 
positive one. We also have to address in our economic 
accounting how we value the work of women. There is a move 
afoot to have the census include valuing as employment the 
work that women do as volunteers or at home. I support that and 
I hope we will do that.
<P>
	There will be all kinds of economic arguments as to why we 
cannot do what this bill proposes. We have to start 
fundamentally questioning how we can perpetuate a tax system 
that requires depriving some women of economic recognition 
for the important work they do. I do not suspect we will resolve 
that today or in the next few months but I hope this bill has made 
a lot of members of the House start to think about it. I see the 
hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance sitting 
close by. I hope he is listening because he is in a position to start 
having a positive influence in that direction.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House today to speak on Bill 
C-256 presented by the hon. member for Mississauga South.
<P>
	This bill would allow one spouse to split their earned income 
with a spouse who is working in the home and caring for a 
dependent child who is not yet enrolled in full time school.
<P>
	This bill responds to the growing demands of Canadians that 
recognition be given to those who care for their children at 
home.
<P>
	I am pleased to speak to this bill as an MP who has chosen to 
be recognized as a homemaker in my previous occupation. I 
have not felt isolated or deprived in that role. I am pleased to 
speak to this bill during national family week and in this, the 
International Year of the Family.
<P>
	The initiatives presented in this bill would meet three 
important criteria. It provides parents with the option of keeping 
one parent at home during the early formative years of a child's 
life with a tax benefit recognizing the contribution as being 
significant. Income splitting is an  important first step forward 
in recognizing the financial needs of families with young 
children. It would allow the spouse at home to be eligible for 
certain pension benefits such as RRSPs.
<P>
	The most important objective of this bill is that it would 
reintroduce choice in the realm of child care so parents can have 
the freedom to make decisions that are in their best interest and 
in the best interest of their child.
<P>
	Currently the system favours those who use day care by the 
tax incentives provided to the spouse earning the lower income. 
Consequently those who have one spouse stay at home do not 
have the equivalent tax deductions for providing the service 
themselves. Coincidentally, with the high taxes they pay single 
income families with one spouse at home are technically 
subsidizing those who have two incomes and use day care along 
with the tax deductions.
<P>
	The Reform Party considers the family to be the fundamental 
social and economic building block of Canadian society. We 
also believe that parents are the number one choice when it 
comes to providing the best possible care for their children. This 
view is also supported by the majority of Canadians.
<P>
	An Angus Reid poll published in <I>Maclean's</I> magazine in June 
of this year stated that according to all respondents 68 per cent 
agree that the best type of family in which to raise children has 
two heterosexual parents with one at work and one at home.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the majority of Canadians cannot realize this 
desired ideal because of the limited choice in the area of taxation 
given to those who stay at home.
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	As a matter of fact, there is an unfair bias within the current 
federal tax system against two parent single income families in 
Canada. Currently, the lower income earner in a dual income 
family can claim under the child care expense deduction a 
maximum tax deduction of $5,000 for a child under seven years 
of age, while $3,000 per child is permitted as a deductible 
expense for children aged seven to fourteen.
<P>
	Reform supports many Canadian parents' belief that by 
allowing a child care taxable benefit to working parents the 
federal government in essence is advocating dual income 
families in Canada and in so doing creating an unfair financial 
situation for stay at home parents.
<P>
	This government has further aggravated this situation by 
advocating a commitment to increase the number of day care 
spaces every time the economy grows by 3 per cent or more. 
This is a commitment it will have to honour despite the fact that 
it will only further increase the inequities toward those who 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6592"> 6592 </A></B>
<P>
elect to have one parent stay at home to provide personal care for 
their child.
<P>
	No move has been made by this government to address this 
serious inequality which currently exists. Therefore, the bill 
introduced by my hon. colleague is a very positive step in the 
right direction.
<P>
	Until such a time as a system of flat tax can be implemented 
the Reform Party supports the concept of income splitting 
between legally married couples. No other measure of tax relief 
would affect the family so greatly under our current system as 
the ability to split income and lower the resultant tax burden. 
The tax savings would be particularly meaningful when one 
spouse is working as a full time care giver to their children.
<P>
	Regardless of the employment situation of the husband and 
wife, the marriage union will be recognized in tax law as an 
equal economic partnership. Should the flat rate income tax 
proposal presently being considered by the Reform Party be 
implemented, income splitting would become largely irrelevant 
because individually or collectively a couple would pay the 
same tax.
<P>
	It is also important to counter some of the criticism launched 
against reformers by those who claim that supporting such 
policies is simply a means of trying to turn back the clock and 
keep women at home. Quite the contrary. We are simply 
responding to the desires of a large number of Canadian families 
that would like to stay at home to care for their children if they 
so chose without being unfairly disadvantaged financially by 
federal tax laws.
<P>
	We believe that if implemented correctly, measures such as 
income splitting will allow those parents who are forced to work 
because of finances the option to stay at home and care for their 
children.
<P>
	In a recent survey conducted by Angus Reid 57 per cent of 
respondents thought it would be good news if the government 
would provide some type of financial assistance to help one 
parent in a two parent family stay home to care for their 
children.
<P>
	Income splitting would have several strong advantages to 
those involved and some spinoff benefits for others. First, it 
would help alleviate the excess tax burden experienced by those 
single income families with one spouse at home to care for their 
children. Even with a maximum of $25,000 of split income it 
would allow the spouse at home to receive proper benefit in 
terms of income and participate in simple pension benefits such 
as RRSPs. The tax burden on the family would be lessened, 
allowing for more disposable income to be spent on the very real 
needs of raising a family today.
<P>
	Second, it would also have spinoff benefits in the area of 
employment and day care space availability. There is a very real 
need among single parents for both day care spaces and potential 
employment. If the spouse of a two income family leaves their 
job to care for their child at home this opens up a job for 
someone else and also creates a day care space. A single parent 
who wants to get off any sort of social assistance needs both of 
these  possibilities to do so. These are very real needs for the 
single parent and simply creating day care spaces is only half the 
solution. Income splitting could provide for all components 
necessary in the equation.
<P>
	The bill does have one apparent weakness in that it limits the 
deduction to those with preschool children at home. I would 
advocate that the bill be considered for amendment in that the 
eligibility criteria be extended to include those spouses who stay 
home to manage the affairs of the home with children who are in 
school. This is also an important area of parental care.
<P>
	As critic of family issues I have heard from numerous 
Canadians across Canada regarding the issue of recognition of 
those who stay at home to provide care for their own children. It 
is also an issue in my own riding.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	Let me read from two letters I received from two of my 
constituents. Mrs. Andrea Jones in Coquitlam wrote to me after 
I was first elected, sharing her concerns on the present status of 
the Canadian family.
<P>
	She is a stay at home mother with a toddler to care for. Her 
husband is employed but they are finding it very tough to make 
ends meet. Andrea asked for equality to be implemented within 
the present tax system that does not discriminate against single 
income families. I quote from her letter:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I understand the terrible financial mess this country is in, but I strongly feel 
that the subsidies enjoyed by two-income families discredits the hard work 
homemakers do in support of their children, husbands and community.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Andrea Jones and her husband are not asking for special 
treatment, just fair and equal treatment.
<P>
	Sandra Boleak from Port Coquitlam also wrote to me this past 
spring about the need for the government to recognize the 
important work of those who stay at home in support of the 
family.
<P>
	Sandra and Len have four children at home under the age of 
six. Sandra left her full time, good paying job in 1989 to look 
after her family. Since then, it has been difficult financially and 
the sacrifice they are making to keep one parent at home is real. 
She states in her letter:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>When will stay at home parents' jobs be recognized and respected? Why can 
my husband not write me off as a caregiver as well as claim the spousal amount?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The dilemma facing parents who have exercised this choice is 
that they are disadvantaged taxwise for doing so. They have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6593"> 6593 </A></B>
<P>
chosen the preferred child raising option of Canadians and yet 
pay higher taxes on their earnings because of it.
<P>
	There is a real need to entrench within government policy and 
give full recognition to the importance of family in our society. 
The issue of child poverty is rooted not in the issue of women's 
rights or even of children's rights but in the issue of the strength 
of families.
<P>
	Government policies can actually detract from the importance 
of family role. It is refreshing to see a slight reversal of this 
trend from the government side. Perhaps this will send a loud 
message with a purpose to give the family back its prominence 
and priority within our society, and give them back the freedom 
to choose.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Ringuette-Maltais 
(Madawaska-Victoria):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome this 
opportunity to support the hon. member's bill. I may add I am 
not so naive as to expect the Canadian tax system and the general 
public to support this kind of bill. However, before we have 
legislation supported by the majority of the people and the 
members in this House, we must first have some time for 
discussion.
<P>
	In fact, this bill gives us an opportunity to look at our tax 
policies and consider how the Act could be amended. It may well 
be that at Finance or National Revenue, this kind of legislation is 
seen as a considerable loss of revenue. I must point out that this 
would only be in the short term. If we look at pension funds in 
Canada and the Canada Pension Plan, all the supplements paid to 
the spouse who was unable to take advantage of a private 
pension plan are so many expenditures for the Canadian 
government.
<P>
	I think we should take a much broader view of this bill. We 
can take the short term view but we can also take the longer 
view, and I am thinking of the economic spin-offs.
<P>
	As the hon. member mentioned earlier, I also think this bill 
raises the whole issue of recognizing the value of work done in 
the home, work that has a social value in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	At some point we can put a price tag on these social values. 
Our tax system should be able to recognize that cost, although 
personally, I think that women or men who decide to stay home 
do so as a matter of choice or personal emancipation. There are 
people who function extremely well in the home, although 
unfortunately, I am not one of them. I notice my colleagues are 
smiling, but I think we must recognize the value of work done in 
the home.
<P>
	I would even say that in this initial bill, perhaps we should 
have considered all children, not only children of pre-school 
age who are still at home. In the current context, all levels of 
government and Canadian society as a whole urge children to 
take some responsibility for caring for their parents and 
grandparents.
<P>
	When care is given to a child, a teenager, an adult or an elderly 
person, there is an intrinsic social value that  should be 
recognized. I think it is the right time to start this debate on the 
value of the Canadian family and the individual. I think it is the 
right time and also the right week, since this is National Family 
Week. My family includes my parents, grandparents, children, 
spouse and in-laws. They will be glad to hear that!
<P>
	I think it is high time, when we are talking about updating all 
our social programs in this country as well as a review of our tax 
system in the short, medium and long term, I think it is high time 
to get this debate going. I may be naive, but I believe that 
Canadians across the country will be very pleased to have an 
opportunity to discuss this value and to ensure perhaps that we 
can create a very just society, one that will be even more just and 
progressive than it is now.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to participate 
in the debate. I would like to thank the hon. member for 
Mississauga South for raising these issues through Bill C-256.
<P>
	While I appreciate the intent of the bill I have some serious 
concerns with the proposal. I would like to bring to the attention 
of the House and the very many members who are interested in 
this three concerns.
<P>
	First, I believe it would reduce tax revenues at a time when 
our fiscal position precludes any erosion of the tax base. Second, 
I do not think the proposed amendments to the Income Tax Act 
will deliver the anticipated benefits. Third, this bill could have 
negative consequences that may not have been anticipated by its 
sponsor.
<P>
	Parents among us will know that raising young children 
entails unique expense. I personally fit into one of those families 
where one parent works and we have two young children at 
home. Expenses can put significant pressure on a family's 
income. Fortunately these expenses are recognized by the 
Income Tax Act. For example the child tax benefit provides 
financial assistance for low and middle income families with 
children. A supplement of $213 is provided for each dependent 
child under seven.
<P>
	This measure is directed particularly to those families where 
one spouse stays at home to care for preschool children. Tax 
relief is also provided to working families through the child care 
expense deduction which helps to offset day care costs. 
Recognizing that the cost of child care is higher for preschool 
children the limits on the deduction are higher for children 
below age seven.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="6594"> 6594 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	This bill proposes additional measures to assist families with 
preschool children. Under the proposed bill families could 
reduce their tax burdens by transferring $25,000 from a working 
spouse to a spouse who is managing the family home and is 
caring for at least one preschool child.
<P>
	The bill is intended to provide several benefits for families 
with young children. As I understand it the intent of the bill is 
that many spouses with low incomes could then afford to quit 
their jobs, stay at home and care for their children. This would 
reduce the family's child care expenses, free up day care spaces, 
and create additional employment. The hon. member suggests 
that all this would happen at no material cost to the government.
<P>
	Let me suggest some revenue losses. The revenue losses 
associated with this proposed measure would actually be 
substantial for both levels of government. In fact the 
Department of Finance estimates that the revenue losses for 
federal and provincial government could approach $1 billion 
annually.
<P>
	Here let me remind all members of Canada's fiscal challenge. 
On a per capita basis we are one of the most indebted nations in 
the industrial world. That national debt built up by governments 
spending more than they earned limits our ability to create new 
jobs and sustain economic growth. It pushes up interest rates, 
hampering investment, and hindering our ability to succeed and 
grow in a world that grows more competitive with every passing 
day.
<P>
	In short, any measure before us must be evaluated in terms of 
whether it adds to our deficit and the tax burden it imposes on all 
Canadians. Unfortunately the proposal would likely do just that. 
To implement Bill C-256 without affecting our financial 
position, we would either have to increase other taxes or find 
corresponding expenditure reductions elsewhere. Ironically, 
these revenue losses would occur because the proposed 
measures would not solely benefit those families to which they 
are directed.
<P>
	In particular tax benefits would flow to families not currently 
saddled with day care costs. Instead thousands of families where 
one spouse already stays at home to provide care for young 
children would automatically receive the tax savings. In these 
cases no additional day care spaces and no additional jobs would 
be freed up.
<P>
	In addition, revenue losses could occur if Bill C-256 
increases the tax benefits to working couples without actually 
changing their working status. For example, consider what 
would happen if proposed tax savings were greater than the 
value of the child care expense deduction they currently claim. 
Some two-earner families might then forgo claiming the child 
care expense deduction to remain eligible for the measure 
proposed in Bill C-256.
<P>
	There are other unintended consequences that passing this bill 
could impose. Among them is the fact that eventually families 
which benefited from the proposed measure would suffer a 
significant drop in disposable income.
<P>
	The income drop would occur when their children began full 
time attendance at school. At that point these families would no 
longer be eligible to split the income of the higher earning 
spouse. The resulting tax increase would reduce their disposable 
income.
<P>
	Significantly, the income drop would arrive when the family 
could least afford it. Again, as parents among us will know the 
costs of raising children increases as the children grow older.
<P>
	Of course one could argue that to cover these increased 
expenses the stay at home spouse could merely go out and find a 
job. Unfortunately as the 1.5 million-plus unemployed will tell 
you it is not all that easy to rejoin the labour force, particularly 
for someone re-entering the workforce after a protracted 
absence during which skills have either been diminished or 
become obsolete.
<P>
	In conclusion, the issue of support for families and especially 
for children is one that the Minister of Human Resource 
Development is considering as part of his wide-ranging 
proposals for renewal of our social safety net. We should not 
undertake this process with legislation that could well miss the 
mark.
<P>
	While the intent of Bill C-256 is admirable, I believe its flaws 
severely outweigh its benefits.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, it is almost 6.30. The hon. 
member for Mississauga South will close the debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South):</B> Thank you, Mr. 
Speaker. I want to thank all hon. members who took part in the 
debate. It is obviously very important that we have this 
exchange of ideas.
<P>
	The one area that I have to comment on is the intervention of 
the parliamentary secretary. The parliamentary secretary 
unfortunately took an early memo that was prepared by staff and 
signed by the minister and sent to me using a billion dollar 
figure. Subsequent to that we have had numerous meetings to 
discuss the real finances.
<P>
	If we compare what the real finances are to what the 
parliamentary secretary has said we find a substantial 
difference.
<P>
	In fact the billion dollar figure assumes that every stay at 
home parent who is presently there would take advantage of this 
bill but nobody else would, in which case it is a full drain. It also 
does not eliminate all those parents that either make too little 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6595"> 6595 </A></B>
<P>
and are in the lower tax brackets or too much to even qualify. 
That reduced the figure to about $500 million.
<P>
	They gave no credit for the creation of child care spaces. I 
wonder whether or not the parliamentary secretary would agree 
that if the government is prepared to spend $12,000 per space to 
create child care spaces, some credit ought to be generated by 
those who free up those spaces.
<P>
	The government used figures when it discussed with me in the 
worst possible case. This is the fiscally responsible thing to do. I 
hoped there would be some movement, some understanding that 
in fact there is real value for work in the home to be recognized. 
It is an honourable profession. Some tax reform is going to be 
necessary sooner or later. I want to assure the House that I for 
one am not going to stop fighting on behalf of all caregivers, 
whether they be parents working in the home, the seniors, the 
chronically ill or the disabled.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time provided for the
