<P>
	I begin by thanking hon. members on behalf of the Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development for supporting the bill 
at second reading and in committee. I would also like to thank 
the negotiators and all the people who participated in the 
negotiations.
<P>
<B>(1005) </B>
<P>
	This is neither a complex nor a controversial piece of 
legislation. It has been developed through extensive 
consultations with all parties that will be affected by it and is 
supported by them.
<P>
	Bill C-36 is concise and direct. Despite its brevity it is 
important. For the Government of Canada the proclamation of 
Bill C-36 will mean a release from any other further claims by 
the Split Lake Cree First Nation under the northern flood 
agreement.
<P>
	More important, it will mean that we are fulfilling our 
commitments to this First Nation. It will allow us to begin to 
build a new partnership with this First Nation, a partnership 
based on trust, respect and understanding for the people of the 
Split Lake Cree communities.
<P>
	Bill C-36 means they can now realize the full benefits of the 
northern flood settlement agreement. Most elements of the 
agreement are already being implemented and, as a result, the 
Split Lake Cree are building a better and more secure future for 
themselves.
<P>
	To fully appreciate Bill C-36 we must first acknowledge that 
the people of the Split Lake, Cross Lake, Nelson House, Norway 
House and York Factory First Nations in northern Manitoba paid 
a high price for the northern flood agreement. The flooding of 
4,800 hectares of reserve lands by the Churchill River diversion 
projects of Manitoba Hydro deprived many families and 
communities of access to their traditional hunting, gathering, 
harvesting and fishing areas. It occurred with little 
consideration to the needs or rights of these people.
<P>
	A quarter of a century later the Government of Canada cannot 
turn back the clocks. However we can and must respect the 
commitments that have been made to the First Nations 
concerned. One way we will do that is by seeking parliamentary 
approval and royal assent for Bill C-36.
<P>
	As hon. members are aware, the governments of Canada and 
Manitoba, as well as Manitoba Hydro, have attempted through 
the northern flood agreement of 1977 to provide compensation 
to these nations. In addition to cash compensation the agreement 
contained provisions for land management, resource 
development, community infrastructure, navigation and so on. 
It also provided for the appointment of an arbitrator to deal with 
the claims arising under the agreement.
<P>
	Unfortunately the northern flood agreement is vague or silent 
on many key issues. As a result it has been very difficult to 
implement. It has led to frustration and excessive costs for the 
parties involved as it encourages arbitration rather than 
co-operation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7356"> 7356 </A></B>
<P>
	The two governments and Manitoba Hydro have therefore 
been pursuing settlement agreements with individual bands 
based on a common set of principles and objectives.
<P>
	Bill C-36 arises from such an agreement with the Split Lake 
Cree First Nation, the first and only band specific settlement 
agreement negotiated to date. The Split Lake Cree agreement 
was reached in June 1992. It fulfilled all outstanding obligations 
of the Government of Canada to the First Nation pursuant to the 
northern flood agreement.
<P>
	As I mentioned a moment ago, the agreement is already being 
implemented with no significant problems. It is providing 
additional financial compensation to the Split Lake Cree. As 
well, it is providing for the transfer of certain lands to the First 
Nation, the creation of two new reserves, and increased 
socioeconomic opportunities for the Split Lake Cree.
<P>
	The government made a commitment in the agreement to 
entrench several of its provisions in legislation. This is what we 
are endeavouring to achieve with Bill C-36.
<P>
	Specifically Bill C-36 implements four provisions of the 
agreement, all of which stand to benefit both the First Nation 
and the government. First it will remove any administrative 
responsibility the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development might have for moneys paid under the Split Lake 
agreement. By stipulating that these are not Indian moneys 
under the Indian Act, this in turn will give the First Nation far 
greater control over the funds which will be managed on its 
behalf by a trustee.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-36 will also ensure that provincial crown lands 
provided in fee simple title as a result of the settlement 
agreement will not become special reserves under sections 35 
and 36 of the Indian Act.
<P>
	The First Nation will thus control the use and management of 
these lands without interference from the government and 
without the restrictions of the Indian Act. From the 
government's perspective this clause means the department will 
not have responsibility for these lands.
<P>
	Bill C-36 will also address the costly and cumbersome 
dispute resolution process set out in the northern flood 
agreement. Individual band members can continue to make 
certain claims against Manitoba Hydro, but the simplified 
adjudication process set in the Split Lake Cree settlement 
agreement will take precedence over the process included in the 
northern flood agreement.
<P>
	Finally, Bill C-36 ensures that the Government of Canada can 
utilize the Manitoba Arbitration Act when matters are in dispute 
under the northern flood agreement with regard to the Split Lake 
Cree First Nation. Currently Canada is the only party to the 
agreement that does not have access to these arbitration 
mechanisms.
<P>
	As I indicated a moment ago, five First Nations were affected 
by the Churchill River diversion projects and are therefore 
eligible to receive benefits under the northern flood agreement. 
However Bill C-36 applies to only one of those First Nations, 
the Split Lake Cree, since it is the only First Nation that has 
signed a band specific settlement agreement. I am hopeful that 
negotiations with the remaining First Nations will be 
successfully concluded in the future.
<P>
	It is important hon. members understand that Bill C-36 does 
not give force to the Split Lake Cree Settlement Agreement, as 
the agreement is already being implemented. It does not place a 
new burden on the government but simply ensures that we live 
up to our commitment as set out in the agreement. The passage 
of Bill C-36 will have a significant impact on the members who 
make up the Split Lake Cree First Nation.
<P>
	The goal of the minister responsible for this challenging 
portfolio is to make a difference in aboriginal and northern 
communities and to give families and individuals both the hope 
and the tools for a brighter and better future.
<P>
	I urge hon. members to join me in pursuing that goal. Bill 
C-36 is an important element of the legislative agenda of the 
government for aboriginal people. It deserves the support of the 
House so that it can be referred to the other chamber at the 
earliest possible date.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to address the House to support, on behalf of the 
Official Opposition, Bill C-36, an Act respecting the Split Lake 
Cree First Nation and the settlement of matters arising from an 
agreement relating to the flooding of land in Manitoba.
<P>
	I would like to start by putting the bill into context, because 
what happened in northern Manitoba in connection with the 
construction of a hydro-electric project on lands traditionally 
held by aboriginal communities has had a major impact on these 
communities. It is also an object lesson for our governments and 
people in the south, who failed to give these issues the 
consideration they deserved.
<P>
	The events took place in the seventies in northern Manitoba 
and involved a Manitoba Hydro hydro-electric project.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	I may add that in a number of other areas in Canada, and 
especially in Quebec at the time, there were plans to develop 
hydro-electric power on several rivers in the north. The people 
of Quebec will remember that at the time, an agreement was 
negotiated with the Cree in connection with the James Bay 
hydro-electric development project. I will come back to this 
later on in my speech.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7357"> 7357 </A></B>
<P>
	The purpose of the project that concerns us today, was to 
develop hydro-electric power on the Churchill and Nelson 
Rivers. It was an enormous project. It involved diverting about 
85 per cent of the waters of the Churchill River to the Nelson 
River. It included the construction of dikes, dams, channels and 
hydro-electric power stations. This altered the rate of flow in 
the affected waterways, immense reservoirs were built, and lake 
water levels changed.
<P>
	The communities that lived on these lands traditionally lived 
along the waterways that provided means of transportation, their 
livelihood and food in the form of fish, so their whole 
environment was disrupted. In my region in the twenties, we had 
a similar development that affected the Lac-Saint-Jean when 
hydro-electric dams were built to form a reservoir for the Île 
Maligne power station.
<P>
	The shores of the Lake Saint-Jean were flooded. A few years 
ago, a local filmmaker, who I believe worked for the National 
Film Board, produced a documentary called <I>La tragédie du Lac 
Saint-Jean</I>. What we are about to discuss this morning in 
connection with the development of hydro-electric power in 
northern Manitoba is similar to this situation. I think some 
tragic events took place, and I think that is something we should 
not forget.
<P>
	The territory involved in the hydro-electric development 
project in northern Manitoba is immense, covering more than 
250,000, and perhaps as much as 300,000, square kilometres. 
Manitoba Hydro invested a total of nearly $3 billion in this 
project. Nearly 18 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity are 
produced, with sales estimated at between $5 million and $6 
million annually. This enormous project will probably be of 
great benefit to Manitoba. Hydro-electric power is a source of 
wealth, and it is one of the cleanest sources of electric power, but 
although it has been of great benefit to Manitoba, the project has 
been a tragedy for the five First Nations living on the shores of 
the Nelson River.
<P>
	These are the Cross Lake, the Nelson House, the Norway 
House, the York Factory and the Split Lake First Nations. The 
bill before the House this morning is specific to the Split Lake 
nation. Altogether, about 10,000 Cree status Indian living on 
these five reserves were affected. The hydro-electric 
development project flooded about 11,800 acres of land on the 
reserves or more than 10 per cent of their territory. The lands 
that were flooded were those that had been traditionally and 
continuously occupied, being, as I said earlier, those located 
along the waterways which served as a means of communication 
with the outside world.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	Before the development of hydroelectricity, the traditional 
way of life of native people was what they had known from time 
immemorial. It was similar to the way they lived at the 
beginning of the century. They relied on federal assistance as 
they should, since they were entitled to it under the treaties they 
had signed, but mainly they  relied on hunting, fishing and 
trapping for their livelihood.
<P>
	And then, progress came from the south and disrupted 
everything. As you can imagine, with the start of huge projects 
and the arrival of southern workers living in camps and coming 
into contact with people on the reserves, the native way of life 
was bound to change. But the biggest change was the disruption 
of the ecosystem brought about by the dams. There was a change 
in the ecosystem of the Churchill and Nelson rivers as well as of 
neighbouring lakes and lakes which are merely wider parts of 
the river.
<P>
	The water regime changed. In some places, the water flow 
dropped dramatically, while in others it rose sharply to the point 
of submerging banks.
<P>
	Obviously, it has had an impact on the local plant and animal 
life. Hunting, fishing and trapping activities have been 
disrupted. Trapping often depends on water levels. Animals, 
such as beavers, live in streams and when you change the 
ecosystem, you disrupt their way of life and they must move or 
modify their habits. Thus traditional trapping, hunting and 
fishing grounds have been greatly altered.
<P>
	Infrastructures such as wharfs and camps which had been used 
from time immemorial were lost. We often reflect on what the 
impact has been in the summer, but during the winter, people 
used to snowshoe across frozen lakes and rivers. Dams have 
changed the water flow and water level in streams. When you 
open the gates, the water level goes down and people can no 
longer walk on the ice as they have always done. Thus, even in 
the winter, their way of life has been greatly disrupted.
<P>
	The most dramatic changes can be seen in the local native 
peoples' way of life. To start with, they have suffered a loss of 
income. Those who used to live from hunting, fishing and 
trapping have seen their income drop. The cost of living went 
up. Workers came in from the south, bringing along new 
products and introducing new habits among natives. All this 
meant an increase in the cost of living. Goods went up in price 
because people could not rely as much on hunting, fishing and 
trapping for their livelihood. They were forced to buy food, but 
at higher prices because everything had to be shipped from the 
south.
<P>
	There was also a transformation of their mental and physical 
environment, in other words, their quality of life suffered. For 
generations they had lived next to a given river, they had 
particular activities, they recognized the landscape. Oral 
tradition had given rocks or places particular significance. 
When the land was flooded, a lot of significant landmarks were 
lost. Just think of our feelings when, by chance, we go through 
the village or the street where we grew up 40, 50 or 60 years ago. 
We know 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7358"> 7358 </A></B>
<P>
it is the same place, we recognize a few things, but we realize 
that the environment has changed.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	For the native peoples of the North affected by the harnessing 
of the Churchill and Nelson rivers, the environment changed 
suddenly. They no longer recognized their rivers, their lakes. 
They could no longer find the places where their people used to 
gather and live as a community. A part of their culture had been 
flooded at the same time as the river banks and the lake shores.
<P>
	Yet, these people had rights. At that time we were not talking 
about rights entrenched in the Constitution, because this 
happened in the early 1970s in Manitoba. But these people had 
treaty rights, under Treaty No. 5, signed and negotiated with the 
federal government by their ancestors. Since they had rights 
over this land, it was to be expected that they would be entitled 
to compensation for losses incurred and that measures would be 
taken to help ensure decent living conditions on their ancestral 
land.
<P>
	Of course it may have been less trouble for some people if 
these people had migrated south. Many wonder why one would 
want to live on ancestral land, when economic activity is 
difficult and everything is so expensive in these remote, 
northern areas; transportation costs in particular are 
astronomical. So, it would make things much easier if 
everybody just moved down south. But that is not what our 
country is about. That is not how we operate in Quebec and in 
Canada. Quebec and Canada are areas, land that was developed 
over the years by our fathers and forefathers, land on which we 
want to continue to live.
<P>
	I can understand that aboriginal peoples of the north, be it 
Northern Quebec or Northern Manitoba, want to live in dignity 
on their own land. The issue of regional development was 
debated extensively in my region, the 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region. People want to continue to 
develop this land. They want to live on this land. They want their 
children to find work there and the community as a whole to 
prosper.
<P>
	These are requests often made to governments. People ask: 
``Give us the means to live on this land of ours''. I can 
understand full well the situation of native peoples from 
Northern Manitoba who have seen their land altered, but wish to 
continue living in dignity on that land.
<P>
	An agreement was to be concluded between interested parties. 
These interested parties are the five native peoples, Manitoba 
Hydro, as the financial backer of this project, the Province of 
Manitoba, which owns the Crown lands, and the government of 
Canada, as trustee for the natives affected, under the Indian Act.
<P>
	It all started, as I said earlier, in the early 1970s. In 1968, 
Manitoba Hydro received a licence from the provincial 
government to develop the northern territory covered by the 
Churchill and Nelson Rivers.
<P>
	In 1972, Manitoba Hydro decided to go ahead. There was, of 
course, a debate among the population at that time. The Natives 
argued that they had rights. Some people more sensitive to 
environmental considerations also took part in the debate. There 
was a good discussion.
<P>
	The licence was granted in 1968 and Manitoba Hydro decided 
to go ahead in 1972. In 1974, the Department of Indian Affairs 
got involved, some four or five years after the project was 
initiated. The Department of Indian Affairs assumed its 
responsibilities and ruled that, under Sections 28 and 35 of the 
Indian Act, the project could not be carried out without the 
agreement of the bands concerned.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	The federal government, which had a responsibility in this 
regard, finally notified everyone involved that the agreement of 
Native peoples had to be secured.
<P>
	In 1975, negotiations began between the federal government, 
the province, Manitoba Hydro and the five nations represented 
by the Northern Flood Committee. This committee had 
represented Native people since 1974. Representatives from 
each nation had formed a committee to negotiate with Manitoba 
Hydro, the Province of Manitoba and the federal government.
<P>
	Negotiations took place and, in 1977, the Manitoba Flood 
Agreement was signed. In other words, an agreement was 
reached in 1977 and the First Nations concerned agreed that the 
project could go forth. At that time, compensation was provided 
for flooded lands, for lost community infrastructure and for the 
loss of hunting and fishing rights. Steps were to be taken to 
ensure fair treatment for the Native people affected. That was 
the agreement.
<P>
	Unfortunately, as the representative of the Minister of Indian 
Affairs said before me, this agreement was vague on certain 
points. Some matters were not settled and too many issues were 
poorly resolved or negotiated, so that the agreement could not be 
implemented.
<P>
	The most contentious points that were put on the back burner 
concerned adding lands to the reserves to replace the flooded 
lands or giving the first nations concerned other lands in return 
for the flooded lands.
<P>
	Another point left in limbo was the employment of reserve 
members on building sites. One would have thought that with 
the building sites open in those regions, an adequate and 
rigorous policy would be in place to allow members of the First 
Nations concerned to work on hydro-electric projects if they 
wished to do so. The agreement was vague on this point.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7359"> 7359 </A></B>
<P>
	There was the whole issue of environmental monitoring. Land 
was flooded, so the plant and animal life were disrupted and we 
realize that there were surely environmental problems. The 
agreement contained no strict, specific measures for proper 
environmental monitoring. Of course, we are looking at it today 
from the vantage point of the 1990s and, in the 1970s, people 
may have been less sensitive. Today, when we think of all the 
environmental studies and precautions that an organization must 
take if it wants to proceed with hydro-electric development in 
the north, we realize that nothing was done in Manitoba in the 
1970s or whatever was done was inadequate.
<P>
	In my region, there was a hydro-electric development project 
on the Ashuapmushuan River. I say ``was'' because that project 
seems to have been abandoned for now. For seven or eight years, 
Hydro-Québec has been conducting studies, making public 
submissions, setting up review committees and boards to hear 
what the public thinks. Today we find it quite right and proper to 
protect the environment. That was not the case in northern 
Manitoba in the 1970s.
<P>
	The agreement between the native peoples and Manitoba 
Hydro left this whole issue unresolved.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	Another important thing is that the agreement did not provide 
for a body to implement it. You might think that the committee 
of First Nations on the flooding of land in northern Manitoba 
would have dealt with this issue, but the agreement did not 
provide for any spending or an adequate amount to cover the 
costs. There should have been an auxiliary agreement to specify 
this, but no such agreement was ever concluded.
<P>
	So in 1977, we had what I would call a bungled agreement that 
was very inadequate. The result was predictable. Implementing 
the agreement was a tragic failure for the Native people 
concerned. From 1982 to 1993, the Native people filed 174 
applications for arbitration under the agreement. That is a huge 
number. It means that the Native people concerned had to fight 
inch by inch, make representations and file complaints with an 
arbitrator to enforce an agreement that they had signed in good 
faith. Of course, they are in a pitiful situation.
<P>
	It is clear that for the Native people concerned, the project had 
very harmful consequences, as the Department of Indian Affairs 
has admitted. For example, in terms of the environment, the 
Department of Indian Affairs has admitted that some 
deterioration of commercial and recreational areas can be 
observed. I have spoken about it at length from the beginning. 
The department has also been able to observe an increase in 
mercury contamination. Those are waterways, and the presence 
of mercury in water is very harmful to fish and to those who eat 
that fish.
<P>
	It was noticed that the drinking water in some communities 
was contaminated, this in an area where water is found 
everywhere. In northern Manitoba, there are lakes, rivers and 
streams on much of the land, but some of the water used by 
Aboriginal people was contaminated. A reduction in the 
quantity and the quality of fish was noticed. The Department of 
Indian Affairs recognized that game and fish became scarce.
<P>
	In 1992, the Auditor General examined the issue. I must admit 
that, since I come from Quebec, I did not have a very good grasp 
of the issue, but the problem has been discussed for years in 
Manitoba. In 1992, the Auditor General found that the 
Department of Indian Affairs, which had signed the agreement 
on behalf of Canada, had not done its duty regarding the 
environmental aspects of this project. The Auditor General told 
us that the department had not conducted an adequate 
preliminary environmental assessment, that it did not have a 
plan to monitor the environmental impact of the hydroelectric 
project, and that it did not present a report to the bands 
concerned on the implementation of the recommendations made 
in 1975 regarding the environment.
<P>
	The Native peoples concerned had told the Department of 
Indian Affairs that the project had serious consequences. 
Recommendations had been made in 1975, but the department 
did not implement them. Aside from these environmental 
considerations, the agreement also included provisions on major 
concerns of Native peoples, but these were not implemented.
<P>
	Canada did not fulfill its commitment to transfer some land to 
the reserves, in exchange for the land that was flooded. 
Seventeen years later, in 1993-94, only one per cent of the 
promised land had been transferred.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	Also, community development was never really promoted. 
Some initiatives were taken, as the parliamentary secretary said 
earlier, but little was done for community and economic 
development in those regions.
<P>
	In 1980, a plan was developed to promote employment, 
health, transportation, housing and education. That plan was not 
implemented and, in spite of that, no monitoring process was 
devised to ensure its implementation.
<P>
	Consequently, 20 years later we find ourselves with an 
enormous mess on our hands. Of course Hydro Manitoba is 
pleased: it generates electric power. The province is also pleased 
because it promoted its own economic development. The federal 
government was not seen to be particularly pleased, but then, 
during his speech earlier, the parliamentary secretary did 
express satisfaction that the bill before the House this morning 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7360"> 7360 </A></B>
<P>
will free the Department of Indian Affairs from some of its 
duties.
<P>
	The fact remains that some people benefitted from all this, 
some people benefitted from this development, but so far it has 
not been the Natives living on these territories. Why? Because 
the proposed agreement was ill-conceived and there was no 
agency to implement it. This agency, as I mentioned earlier, 
should have been the committee that negotiated on behalf of the 
aboriginal peoples, that is the Northern Flood Committee, but 
since the agreement did not provide for its funding, we are 
without such an agency.
<P>
	Moreover, in 1983, the judge presiding over some of these 
matters stated that if someone had wanted to strip the committee 
of all its duties, he would not have acted any differently. The 
best way to go about it was to provide no funding at all. We must 
realize that this committee was supposed to implement the 
agreement over a vast territory. This would have entailed 
permanent staff, management, transportation costs, legal costs 
for representation in court. In any case, it would have cost a lot 
of money. The agreement did not provide funding for this 
committee. I think it should have, but it did not.
<P>
	A solution had to be found, so, 1986, the committee which had 
overseen the negotiations for the agreement and managed to 
survive, proposed a new round of comprehensive negotiations to 
settle all outstanding claims and to put an end to all these 
disputes. This was in 1986, six years after the Agreement was 
signed.
<P>
	Three years later, in 1989, a new round of negotiations 
started. This is a very slow process. Admittedly, aboriginal 
people are patient but when they ask for negotiations and these 
negotiations only start three years later, somebody somewhere 
is not making all the efforts needed to solve the problem.
<P>
	In July 1990, another settlement agreement was signed on 
outstanding land claims and obligations. Among other things, it 
was decided to transfer at least 834 square kilometres of Crown 
lands to the Indians concerned. Thus, a settlement agreement 
was signed that was going to be used as a kind of framework 
agreement for the negotiations embarked upon by the 
Aboriginal peoples, since each one of them is in a unique 
situation. All of them are not located along the same river. Their 
physical and economic conditions differ. Of course, each and 
every one of them wants negotiations that meet its own 
particular needs.
<P>
	But the agreement signed in 1990 was supposed to be a 
framework agreement. In 1992, the Split Lake First Nation, the 
one mentioned in the bill before us this morning, apparently 
accepted a special agreement that stemmed from the proposed 
agreement. As for the four other nations, negotiations are still 
going on. At the present time, they negotiate on an individual 
basis with the authorities to reach agreements. There are 
separate negotiations for each of the four nations. Was the 
intention to divide and conquer? If so, this was certainly 
successful.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	The agreement signed by the Split Lake Cree Nation provides 
particularly for some rule on the water level, meaning that the 
aboriginal people will be consulted and will have their say on 
water levels and flows. The agreement specifies which lands 
will have to be transferred by the Crown to the province of 
Manitoba for the reserves and for the native populations. The 
agreement provides for a partnership for resource management 
and planning for the use of traditional lands. The agreement 
provides for adequate environmental monitoring with a very 
active participation by the Cree. The agreement provides for the 
payment of certain amounts per capita and pensions to the 
elders. This is part of the compensation owed to the aboriginal 
peoples for the losses they incurred due to the hydro 
development project.
<P>
	The agreement also specifies that the right of native 
populations to have access to regular government programs is 
not diminished because of the fact that they have received 
money under this agreement. If we take away their right to have 
access to regular government programs because of the money 
they have received, they will be as poor as they were before.
<P>
	It is also expected that measures will be taken to ensure that 
members of the native community affected can find jobs at 
Manitoba Hydro and that business opportunities are created to 
help these populations revitalize the local economy.
<P>
	The agreement also provides for an adequate arbitration 
mechanism. This is essential because nothing guarantees that 
this agreement will always be implemented to everyone's 
satisfaction. So there is a need for an arbitration mechanism.
<P>
	There is also the possibility of opening a trust account to make 
money available to the native people so that they can manage 
this own development. for development purposes. All these 
measures may require fiscal commitments of $15 million from 
the federal government and of $4 to $5 million from the 
province of Manitoba and Manitoba Hydro, as well as 
guarantees of some $21 million from Manitoba Hydro. This 
means that money will be made available to the Cree to 
stimulate economic development in the area.
<P>
	Now, you may ask, since an agreement has been reached, why 
do we have to study a bill on this agreement? The bill is designed 
to facilitate the settlement of matters arising from the Split Lake 
agreement.
<P>
	Thanks to this bill, the aboriginal population of Split Lake 
will be able to receive directly the money owed to them. It will 
not have to go through the federal government. My party has 
frequently asked this government for amendments to the current 
legislation that many people would welcome. At present, money 
made available to Indian or Native nations must go through the 
Indian affairs department, which is  responsible for the manage-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7361"> 7361 </A></B>
<P>
ment of that money. With this bill, the Split Lake population will 
get administrative control over the funds made available to 
them.
<P>
	This bill also exempts from reserve land status certain federal 
lands to be transferred. That will give the Split Lake population 
better control over those territories. That also means less 
responsibility for the department.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	Native peoples will get better control, but, as a result, the 
department will have to assume lesser responsibilities as their 
trustee. What matters is that these peoples take charge of their 
own lives and that the trusteeship of the Indian affairs 
department gradually diminish.
<P>
	The bill provides that the agreement takes precedence over 
the 1977 agreement. That agreement was bungled and 
ill-conceived. Therefore, the agreement the Crees signed in 
1992 will have precedence over the clauses of the previous 
agreement that are not as clear.
<P>
	There is also a dispute settlement mechanism under the 
Manitoba legislation. This means that people can be more easily 
summoned and that procedural rules are clearer and more 
restrictive for all parties.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you can see from my speech that I have realized 
that there has been a hydroelectric development. The population 
has suffered because of that and should receive some kind of 
compensation. The Split Lake agreement signed in 1992 
provides the population concerned with the means to look after 
its own development and the bill submitted to us will help that. 
That is the reason why the Bloc Quebecois supports this bill in 
third reading.
<P>
	However, some issues were raised when we heard witnesses at 
the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. The Bloc 
Quebecois members sitting on this committee intend to suggest 
that the committee ask the minister that some of our 
recommendations be implemented in order that agreements with 
the other four nations now negotiating be reached.
<P>
	We will ask that the committee negotiating that issue for 
Aboriginal people gets adequate funding to ensure proper 
service to the communities involved in future negotiations. We 
will ask that the federal government authorize anticipated 
payments or non-interest-bearing loans so that funds be given 
to people negotiating in order that they have immediate access 
to all the monies required for their economic recovery. And 
when other nations settle, the anticipated payments will be 
deducted from amounts due.
<P>
	Perhaps we will also ask the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development to seriously consider reviewing the 
amounts the Split Lake nation settled for in the agreement 
reached if other communities should obtain much higher 
amounts through negotiations. We must say that the Split Lake 
people are taking a risk under the circumstances. They are the 
first to sign and the others could get much more. Canada, the 
province of  Manitoba and Hydro Manitoba will benefit from the 
fact that people in Split Lake want to take that risk, but I think 
they should not have to put up with negative consequences in the 
future because they were the first to accept.
<P>
	We will also ask the committee to recommend that the 
Department of Indian Affairs ensure the continued use of 
environmental impact studies, and we want the federal 
government to see to it that the parties act in good faith during 
current negotiations with the four other nations.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	I am not accusing anyone, but I have the impression that in 
this process, especially in the case of the agreement signed in 
1977, some people wanted to take advantage of the situation, 
and that the parties were acting in strict good faith.
<P>
	Since my time is running out, I will start my concluding 
remarks.
<P>
	The agreement before the House today is not a comprehensive 
agreement like those concluded in 1975 at James Bay, in 1984 on 
the Mackenzie, in 1990 in Yukon and in 1992 in Nunavut. This 
agreement concerns only one of the nations, but the philosophy 
is the same. In other words, faced with the fact that Aboriginal 
peoples were making claims and had rights in Canada, Canada 
and Quebec realized that it was necessary to have agreements in 
good faith involving aboriginal peoples and the various 
governments concerned.
<P>
	In concluding, I may recall that the first agreement in this 
country was the agreement signed in Quebec with the James Bay 
Cree in 1975, while a side agreement was signed in 1978 with 
the Naskapi of Northeastern Quebec. It was the first significant 
and comprehensive agreement signed in Canada and was ratified 
in 1977 by an Act of Parliament.
<P>
	Hon. members will recall that, at the time, the federal 
government's objective was to extinguish the aboriginal rights 
of all Indians who signed agreements. The Crees who signed the 
James Bay agreement relinquished their aboriginal rights to the 
lands concerned. These lands represented an immense territory 
of more than one million square kilometres, about 69 per cent of 
the territory of Quebec. This agreement was implemented.
<P>
	I think Quebec can be proud of the fact that the agreement 
signed in the seventies by the Bourassa government was 
implemented by subsequent governments, including the Parti 
Quebecois government headed by Mr. Lévesque. These 
agreements were entered into in good faith by the Crees and the 
Neskapis, the federal government, the province of Quebec and 
Hydro-Quebec. As far as I know, the parties concerned, have 
seen to it that the agreement is respected. I think it has been, to 
the satisfaction of all parties. Substantial amounts of money 
were 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7362"> 7362 </A></B>
<P>
made available to the James Bay Cree; their territorial rights are 
clear; they managed to organize a Native police force; there 
were propoer environmental assessments. As far as health and  
education are concerned, Cree communities have been able to 
set up all the services they need and are in charge of running 
their own affairs.
<P>
	In closing, I can say that my party intends to support Bill 
C-36. An injustice has been done to the Aboriginal peoples in 
Northern Manitoba, and I think it is the duty of the federal 
government to redress it. If Bill C-36 before the House today 
can be helpful in this respect, it will be a pleasure for us to 
support this bill.

members of the Reform Party have included in their statements 
the amount the debt increases during the one minute they speak. 
Fair enough. Emphasizing the seriousness of our economic 
difficulties is important.
<P>
	But members of the opposite party fail to tell the complete 
story and ignore some of the important disbursements the 
government will make. In the next minute, $38,000 will be paid 
to seniors, $28,000 will be transferred to the provinces to pay for 
medical services, $15,000 will be disbursed to low income 
Canadians through the child tax and GST credits and $29,000 of 
tax expenditures will be incurred to support retirement savings 
plans.
<P>
	Unlike some members of the Reform Party we in the 
government are cognizant of our social responsibilities to 
individual Canadians. We intend to ensure that people do not die 
for lack of medical care, do not go hungry for lack of food and do 
not suffer from exposure for lack of housing.

control mechanism to monitor the questionable activities of the 
Communications Security Establishment. In so doing, he is 
going against the traditional position of the Liberal Party of 
Canada.
<P>
	In fact, the Liberal members on the special committee 
reviewing the CSIS Act in 1990 recommended that the CSE be 
subject to outside control. We also remember that the former 
Liberal Solicitor General, Robert Kaplan, believed as well that 
informal administrative controls are no longer sufficient. A 
democratic, independent external control mechanism is 
required for the activities of the CSE. The Bloc Quebecois 
believes that the government must make a parliamentary

received over 1,000 letters from my riding expressing support 
for Chuck and his group CRY, or Crime, Responsibility and

Deas and the crown for failing to enforce the court imposed 
curfew. Had that curfew been enforced, Jesse would be alive

current revenues are $600 million annually. They project that by

These are highly paid, knowledge based, export oriented jobs.
<P>
	Yesterday I had the pleasure to host in Ottawa 14 CEOs 
representing IT companies. They met with officials of the

message to government was clear: they are not looking for 
handouts or subsidies.
<P>
	They stated that it was easier for them to sell their IT products 
to the Untied States government than to the Canadian 
government. They asked that in cases in which their product was 
superior and priced better than the U.S. products that the 
Canadian government buy Canadian made IT products.

	This program funds equality seeking groups and individuals 
who seek to use the charter to establish their legal and

of their election promises.
<P>
	Speaking of the importance of restoring public trust, the 
Liberals told us: ``This erosion of confidence seems to have 
many causes: some have to do with the behaviour of certain 
elected politicians, others with an arrogant style of political 
leadership''.
<P>
	So on the first opportunity, the Liberal government and the 
Prime Minister gloss over an unpardonable indiscretion by a 
Cabinet minister. The Prime Minister casually rebuffs the 
Official Opposition which asks him to enforce the most basic 
rules of ethics. What has become of the Liberal promises? What

Speaker, how can the Prime Minister explain to this House that 
he consulted the ethics counsellor only a few hours before the 
minister of heritage made his statement? Is this not an admission 
of how little importance he attaches to this counsellor's advice?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when I was informed of the minister's letter, I knew 
that Privy Council advisers had analyzed the problem and I was 
given a recommendation to that effect. I did not know whom 
they consulted. I was briefed on the various options. I knew that 
Mr. Sharp had been consulted and I thought that Mr. Wilson had 
been consulted, but that did not change the decision. The 
decision is still the Prime Minister's responsibility. The Prime 
Minister cannot say, ``My counsellor advised me to do this or 
that''. At the end of the day, the Prime Minister must take his 
responsibilities and that is what I did.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is ironic that, after making such a big fuss over the 
appointment of an ethics counsellor, they consult him only a few 
hours before a statement, probably to save face.
<P>
	Given his party's ambitious commitments with regard to 
integrity and openness, does the Prime Minister not agree that 
the episode of the letter shows that his government is in no hurry 
to adopt clear guidelines for ministers, especially when dealing 
with quasi-judicial bodies?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I checked the long-standing guidelines on this, and 
those concerning judges are very clear. They say that anyone 
who has a problem with the judiciary must go to the Minister of 
Justice. It is very clear that a minister cannot write or telephone 
a judge. Even when I was a minister, there were guidelines to the 
effect that one must go to the Minister of Justice, who must use 
his judgment.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	As for the guidelines for members of Parliament and 
ministers concerning quasi-judicial bodies, they say that there 
must be communications among these bodies, but after reading 
the guidelines yesterday, I concluded that they were not clear 
enough and I ordered that new ones be prepared.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage.
<P>
	After a series of failures, including the Ginn Publishing 
episode, the avowed helplessness of the minister to adequately 
protect the interests of French-speaking people living outside 
Quebec, and now his refusal to resign following his blunder with 
the CRTC, the minister no longer has any credibility.
<P>
	At a time when the government is about to slash his budget, 
what credibility does the minister think he still has to protect the 
interests of Canadian cultural institutions and industries?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I assume my responsibility to all Canadians 
who expect me to look after their interests, including those of 
cultural communities.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, does the minister not think that, given his poor 
record and his inability to deal with several major issues, he 
would have served the interests of Canadians better by resigning 
yesterday, as he was asked to do?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the answer is no.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the Prime Minister said that he had learned of the 
letter to the CRTC from the Minister of Canadian Heritage at the 
beginning of the month of October and that he had consulted the 
ethics counsellor.
<P>
	I draw the House's attention to yesterday's <I>Hansard</I> at page 
7312 where the Prime Minister is quoted as saying:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I consulted the government's ethics counsellor and one I appointed for 
myself-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In light of those remarks I would like to ask the Prime 
Minister how he could say just a few moments ago that: ``I did 
not speak to him myself. I asked that he be consulted''. Further, 
how could he justify saying just a few moments ago: ``I thought 
Mr. Wilson had been consulted''. Why the discrepancy?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when you are Prime Minister, you have people working 
for you, preparing reports and discussing issues. Officials 
worked on this issue and then made recommendations.
<P>
	As to the minister's letter, I was of the opinion that he had 
made a mistake, but when he realized that, he himself corrected 
the situation. I knew that the issue had been reviewed by lawyers 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7367"> 7367 </A></B>
<P>
from the Privy Council Office. These people do not come to see 
me personally; I have an excellent Clerk of the Privy Council 
who keeps me informed.
<P>
	I did receive the recommendation. I did not ask them to whom 
they had talked. The recommendation was made to the Prime 
Minister who is fully responsible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Prime Minister is fully responsible. With all the facts in 
front of me I said I think that the minister made an error in not 
being that careful but he tried to correct it as soon as he realized 
his error. I did not ask him to resign. Eventually I asked if Mr. 
Wilson had been consulted in the process. I have been told he 
was not. Therefore, I asked that he be consulted right away. He 
was consulted yesterday and he gave his advice. The advice he 
gave was given to me and it did not force me to change my mind 
about the decision I took a few days ago.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
is not something we are dealing with just a couple of days ago. 
The ethics counsellor said that he was contacted on Wednesday 
night, not by the Prime Minister or his officials but by a 
Southam News reporter. This has been going on literally for 
months. According to the ethics counsellor he was only 
contacted Wednesday night. This is not good enough.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister: Where are the reports and the 
minutes from this meeting with the ethics counsellor? Why can 
we not have all the facts for this? Will he table a report from the 
ethics counsellor with the facts?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is not about that at all. I said that the Prime Minister 
is responsible. I was made aware of the problem. I looked at all 
the facts and I made the decision. I am fully responsible.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	If I were to make the wrong decision and then come into this 
House and say that I received advice from somebody telling me 
to do this or that you would have said: ``You are the one 
responsible''. I take full responsibility on that matter.
<P>
	The Prime Minister can consult whomever he wants. At the 
end of the day when he gets up in this House he is the only person 
responsible. I am not running away from my responsibilities.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that 
is exactly what we are asking for: absolute responsibility and 
accountability from every member in this Chamber.
<P>
	Instead of establishing an independent ethics watchdog to 
investigate ministers and hold them publicly to account, the 
government has established an ethics lapdog that answers to 
nobody but the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister keeps him in 
the dark and employs him only when he is needed at the last 
minute to excuse the actions of an embattled minister.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister stop dodging his responsibilities as 
he is proud to do and demand the resignation of the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I explained the situation yesterday. I said that it was an 
honest mistake. The minister recognized that himself and acted 
without pressure from anybody outside. When he realized it was 
interpreted like that and when checking the guidelines he 
realized he wanted to correct the situation and he wrote the 
letter. I was satisfied with that.
<P>
	I would have preferred that he had not written the letter of 
course. But as I said, when you look at the facts it was not to 
influence a decision, it was to have a decision. When you look at 
the facts today the letter was written in relation to one applicant 
who did not get the permit. He lost it.

<P>
	After weeks of waiting, the government will release today a 
series of studies on the future of its cultural institutions, for the 
sole purpose of justifying the major cuts it is about to make in 
that sector.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Canadian Heritage realize that imposing 
major budget cuts to cultural institutions, such as the NFB, will 
only result in jeopardizing their integrity, and even the survival 
of an institution which is internationally recognized?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member thinks that the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage has made decisions concerning the future 
budgets of some federal cultural institutions. This is only an 
assumption.
<P>
	What I did was to have these studies made public precisely so 
that people and institutions concerned can react. This is in total 
agreement with the government's desire for transparency in 
these fields.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies,

recommendations contained in the Secor report on Telefilm 
Canada, to the effect that investments should be limited to

Mr. Speaker, yesterday we were concerned about the judgment 
of the Minister of Canadian Heritage. Today we are concerned 
about conflicting statements by the Prime Minister who 
yesterday said: ``I consulted. I consulted with the ethics 
counsellor''. Today he is saying: ``I asked somebody else to go 
and see him and see what he said''. This is a discrepancy and I 
am very concerned.
<P>
	The Mulroney government was not known for setting high 
standards but at least when it had a problem it was dealt with 
immediately. This Prime Minister has not.
<P>
	I ask him to ask his minister to resign immediately and clear 
the air.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yes, I consulted. I asked somebody to call him to ask 
him the question. He gave a very clear answer. He did not speak 
to me directly. Most of the time I have a staff that consults with 
me because I have a lot of work to do. The answer that came 
from him did not lead me to change my mind about the decision I 
had made earlier in the month. I think it was October 1 and we 
are still in the month of October.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, on page 95 of the red book, the Liberals promise 
and I quote: ``to appoint an independent ethics counsellor that 
will report directly to Parliament''. This is a broken promise 
made by the Prime Minister during the election campaign. The 
Prime Minister has said that he would be accountable for 
fulfilling every promise in the red book. This need not have 
happened. The Prime Minister would not be in this mess had he 
stood up and kept his own promises.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister to give the ethics counsellor his 
independence, make him responsible to Parliament, and allow 
him to report directly to Parliament on this issue as he promised. 
Then he would not be in such a mess as he got himself into today.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we debated that theory in the House at that time. We 
came to the conclusion that at the end of the day, whatever 
advisers you have around you, when you are the Prime Minister 
you make the decision. Even if that adviser is to report to 
Parliament, I will have to decide whether I do or do not keep a 
minister in the cabinet. Nobody but the Prime Minister chooses 
a cabinet minister and is responsible for the cabinet.
<P>
	The man does the advising but the decision remains the 
responsibility of the only one who is responsible for the cabinet, 
the Prime Minister of the country.

for the Minister of Canadian Heritage. It is becoming more and 
more obvious that the delay in tabling the long-awaited bill on 
Phase II of the copyright law reform is attributable to the 
inability of the heritage minister to agree with his colleague, the 
industry minister, on the scope of the recognition of 
neighbouring rights.
<P>
	Will the minister recognize that his industry colleague and 
himself hold completely opposite views on this issue and that 
his weakness and lack of credibility could well put him at a 
disadvantage vis-a-vis his colleague who is prepared to defend 
the interests of industry at the expense of creative artists?

<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr.

the minister received a letter from the CRTC thanking him for,

support for the application by Telemedia''. The minister stated 
yesterday that having received the CRTC's letter he reacted 
quickly to remove the misunderstanding that had arisen.

aircraft owned by Royal Aviation Inc. The report even mentions 
that Royal operated aircraft that would not have received an

control program, and what does he intend to do to ensure 
passenger safety?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the issue raised by the hon. member is a very important 
one. The Department of Transport is responsible for ensuring 
passenger safety in all public transportation, and I can assure the 
hon. member that I will look into the situation he described, 
because we cannot afford to leave any doubt as to the quality of

question is for the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	During his trip to Vancouver, the Prime Minister announced 
his government's strategy on tourism. Using the excuse of a 
need to co-ordinate the activities of all stakeholders in this area, 
the federal government is preparing to interfere once again in a 
field already well under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Does the minister not realize that by creating a Canadian 
commission on tourism with the mandate of promoting, within 
Canada and abroad, our country as a tourist destination, he is 
creating a new source of costly overlap?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to explain to the hon. member that in 
addition to the obvious benefits of tourism in the job creation 
front, one of the key components of this strategy is to address the 
very significant part that the tourism account deficit plays in our 
current account deficit which is about $30 billion a year and 
represents in effect the amount we have to borrow from 
foreigners every year.
<P>
	To displace Canadians going offshore is as valuable to our 
current account deficit as it is to attract foreigners to Canada. 
Therefore by promoting Canada to Canadians we are also 
solving our fundamental issue.
<P>
	It is not a duplication. It is an opportunity for us to ensure that 
all Canadians understand what a wonderful and rich country 
they share.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
purpose is to make all Canadians aware of the magnificent 
beauty of their country.
<P>
	In that context, is the Minister of Industry willing to admit 
that the true reason Ottawa is trying to gain control over tourism 
promotion within Canada is to use it as a tool for promoting 
Canadian unity in preparation for the upcoming referendum in 
Quebec?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is really a rather silly question because the way the 
Prime Minister has announced the formation of the commission 
is that it is going to be on a co-operative basis. We expect and 
hope to have the co-operation both of provincial governments as 
well as the private sector in the establishment of the Canadian 
tourism commission.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	Decisions on the expenditures of the promotion 
account-because this is entirely intended to encourage demand 
for tourism-are going to be collective decisions. If people in 
the Government of Quebec do not wish to participate that is up 
to them. However I suspect that representatives of the Quebec 
tourism industry will see the promotion of tourism in the 
province of Quebec as a real asset for their industry and for their 
province in creating jobs in the province of Quebec and 
elsewhere in Canada.

consult with the person who produced this letter, and I said I

	<B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Cochrane-Superior, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Secretary of State for 
Parliamentary Affairs.
<P>
	Statistics Canada has reported a significant decrease in the 
number of people receiving unemployment insurance in the last 
eight months, that is 12.3 per cent less than in 1993.
<P>
	Could the Secretary of State explain this rapid change and its 
consequences for the unemployment insurance fund?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Secretary of State (Parliamentary 
Affairs) and Deputy Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, for the benefit of the hon. 
member and all my colleagues in the House, I will say that the 
decrease in the number of people receiving unemployment 
insurance is due to a sharp upturn in the economy.
<P>
	We have created 340,000 jobs since we came to office; 90 per 
cent of these jobs are full-time, young people have filled more 
than 50 per cent of the jobs created in September and 147,000 of 
the new jobs went to women. This is the result of all the 
measures taken by our government: infrastructures, Youth 
Service, initiatives, and statistics. This will ease the 
implementation of our reform of social programs.

<P>
	The federal government has announced the establishment of 
13 regional offices to provide one-stop service to small- and 
medium-sized businesses.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	The federal government has also confirmed its plans to 
interfere further with regional development, in spite of the 
consensus in Quebec for full powers to the province in this area.
<P>
	Does the minister recognize that, after dismissing Quebec's 
claims over manpower training, Ottawa is about to do the very 
same thing with regional development? Is that the kind of 
co-operation we were promised by Ottawa?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, the federal government is always prepared to 
co-operate with any province, including Quebec, on any issue in 
which we have common interests.
<P>
	In the case in point, the Federal Office of Regional 
Development already has 13 offices in Quebec; they have been 
there for over 20 years. No new office is being established. 
These offices already exist. What the minister responsible for 
the FORDQ did announce was the provision of an additional 
service to small- and medium-sized businesses, to improve 
operations through centralization of information on federal 
programs in existing offices of the FORDQ.

my supplementary question is for the same minister.
<P>
	Does the minister recognize that his repeated attempts to 
increase federal government visibility in the regions only 
increases duplication between Ottawa and Quebec and that, in 
the end, it is the taxpayers and the regions that pay the shot?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, we are the ones who have just put in place a system 
to reduce duplication and overlap. We already have eight 
provinces on board. Unfortunately, Quebec did not see fit to join 
us in reducing duplication and overlap.
<P>
	In the case in point, the information we will be providing 
small business is information on federal programs, including 
international marketing insights that can only be gained through 
the federal government. That is why we plan to use these 13 
existing offices to provide extra services to businesses.

question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	There is a clear discrepancy between what he said in the 
House yesterday and what he is saying today with respect to the 
ethics counsellor, meeting with the ethics counsellor and 
checking with him.
<P>
	Another discrepancy is that yesterday the ethics 
commissioner said that there were no explicit guidelines for 
cabinet ministers dealing with government agencies. Has the 
Prime Minister not given the ethics commissioner a copy of the 
interest guidelines? I have a copy here if he wants an extra one.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Once again I appeal to colleagues not to use 
any props.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, ministers have received books on guidelines. I have 
explained earlier that in the case of communications with the 
judiciary it is very clear they cannot do that directly by 
telephone or by letter.
<P>
	They have to call, if they have a problem, the Minister of 
Justice who is the only one authorized to do something if the 
Minister of Justice decides to do something.
<P>
	In the case of quasi-judicial bodies that relate to the affairs of 
the government, the affairs of the members of Parliament and so 
on, the guidelines were not clear to my satisfaction.
<P>
	I have asked the Privy Council Office to prepare new 
guidelines in consultation with Mr. Wilson. I hope these 
guidelines will be ready very soon, and I will instruct ministers 
to follow them very clearly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I hope I 
can clear this matter up.
<P>
	The object of this code is to enhance public confidence in the 
integrity of public office holders which includes ministers of the 
crown, I might add. It further states under preferential treatment 
that ``public office holders shall not step out of their official 
roles to assist private entities or persons in their dealings with 
the government where this would result in preferential treatment 
to any person''. If that is not clear, I do not know what is.
<P>
	In light of this revelation, would the Prime Minister admit 
that a serious breach of conduct occurred, just as bad as Mr. 
Charest and just as bad as Mr. Munro went through and therefore 
he has no choice but to restore integrity-

<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Would the Prime Minister admit that a serious 
breach of conduct has occurred and therefore he has no choice 
but to restore integrity to the office of the minister of heritage 
and ask for his resignation?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have explained very clearly the rules that apply to 
communications with the judiciary. I explained clearly that my 
conclusion is that we have to make some clear directives in 
relation to the quasi-judiciary bodies that exist in the 
government.
<P>
	Of course all these bodies report through ministers to 
Parliament. That is one of the problems. Ministers receive 
communications from members of Parliament. Every member 
of Parliament is obliged as a member of Parliament to listen to 
representations from constituents and ask that they be treated 
fairly. That is the work of every member of Parliament and 
ministers are members of Parliament.
<P>
	We have to make the situation clear as to how a minister can 
be a member of Parliament at the same time. We cannot deprive

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry. Quebec 
has 30 federal research establishments that employ 2,533 
workers, accounting for 11 per cent of jobs in federal facilities 
of this type in Canada, while the Chalk River centre in Ontario 
alone has 2,000 employees.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Industry agree that there is a major 
imbalance in the distribution of federal research facilities in 
Canada and that Quebec does not receive its fair share of federal 
jobs in research and development?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member knows very well how important 
research and development in Canada are for science and 
technology, which benefit all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is not possible to say that this is exactly how all federal 
research money should be allocated, given the fact that much of 
the existing research money spent by the federal government is 
in support of carrying out the mandates of federal departments. 
It is obviously going to result in a disproportionate amount of 
the total spending occurring close to the seat of government.

will discover that in fact Quebec has more than its proportionate 
share.

	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Prime Minister has told the House that when the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage wrote the letter we have been talking about 
he was just acting as an MP. Then he said that the minister made 
a mistake.
<P>
	Since he cannot have it both ways, acting reasonably and 
properly as an MP and making a mistake, I would like the Prime 
Minister to tell the House which interpretation of the minister's 
conduct is the correct one.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, of course when a minister is faced with a situation like 
that he or she has to realize he or she is a minister at the same 
time.
<P>
	Members write all the time to commissions recommending 
somebody or asking that a file be studied. A minister has to be 
more careful. That is why I said the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage should have been more careful, but he was acting in 
good faith as a member of Parliament. His letter was very clear. 
He asked for due process. He was not asking for a favour.
<P>
	In reality what happened was that when the decision was made 
the person he wrote for did not receive the permit. In fact 
somebody else got the permit, so the letter did not help at all.

<P>

receiving support under Canada's social security programs. 
Some are receiving unemployment insurance benefits; others 
the child tax credit.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	Will the minister please tell the House how he intends to 
ensure that the support of Canada's social security programs 
remains available for those Canadians who are truly deserving?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for drawing 
attention to this very important question which deals with the 
allocation of scarce government resources.
<P>
	I should point out that wealthy people currently receiving 
these benefits are doing so entirely legally. It is exactly that 
reason why the minister responsible for human resources has 
tabled the social security review for members to examine. It is 
exactly for that reason we are embarking upon a debate on these 
measures that we have inherited from the previous government.
<P>
	I trust that other members of the House will also take part in 
this and make sure they follow the lead of the hon. member for 
Brant. I would add how important it is also to recognize that we 
should reject these constant demands from the opposition not to 
touch the tax system. If we accepted its demands we would be 
unable to make these changes which will free up scarce 
resources for people who need them most.
<P>
	I would suggest that both with respect to the debate on social 
security and in the preparatory discussions for the budget we 
take full part in making sure the system is improved so scarce 
money goes where it should go.

	At the same time I will not hesitate to credit the present 
government for implementing this agreement by way of Bill 
C-36.
<P>
	I am confused as to the display of schizophrenia on behalf of 
the government when back in June it introduced a couple of 
pieces of legislation dealing with aboriginal issues, namely 
Bills C-33 and C-34 which were terrible pieces of legislation 
and terrible agreements. Now in direct contrast it is introducing 
a bill that has a great deal of merit. I wonder how the present 
government can take such opposite views of agreements and 
still call it good legislation.
<P>
	As an example, when we compare Bills C-33 and C-34 with 
the way Bill C-36 was introduced, on Bill C-36 there was plenty 
of time the analyse the legislation and the agreement to make 
reasoned, logical decisions. In contrast to that, Bills C-33 and 
C-34 were presented a very short time before debate. There was 
no time to analyse the two bills before they were debated in the 
House.
<P>
	On Bill C-36, there was plenty of time to prepare a response 
to the bill and the agreement through a detailed analysis. On Bill 
C-33 and Bill C-34 as you know, Mr. Speaker, there was no time 
to prepare adequate responses. Once the bills were rammed 
through the House, we had time to come up with more reasons 
why those bills should not have gone through.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	In contrast there was plenty of time to debate Bill C-36, 
which we really appreciated. Our party has debated it at length. 
It is good legislation. By contrast the Liberal government 
invoked closure on debate on Bill C-33 and Bill C-34. It 
devalued the democracy that was present in the House.
<P>
	We appreciate the debate time we have had on Bill C-36. Bill 
C-36 is an excellent agreement, an excellent piece of legislation 
because there is finality to it. It actually reaches a conclusion. 
The amount of moneys payable under the agreement are set. 
They are predetermined. They will end at a particular date.
<P>
	As opposed to that, in Bill C-33 and Bill C-34 it is completely 
open-ended. It is a blank cheque piece of legislation. There is no 
finality to it. There are so many grey areas that we could be 
paying for the same thing over and over again for generations to 
come. We appreciate the finality that Bill C-36 has and we 
question the reasoning behind Bill C-33 and Bill C-34 that the 
government was so pleased about.
<P>
	By contrast again, in Bill C-36 there was sound logical and 
reasonable solutions put into this agreement to solve the 
problem. Contrast in Bill C-33 and Bill C-34 there was no 
reason, no logic, no sound solutions to the problem, just vague 
statements that left the opportunity for abuse over and over 
again and the cost to rise upward and upward and the payments 
to go on for generations.
<P>
	Now that I have drawn a comparison between a good piece of 
legislation and a great agreement that we have in the House 
today with some terrible legislation, Bill C-33 and Bill C-34 
that the Liberals rammed through the House in June in order that 
they could break early and have a holiday over the summer and 
the minister of Indian affairs could go to the Yukon and proudly 
proclaim this agreement, I want to talk about Bill C-36 and why 
our party would support it.
<P>
	Problems in this region of Manitoba began in the 1940s with 
the Lake Winnipeg regulation and the Churchill River diversion 
projects. These were huge hydroelectric projects initiated by 
Manitoba Hydro that flooded almost 12,000 acres of reserve 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7377"> 7377 </A></B>
<P>
lands that were  the occupied lands of the different Cree groups 
there. This represented about 10 per cent of reserve lands among 
five Indian bands.
<P>
	In 1975 the Northern Flood Committee was established with 
representation of all five bands which of course included the 
Split Lake Cree band.
<P>
	This committee was established to determine exactly how the 
bands affected by this hydroelectric project were to be 
compensated for the flooding of their lands and the negative 
impact that this had on aboriginal fishing, hunting, gathering 
and trapping, traditional activities in that part of the area among 
the Cree bands.
<P>
	The work of the committee eventually lead to the creation of 
an economic development agreement and the Northern Flood 
Agreement known as the NFA in 1977. That was not a good 
agreement. The NFA was vague in its terms. It was very 
open-ended. It presented all sorts of opportunities for abuse of 
the compensation. It has cost the government well over $100 
million because of the disastrous formulating of that agreement.
<P>
	Bill C-36 is a result of the many serious problems that were 
experienced under the NFA between the bands, Manitoba Hydro, 
the Government of Manitoba and the Government of Canada, 
problems which began only a year after the signing of the NFA in 
1978 and carried through to 1988.
<P>
	In 1992 the Auditor General reviewed the operation of the 
NFA and found a huge number of problems. He found that the 
terms and conditions of the NFA were terribly unclear. This 
resulted over a period of time in a large number of arbitration 
applications being put forward by the signatories over the years.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	Just after the NFA was signed the terms and conditions were 
so clouded that the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development requested an extensive legal analysis of its 
obligations under the agreement. DIAND was very worried 
about this agreement and the implications it would cause for 
compensation and for provisions down the road. It requested 
this huge legal analysis so it could get its position a little bit 
clearer.
<P>
	This resulted in a 72 page report being produced in 1983 and 
later a 200 page report being produced in 1987 outlining 
DIAND's obligations under the NFA.
<P>
	One really has to wonder whether the people who put this NFA 
together were asleep at the switch when it was signed and what 
the government was doing when it was being put together. In 
1983 and 1987 the government had to go into this huge legal 
process to find out exactly what its obligations were under the 
NFA. One wonders who the negotiators were representing. It 
also brings into question their competence.
<P>
	By way of example of the obligations of the government that 
were unclear, the NFA appears to be definitive when it states that 
Canada is responsible to supply drinking water to the bands. 
Manitoba Hydro was  supposed to pick up 50 per cent of the cost 
of doing this. It just so happens that to date Canada has spent $88 
million on this obligation to supply pure drinking water and 
Manitoba Hydro has not picked up one cent of this cost. We are 
talking about $44 million here.
<P>
	When this bill was before the committee on aboriginal affairs 
we discovered that an arbitrator was still trying to determine if 
Manitoba is responsible to pay 50 per cent of Canada's cost of 
supplying drinking water to the five bands. We have the 
Northern Flood Agreement that is or appears to be very 
definitive that there was a 50 per cent cost sharing between 
Canada and Manitoba Hydro. It ends up that Canada has paid the 
whole shot up to now, $88 million. There is an arbitrator still 
trying to determine if Manitoba Hydro was responsible to pick 
up 50 per cent of the cost. It gives an idea how unclear in many 
areas the NFA was. It was actually a very bad agreement for 
Canada to be involved in.
<P>
	This example I just gave on the drinking water clearly 
highlights the uncertainty which exists in the terms and 
conditions of the NFA. That is why it is such a good thing that we 
are able to break out of it and sign this particular agreement with 
the Split Lake Cree Nation.
<P>
	The Auditor General determined that the NFA was designed to 
be implemented through a co-operative approach. Instead, he 
found that the NFA was being implemented through an 
adversarial approach. This adversarial condition was brought 
about by the cloudiness of the agreement and people thinking 
that they could take advantage of this. In fact, there was every 
opportunity for them to take advantage of it.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, as of November 1991 signatories to the 
NFA had filed a total of 150 claims for arbitration. At that time 
there were 32 outstanding claims where Canada was either the 
respondent or the claimant. This adversarial process is 
frustrating to the bands, it is frustrating to the government and it 
is frustrating to Manitoba Hydro.
<P>
	It is a process which of course is expensive to the taxpayer 
because the taxpayers end up paying the shot for the legal costs 
on this.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	Because the parties are retaining legal counsel to battle their 
claim before an arbitrator, the Canadian taxpayer ends up 
picking up the tab for the federal government's lawyers, the 
Manitoba Hydro lawyers, the province of Manitoba and the 
bands involved, the signators on the native side of it.
<P>
	I can clearly say that the taxpayer may never know the true 
cost of the Northern Flood Agreement. It is that bad and it is that 
expensive.
<P>
	The Auditor General estimated that the NFA had cost the 
federal government $115 million and up between the time it was 
signed in 1977 and March 31, 1991. This was an agreement that 
was supposed to solve the problems. It created problems and it 
created a huge obligation to the  Canadian taxpayers. However, 
the Auditor General said that this was strictly an estimate 
because in fact-I love this statement-the Department of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7378"> 7378 </A></B>
<P>
Indian Affairs and Northern Development had not captured the 
entire cost.
<P>
	Within his recommendations in the 1992 report, the Auditor 
General stated that the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development must capture all NFA associated costs, a 
huge obligation for the taxpayers of Canada for this disaster of 
an agreement, the Northern Flood Agreement.
<P>
	In all, the NFA was not clear in its terms and conditions and 
this led to various claims being filed for arbitration between the 
parties which would sign the agreement. This led to an 
expensive and certainly unworkable agreement.
<P>
	In 1989 negotiations began between the parties to address the 
severe difficulties found within the Northern Flood Agreement. 
The negotiators were seeking band specific agreements. I think 
that was a good first step.
<P>
	Bill C-36 is just such an agreement reached with the Split 
Lake Cree band. I want to say that as a participant in the 
committee process on this bill, I had the opportunity to talk with 
many members of the Split Lake Cree band. I was very 
encouraged by their determination to resolve this thing and get it 
so that there is some definite finality to this bill in order that the 
vague, grey areas of the NFA can be put aside. They can get on 
with life and make some definite plans for the future well-being 
of their community.
<P>
	I commend the Split Lake Cree band for having the courage to 
break away from the Manitoba flood committee and negotiate 
this final settlement with Manitoba Hydro and the provincial 
and federal governments. They faced a lot of adverse criticism 
from the other four bands that were the original signatories for 
breaking away and wanting to get the thing done. I commend 
them for what they did. It was a very courageous act.
<P>
	Apparently work is currently under way with the four 
remaining bands to try to draft similar agreements to this in the 
coming year.
<P>
	There is again a lot of resistance to it because of the blank 
cheque opportunities in the NFA. It is incumbent on the 
government that it pursue coming up with agreements for those 
four remaining bands as quickly as possible. It is going to solve 
the problems in that area and it will save the Canadian taxpayers 
a huge amount of money and problems.
<P>
	I am not going to be as long as the former speaker but I want to 
talk briefly about some of the really good things in this bill. 
Specifically under this agreement, the Split Lake Cree will 
receive about $47 million over five years. They will receive 
some 34,000 acres of new reserve land and some 2,800 acres of 
fee simple land.
<P>
	This is good because they will know what their land reserve 
will be. They will have this money for economic development in 
setting up infrastructures within their communities and they will 
be able to put a business plan together.
<P>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
	It is interesting to note also that the settlement moneys will be 
transferred to a trust fund in the name of the Split Lake Cree. 
These funds will be administered by a trust company in order to 
guarantee accountability. This is going to ensure that the band 
has the utmost flexibility in determining where and how the 
money will be spent within its community. In speaking with the 
Split Lake Cree I believe it is going to be spent with due 
diligence and accountability.
<P>
	The 2,800 acres of fee simple lands will be subject to property 
taxation. Any business originating from those lands is also 
taxable. I like that. We have a form of taxation that is going to 
help the economic base.
<P>
	I am also pleased to note that this agreement was put to a 
referendum in the band. Individuals in the band voted 93 per 
cent in favour of the agreement. I like that as well because that is 
the democratic process. It is important to utilize such a 
mechanism in order to allow the input of the rank and file band 
members since this settlement agreement has a direct effect 
upon their lives and the lives of their children.
<P>
	Further Bill C-36 was examined by the Standing Committee 
on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, which 
examination ended on October 6. This bill was reported back to 
the House without amendment. It was a good piece of 
legislation. It is a good agreement. Committee members found 
that the bill sufficiently addresses the problems found within the 
northern flood agreement. Members hope that Bill C-36 will 
adequately settle the grievances arising out of the flooding of 
reserve lands.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports the settling of legitimate Indian 
grievances. This indeed is a legitimate grievance. I know this 
new agreement will work a lot better than the NFA. I hope that 
similar settlement legislation relating to other affected bands 
will be forthcoming.
<P>
	I have no hesitation and the Reform Party has no hesitation in 
supporting Bill C-36.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to, bill read the third time and passed.)

	The House resumed from October 27 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-53, an act to establish the Department of 
Canadian Heritage and to amend and repeal certain other acts, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee; of the 
amendment; and of the amendment to the amendment.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, for 
the interest of the House I would like to provide the reasons for 
bringing forward the subamendment that was presented 
yesterday.
<P>
	The issues in the reorganization of this department are 
complex. We are seeing five ministries becoming one. It 
consolidates several subcabinet departments: the Secretary of 
State; the Department of Multiculturalism and Citizenship; the 
Department of Fitness and Amateur Sport; Parks Canada; 
components of Environment Canada; and the heritage 
component of the Department of Communications.
<P>
	The government has talked a great deal about meeting its 
deficit target. I was really quite astounded to hear that this 
reorganization is going to save the huge figure of $7.3 million. 
Our debt today is over $536 billion. We have a deficit of $40 
billion. Yet this reshuffling and this reorganization is going to 
save $7.3 million. Not a single person-year is lost; everybody 
has been reshuffled and moved off to other departments. 
Therefore I am not quite certain where the savings are.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	The other side of the House, the government side, has often 
challenged the Reform Party MPs to come forward with some 
good ideas. We certainly want to ensure that the finance minister 
indeed does have access to this report by June 23, 1995 to help 
him with his short term deficit targets that he puts and that he 
wants to reach.
<P>
	I also felt it was important to express one last time for the 
record and for Canadians generally exactly what we mean by 
special interest funding. This really is a ministry of special 
interest.
<P>
	I have with me a number of items I would like to read into the 
record which come from a 703 page document listing all of the 
special interest funding that is available to Canadians today. It is 
important for us to look at these particular elements because 
they clearly describe special interests in Canada.
<P>
	In the 1993-94 fiscal year $17,200 was given to something 
called ``The Hidden Advantage''. It was a series of round table 
discussions to be held in Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal, Calgary 
and Saskatoon on the relationship between diversity and 
international trade with a particular focus on the Pacific rim. 
Participants would include opinion leaders in the Asian 
Canadian community.
<P>
	A staggering $85,000 was committed to the Canadian 
Advertising Foundation. It was for ``Minorities in advertising; 
we are all Canadians''. This is a communications outreach. It 
was for the dissemination of the findings of the research done by 
Goldfarb Consultants for the Race Relations Advisory Council 
on advertising and the provision of suggestions on how to 
include and portray visible minorities in advertising. Once 
again, $85,000 for that particular activity.
<P>
	The 1993-94 program funding for the Canadian Council for 
Multicultural and Intercultural Education was $198,000. This 
was to provide program and project support for the following 
activities: operations of the national office, co-ordination of 
CCMIE activities, the board, executive, meetings, ECE and 
Race Relations Resource Advisory Committee workshops at the 
CCMIE national conference that is held every year. That was 
almost $200,000 to that group.
<P>
	There is also the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry, Culture, 
Community and Health Studies. It received $5,000 for a national 
symposium titled ``Models of Health Care in a Pluralistic 
Canada''. It was a two and a half day national symposium on 
models of health care appropriate for a pluralistic Canada, 
whatever that means. It was held in Toronto and was for research 
workers, health care providers, health educators, public health 
agency staff, policymakers and consumers.
<P>
	The Conference Board of Canada received $86,635 on 
``Dimensions of Diversity in Canadian Business''. This was a 
two-year research and information dissemination project on the 
importance of diversity to Canadian economic prosperity, with a 
particular focus on managing and valuing diversity in the 
Canadian private sector.
<P>
	There was $15,000 committed to the public service 
announcement campaign on violence in society and the 
development of a public service announcement, a PSA. This 
campaign was going to focus on violence in the community and 
the media.
<P>
	The Ethnocultural Business Advisory Committee of metro 
Toronto received $20,000 for its small business week on 
ethnocultural business activities. This is a co-ordination of 
events to be held during small business week by eight 
Ethnocultural Business Advisory Committees across Canada. 
These events include trade shows, workshops, business awards 
and networking events. This is part of an annual national event 
for small business.
<P>
<B>(1240 ) </B>
<P>
	The next thing I want to bring into focus is the $40,000 that 
was given to the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto Chief 
Administrative Officers department. It is for municipal 
procurement strategies and minority economic development. 
The municipal government will adjust its procedures for bidding 
on contracts to ensure they do not present barriers to minority 
owned businesses and it will train its managers on the 
implementation of those procedures.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you will be pleased to hear that the National 
Association of Friendship Centres received $15,000 for phase 
three of its national race relations strategy. This project will 
develop resources and tools that will be used to train race 
relations workers from friendship centres across Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7380"> 7380 </A></B>
<P>
	The Steering Committee Forum for Central and Eastern 
European Canadians on Business Development in 1993 received 
$10,000. This was a forum for central and eastern European 
Canadians on business development. This two-day national 
forum was to be held in Toronto. It was on how the Ukrainians, 
German and Polish Canadian communities in Canada could 
utilize the business expertise within their respective 
communities to become more involved in business activity.
<P>
	The next one I want to raise is on drama and education to 
foster understanding. Easin Productions received $10,000. This 
project will introduce students and community groups to race 
relations and cross-cultural issues through the medium of live 
theatre and workshops. There will be at least 174 presentations 
in schools and community groups.
<P>
	I really wonder how unifying all of these different activities 
are in Canada today. We are seeing so many of these projects and 
workshops unfolding that highlight more and more of our 
differences. They are not bringing us together or unifying us on 
how we are the same.
<P>
	The Black Educators Association of Nova Scotia received 
$34,442. This was for program funding to address educational 
concerns and deliver workshops in black communities to 
increase parental involvement in education issues.
<P>
	The Dartmouth Police Department received $3,526 for a 
14-week employment project for two visible minority students.
<P>
	The Eye Level Gallery received $1,507 for workshops 
presented on key video works by a black artist and a cultural 
skill development workshop.
<P>
	The International Education Centre received $34,160 to 
conduct a series of multicultural and race relations programs for 
teachers, education administrators, students and community 
groups.
<P>
	The Parents for a Model School Committee of the St. Joseph 
A. McKay Home and School Association received $11,970. This 
was for a proposal for phase one of a model school project for 
this particular association. It was for the development of the 
infrastructure and support system for an anti-racism and 
anti-poverty project for an inner city school in Halifax.
<P>
	Shelburne County Cultural Awareness Society received 
$25,645. This project is researching data and conducting an 
archaeological survey on a site of historic significance to the 
Nova Scotia black community which has been selected for a 
regional landfill.
<P>
	In closing I want to state for the record once again that the 
reorganization of the Department of Canadian Heritage is really 
a ministry of special interests. The government is creating a new 
superministry of cultural identity that will legislatively 
entrench grants to feminist, multicultural, linguistic and 
environmental groups. I submit that it denies us an opportunity 
to define ourselves as Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I very 
much thank the previous speaker for taking the time to review 
some of those issues because they underline one of the things I 
want to talk about in addressing this reorganization. Frankly I 
am a little astounded that when reading through the list of grants 
the member did not understand what people were attempting to 
do. People in business and in government throughout the 
country from coast to coast have recognized that we in Canada 
have built something profound, wonderful and strong. It gives 
us strength internationally that no other country in the world 
has.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	We have recognized that in our diversity there is strength. I as 
an English Canadian married to a Polish Ukrainian person can 
celebrate what we bring to the country. At a time of globalism, at 
a time when we are reaching out to the entire world, we can build 
upon those strengths.
<P>
	Professor Neil McDonald who lives in my riding is renowned 
throughout North America as an expert on the question of 
diversity. He points out that at a time when we are reaching 
across the ocean, when we are reaching into other countries of 
the world to build markets and build relationships, we have in 
Canada a vast resource of people who can work with us.
<P>
	What is the member concerned about? Is it a $17,000 grant to 
talk about diversity and international trade to help build our 
balance of payments and support exports in the country? That 
does not sound terribly subversive to me.
<P>
	Let me respond to a couple of points the member highlighted. 
Referring to models of health care, at a time when we are 
working so hard to strengthen our health care system and are 
supporting research into some models of health care it strikes 
me as something we should be celebrating, not criticizing.
<P>
	Turning to violence in society, is the member saying she is 
afraid to look at it or that the government should not be taking 
action on such a critical social issue?
<P>
	Referring to drama and education to foster understanding for 
students, as members and as a government we have a role to 
educate people, to help people from all parts of the country to 
understand what the country is really about. By fostering 
understanding of other groups we reduce tensions and reduce 
some of the violence in communities. Is this what the party 
opposite is opposed to?
<P>
	Then parents for a model school. I did not select these things. 
This is what the member read into the record as examples of 
abuse. We are funding parents to help them look at building a 
model school promoting anti-racism and anti-poverty. Is that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7381"> 7381 </A></B>
<P>
what the party opposite says it is opposed to? Frankly I am a 
little astounded.
<P>
	I suspect the majority of the House supports the 
reorganization the government has begun. As we promised we 
have worked to reduce the size of cabinet, to streamline 
operations and to bring together like departments. We have had 
many debates in the House about a number of departments and 
the department of heritage is one which I support very strongly.
<P>
	The proposed legislation combines sectors that share the 
following responsibilities: the promotion of Canadian identity, 
cultural development and heritage, and the maintenance of our 
national parks.
<P>
	I want to describe in some detail the different sectors and how 
they relate to fostering Canadian values and Canadian identity. 
The sector of citizenship and Canadian identity promotes the use 
of official languages. I have heard much talk from members 
opposite about the evils of promoting official languages. They 
should stop and reflect upon what we have built in the country, 
how we have managed in very difficult times and with very 
extreme tensions by promoting understanding, acceptance, 
introduction and inclusion rather than rejection.
<P>
	The federal government is the government of all Canadians. 
Therefore its policies must serve a diverse population of some 
27 million people. Actually Statistics Canada says it will soon 
be 29 million.
<P>
	The department believes that official bilingualism allows for 
services in the official language of the citizen's choice and 
reflects a simple commitment to understand and to be 
understood by the public in English or in French.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	Lester B. Pearson put it very eloquently when he said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In a diverse federal state such as Canada, it is important that all citizens 
should have a fair and equal opportunity to participate in the national 
administration and to identify themselves with and feel at home in their own 
national capital.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In addition to official languages, the citizenship and Canadian 
identity sector is also responsible for the Multiculturalism Act. 
It is apparent that Canada's increasingly diverse population 
provides a unique resource base for the successful development 
and expansion of our economy.
<P>
	This is something that multinationals have recognized. This is 
something that the business community in Canada has 
recognized. This is something that the Liberal government has 
recognized for several decades, and that is why we have built the 
multiculturalism process. It is passing strange to me that 
members opposite have not recognized this point.
<P>
	A diverse society is one which ensures a continuous and 
dynamic interplay of better ideas and experiences which are 
essential for a growing, competitive, global economy. By 
working with various ethnocultural and mainstream 
organizations the Department of Canadian Heritage is effecting 
real change to make Canada a better place and the envy of every 
nation.
<P>
	That is what we are. I really support and applaud the Secretary 
of State for Multiculturalism for the work she is doing as she 
goes across the country supporting and promoting diversity. In 
that diversity is our strength as a country.
<P>
	Amateur sports and related events like the Canadian games 
also fall under this department. These events are an important 
part of how the department fosters a positive Canadian identity 
and pursues the values of excellence that Canadians hold true. 
The sector of cultural development is also an essential, integral 
part of the department. This sector develops policies and 
programs to promote artistic expression and the preservation of 
Canada's heritage.
<P>
	The economic impact of the arts community on the Canadian 
economy cannot be understated. In 1992 the cultural sector 
accounted for 3.7 per cent of GDP, or roughly $22 billion. In 
addition the sector employed almost 500,000 people, a 
relatively large bang for the buck.
<P>
	The Government of Canada recognizes the importance of 
Canada's cultural sector. That is why under the auspices of the 
Department of Canadian Heritage it rigorously promotes the 
interest of Canada's cultural community on the international 
scene.
<P>
	Finally I would like to refer to the integral part the parks 
sector fills in the Department of Canadian Heritage. This sector 
fulfils national and international responsibilities in mandated 
areas of heritage recognition and conservation. Our rich natural 
and historic heritage incudes 36 national parks, 750 historic 
sites, 9 historic canals and 4 marine areas located throughout 
Canada. They include some of the gems of the world's heritage. 
Parks Canada commemorates, protects and presents these 
national treasures. Parks Canada ensures public understanding, 
appreciation and enjoyment of this heritage while at the same 
time ensures long term, ecological and commemorative 
integrity.
<P>
	In short, what we are on about today is simply bringing 
together elements in government that speak to every person in 
the country and to the world about what we are as Canadians. We 
should all celebrate and enjoy the fruits of the work of the 
department. It is at the foundation of what makes us the best 
country in the world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will not speak for a long time on Bill C-53 
because we have spent several hours dealing with the bill. We 
have proposed an amendment to the amendment calling for the 
committee to have a deadline to review the entire focus and 
purpose of the Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7382"> 7382 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to respond to some of the comments made by the 
member for Winnipeg South in his response to my colleague, the 
member for Calgary Southeast. The member for Calgary 
Southeast was reading and referring to some grants made by the 
department under the banner of multiculturalism.
<P>
	I share the concerns of the hon. member for Winnipeg South 
regarding racial discrimination, the importance of education 
and the importance of health.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	I would like to remind the House that we have a justice 
department which should adequately be able to protect our 
citizens from discrimination and should be able to undertake 
any necessary action to guard the rights of all Canadian citizens.
<P>
	We have a Department of Health that is supposed to be 
concerned with the health of Canadians. Why is the Department 
of Canadian Heritage, under the banner of multiculturalism, 
messing around with Canadian health issues? It does not make 
sense. What about education? Education is a provincial 
responsibility. The federal government has some responsibility 
for funding, particularly for higher education, but why is the 
Department of Canadian Heritage under the banner of 
multiculturalism offering grants regarding education programs?
<P>
	It does not make sense. It costs a lot of money. What is the 
whole premise of the Department of Canadian Heritage, why it 
exists? Why do things like multiculturalism and Canada Council 
grants flow from that department or why do they need to be 
reviewed?
<P>
	I state my case. I think I have the support of my colleague 
from Calgary Southeast in saying that we are not against the 
fundamental principles that Canadians support, but we are 
against the foolish administration from the federal perspective 
as it relates to those important elements Canadians so much 
enjoy.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to speak on second reading of Bill C-53, an act to 
establish the Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	The bill will give the new department a mandate to assume its 
rightful share of responsibility in  administering the legislative 
responsibilities of the heritage department. As everyone in the 
House is aware, the new department came into being in 1993 
with the amalgamation of several departments.
<P>
	The legislation creates a department that will have 
responsibility in the areas of national parks, historic sites, 
cultural development, amateur sports, multiculturalism and 
official languages. All these areas were previously in five 
separate ministries and are now combined into one. That in itself 
is a very significant cost saving measure. All these areas have 
clear links to our identity as Canadians.
<P>
	I found it very disconcerting yesterday to listen to every 
member of the Reform Party and how they spoke against Bill 
C-53. I did not hear one positive comment from that side of the 
House with regard to Canada's heritage. One after another they 
stood in their places in the House and spoke about each of the 
main aspects of the heritage department.
<P>
	I would like to quote only one member. I am sorry the member 
for Kindersley-Lloydminster who just spoke had to leave. He 
mentioned what the new ministry was responsible for, as 
reported in yesterday's <I>Hansard</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-an unruly collection of agencies which has been lumped together 
arbitrarily. It truly is the ministry of lost souls, a ministry put together consisting 
of many irrelevant and outdated agencies with nowhere else to go.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Let me mention a couple of the so-called unruly irrelevant 
areas the member was talking about. He was talking about the 
Museum of Civilization, the Museum of Nature, the National 
Archives, the National Arts Centre, the National Battlefields 
Commission, the National Film Board, the National Gallery, the 
National Library, the Museum of Science and Technology, Parks 
Canada, Heritage Sites, and on and on.
<P>
	If anything shows our Canadian identity, it is those particular 
national agencies that we happen to be very fortunate to have in 
the country.
<P>
	The institutions I have mentioned are some of the cultural 
heritage institutions of Canada. Not that many years ago I 
chaired for several years in the region of Ottawa-Carleton the 
advisory committee on the arts. I would like to explain my 
connection between a local regional advisory committee on the 
arts and the heritage department. They are very different. One is 
huge and one is small.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	Their roles are the same, to retain the heritage of our country 
and to promote the language and the culture.
<P>
	Without the help of a major department like the department of 
heritage or without the advisory committee on the arts which I 
just spoke of, one requires the assistance of municipal 
governments, regional governments, provincial and federal 
governments.
<P>
	Without those four levels of government, culture would not 
survive in the country because of its size. Whether it is film, 
music, radio, television, archives,  museums, our rivers, lakes 
and mountains, we as legislators have a responsibility to 
promote and protect.
<P>
	Most of the Reform Party people come from the province of 
Alberta. I happened to be in Alberta two weeks ago and spent a 
week in the beautiful Banff resort area in the Banff National 
Park. What a jewel in the crown of Canada is the Banff National 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7383"> 7383 </A></B>
<P>
Park with national funding going into that park. I am proud that 
all Canadians recognize the importance of not only this national 
park but many national parks in this country.
<P>
	I mentioned the commemorative war memorial. Soldiers from 
every province in the country died in Europe during the wars. 
Have you ever gone to those cemeteries? Have you ever visited 
them? I did this past-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I know that 
members feel very strongly about issues. It is the place of 
vigorous debate but I would call on each and every member to 
please direct their interventions through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gaffney:</B> Mr. Speaker, you get quite emotionally wound 
up in these things and you go off track every now and then.
<P>
	There are gravesites of Canadian soldiers in Europe. Our tax 
dollars maintain those graveyards in France, Holland and 
Belgium. There is even a Canadian gravesite just over the border 
in Germany.
<P>
	They are beautifully maintained. It makes us realize how 
lucky we are to be Canadians. Canadians died so that you and I 
can sit in the House of Commons, be free and be free to speak. It 
is part of our history and it is something that we must not lose.
<P>
	Would we have a national orchestra or a national film library, 
and I could go on and on, without federal assistance? Of course 
not. They could not possibly operate without financial 
assistance from the federal government.
<P>
	It is our responsibility to encourage artists, whether music, 
sports or whatever. They need to have the opportunity to develop 
their talents so that you and I and future generations have the 
opportunity to dwell on the importance to this nation of the 
contributions of those people who have gone before us.
<P>
	In my riding of Nepean we have the Centrepointe Theatre 
which is a 1,000 seat theatre comparable in size to the National 
Arts Centre theatre. I look at the operation of that theatre. It is 
operated by volunteers.
<P>
	The Centrepointe Theatre is not any different than any other 
organization. The National Arts Centre has volunteers, as does 
the National Museum. People in this country give their hearts 
and souls and their time to contribute to these institutions.
<P>
	Has anyone been to Washington or a state capital recently? Do 
members know how Americans promote their heritage? It is 
front and centre every day of the week in school. They are 
constantly there with buildings and monuments to retain their 
heritage. I did not hear  one positive statement from the Reform 
Party on heritage.
<P>
	The government appreciates that there are some concerns 
about the decision to divide responsibility for broadcasting and 
telecommunications between Canadian Heritage and Industry 
Canada. The inclusion of telecommunications in the 
department's industry portfolio recognizes the increasing role 
of telecommunications.
<P>
	On the other hand, broadcasting fits more closely with the 
identity of culture and the Canadian content mandate of the 
Canadian heritage. Canadians know that the government is 
committed to fiscal responsibility in all areas of federal 
endeavour. Bill C-53 is a prime example of that.
<P>
	By putting these five ministries into one, we are looking at the 
bottom line. The Reform Party can take comfort in the 
knowledge that for the upcoming year the Canadian heritage 
portfolio is saving $76.1 million. That is a significant amount of 
money.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	In addition to these actual savings of money there will be 
other longer term efficiencies realized through the regrouping of 
the areas of responsibility from various departments. Broadly 
speaking, the Canadian heritage minister will work for the 
betterment of our country in matters relating to Canadian 
identity and values, cultural development, heritage and areas of 
natural or historical significance to this nation.
<P>

	The House resumed from October 20 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-54, an act to amend the Old Age  Security 
Act, the Canada Pension Plan, the Children's Special 
Allowances Act and the Unemployment Insurance Act, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee; and of the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
consider it a privilege to spend a few minutes discussing the 
provisions of Bill C-54 which deals with overpayment of old 
age security benefits and a time bar on the recovery of these 
overpayments.
<P>
	This provision points out the challenges of administering our 
income security programs which comprise an extremely large 
enterprise, one which is vital to the well-being of more than six 
million Canadians.
<P>
	To manage effectively a program that provides more than $20 
billion a year to six million clients is challenging enough but the 
Government of Canada must also maintain the reputation of the 
income security programs as effective, efficient and equitable. 
After all the purpose of the old age security and other benefits is 
to help provide Canadians with a just reward for a lifetime of 
work and service to family, community and society.
<P>
	The old age security program is designed to assist those 
whose retirement income is minimal or even non-existent. It is 
designed to contain elements that alleviate poverty among 
senior citizens. Inevitably with such an extremely large group of 
programs there will be anomalies. People may receive more than 
their entitlement. People may receive less than they are entitled 
to.
<P>
	A vital part of administering these funds of such formidable 
size is to remedy abnormalities in a manner which is effective, 
equitable and, where appropriate, compassionate.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	The Old Age Security Act contains restrictions which prohibit 
the recovery of substantial overpaid amounts and allow clients 
to retain unlawful gains. The act restricts the recovery of some 
overpayments aside from those arising from fraud or wilful 
misrepresentation. Collection can be made only for access 
moneys received in the current fiscal year plus the full previous 
fiscal year.
<P>
	This is not the case with the Canada Pension Plan. It allows 
overpayments to be recovered regardless of the timeframe. The 
proposed amendment to the Old Age Security Act reads exactly 
this way: ``Where a person has received or obtained a benefit 
payment to which the person is not entitled or a benefit payment 
in excess of the amount, the benefit payment to which the person 
is entitled, the amount of that benefit payment or the excess 
amount, as the case may be, constitutes a debt due to Her 
Majesty''.
<P>
	This provision amends the Old Age Security Act to remove 
timeframe restrictions for recovery of overpaid moneys 
including payments for guaranteed income security and 
spouse's allowance. The change will provide greater 
accountability to the taxpayer and allow equal treatment of 
clients of old age security and the Canada Pension Plan.
<P>
	Under this change the minister will have the discretion to 
collect the entire amount overpaid to a client rather than a 
limited amount. However, in keeping with the policies and 
practices of the income security programs there would be no 
change to the existing authority to remit overpayments in 
various cases. These would include cases of hardship where 
administrative costs exceed the debt or where the debt cannot be 
collected within the foreseeable future.
<P>
	Another new amendment incorporated in Bill C-54 will 
extend the minister's authority to remit overpayments where 
there was administrative error or erroneous advice. As a result 
of this amendment, recoveries of incorrectly paid funds are 
estimated to be approximately $1 million to $2 million every 
year.
<P>
	I should mention that the time restriction has never applied in 
situations where charges of fraud were laid and proved but of 
course there are only a handful of cases of that type. 
Nevertheless, this amendment will enhance the ability of 
government to administer the old age security program in 
keeping with justice and equity.
<P>
	No concerned Canadian wants to deny old age security 
benefits to a senior citizen who is deserving and in a difficult 
financial situation. Nothing in this proposed amendment will 
change that. The removal of this time restriction on recovery 
brings the old age security provisions into line with those of the 
Canada Pension Plan and the Unemployment Insurance Act.
<P>
	Earlier in this debate the hon. member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve commented that the government will 
collect debts incurred 15 years ago on the basis of erroneous 
advice from the department. This comment does not recognize 
the minister's ability expanded in this Bill C-54 to forgive 
overpayments incurred in such circumstances.
<P>
	These amendments taken together will provide the minister 
with the flexibility to forgive overpayments where that is 
merited and to pursue the recovery of overpayments where that 
is merited. That is surely what is desired as opposed to the 
previous rules which were arbitrary and inconsistent with other 
government programs.
<P>
	Where administrators have made errors, overpayments are to 
be forgiven. Where persons have made incorrect claims, 
overpayments are to be recovered. However, the government is 
determined to merit the reputation of the income security 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7385"> 7385 </A></B>
<P>
programs as programs that respect both the taxpayer who 
provides these millions in benefits and the pensioner who 
deserves to be treated with sensitivity and dignity.
<P>
	The old age security program is designed to help those who 
really need help. Through supplements, it is intended to help 
those senior citizens whose income is low. With more than six 
million people benefiting from all income security programs, 
there are bound to be anomalies.
<P>
	I want to again stress that a vital part of administering these 
large sums of such formidable size is to remedy anomalies in a 
manner which is efficient, equitable and where appropriate 
compassionate. The amendment to remove time barriers to 
recover overpayments is an important provision and another 
reason why Bill C-54 merits the support of all members of this 
place.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to congratulate my hon. colleague on his introduction 
to Bill C-54.
<P>
	I too rise in support of Bill C-54 and I want to start by talking 
a little about some of the problems with how government in the 
past has managed pension programs in general. There are a lot of 
pension programs that exist in this country today.
<P>
	We have to have a complete understanding. There really is not 
anything any more important than looking after our seniors 
today, for they cannot and will not get jobs as we are trying to get 
for our young people. They generally would not be retrained into 
our society. They are not going for extra education and these are 
the people really who deserve a secure retirement.
<P>
	One of the members opposite is referring to himself. I think 
we will look after him too and I will talk a little about the MPs 
pension plan in a few minutes and we will see how well we will 
look after him in the future.
<P>
	These are the people who really deserve a secure retirement 
because they have earned it through paying taxes and through 
paying into the CPP and so on. I guess we have to ask here 
whether the government and that other party from Jurassic Park 
have really looked after the welfare of senior citizens of the past. 
When we talk about changes to old age security, CPP and so on 
in the future we are going to have to get into looking at some 
new, constructive ideas because as most people in this country 
know money is becoming of short supply for those kinds of 
programs and they are going to have to be dealt with.
<P>
	I have some difficulty in getting some confidence that this 
government will deal with these programs in a new, modern, 
constructive way. This is after all a traditional party of which we 
have one left in the House. Traditional ideas we thought were 
going to be gone in years past and for the future are ideas like the 
Senate. The better part of this country today is asking that we 
have elected senators, that they be effective and that we have 
equal representation in provinces. Yet this government still 
provides the patronage appointments to which most Canadians 
are opposed.
<P>
	We talk time and time again about the MP pension plan. 
Virtually not a month goes by in this House when we do not 
complain about it. Yet no changes have been made. We are 
talking about tradition and how we get a government like this, a 
traditional party, to move ahead and make some constructive 
changes in CPP and old age security. We are running out of time 
on some of these programs and they really have to move ahead; 
laws and legislation like in the Young Offenders Act where the 
whole country really wants this traditional party here to move 
ahead with them and make tougher constructive changes. It has 
failed to do it time and time again.
<P>
	What we have here I fear is another traditional party that is 
dealing with non-traditional problems like old age security and 
CPP which have to be changed.
<P>
	Why would we expect this government to come up with new 
ideas? I guess maybe we do not and that is what we are here for. 
That is why we have come to this House, to try to infiltrate some 
changes throughout the system.
<P>
	Old age security is what is called a non-contributory 
program. Individuals do not contribute to it. It comes from tax 
revenue. On one hand one might assume that we could cut that 
out because people had not contributed to it. That is not the fact. 
Over the years all the taxes paid into the government have been 
used in part to fund old age security which is good in measure. 
That will have to change somehow unless the government finds 
some revenue either by raising taxes, and we hope it does not do 
that, or cutting expenses and we know it is not doing that.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	The Canada pension plan is the contributory portion of 
pension for Canadians where the employer and the employee 
contribute.
<P>
	To address old age security and CPP and future changes we 
must look at how the government manages its current pension 
plans. We know what they are. They are the MP pension plan, the 
military pension plan, the civil service pension plan and the 
RCMP pension plan. There are a number of them. Those plans 
should be covered under the Pension Benefits Standards Act. 
This act sets standards for pension plans in this country on the 
financing and the fund management. It was introduced in 1967 
and amended by the Conservatives in 1987. The plan has four 
very good standards which actually should apply to all pension 
plans.
<P>
	The first one is that the employers must ensure that dollars are 
held in trust. This is very basic and necessary for any pension 
plan. A pension fund administrator shall be put in place 
managed by a board, an organization that is charge of the fund. 
The administrator must be responsible for appointing somebody 
for accountability and then the fund must be prudently invested. 
It 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7386"> 7386 </A></B>
<P>
stands to reason that is the only way a good pension plan could 
be managed.
<P>
	However, these standards that were in the standards act were 
intended to protect the interests of the plan members. Not 
surprising, however, Parliament exempted the federal 
government from these rules. Here we go with this kind of 
sanctimony. We will look after everybody else but ourselves. 
When this act came in and was modified in 1987, Parliament 
said that is okay for everybody else but we will not get involved 
in that portion, we will exempt ourselves from it. It did, with the 
military, civil service, RCMP and MP pension plans.
<P>
	Consequently, there are problems with those plans. I am going 
to illustrate from these four plans what is wrong with the 
management and the ability to fund old age security and CPP.
<P>
	The problem with that particular exemption is that total 
pension payments exceed the contributions. When you exempt 
yourself from these rules you start to go into the hole. You start 
into deficits. That we know is where we stand today. Today we 
have total liabilities for RCMP, military and civil service 
pension plans of $94 billion, unfunded. It is carried in an 
account on the books of the government as an SPA, I believe, a 
special purpose account. It is a liability. It is not funded in trust 
as the Pension Benefits Standards Act so directs everybody else 
to do.
<P>
	We pay out about $6 billion to these three organizations, the 
military, civil service and RCMP. That comes directly from 
general revenues paid by the taxpayer.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I regret that at this stage 
in debate on this particular piece of legislation members are 
entitled to 10 minutes without questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is too 
bad. I just got warmed up. I have not even had an opportunity to 
tell the government what I think of it today. I only did that 
yesterday.
<P>
	We have to work on old age security and CPP, make no 
mistake about it with this government, and RRSPs as well.
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	I am advising the government now to keep away from taxing 
RRSPs. It may be the one very good livelihood senior citizens 
have in this country. After 20 years of spending money 
carelessly by both Liberals and Conservatives there are very few 
dollars left in those pots to fund other pensions.
<P>
	If that bank is broke, which it is, what has to happen here is 
that old age security and CPP must be the number one priority 
for funding. That means the government should attend to the 
Pension Benefits Standards Act, try to get these in trust and try 
to get them funded.

	To my mind this is one of the most important bills that we may 
be discussing in this Parliament because it is a very small but 
important step in restoring confidence in the system and 
restoring trust in politicians.
<P>
	I am particularly pleased to rise and speak on this bill today 
because I recall it as being one of the major reasons why I joined 
the Reform Party in reading over its policies and positions on 
political reform and on freer votes, referenda, citizens' 
initiative, recall.
<P>
	Back in 1990 when I first was exposed to those policies they 
rang very true with me. I said yes indeed that is what is wrong 
with this country of ours today. Politicians have lost touch with 
the people they are representing and the system is in great 
disrepute.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	Recall is one part of political reform, but as I said earlier, it is 
a very important step in the direction to make politicians more 
accountable to the people who voted them into office. 
Referendums can encourage the common sense of the common 
people to be brought to bear on some of the major issues we are 
and will be facing in this 35th Parliament.
<P>
	Canadians have lost faith in the system. They have lost trust in 
the politicians. The results of the last election in having 205 new 
members of Parliament elected to this House speaks very clearly 
to the feelings of the Canadian voters that there must be change. 
They are not happy with the status quo and we have to have some 
new directions.
<P>
	Consider Meech Lake, followed by the Spicer commission, 
followed by the Charlottetown accord. During that period these 
things indicated very clearly that Canadians were saying: ``We 
want change; we are not happy with the direction governments 
have been going in''.
<P>
	This applies particularly when I reflect on the Charlottetown 
accord. All major governments were supporting it; all of the 
major press were supporting it. However, the Canadian people 
saw through it and said: ``No, this is not a good idea. This is not a 
good move''. They rejected it. It was to the utter disbelief of the 
parties that the Canadian voters would stand up, see through the 
smoke-screen being presented to them and say: ``No, this is not 
what we want. We have not had a voice in this process''.
<P>
	That was a turning point in Canadian politics and it was a 
turning point for the better. Politics in Canada will never be the 
same. The problem is that once credibility is lost, it is extremely 
difficult to get it back. Talk is not enough. It takes action. This 
bill is going to provide some action, a step in that direction. 
Changes must be made.
<P>
	I recall when I was campaigning. The door to door experience 
I have described was frightening. At door after door I am sure 
other members as well as myself were being met with the same 
reaction: ``I am absolutely fed up with what has been going on 
up there in Ottawa. Why should I believe you? You are here at 
the door telling me what you want me to believe, what you think 
I want to hear. But you will go to Ottawa and you will do exactly 
as you are told, just as has been going on for years. I am fed up 
with it''.
<P>
	I encountered that at door after door. That level of cynicism 
really was disturbing. In a way it reinforced my desire to get 
involved in the system and hopefully bring about the change 
needed to restore the level of confidence that has been so sadly 
lacking.
<P>
	I am building a case for the mistrust and the cynicism that is 
out there with the voters. I want to read some quotes from the 
very famous red book because it has been played so often during 
this first sitting. There are those who would suggest that the red 
book should have started out with the phrase once upon a time, 
but it does contain the odd pearl of wisdom.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to quote some of them. 
They will reinforce exactly what I am saying today in support of 
recall. On page 91 under ``Governing with Integrity'':
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Canadians have always prided themselves on the quality of their democratic 
institutions. Yet after nine years of Conservative rule, cynicism about public 
institutions, governments, politicians, and the political process is at an all-time 
high. If government is to play a positive role in society, as it must, honesty and 
integrity in our political institutions must be restored.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The most important asset of government is the confidence it enjoys of the 
citizens to whom it is accountable. There is evidence today of considerable 
dissatisfaction with government and a steady erosion of confidence in the 
people and institutions of the public sector.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This erosion of confidence seems to have many causes: some have to do with 
the behaviour of certain elected politicians, others with an arrogant style of 
political leadership. The people are irritated with governments that do not 
consult them, or that disregard their views, or that try to conduct key parts of 
public business behind closed doors.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	On page 92 under ``Parliamentary Reform'' it states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the House of Commons, a Liberal government will give MPs a greater role 
in drafting legislation, through House of Commons committees. These 
committees will also be given greater influence over government expenditures. 
More free votes will be allowed in the House of Commons, and individual 
members of Parliament will be involved in an effective prebudget consultation 
process. We will establish mechanisms to permit parliamentary review of some 
senior order in council appointments.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7388"> 7388 </A></B>
<P>
A lot of talk so far but little in the way of action.
<P>
	Let me now go to page 93 under the title ``Perspectives''. This 
quote that is in the red book was actually taken from the Public 
Policy Forum, 1993:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Given the sustained and often angry criticism that has been widely expressed 
by the public in recent years, it is remarkable how little has been done by way of 
reform. Of all the grounds on which successive governments, together with MPs, 
could be charged with being unresponsive, none is more striking than the lack of 
response to unmistakable expressions of public dislike of the manner in which 
Parliament goes about its business. If Canadian parliamentarians are unwilling to 
effect changes, they must be prepared to accept a further loss of public regard. If, 
however, they are now ready to embrace reform, there are a number of avenues 
open to them.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The last quote is from page 93 of the red book. The source is 
the Royal Commission on Electoral Reform and Party Financing 
of 1992. It is entitled ``Political Cynicism in Canada''.
<P>
	I will read out the quote and the percentage who agree with the 
statement: ``I don't think that the government cares much what 
people like me think''; 72 per cent agreed with that statement. 
``Generally, those elected to Parliament soon lose touch with the 
people''; 79 per cent agreed with that statement. ``Most 
candidates in federal elections make campaign promises they 
have no intention of fulfilling''; 82 per cent. ``Most members of 
Parliament care deeply about the problems of ordinary people''; 
62 per cent. ``Most members of Parliament make a lot of money 
misusing public office''; 64 per cent.
<P>
	The problems we have had with the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage this week illustrate there is a problem. Unfortunately, 
the government missed a great opportunity this week to show it 
meant to restore integrity and honesty to government. By not 
taking fast and appropriate action it has lost the credibility that 
is so heralded in its famous red book.
<P>
	Let us get back to recall. Is there identified support for recall? 
There is a very definite yes in answer to that question. In 
October 1991 the province of British Columbia had a vote on 
whether to support recall and 81 per cent of the voters in that 
province responded in favour of recall. In the March 1994 
Gallup poll 75 per cent of Canadians said yes to recall. In the 
province of Quebec 70 per cent supported recall. In the province 
of Ontario 78 per cent supported recall.
<P>
	Let us go now to the question of party affiliation relative to 
the question of supporting recall. Liberal supporters, 76 per cent 
endorsed recall. BQ supporters, 76 per cent supported recall. 
Indeed, there is very strong support for recall.
<P>
	In the first week of Parliament the need for recall was 
demonstrated by what happened in the riding of 
Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville. The member was not 
good enough for the Liberal Party and was thrown out. The 
people in that riding now have no member or no way of getting at 
their member. Just this morning I presented another petition in 
the House with hundreds of  names on it requesting that 
Parliament do something about this inability for constituents to 
get at a member who is not representing them.
<P>
	I cannot understand this reluctance toward recall. I can only 
assume it is because members have not received the message 
that the voters want change. That has been demonstrated so 
clearly. They are still out of touch with voters. The people who 
pay our wages, our bosses, are telling us and demanding that 
change be made.
<P>
	I spoke about the Spicer commission because it reinforces a 
lot of what I was saying. The final chapter in that report was not 
written by Mr. Spicer or any of his commissioners, but by one of 
the Canadians who was interviewed. What he said was: ``No 
hyperbole or political hedge can screen any member of any 
legislature who thwarts the will of the people on this matter. The 
voters are watching and waiting''. I think they are waiting for 
recall.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I welcome this opportunity to speak in the debate 
on the proposed act to provide for the recall of members of the 
House of Commons. This bill is a good example of an idea that 
has its merits but does not quite make it. The purpose is to ensure 
that the member is worthy of the mandate he received from his 
constituents. The problem has been with us since the beginnings 
of the democratic system. We have seen this in the past in many 
countries, and though people have tried to find a solution, they 
have failed to come up with satisfactory answers. In countries 
where recall exists, it very seldom occurs, but there are also 
some outlandish situations.
<P>
	If we consider the bill before the House today, I will explain 
why I said it does not quite make it. It is certainly not attractive 
in its present form because, among other things, it opens the 
door to all kinds of political intrigue. I will give an example. If 
this bill is passed, it would give more power to party 
organizations. Take for instance, a riding where a member was 
elected with less than 50 per cent of the vote, or the case of an 
independent member, like, for instance our colleague here in the 
House who represents the riding of Beauce. I am not saying that 
politicians might actually do this, but the parties might get 
together and decide to start a petition to challenge a seat held by 
an independent member, who would not have the same political 
clout as these parties, and a new election would be called, not to 
challenge the performance of the member but just to win another 
seat. And this may have important repercussions, one way or 
another.
<P>
	What started out as a good intention expressed by the Reform 
Party could have unacceptable consequences like giving even 
more weight to the party machine at the expense of the member 
representing his or her riding. In addition, according to the 
current legal interpretation of the political party financing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7389"> 7389 </A></B>
<P>
legislation, if this act  providing for the recall of members of the 
House of Commons went into effect, it would become an 
appalling form of lobbying for those who finance political 
parties, and who are not necessarily individuals. For example, 
companies, banks or unions on the other side of the fence could 
decide in a given situation to make a member lose his seat, not 
because of poor performance but because his ideas are different 
from theirs. In this regard, our legislation governing political 
party financing is not tight enough at the present time to allow us 
to put in place a concept such as the recall of members.
<P>
	Another perverse element which is not in the legislation must 
be avoided, namely the systematic use of recall to remove 
members from the House. This bill provides that such petitions 
can be accepted 18 months after an election. Politicians could 
easily make systematic efforts to question the mandates of 
members from the other party, from the other side of the House, 
thus creating instability which is totally inconsistent with the 
goals and objectives of our parliamentary system. We cannot 
afford to transfer to a parliamentary system such as ours ideas 
which may have been successful in a different type of system but 
which would not have the same effect here. I think that these 
perverse effects must be avoided at all cost.
<P>
	Something else to keep in mind is that we must not 
over-legislate, and in this regard I think that the Reform Party is 
contradicting itself. You do not solve a problem by passing a law 
and damming every little stream. In this Parliament, if the 
mandate of one or two individuals should be reconsidered 
because of something they did, I think that it is not necessary to 
pass a law that would have a major effect on the parliamentary 
system and the electoral system and unpredictable negative 
effects.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	My colleague from the Reform Party just gave the example of 
Charlottetown. If we had had such a law when the Charlottetown 
Accord failed and all of Canada started to recall all the members 
who had spoken in favour of that horrible agreement, I feel that 
we would have had a constitutional crisis and an even more 
obvious parliamentary crisis, especially since about a year 
passed between the Charlottetown Accord and the next federal 
election, the same time it would have taken to come up with 
something to challenge the mandates of the people who had been 
elected.
<P>
	So, this solution does not seem viable, in my view. It does not 
seem like an appropriate solution to the problem which may be 
created by a member of Parliament who does not properly fulfill 
his mandate. Other forms of representations can be made and 
actions can be taken by the constituents, without jeopardizing 
someone's mandate because of his ideas.
<P>
	Let us not forget too that we sometimes have free votes on 
moral issues and on bills. Some pressure groups could 
conceivably resort to the recall process because of just one issue 
representing a very minor part of the work done by a member.
<P>
	I also want to say a word on the short text-some 200 
words-to justify the application for recall. We are in politics. 
We see the same reality from different perspectives. That text 
could take different forms and be subject to various 
interpretations, thus generating an instability which is not 
appropriate, considering that, in the next few years, Parliament 
will have to consider major constitutional changes.
<P>
	It is because of the strength of our parliamentary 
institutions-and this must be recognized-that a party seeking 
a radical transformation of our country's political structure, can 
come here and express its views. We must ensure that this 
democratic process continues to exist. Indeed, that institution is 
still the best democratic tool available.
<P>
	Let me mention a few issues which I consider more urgent 
regarding MPs' mandate. I already said it, but I will repeat it 
now: We must first ensure that we have a political party 
financing process act which is airtight. We must ensure that only 
individuals, and not corporate entities, can make contributions 
to a political party.
<P>
	When you look at the list of the people who are presently 
contributing to the financing of political parties like the one 
currently in power or, in the past, the Conservative Party or any 
other party that is satisfied with following the letter of the law, 
you realize why their hands are tied in so many situations. You 
understand why, in the social program reform for example, 
government action is much more limited and softer than what 
the public expected. This is because this party's financial 
backers, if not handed control, at least exercise moral influence 
over it. When these backers are banks, unions, corporate bodies, 
the voters are not a priority and, in that sense, the intent of the 
Representation Act is distorted. Therefore, it appears to me that 
legislation to that effect is much more urgently required.
<P>
	The second element on which I believe it appropriate to move 
very quickly is to make sure that when people are elected, they 
come here with a clear, well-defined mandate and that they 
respect it. In politics, people are always right in the end. We live 
in a society in which-the Conservative Party of Canada can 
attest to that-if political parties retreat in their ivory tower and 
forget about the people who brought them to power, they 
eventually pay dearly for it. In our political system, a four- to 
five-year term of office seems very reasonable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7390"> 7390 </A></B>
<P>
	Each one of us, the 205 new members, knows it to be true. If, 
after 18 months in office, we were asked to perform as 
efficiently as those who have been fortunate enough to be here 
for two, three or four years, it would render the system less 
efficient. Contrary to the Reform Party's objective, this would 
further diminish voter confidence in the institutions which 
represent them.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	To conclude, I would say that what we have here is the age-old 
problem of democratic representation by delegation. It has been 
with us for a long time. The solution we are being offered is not 
the right one. I believe that we should give it some more thought. 
This bill should be dropped and instead we should start a 
reflection on a priority issue, the financing of political parties.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today to participate in the 
debate on Bill C-210 proposed by the member for Beaver River 
respecting the recall act.
<P>
	In trying to find why we would need a bill such as this one in 
place in Canadian politics, I asked the Library of Parliament to 
do some research and give me examples of corruption and 
situations that may have been prevented if we had recall 
legislation like the one before us. I was amazed. My fax machine 
burned up for about a half hour with all the examples the library 
was sending me.
<P>
	A December 30 article in the <I>Ottawa Citizen</I> refers to 18 
members and ministers on the Liberal side of the House and on 
the Conservative side of the House who were implicated in such 
corruption. There was also more evidence in a June 28 article 
that reads: ``Two PC MPs leave caucus pending probe, an RCMP 
investigation into the misuse of federal funds''.
<P>
	Another article that caught my eye states: ``Prime Minister 
Kim Campbell has inherited the mandate of one of the most 
corrupt governments in Canadian history. Seldom have so many 
been caught doing so much for themselves''.
<P>
	These are examples of some of the things. I found it totally 
outrageous that the Canadian public has put up with nonsense 
like corruption charges against members, forged documents, 
shoplifting, kickback deals, ministers accepting $2.5 million in 
loans from a friend who just happened to be a government 
contractor, questionable land deals, lavish spending while on 
government trips abroad financed by the taxpayer and conflict 
of interest charges. The Canadian public demands more from 
elected representatives.
<P>
	Recall is the power of the people to petition for the holding of 
an election on the recall, the removal of a member of 
Parliament. It was first used in the American Articles of 
Confederation of 1777 and recall currently exists in 15 
American states. We hear criticism that if recall were in place 
we would have massive amounts of  tie-ups in the process 
because of all the numbers that would be coming forward to the 
House.
<P>
	From the best count I have been able to make of recall in the 
United States, I could only find seven state representatives, one 
state senator, two elected state cabinet officials and one 
governor. They are rather low figures and nothing to get too 
concerned about.
<P>
	With accountability and open government high on the 
Canadian taxpayers' agenda, recall is direct popular 
participation in the administration of the law. No position 
should be considered too lofty or too dignified for this type of 
action. The position of a member of Parliament exists for and is 
financed by the people of Canada. The people should be able to 
remove any incumbent whose performance they consider 
unsatisfactory. The people should be able to remove any 
unsatisfactory MP or minister without turfing the whole 
governing party out of office.
<P>
	One hon. member just mentioned a few minutes ago the red 
book. There are certain quotes in the red book that are pertinent 
to this. The red book on page 91 states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If government is to play a positive role in society, as it must, honesty and 
integrity in political institutions must be restored.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This erosion of confidence seems to have many causes: some have to do with 
the behaviour of certain elected politicians, others with an arrogant style of 
political leadership.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
	It would seem in principle that the Liberal Party is supportive 
of direct democracy in government.
<P>
	Adopting recall is a way of introducing into the 
administration of the law the kind of democratic control that 
citizens' initiatives and referenda could bring to the making of 
law. Recall introduces a deterrent to and, as a last resort, a cure 
for arrogance, bias, corruption or incompetence among elected 
officials.
<P>
	If the people had the power of recall we would not have an 
abusive MP pension plan. We would not have patronage. We 
would not have outrageous perks. We would not have an ear for 
special interest groups. We would not have cabinet ministers 
abusing their power as we have seen in the last couple of days.
<P>
	If the people had the power through recall legislation we 
would have a higher public opinion of elected officials. We 
would have more accountability in government. We would have 
MPs representing their constituents instead of toeing the party 
line.
<P>
	By passing Bill C-210 history will show that we did restore 
public confidence in government. To restore confidence in this 
place we must move toward a truly democratic system. We must 
be accountable in supporting Bill C-210 and introducing recall. 
Thereby we will establish the power of the people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7391"> 7391 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us examine the democratic option of recall and discuss its 
potential impact on the Canadian system of government and its 
electorate. Recall is a procedure that allows the voters to call 
their representatives to account before the end of their normal 
term, at a time of the voters choosing.
<P>
	This has been criticized in some arenas but before the House 
affairs committee on September 7 there was testimony by Dr. 
Peter McCormick, a political scientist from the University of 
Lethbridge, as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I think we have to reject the argument that voters would be discarding 
representatives every second week, that there would be recalls going on endlessly 
and constantly. In a democracy it should not be necessary to belabour this point. If 
we can trust the electors to show some wisdom and some judgment in electing 
people in the first place, surely it is not unreasonable to say that they will exercise 
similar wisdom and judgment in how often and to what purpose they use recall. If 
we cannot trust them to use recall then it is not clear why we trusted them to do the 
electing in the first place.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The recall process outlined in Bill C-210 essentially involves 
three stages: an application for recall, a recall petition and 
finally a byelection. I do not want to spend too much time on the 
actual workings of the bill because I do not have that much time. 
However I would like to talk a bit about the safety valves that are 
included in the bill.
<P>
	First, the Clerk of the House will not accept a recall petition 
until the grace period of 18 months has passed since the last 
election, which applies both to newly elected and re-elected 
MPs. In the case of newly elected members, they would have a 
reasonable chance to establish a record of representing and 
serving their constituents.
<P>
	Second, a recall petition can only be made once in a 
constituency during the life of an elected Parliament. This 
would prevent an MP being repeatedly harassed by an organized 
special interest group.
<P>
	Third, the petitioners' official agent must report all 
contributions and expenditures related to the group's recall 
campaign, including a list of all people who made financial 
donations, thus limiting the lobbyist factor.
<P>
	Fourth, the safety valve is the time limit for collection of 
recall petition signatures. This ensures that the issue that 
triggered the petition remains alive and significant for the later 
stages of the process.
<P>
	Fifth, as an added precaution Bill C-210 incorporates several 
clauses that would ensure the official agent is operating above 
board by instituting an offence punishable on a summary 
conviction.
<P>
	In closing I quote the words of Edmund Burke in his 1774 
speech to the electors of Bristol:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It ought to be the happiness and glory of a representative to live in the 
strictest union, the closest correspondence and the most unreserved 
communication with his constituents.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion high respect; 
their business unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his 
pleasure, his satisfaction, to theirs; and above all, ever and in all cases, to prefer 
their interests to his own.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1400) </B>
<P>
	I urge all the members of this place to support Bill C-210.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure for me to stand in support of my colleague's bill 
today.
<P>
	I want to say that I am very dismayed that none of the 
government members opposite has the courage to stand and talk 
about the concept of recall in this House.
<P>
	As my colleague from Simcoe Centre has already stated, this 
is a measure that has very high support among the Canadian 
electorate. In other words, Canadians want us to be subject to 
recall. The members of this government will not even talk about 
it and that is a shame and not in the interests of Canadians.
<P>
	Really the purpose of a recall mechanism is that Canadian 
democracy would benefit from the increased accountability of 
elected officials. Once again this week we have seen how very 
unaccountable elected representatives really are.
<P>
	This government talks so loudly about integrity in 
government and how it was going to put a watchdog in place that 
would be accountable to Parliament. What has it done to provide 
for accountability of elected officials? What it has done is 
appoint a lapdog that is answerable only to the Prime Minister 
and is now being used as kind of a Delphic oracle when the 
Prime Minister needs some words of wisdom from a deep source 
to justify his actions.
<P>
	Canadians are not satisfied with the level of accountability 
that their elected officials have. It needs to be corrected.
<P>
	This idea of holding elected representatives accountable by 
some recall mechanism is certainly not something that has just 
been dreamed up by a few strange people in this country. The 
whole concept originated in ancient Athens which was the 
birthplace of democracy.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I want 
to draw to your attention and to the attention of the House that 
the member speaking has commented on the participation of the 
government in this debate, suggesting it is some kind of 
cowardice that prevents us from speaking on this bill.
<P>
	In this hour of debate we have chosen to leave the debate to 
the Reform Party hoping that it will display through it speeches 
how foolish an idea this is.

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. With the greatest 
of respect I do not believe at this point that we have a point of 
order.
<P>
	I was attentive to the remarks of the hon. member with regard 
to the issue raised by the government deputy whip but I conclude 
that there is no point of order and I ask the member for Calgary 
North to resume her intervention.
<P>
	I do not know that there was a point of order. It is a matter of 
debate. At this point the floor has been granted to the hon. 
member for Calgary North.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I hope that the government will 
engage in debate on this issue as time goes on.
<P>
	In the birthplace of democracy in Athens, the accountability 
of elected officials was through a process of recall which was by 
way of ostracizing wayward politicians. Wayward politicians 
were ostracized and not allowed to participate in public life and 
they were also sometimes exiled from the country.
<P>
	I think a lot of Canadians would feel that we should go right 
back to original democratic principles sometimes.
<P>
	Also recall has been a facet of the Swiss system since before 
its formal adoption in the 19th century. In the 19th century recall 
was by another name.

	It was known as the imperative mandate. It is a device 
whereby elected officials can be subjected at any time to the 
review of the people who put them in office and I would suggest 
that this makes eminent sense in light of what democracy really 
is.
<P>
	I remind Canadians again that democracy is rule by the 
people. We are simply the representatives of the people here in 
this Chamber. We are here because they have chosen us, given us 
the honour and the responsibility to represent their concerns, 
their wishes and their interests and carry them out on their 
behalf.
<P>
	A lot of times Canadians feel that once elected, 
representatives simply disconnect from the people who put them 
in place, pay the bills and whose future is affected by their 
decisions.
<P>
	I would also point out that recall is truly democratic because 
citizens can only recall their own representative, not someone 
else's. It is the people who put a representative in place, who 
have the wisdom to elect that representative in the first place, 
who should be able to have the say as to whether that 
representative continues in the position where the electors have 
put them.
<P>
	I want to point out to members of this House that every other 
Canadian is subject to recall. If you are in a job or a position and 
you do not do it properly you will be booted out. You will be 
replaced. You will be given a pink slip. Yet somehow 295 
Canadians who have a very important job, a very critical job, a 
job on which hangs the future and the well-being of thousands 
and thousands  of Canadians, feel that somehow they should not 
be subject to the same type of representation and accountability 
and recall as every other Canadian. This simply does not make 
sense and it should be rectified.
<P>
	People are cynical and disrespectful of politicians because 
they do not open themselves up to this evaluation. It is an axiom 
that if you want trust from others you must trust them in 
response. We hear this all the time when we are counselled about 
dealing with our children, dealing with staff in management 
situations and in all facets of human relationships. Mutual trust 
is so important.
<P>
	Yet it appears that members of this House are not prepared to 
entrust their future and evaluation of their performance and of 
the adequacy of what they are doing to the Canadian public. This 
does not make sense and we need to re-examine our belief in the 
common sense of the people who elected us in the first place.
<P>
	When we asked the Prime Minister of this present government 
about his support for the concept of recall his response was that 
Canadians have the ability to recall their representative in an 
election.
<P>
	Canadians know well that a general election is not the most 
effective time for a performance review because that is the time 
when so many issues are at stake with not only individual 
representatives but really the party and the leadership. Other 
kinds of programs and policies are on the table. A performance 
review is such a very small part of all of the factors that electors 
have to weigh at the time of an election that it is not fair to say 
that is the definitive moment when electors should be deciding 
whether a particular candidate is satisfactory.
<P>
	MP recall, I believe, would dramatically change the 
sensitivity of MPs to issues by shifting the balance from parties 
to people and that is where it really belongs. If a backbench MP 
could say to the government whip and to the front benches ``I am 
sorry, I would like to support this measure. I know you are 
telling me to but if I do I am going to get turfed out back home 
because this is simply not supported by the people I represent'', 
think of how much healthier it would be and how much more 
meaningful real legislation would be if it had to have the real 
support of the people we speak for and vote for.
<P>
	That would be one of the healthiest changes we could bring to 
do something to really address the issues of the country in a 
meaningful way, in a way that meets with the approval of the 
people we represent.
<P>
<B>(1410 ) </B>
<P>
	There are so many reasons why we need to have the courage 
and the faith in the Canadian public to bring forward these direct 
democracy measures that I urge this House to reconsider, 
especially members on the other side, their resistance to moving 
in this direction and to support my colleague's bill on recall of 
representatives.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7393"> 7393 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
accept your ruling on the point of order. However inadvertently I 
do believe that the member who just spoke has provided some 
incorrect information to the House and I do want to put on record 
a correction in the context of speaking on the motion of the 
member for Beaver River.
<P>
	The member has suggested that Liberal members of 
Parliament are somehow avoiding this debate. To this point an 
equal number of Liberal and Reform Party members have 
spoken in this debate. It is an ongoing debate. It is not just this 
particular hour. Four Liberal members of Parliament spoke on 
the issue and four Reform members of Parliament spoke on the 
issue.
<P>
	I think that indicates clearly our interest in this debate. 
Nonetheless, this issue of a recall is a matter of Reform Party 
policy and so today we did feel that we wanted to leave the floor 
to the members of the Reform Party to explain their policy to 
Canadians.
<P>
	However, having been challenged to enter the debate I am not 
going to by any means give up that opportunity.
<P>
	I have spoken on this issue before in this House but I am 
pleased to do so again if the Reform Party members do not wish 
to use the full-time we wanted to accord them the courtesy of.
<P>
	I have compared this legislation to a kind of instantaneous 
divorce and suggested that when I chose a spouse and I think 
when most people choose a spouse they do so very carefully and 
with great forethought, and they make a long term commitment 
to that relationship. Because it is a long term commitment, they 
tend to choose very carefully and take their choice very 
seriously and recognize that there will be in any relationship, a 
marriage or an elected representative, some good times and 
some bad times.
<P>
	As I said at that time, I am sure that in 33 years there have 
been many times when had instant divorce been available either 
my husband or I would have taken advantage of it. Looking back 
on 33 years we will conclude that all in all the good times 
outweighed the bad and we are glad we stuck with it.
<P>
	Participatory democracy is more than paying a buck to pick up 
the phone and register your opinion without the responsibility to 
engage in dialogue with others who perhaps have different 
opinions, or to consider other interests involved in the opinion 
you are expressing.
<P>
	It is very easy to selfishly say ``this is my opinion''. It is not so 
easy to say ``I have an opinion but I also want to know what the 
impact of that opinion is on other people. I want the opportunity 
to engage in dialogue with them about the pros and cons and the 
effects this will have on our society as a whole and, the bottom 
line, what is good for the country''.
<P>
	Members express a lot of concern about special interest 
groups. Frankly, one of my concerns about this legislation is that 
it does very much put members of  Parliament at the mercy of 
very special interest groups that have both the social standing 
and the economic means to organize to unseat a member of 
Parliament because they do not like a decision that member of 
Parliament made. This has happened in many jurisdictions 
around the world. Sometimes that special interest group is the 
military which manages to unseat a whole government with 
disastrous results for its society.
<P>
<B>(1415) </B>
<P>
	Recall in fact has the potential to produce a very selfish 
citizenry who look at every vote from the point of view of what 
is in their interest and whether the member is serving their 
interest. It is not: Is this member serving the interests of the 
community or the country at large? Is this member sensitive to 
interests that are not his or her own? Are they concerned not only 
about today but about tomorrow and the next generation? That is 
what we are here for. It is not to please people in the very short 
term. We are here to try and listen to our constituents and do 
what is best for them, for our country and for all citizens.
<P>
	This government has taken significant measures to ensure that 
in fact democracy is not simply a question of what happens at the 
ballot box and then go away and forget your constituents and 
they forget you. We have done our best to introduce ongoing 
participation in the democratic process.
<P>
	I want to say one final word about caucus. I do not know how 
the Reform Party caucus operates. I do know that every 
Wednesday morning we in the government caucus have the 
opportunity to freely and openly express our point of view to our 
Prime Minister and to one another. Together we resolve those 
differences of opinion we have. When we come in here we do 
what we believe is in the interests of the country.
<P>
	Finally, we made a commitment as a government. We made 
numerous commitments to the country during an election 
campaign. We want to be able to keep those commitments. We 
are working at that day in and day out. We need to have some 
solidarity of caucus to do that because that is what Canadians 
expect of us.
<P>
	Let me just return to my main point in rising today. In the first 
hour of debate on this bill on April 29, 1994 there were four 
Liberal speakers and one Reform speaker. There have only been 
three Reform speakers today.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I would like to 
clarify a lot. First of all I would like to just say that this bill was 
debated in February, not April. February was the beginning of 
this debate-
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7394"> 7394 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, order. If the 
member has a point of order relating to another matter of which 
she has given an indication, would she please get to that matter 
quickly.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask to speak briefly 
under the right of reply under Standing Order 44(2). I believe we 
have time as we go to about 28 minutes after the hour.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Let me just see if I can be 
helpful. The debate when it began earlier this day had 45 
minutes left on it. Now the request from the member for Beaver 
River is under a standing order concerning which is commonly 
referred to as right of reply. Where a member of the House 
moves a substantive motion the House of course recognizes that 
that person under right of reply is the last one to speak on the 
debate which closes the debate.
<P>
	I believe the hon. member for Beaver River is asking the 
House for unanimous consent to have, I will arbitrarily select a 
figure, two minutes to close the debate and then I must put the 
question.
<P>
	Is there unanimous consent to allow the member for Beaver 
River who moved the motion to close the debate?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker, then the debate closes 
without unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Yes, the debate will close 
two minutes from the time the member for Beaver River begins 
to speak and I will put the question forthwith. Is that agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to just close off this debate by saying how much I 
appreciate members who have spoken in favour of this bill. The 
member for Ottawa West called it a foolish idea when she rose in 
her place. They may think it is a foolish idea but I am here to say 
that the Canadian public, even Liberals who have been polled 
across the country, hardly think this is a foolish idea.
<P>
	What the Canadian public thinks is foolish are the people in 
this Chamber who are completely immune to job security, 
completely immune to being put forward to somebody who 
would say: ``You are not doing your job, you are not acting 
responsibly''.
<P>
	The member for Ottawa West spoke about good times and bad 
times in a marriage. She likened this bill to an instant divorce. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. There are many 
provisions in this bill to be safeguards for that.
<P>
	This is something that is going to carry on over a period of 
days, weeks, even months. A person who has been a member of 
Parliament for 18 months has had a chance to prove themselves. 
That is hardly an instant divorce.
<P>
	This bill calls for 50 per cent plus 1 of the number of voters 
who voted in the last election. That is not something that can be 
obtained instantly to call for this instant divorce.
<P>
	I will wrap up my comments by saying how sad I find it that 
people on the government side refer to this whole thing as just 
something that is foolish, that they have spoken about it more 
than we have. May I draw the House's attention to the fact that 
the Liberals said today they have no more speakers on this. The 
member got up without knowing her facts about the bill, making 
comments about it.
<P>
	I would urge this government to support-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. Pursuant to 
Standing Order 93, the time provided for debate has expired.
<P>
	Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> All those in favour of the 
motion will please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> All those opposed will 
please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In my opinion the nays 
have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Pursuant to order made 
Thursday, October 27, 1994, the division stands deferred until 
Tuesday, November 1, 1994, at the expiry of the time provided 
for Government Orders.
<P>
	This House stands adjourned until Monday next at 11 a.m. 
pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 2.22 p.m.)
