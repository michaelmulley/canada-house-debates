	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last March I was approached at my 
constituency office by a constituent whom I had not met before 
and whom I have not met since, to write a letter drawing the 
attention of the CRTC to his application for a radio licence. I 
explained to this constituent that as minister responsible I could 
not interfere with the workings of the CRTC, but I agreed as his 
member of Parliament to do my best to ensure that he was 
treated fairly.
<P>
	On March 15, I wrote to the chairman of the CRTC in my 
capacity as an MP for this constituent asking the commission to 
give the application a fair hearing. This was the letter of an MP 
seeking to ensure that a constituent received due process.
<P>
	I wish to table the letter. The letter was not meant in any way 
to be an endorsement of the licence application, nor was it 
intended to exert pressure on the CRTC. I also understand that 
on March 30 the CRTC acknowledged my letter, categorizing it 
as a letter in support of the licence applicant. That 
acknowledgement letter was never brought to my attention. If it 
had been, I would have immediately rectified the matter.
<P>
	As soon as I did learn that one of the interested parties wrote 
to me in September regarding my ``alleged support'' for the 
licence application, I took immediate corrective action. I wrote 
to the interested party, clarifying my earlier letter and clearing 
up any misunderstanding.
<P>
	In this letter dated September 30, I wrote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My letter of March 15, 1994 to the CRTC simply asked that due consideration 
be given to the application. It is not intended to convey support for or 
opposition to the application. The CRTC is the body mandated by law to make 
independent decisions on all such applications. It is therefore for the CRTC to 
weigh the merits of the arguments raised by the applicants and the interveners.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I wish to table the letter. Members will note that I took these 
actions before the matter became public. I did my best to clear 
up and correct the situation not because of public or media 
pressure which did not exist at the time but because it was the 
right thing to do.
<P>
	Being an MP and a minister is not always easy. Among other 
things it is a learning experience. In hindsight it was imprudent 
to send that original letter to the CRTC. I regret any 
misunderstanding it may have caused.
<P>
	I assure the House that I have never for a moment had any 
hesitation or misunderstanding about my role or responsibilities 
as a minister. As I said in the House on October 3 in answer to a 
question from the member for Rimouski-Témiscouata, the 
minister of heritage cannot dictate to an independent body like 
the CRTC, which is also a regulating agency. It would be quite 
inappropriate for the Minister of Canadian Heritage to tell it 
what to do.
<P>
<B>(1005) </B>
<P>
	I have held to that position every moment on this job and the 
House has my commitment that I will continue to do so.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Of course the statement made to the House is a 
clarification. The hon. minister has not asked me to rule on a 
specific question of privilege at this time, and so the Chair 
would accept the statement as given. At least at this point there 
does not seem to be any reason for me to rule on a question of 
privilege.

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I wish to inform the House there has been a 
standing agreement between the government and the opposition 
parties that ministers' statements would be given to opposition 
parties for their critics' perusal sufficiently ahead of time so 
they could prepare to respond to ministers' statements.
<P>
	The agreement was that if a minister's statement were made in 
the morning, that statement would be given to opposition parties 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7274"> 7274 </A></B>
<P>
the night before. This has not happened in this instance. We have 
had less than one hour's notice. We protest greatly. We are 
concerned about the minister's mismanagement of this situation 
and we would ask him to defer the reading of the statement until 
we have had proper time to review the statement so we can 
effectively perform our role in opposition.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I will see if I can help the 
matter. I will come back to the hon. secretary of state if he 
should so choose. From consultation I understand this is an 
informal agreement between the parties. Certainly the Chair is 
prepared to recognize the minister, as is appropriate, to make a 
statement.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Secretary of State (Parliamentary 
Affairs) and Deputy Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, for the record, we have an 
agreement between parties that we will give enough advance 
notice with documents for ministerial statements. This has been 
respected in the past. I want to assure my colleague that it will 
continue to be respected.
<P>
	Sometimes situations arise which we have to deal with 
immediately. This is the case, as was already explained to the 
hon. member previous to the opening of the House. We 
understand his concerns and we give the assurance that we will 
continue to respect the agreement we have.
<P>
	This is an exceptional circumstance as the minister will 
explain to the House. There are some parts already public. We 
believe it is important to do this as soon as possible since it 
seems there was no agreement before the House opened that we 
could have done it during question period. We are proceeding. 
We will have the statement now.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, B.Q.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, since the beginning of the 35th Parliament, it was 
understood by the party in power and the Official Opposition 
that the latter would receive prior notice of a minister's 
statement. We all know that our role in this House is to do our 
job as well as we can, in the best interest of the citizens of this 
country. Today, however, this understanding has been 
compromised by the fact that a ministerial statement will be 
made without prior notice to the opposition. We feel that this 
makes it difficult for us to play our role.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I have heard comments 
from both parties, but I will now proceed with Statements by 
Ministers.
<P>
	I therefore recognize the Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency.

	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the outset let me 
say to my colleagues opposite that I apologize for any 
inconvenience which may have been caused to them as a result 
of the statement not getting there earlier as opposed to the late 
time they received it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> You knew about it for months and you cannot 
co-operate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> If the hon. member finds the subject matter so 
difficult to comprehend I will read very slowly so that he can 
understand each and every word. I am prepared to be fully 
co-operative with the opposition in every way. I was extending 
an apology for the inconvenience which we caused to the 
opposition.
<P>
	However I believe the minister of state and the whip for our 
party informed the opposition of the miscue which took place. I 
felt compelled that we would come here this morning to share 
this information and have members of the opposition add their 
comments to the decisions which have been arrived at.
<P>
	I want to take this opportunity to advise members of the 
House and Canadians whom we represent of the latest initiative 
related to the long range plan for the preservation and 
rehabilitation of our most important national symbol, the 
Parliament Buildings.
<P>
	Over the last number of years funding for renovations to 
Parliament Hill has been severely restricted. The Auditor 
General in his 1992 report noted that the government has 
neglected to undertake most of the necessary repairs and 
renovations to the parliamentary precinct identified in the 1970s 
and the 1980s.
<P>
	Parliament Hill requires urgent attention. The simple fact is 
that we can no longer afford to neglect it. Over the next 12 to 15 
years, and I wish to underline this point, the buildings and 
grounds will require considerable attention. During that period 
we will in turn address the requirements of all buildings on the 
Hill to guarantee that in the future they remain safe for 
Canadians and healthy for the occupants.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We want to ensure that the buildings and grounds on 
Parliament Hill are energy-efficient, are relatively cheap to 
operate, meet environmental standards and are accessible for all 
Canadians. We must protect and preserve our national heritage.
<P>

<P>
	The long range plan developed by the Department of Public 
Works and Government Services addresses in a logical sequence 
the need for that preservation. As recent visitors to Parliament 
Hill will have noticed, we are currently undertaking critical 
repairs to restore the Peace Tower and to stabilize the outside-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Epp:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I would like 
to call for quorum.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I will ask the clerk to 
count the members present.
<P>
	<I>And the count having been taken:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I see a quorum. I will ask 
the hon. minister to continue.
<P>
<B>(1015 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dingwall:</B> Mr. Speaker, the long range plan developed by 
the Department of Public Works and Government Services 
addresses in a logical sequence the need for preservation.
<P>
	As recent visitors to Parliament Hill will have noticed, we are 
currently undertaking repairs to restore the Peace Tower and to 
stabilize the outside masonry of the Centre Block.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We are also installing new water mains that will make it easier 
to fight fires on the Hill, and of course the government is taking 
the requisite steps to make the Parliament Buildings conform to 
the National Building Code.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The first scheduled major rehabilitation project on an 
occupied building is the West Block.
<P>
	Following the next dissolution of Parliament we will close 
down the West Block for a few years and use the Justice Building 
as alternative office space. Complete repairs to the West Block 
require the removal of asbestos and we cannot put the health of 
MPs and staff at risk by keeping the building open during the 
repairs.
<P>
	New mechanical and electrical systems must be installed. 
New fire detection, alarm and sprinkler systems must be in 
place. New waterproofing, windows, new energy saving devices 
are required. Sewage facilities must be upgraded. Walls, 
ceilings and roofs require attention. Elevators, doors and 
washrooms must be modernized to accommodate the disabled.
<P>
	When the West Block is reopened, renovation of the Centre 
Block will begin early in the next century, with MPs and staff 
from the Centre Block moving to the West Block.
<P>
	A long range plan is absolutely vital if we are to safeguard the 
Parliament Buildings. The cost over a 12 to 15 year period is 
approximately $265 million. Of course we cannot afford to 
spend all that money at once nor can we afford to shut down the 
essential operations of  Parliament. That is why the plan is over 
a 12 to 15 year period.
<P>
	Given the current climate, we are not talking about a Cadillac 
renovation here. I want to be very clear on this. Consistent with 
our Chevrolet approach we have prioritized and addressed only 
the most critical of the health and safety issues that affect the 
parliamentary precinct. If not, that figure would have been in 
excess of $450 million.
<P>
	During the course of renovations we will be working with the 
House of Commons, the Library of Parliament and the Senate to 
ensure continued access to visitors to Parliament Hill.
<P>
	All contracts will be awarded through the open bidding 
system. Since Parliament Hill is the focal point of Canadian 
democracy, only Canadian businesses and Canadian workers 
will be eligible to do the rehabilitation work.
<P>
	This is not about fancy new furnishings or lavish new offices. 
It is strictly about protecting our history and guaranteeing the 
safety, health, environment and accessibility of the Parliament 
Buildings. Canadians expect the Parliament Buildings to be 
preserved. They are willing to pay for the renovations if they are 
done in a prudent, fiscally responsible and open manner, and 
that is what is being accomplished.
<P>
	As the minister responsible for public works and government 
services, I would be happy to report to the standing committee 
on government operations on the progress that has been made, 
answer questions members or other individuals might have 
concerning those expenditures to assure all members that the 
expenditures are prudent, fiscally responsible and have been 
carried out in a very open fashion.
<P>
	On a continuous basis all attempts to minimize to the fullest 
extent possible potential disruptions resulting from noise, dust 
or interruption of services are being made.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I sincerely want to thank all members on both sides of the 
House for their understanding and patience during these major 
renovations.
<P>
<B>(1020 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	May I add my thanks to the Speaker and to all parties in the 
House of Commons for their advice. As members opposite will 
know and appreciate, the Board of Internal Economy, which is 
represented by three political parties, proved to be most helpful 
on this relocation project.
<P>
	I am very pleased we have the consent of all the major parties 
to proceed with this vital initiative which protects the health and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7276"> 7276 </A></B>
<P>
safety of visitors and occupants of the parliamentary buildings, 
Canada's most important national heritage site.
<P>
	Let me repeat what I said at the beginning. I apologize to my 
colleagues if these deliberations and the statement has caused 
them inconvenience, however they are fully aware that 
information was provided to government employees and not to 
members, so I thought it only appropriate that I come to the 
House at the soonest possible time to share this information with 
all members of Parliament.
<P>
	As members opposite know, the subject matter has been 
discussed at the Board of Internal Economy where all parties 
have been represented and have had an opportunity to 
participate. I believe that goes back, if memory serves me 
correctly, to some time in May of last year.
<P>
	In conclusion, I regret the inconvenience we may have caused 
colleagues opposite but I want to indicate to them that I believe 
this is in the best interest of Canada's national heritage site, the 
parliamentary precinct.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as my party's critic for parliamentary affairs, instead of 
responding to the substance of this ministerial statement, I must 
inform the minister that although there were discussions 
between the parties on the Board of Internal Economy, that is no 
excuse for not advising us of the content so that we can do our 
job.
<P>
	I repeat that the basic objective of the Official Opposition in 
this system is to do a good job by monitoring the government 
and government operations and by defending the interests of our 
fellow citizens.
<P>
	Since the beginning of this 35th Parliament, as far as 
parliamentary affairs are concerned, it was tacitly understood 
that the opposition would get the information a few hours before 
ministers made their statements. The purpose of this 
understanding was to help us do our job as well and as 
democratically as possible. In this particular case, we seem to be 
right in the parliamentary stone age.
<P>
	The opposition's role is to monitor the government's 
administration. What disturbs us in this particular case, which 
concerns the Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services, is that we lack the detailed information we need to be 
able to respond, and I must say it is particularly difficult for 
members to obtain information from this department. This is a 
closed department, a department that distributes contracts and 
also a department where members find it extremely difficult to 
get information. For instance, when low-cost housing projects 
are officially opened in Quebec, the department, according to its 
own particular protocol, invites all the provincial members, 
mayors, and so forth, except the members of the Official 
Opposition. This is the kind of department and the kind of 
minister we find disturbing.
<P>
	This morning, we cannot do our job because of the kind of 
behaviour that is typical of a department that is so secretive that 
it tables documents at the last minute.
<P>
	That is why we cannot respond on the substance of this 
statement and, in the name of democracy, we regret that we 
cannot. And again, we may remind everyone, and especially the 
minister's colleagues, that this is the most difficult department 
from which to get information.
<P>
<B>(1025 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I begin my 
speech as my hon. colleague from the Bloc has by once again 
chastising the minister and the department for the problem of 
timing.
<P>
	We understood that the government had an agenda of more 
openness in government, more accountability. I remember 
hearing during the campaign: ``We want to make Parliament 
work better'' and yet at every turn we have what could almost be 
called obstructionism from the government. We are receiving 
inadequate notice of these statements and therefore cannot 
respond in substance. We cannot possibly hold a reasoned 
debate on the issue.
<P>
	I believe that the work in committees is important. I was in a 
committee meeting where we were talking about the Lobbyists 
Registration Act and how to improve accessibility and 
accountability in government.
<P>
	Ten minutes to the hour I received notice that the minister was 
going to make a statement. As the critic in that area I had to 
leave what at that time was very important work. I had no time to 
arrange for a substitute so no representative of our party is in the 
committee meeting which is going on as we speak.
<P>
	Here I am talking about a statement which, admittedly, has 
very little substance so I do not need five days to look at it, but I 
really would have appreciated enough notice so that I could have 
organized my time today. I could have had substitutes in my 
committee so the real work of Parliament could proceed in a 
rational, orderly fashion.
<P>
	I cannot help but applaud the initial statement because we 
want to keep these buildings up, we want to keep them in a safe 
condition, we want to be environmentally responsible. Those 
are all very good goals. However we need time to go through the 
cost estimates to see whether the taxpayers' money is being 
spent wisely. I do not know at this stage whether it is but we need 
some time to do that.
<P>
	The minister has given some specifics. He indicated for 
example that we should repair some washrooms and remove the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7277"> 7277 </A></B>
<P>
asbestos in the ceilings. That is pretty good and I do not think we 
need to spend a lot of time debating that in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	I find it interesting that he made no mention of repairing the 
tunnel to the East Block. Perhaps he too is writing off the 
usefulness of the other place. I do not know.
<P>
	When we talk of repairing and keeping the buildings up, an 
even more important point is that we ought to be looking at what 
is inside. The buildings are not nearly as important as the people 
and the individuals who work here, including the members of 
Parliament.
<P>
	What we ought to be doing, because this type of thing should 
be passed very quickly, is getting on with the job. We need to 
look at the effectiveness of members of Parliament and whether 
we will ever in this place have free votes so that members can 
represent their constituents. That is one of the flaws that needs 
to be fixed in this place, that needs no public works but is very 
important and needs to be done.
<P>
	I really believe that the minister needs to sharpen up a bit. 
How can I say that politely? This is the second time we have had 
10 minutes or half an hour to react. Let us assure the people of 
Canada that we can run this place correctly and properly.
<P>
	I would like to say one more thing about the process. This is 
the only thing to which I have had a chance to respond. I read 
this thing while walking over from my office, walking and 
reading, and the only thing I can say at this stage because of lack 
of time to analyse it in greater depth is with respect to the time.
<P>
<B>(1030 ) </B>
<P>
	I can hardly believe we need to shut down a building for three 
years while it is being repaired. That certainly is not the way 
things are done in private industry. If this were an office 
building and no rent was being collected we can be assured that 
whoever owned that building would arrange for contractors to 
do it. I do not think they would do it on the weekends but I assure 
the House they would do it much more rapidly.
<P>
	The West Block has four floors. Surely crews could be 
assembled so that four crews per floor could work over the 
summer and the repairs would be finished when we came back in 
the fall. There is no reason that could not be done.
<P>
	I cannot believe this is going to take three years. Maybe it is 
going to be a case of one dumb digger dug into the ditch, the 
other dumb digger dug out. Maybe that is what is going to 
happen. I really do not know.
<P>
	There is an obvious lack of planning when it has been 
determined it will take that long. There is a considerable 
disruption to the operation of Parliament by having the 
displacement away from that building. We should be able to do 
much better than that.
<P>
	I suppose that is all we can expect from the present 
government. We very much look forward to putting the Liberals 
into their correct place at the next election. Perhaps we will have 
the opportunity to do better.

	The House resumed from October 26 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-53, an act to establish the Department of 
Canadian Heritage and to amend and repeal certain other acts, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee; and of the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in today's debate on Bill 
C-53 creating the Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	First of all, I think it is essential for all members of this House 
to be aware that this bill is a technicality.
<P>
	Since our government has been in office, the Department of 
Canadian Heritage has vigorously pursued its mandate and 
played a key role in Canadian society. Its activities reflect a 
wide range of responsibilities in areas of cultural development, 
arts, broadcasting, national parks, historic sites, amateur sport 
and multiculturalism.
<P>
	The department also administers official languages, state 
ceremonial and Native programs, which are all fundamental 
elements of the Canadian identity. In a world where 
international barriers are disappearing, where technology is 
altering borders, Canadian identity lies at the heart of our 
country's growth.
<P>
	It goes without saying that the federal government needs an 
instrument such as the Department of Canadian Heritage to 
carry on its work to develop Canadian culture and promote 
Canadian identity.
<P>
	I cannot describe in detail all the responsibilities entrusted to 
the Department of Canadian Heritage, but I will outline some of 
its activities that are essential to our society's development.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	National parks and historic sites are concrete symbols of this 
country's wealth and an important part of the duties performed 
by the Department of Canadian Heritage which are designed to 
promote Canadian identity. Our natural heritage, our vast terri-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7279"> 7279 </A></B>
<P>
tory, our history and our place in the world play a crucial role in 
promoting our identity and the values we cherish as Canadians.
<P>
	Furthermore, the official languages policy introduced by the 
federal government in the 1970s reflects a generous and creative 
vision. The Department of Canadian Heritage was assigned the 
responsibility of ensuring that French-and English-speaking 
Canadians feel at home wherever they choose to reside.
<P>
	The principle of respect for both official languages of Canada, 
combined with respect for the traditions and contributions of 
aboriginal peoples, respect for our cultural diversity as well as 
fundamental respect for human rights make Canada a land of 
open-mindedness and opportunity that millions of people dream 
of around the world.
<P>
	New Canadians and their language skills constitute a valuable 
asset for the Canadian society. Just think of the key role they 
play in our cultural exchanges and trade transactions with 
foreign countries. The heart of Canada is beating to the rhythm 
of our many cultures, and the impact of these new human 
resources will help us progress.
<P>
	In the international arena, nations strive to find the way to 
bind together, with a deep feeling of national identity, 
populations made up of various ethnic, cultural, linguistic and 
racial groups. Several countries are currently looking seriously 
into the purely Canadian model we have come up with. The 
multicultural dimension of Canada is a rich social reality in our 
country, a reality that we must preserve.
<P>
	Giving each Canadian the place he or she deserves in our 
society and the opportunity to contribute fully to building a 
stronger country can only benefit us all. In the enactment 
establishing the Department of Canadian Heritage, I note that 
the government undertakes to achieve equality for all Canadians 
in matters relating to the social, economic and cultural life of 
their country.
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage recognizes the need to 
remove barriers which divide Canada and build ties based on 
trust and respect. Bear in mind that the purpose of 
multiculturalism is to ensure social unity and strengthen 
national identity. Greater participation by all Canadians in 
community life can only serve to increase awareness of our 
cultural and natural wealth.
<P>
	As for the policies and programs of the Canadian heritage 
department, their purpose is to promote a greater understanding 
of our diversity. Let us not forget that, for many communities, 
the economic and tourist activity generated by departmental 
operations is often vital. These are broad responsibilities that 
the Department of Canadian Heritage is fully capable of 
carrying out.
<P>
	In closing, I wish to emphasize the need for Bill C-53 to be 
passed, to recognize formally the jurisdiction of the Department 
of Canadian Heritage and to allow the department to continue 
pursuing the mission it has been pursuing for a year and a half.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to speak this morning about the motion of my 
colleague, the member for Rimouski-Témiscouata, on an 
amendment to Bill C-53 that she tabled on October 4.
<P>
	This amendment asks that Bill C-53 not be now read a second 
time, but that the order be discharged, the bill withdrawn and the 
subject matter referred to the Standing Committee on Canadian 
Heritage. Mr. Speaker, you will understand that today I would 
not want to give all the reasons for which I am for or against Bill 
C-53. I will do that later if necessary.
<P>
	Nevertheless, I would like to make this House aware of the 
means it has adopted and which should not be overlooked by a 
minister who may wish to have his bill approved as quickly as 
possible.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	The House of Commons must insist that bills presented to us 
on second reading have been considered, first of all, by the 
Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage. The House of 
Commons created this committee to fulfil its role; otherwise, 
what would be the use of it?
<P>
	Among other things, it is supposed to get to the bottom of the 
issues by the most appropriate means-hearings, forming 
sub-committees, nationwide tours, consultations with the 
provinces-and especially by trying to obtain a national 
consensus, even within the committee.
<P>
	After that, we will be able to talk about whether it is 
appropriate to pass a bill establishing the Department of 
Canadian Heritage. I believe that the standing committee will 
have a lot of work to do before it comes back to us with a bill that 
we are sure will be quite different.
<P>
	Some people, especially some Quebec government 
departments, I would say, have some very specific things to tell 
the committee, so it is totally justified to submit Bill C-53 to it 
for consideration.
<P>
	First, the committee can find out what this department's 
mandate is, and it can see that it makes no reference to Quebec as 
a distinct society, much less any reference to its cultural 
specificity.
<P>
	Once again, the committee will realize that the former Liberal 
government denied the reality of Quebec culture by diluting it in 
a Canadian cultural entity based on bilingualism and 
multiculturalism. This department is being created in the wake 
of the defunct Charlottetown Accord, which proposed a 
fictitious and deceptive recognition of the provinces' exclusive 
jurisdiction over culture.
<P>
	The committee will also be able to note that the 
straightforward demands of Quebec's former Minister of 
Culture, Ms. Frulla-Hébert, are not reflected in the future 
orientation of the new Department of Canadian Heritage. So you 
will understand 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7280"> 7280 </A></B>
<P>
that we must think  twice before presenting such legislation to 
the new sovereignist government of Quebec.
<P>
	Without making a list of the areas, and I will come back to this 
a little later if need be, the committee will see that duplication 
and overlap in the field of culture will increase rather than 
decrease with this bill.
<P>
	Taking Quebec as an example, we are faced with two systems 
of cultural institutions, each Quebec institution having its 
federal counterpart, except for the National Film Board.
<P>
	In summary, Quebec has a budget of $425 million and Ottawa 
$2.8 billion.
<P>
	Culture is under provincial jurisdiction and the Standing 
Committee on Canadian Heritage will realize that it must 
recommend that the House of Commons stop unnecessary 
spending at a time when social programs are under attack to 
reduce the deficit and stop allowing interference in provincial 
jurisdiction over culture.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois will demonstrate to the Standing 
Committee on Canadian Heritage, through the hon. member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata, that both the Conservatives and the 
Liberals developed their respective cultural policies by 
increasing federal interference in the cultural sector and by 
denying the distinct identity of Quebecers.
<P>
	Through its representatives on that committee, the Bloc will 
present its views on cultural institutions. We do not intend to 
deny to Canadians the right to their own federal cultural 
institutions. However, the Bloc will make sure that Quebec's 
cultural community gets its fair share of subsidies from federal 
granting agencies and that the waste resulting from duplication 
is stopped.
<P>
	The committee would be well-advised to read the report of 
the consulting group on Quebec's cultural policy, which was 
tabled in Quebec's National Assembly on June 14, 1991. That 
document was reviewed by a parliamentary committee over a 
period lasting almost eight weeks, in the fall of 1992, during 
which 181 Quebec organizations were heard and 264 written 
submissions were received. Following the work of that 
committee, Quebec developed a cultural policy and the Standing 
Committee on Canadian Heritage will have to examine that 
policy prior to a thorough review of the cultural issue. If the 
committee cannot find that policy, I will be pleased to send it a 
copy upon request.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	By adopting its own cultural policy, the Quebec government 
demonstrated its keen desire to provide Quebecers with a 
cultural development framework which allows them to thrive. 
Again, the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage will have 
to take that policy into account before making any 
recommendation to this House.
<P>
	As I said at the beginning, and I will conclude on that note, I 
did not want to elaborate too much on Bill C-53 itself. I simply 
wanted to make this House aware of the need to pass the motion 
tabled by the hon. member for Rimouski-Témiscouata, and to 
refer the whole issue to the Standing Committee on Canadian 
Heritage which, I am convinced, will provide us with an 
amended bill taking into consideration all groups within the 
populatiobn as well as their legitimate aspirations.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFCANADIANHERITAGEACT">DEPARTMENT OF CANADIAN HERITAGE ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from October 26 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-53 an act to establish the Department of 
Canadian Heritage to amend and repeal certain other acts, be 
read the second time and referred to a committee; and of the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin Cauchon (Outremont, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to speak this morning to Bill C-53, 
which I see as important and essential to Canadian society 
because of what it represents. All members who spoke to the bill 
in this House expressed the view that it was basically a 
housekeeping bill. In fact, the purpose of this legislation is 
simply to reassign departmental responsibilities.
<P>
	We have heard criticism from the two opposition parties. 
Certain details, certain aspects of the bill were criticized, of 
course, but in addition, and this is what irks me, they took this 
opportunity to criticize the federal government's role in the 
cultural sphere. I think that if we are to have a constructive 
debate, my comments should deal mainly with the federal 
government's role in this area. According to the opposition 
parties, the federal government should withdraw from anything 
that resembles cultural affairs, should stop working with major 
agencies like Telefilm Canada and, listen to this,  should get rid
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7281"> 7281 </A></B>
<P>
of an agency as important as the Department of Canadian 
Heritage.
<P>
	The opposition parties even claim, and this I found hard to 
take seriously, that the federal government will use these 
institutions against the province of Quebec and even against the 
French fact in Canada as a whole. It takes all kinds, but this takes 
the cake!
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	Such comments seem unwise, to say the least, considering the 
current political context in this country.
<P>
	I want to make it clear that the federal government's role in 
cultural matters is a fundamental and entirely legitimate one, 
and I hope that this short speech will reassure opposition 
members.
<P>
	Why is this role so important? The federal government's role 
is important because of the way Canada was built. We all know 
that Canada is a wonderful mosaic of various cultures, with two 
official languages. We also know that Canada as a country has 
opted for social values based on tolerance, mutual respect, 
multiculturalism and promotion of the Canadian identity. In this 
respect, the federal government's role as Canadian umbrella, a 
Canadian vehicle for promoting our identity as Canadians, is 
fundamental.
<P>
	As parliamentarians we must take the broader view and keep 
this debate removed from what I call constitutional squabbles. 
Quebec and the rest of the country have already suffered enough 
as a result of this quarrelling which in most cases has been of no 
benefit to the people of this country and often puts an extra 
burden on Canadian taxpayers. We should recall the purpose of 
this bill and especially the Canadian government's role, and stop 
this constitutional nitpicking.
<P>
	It is obvious that you have gathered from my remarks that I 
am wary of what the Official Opposition is affirming, but also of 
the Reform Party, which wants to go ahead with unweighed and 
often unjustified cuts that would go against some basic 
principles stated by the Prime Minister of Canada, principles he 
has stated and, indeed, states regularly, in this House. The 
federal government must respond to the budget situation, while 
remaining at the service of the population and, in this role, 
promote Canadian identity.
<P>
	Of course, we must rise above constitutional disputes, but 
without losing sight of the objectives set by the government in 
terms of government administration. The government wants to 
make sure that we can stay away from any form of duplication. It 
also wants to make sure that we can streamline government 
operations and I might add that it is desirable that government 
administrations at all levels be streamlined.
<P>
	Bill C-53, to establish the Department of Canadian Heritage, 
is part of this streamlining process respectful of authority, or
<P>
should I say the powers inherent to the three levels of 
government, specifically the municipal, provincial and federal 
levels.
<P>
	The department the Bloc Quebecois would like to see 
abolished is also the backbone of institutions such as national 
museums, the Canada Council-allow me to list a few more key 
organizations-Telefilm and the National Film Board and 
various programs encouraging interprovincial distribution, 
exportation of our cultural products and promotion of Canadian 
talent internationally.
<P>
	In fact, I would add that the federal government is making use 
of the legislative or statutory instruments within its jurisdiction, 
such as copyright or income tax, to encourage or oversee artistic 
creation and cultural diffusion.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	Of course, the provinces and municipalities, as I said, also 
have a role and since each government has an important role in 
these fields of jurisdiction, I should say that they have a key 
role, a complementary role, in fact, with respect to culture.
<P>
	Far be it from me to challenge the authority of these levels of 
government. I would even go further by stating the obvious fact 
that Quebec's powers are special, since it is the centre of French 
culture in North America. But, of course, this does not prevent 
the Canadian government from assuming its own 
responsibilities of encouraging interprovincial trade, sharing a 
common heritage, structuring the markets for cultural products 
by using the tools that it alone has at its disposal.
<P>
	I understand that the way the Bloc sees things, Quebec's goal 
is to keep anything federal off its territory; however, to say that 
the break-up of the country is necessary because the federal 
government's intervention harms Quebec culture is the kind of 
intellectually twisted argument that they usually give us, 
unfortunately, and give all Quebecers especially. I think that this 
attitude is meant to justify at any cost a case that they consider 
has been proven beyond question. They deliberately want to 
tarnish a record in which all Quebecers can take pride.
<P>
	To conclude, I recently heard some Bloc critics and I was 
deeply offended as a Quebecer. Some Bloc critics say that they 
want to confine the whole province within a single definition, 
that of a nation. I must say that Quebec is not a definition. 
Quebec is made up of people who have pride, their customs and 
culture, a culture that they want to extend throughout Canada 
and internationally. There is also a French community that is 
alive and well outside of Quebec.
<P>
	The federal government's role and the purpose of this bill are 
to make it possible-and I conclude-for this French 
community to flourish more and for the two official languages to 
live together better, all for the sake of promoting what we call a 
Canadian identity, of which I am proud.
<P>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure this morning to speak on 
Bill C-53 respecting multiculturalism.
<P>
	I do challenge whether government should be involved in this 
program. It is very important for the government and ministers 
of the crown to realize the influence they hold over the people 
who provide government services on a daily basis.
<P>
	It is also important for those in a position of power to 
understand that what they say and do will influence and give 
direction to the bureaucracy. It is important that all ministers of 
the crown appreciate what intervention is.
<P>
	The policy of multiculturalism in Canada is a program that the 
Government of Canada has imposed and forced on Canadians. I 
believe that the philosophy of the multiculturalism program is 
very divisive. I am proud of the heritage of many of the people in 
this great country of ours. I do not think that any Canadians from 
the beginning have needed government to provide a program in 
order for them to share their cultural backgrounds with other 
Canadians. I feel it is a place where the federal government 
should not be involved. I take great exception to the federal 
government's using ethnic and cultural backgrounds as a basis 
for employing people within government services.
<P>
<B>(1105 ) </B>
<P>
	I am offended that our federal government departments are 
required to list employees by their gender, by whether they 
belong to aboriginal people, whether they are a visible minority 
or persons with disabilities.
<P>
	I am offended when government officials are proudly 
announcing that they have either met or exceeded their quotas. I 
do not believe that government departments have any business 
in developing quotas.
<P>
	How do they get the stats they are so proud of which they use 
so loosely? They are self-identification stats by individuals who 
are required to fill out a form identifying to what sub-groups 
they belong.
<P>
	I feel that these kinds of policies are very divisive not only 
within Canadian society but certainly within our Canadian 
government services. The government is not satisfied with just 
creating hyphenated Canadians. It now wants Canadians to list 
their lineage.
<P>
	I believe there is a real question of what is a visible minority. 
Is this a person of a mixed race? Do they have to look like a 
mixed race person to belong to a visible minority? Do they just 
need to have it in their lineage?
<P>
	If we are basing employment on the appearance of people, I 
have great difficulty with those people who are judging whether 
those people belong to visible minorities.
<P>
	What if there are two people with the same background but 
one appears to be of a visible minority group and the other one 
not so much? Does the one qualify for the job in government and 
the sibling not qualify?
<P>
	For the government to start looking at a quota system in its 
employees is going down the wrong way. All we have to do is 
look at when quotas and the appearance of people were used in 
history, for it is not in circumstances that we can be proud of.
<P>
	To establish lineage, ethnic background or what qualifies as a 
visible minority do we need to be one-half of a particular ethnic 
group? What about one-quarter, one-eighth or one-sixteenth? 
Where does it begin and where does it end?
<P>
	This whole idea is ridiculous. I believe that classifying people 
by lineage is obscene. History would show us that it is obscene. I 
would like to question why any government would want to 
encourage and continue this practice.
<P>
	A second point that I am concerned about is how the policy of 
multiculturalism is affecting our courts. There was a case in 
Vancouver in which the parent of a child was being questioned 
when the parent was trying to put the child up for adoption. The 
biological father happened to be of aboriginal origin, not full 
blooded and not half blooded, but a quarter.
<P>
	Here was a judge in the courts having to determine what 
percentage of aboriginal background this child had and whether 
that child should be given to the father to be raised in the 
aboriginal community.
<P>
	It turns out that the child was close to one-sixteenth 
aboriginal and the judge in making his decision felt that the 
child did not have enough native background in order to be 
placed in an aboriginal foster home or family.
<P>
	Why should any judge be faced with this kind of decision? 
Why should it ever be important where that child originated? 
What should be important are the best interests of the growth of 
that child, the provisions that could be made to that child in its 
infancy and furthermore in its growing years, not whether it is a 
member of a visible minority.
<P>
	The other issue that I find very offensive is this reverse 
discrimination that we see. I am going to use the RCMP as an 
example. The RCMP is being asked to impose this affirmative 
action, judging people's employment ability on their gender, on 
whether they are a visible minority or whether they belong to a 
group that is physically handicapped.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	I would suggest that when we have a government department 
that in Alberta a few years ago decided it would not accept 
applications, we are not talking about giving them jobs. We are 
talking about accepting applications from white unilingual 
males. I take exception to that. It shows me that all Canadians 
are not  being given equal opportunity. I do not think it solves 
the problem that the RCMP had with not hiring women and not 
hiring minority members 20 years ago. It does not solve that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7283"> 7283 </A></B>
<P>
problem by discriminating against young white males today. I 
do not think those individuals feel they are being treated as 
Canadians, and I would suggest that they are not.
<P>
	It is very important for the government to seriously consider 
whether it has a legitimate right to be involved in this kind of 
multiculturalism program that does invade and does reach out 
into all aspects of Canadian society.
<P>
	I would challenge the government that this program is very 
divisive and is creating a situation in the country that is very 
dangerous. I see growth in ethnic groups and youth groups vying 
for a position of power within our communities, pitting one 
racial group against the other.
<P>
	I hear from new immigrants who say they came to Canada 
looking for and anticipating a new Canadian culture and when 
they get here they are being encouraged to keep the culture of the 
place from which they came. They are here with a sense of 
frustration, of not knowing where to turn. We as the Canadian 
government have a responsibility to new Canadians to bring 
together all those things that we share, all those programs and 
ideals that we are looking to have in this country that will make 
it a stronger unified country.
<P>
	I do not think the federal government should be encouraging 
programs such as multiculturalism and bilingualism that divide 
Canadians, that bring them up against each other in vying for 
superiority and power. It is time that the government realized all 
Canadians deserve equal treatment from the federal 
government, should be considered equal members of Canadian 
society and stop this fallacy, this obscenity of creating divisions 
based on language and ethnic background.
<P>
	I would encourage the House to reconsider supporting Bill 
C-53.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to rise in the House today to participate in this 
debate on Bill C-53, an act to establish the Department of 
Canadian Heritage. My remarks today will be mainly involving 
Parks Canada's involvement and the role it will play in this act.
<P>
	It has been said many times that we have inherited a rich 
legacy and every generation of Canadians has had an 
opportunity to make a contribution to it. That legacy is our 
heritage which we share with everyone in Canada wherever they 
live and whatever their background.
<P>
	Our natural and wilderness heritage and our sense of history 
and place are vital elements of this heritage we all share. They 
are central to who we are and what we value as Canadians.
<P>
	The new Department of Canadian Heritage reflects the many 
dimensions of the Canadian experience, an experience that is 
always evolving. Protecting areas of natural and historic 
significance to the nation for the  benefit and enjoyment of all 
Canadians is the responsibility of the Department of Canadian 
Heritage.
<P>
	In the past a big part of that job has been done and will 
continue to be done by Parks Canada, a key component of the 
new department. The creation of the Department of Canadian 
Heritage will not in any way undermine the importance we place 
on issues associated with the protection and preservation of our 
natural heritage, both natural and cultural.
<P>
<B>(1115 ) </B>
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage supports Parks 
Canada's mandate in this area. All parts of the department are 
working hard to make sure that Canada's heritage and 
environment are valued today and passed on to tomorrow.
<P>
	Parks Canada's traditions, now departmental traditions, go 
back more than a century to the establishment at Banff in 1885 
of Canada's first national park. Of course our system of national 
historic sites started with Fort Anne in Nova Scotia more than 75 
years ago.
<P>
	From Ellesmere Island national park within the Arctic circle 
in the north to Point Pelee national park at the southern tip of 
Canada and from the lighthouse at Cape Spear national historic 
site at the country's eastern edge on the Atlantic to the Pacific 
rim national park on the west coast, our national parks and 
national historic sites dot the length and the breadth of Canada. 
They are Canada's pride, the crown jewels of our heritage.
<P>
	Canadians have a strong attachment to and affection for the 
land and the landscape of the country whether found in small 
towns, in rural areas, in the wilderness or in the historic districts 
of the large cities.
<P>
	Landscape is a vital component of our heritage and it forms 
part of the rhythm of our lives. Our historic landmarks are a vital 
part of the landscape, a significant and irreplaceable part of 
Canada's physical environment. Canada's national historic 
sites, heritage railway stations and federal heritage buildings 
are located in every province and territory.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, as I speak to you today there is construction 
under way in my riding of Hillsborough, Prince Edward Island, 
on the building of a memorial park to commemorate the place 
where the Fathers of Confederation first stepped ashore and 
began their journey up Great George Street to the steps of 
Province House in Charlottetown. What occurred over the next 
few days in Province House was indeed the beginning of the 
formation of our country as we know it today. From that point on 
Charlottetown was to become known as the birthplace of 
Confederation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7284"> 7284 </A></B>
<P>
	These historical sites are a tangible symbol of our national 
unity and heritage and are of great importance to the 
constituents in my riding as well as to the many people who 
come to visit them.
<P>
	One or more national historic sites are located in over 400 
communities across the land, meaning that these communities 
are direct stakeholders in the national heritage, sharing that 
heritage with their fellow Canadians and with visitors to our 
country.
<P>
	Our country's national parks, national marine conservation 
areas and heritage rivers add to this shared legacy of outstanding 
special places held in trust for all Canadians.
<P>
	As symbols of our national heritage all of these special places 
speak directly to Canadian identity. They are living laboratories, 
places where the public can truly experience Canada's past or its 
wilderness.
<P>
	Historic sites cover a vast span of human history measured in 
thousands of years and document the populating of the land, 
economic and social development, nation building, Canadian 
achievements in arts, culture, human rights, wilderness 
preservation and the sciences, as well as a vast number of other 
human endeavours and activities. As both the product and the 
witness of the works of our predecessors, they are fundamental 
to a broadly defined and diverse yet encompassing sense of 
Canadian identity.
<P>
	These heritage places provide an excellent opportunity to 
make all Canadians more aware of their history and to make 
landed immigrants and new Canadians aware of their Canadian 
heritage, aware of the places, events, activities and people that 
have made us what we are. In this respect these places can play a 
vital role promoting citizenship value.
<P>
	Because these historic sites are nationally significant they 
serve as links between the community and the nation and 
between the subject of commemoration and our national history.
<P>
	Each national historic site can be said to illustrate an 
important chapter in a national saga that is constantly unfolding 
not only into the future but perhaps surprisingly into the past. A 
number of national historic sites document the fact that our 
human history is many thousands of years older than we once 
thought.
<P>
	National historic sites represent one of the most important 
and valuable examples of a vital Canadian tradition, the 
partnership between individuals, corporations and governments 
in the history of our country.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	Fewer than one-fifth of Canada's national historic sites are 
owned by the federal government. The investment, the 
involvement and the co-operation of others in the preservation 
of places that have been designated nationally significant by the 
federal government is a  remarkable and regrettably often little 
recognized national partnership of achievement.
<P>
	Federal heritage buildings and heritage railway stations recall 
an era when federal buildings and railway stations were often 
the most important and imposing landmarks in communities 
large and small across the country, serving as symbols of 
national integration and confidence in the future.
<P>
	No less significant than national historic sites, federal 
heritage buildings and heritage railway stations is the program 
that formally recognizes persons and events that have played an 
important part in our history. The program fosters knowledge 
and appreciation of the achievements of Canadians, such as the 
boxer Sam Langford, the poet Pauline Johnson, the scientist and 
educator Frère Marie-Victorin, piano manufacturer Theodore 
Heintzman, and reformer Nellie McClung.
<P>
	Events or themes that have been officially recognized have 
included the inauguration of the transcontinental railway 
service and the assertion of Canadian sovereignty in the Arctic.
<P>
	I know that my time is running out. I could continue on for 
many more minutes here but I know, Mr. Speaker, that you are 
looking at your watch.
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage will be much more than 
the sum of its parts. Canada is a country of great geographical 
and cultural diversity, yet as Canadians we share so much.
<P>
	Our objective is to foster pride in our achievements as people 
and as a country. Canada's heritage is evolving. Each generation 
is making its own contribution to the development of our shared 
heritage.
<P>
	Working together in the new department in partnership with 
Canadians we will achieve more than we ever could do on our 
own. I invite all members of the House to support the bill to 
create the Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to the proposed amendment to Bill C-53, an 
Act to establish the Department of Canadian Heritage. This 
amendment calls for the bill to be withdrawn and the 
subject-matter thereof referred to the Standing Committee on 
Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	I would like to say at the outset that the fears the hon. member 
for Outremont wants to dispel have been reaffirmed by this bill. 
There is no place for Quebec or for the distinct society. It is 
always surprising, not to say sad, to see the illusions of timid 
nationalists reaffirmed after fighting in vain for 30 years.
<P>
	When we look closely at the sectors, the functions and the 
people targeted by this new department, we quickly realize that 
this is a ``grab bag'' department, a hodge-podge of programs 
which clearly show either the Canadian government's inconsis-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7285"> 7285 </A></B>
<P>
tency or its less than transparent strategy in dividing up 
responsibilities, in  bringing together parts of the following 
federal departments: Environment Canada; Multiculturalism 
and Citizenship; the part of Health and Welfare responsible for 
amateur sport; part of the Canadian Secretary of State, namely 
official languages, Canadian studies, Native programs and state 
protocol; the part of Environment Canada responsible for Parks 
Canada and historic sites; the part of the Department of 
Communications responsible for the arts, heritage, culture and 
broadcasting.
<P>
	Later, they will add the Registrar General of Canada from the 
Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs. The new 
Department of Canadian Heritage, whose creation was 
undertaken by the Conservative government, brings together for 
the first time all of Ottawa's cultural policy instruments, namely 
the Canada Council, the CBC, the National Film Board, Telefilm 
Canada, national parks and museums, National Archives, etc.
<P>
	This department will have a budget in the order of $2.8 
billion, compared with a $425 million budget for Quebec's 
Ministry of Culture. In addition, several responsibilities 
assigned to the Department of Canadian Heritage must be 
fulfilled in co-operation with other departments, thus reducing 
the heritage minister's actual power and political say in 
administering his own department. After this morning's 
statement by the minister, we can conclude that even his moral 
power is affected.
<P>
	Moreover, responsibility for telecommunications policy and 
programs was transferred from the Department of 
Communications to the new Department of Industry. All this 
with little or no staff or spending reduction in sight. So what is 
the real purpose of this reorganization? The real powers granted 
to the Minister of Heritage are like jam: the less you have, the 
more you spread it around. In this case, the new department's 
responsibilities are well spread out.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	The culture portfolio has undergone two major 
reorganizations since June 1993; things are getting more and 
more complicated, the number of players keeps increasing, and 
jurisdictional overlap is getting worse. The government must 
have followed an increasingly popular rule: Why simplify when 
you can make things more complicated and a little more 
expensive? A highly centralizing Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	To say the least, the Canadian government has obviously 
decided to make this Department of Canadian Heritage the main 
instrument to promote Canadian values and it will also 
encourage the whole country to fully participate in that exercise.
<P>
	But what about the distinct character of Quebec's culture and 
what about the sectors which are under exclusive provincial 
jurisdiction according to the Constitution of 1867? The bill is 
totally silent on that. The government is deliberately trying to 
hide that reality.  The old centralizing reflex of the federal 
government is still just as strong. The government persists in
<P>
trying to fool Canadians and Quebecers. Obviously, this new 
department tries to bury the specific character of Quebec's 
culture by progressively diluting it in a hypothetical Canadian 
culture which is, would you believe, unique and multicultural.
<P>
	Make no mistake about it: The mandate of the Department of 
Canadian Heritage is twofold. Indeed, it must create from 
scratch an artificial Canadian identity based on Canada's 
multi-ethnic mosaic and, consequently, that identity must be 
multicultural. However, that identity and that feeling of 
belonging based on bilingualism and multiculturalism sounds 
hollow to Quebecers.
<P>
	That double mandate goes totally against Quebec's 
fundamental interests, since it rejects the distinct and specific 
character of Quebec's culture. The hon. member for Outremont 
talked about complementarity, but he should have used the word 
overlapping.
<P>
	Such is the new federal cultural policy: A policy aimed at 
levelling out everything with a steamroller!
<P>
	On June 21, the hon. member for Rimouski-Témiscouata 
said in this House, and I quote: ``The concept of Canadian 
identity does not include the Quebec identity. In fact, its purpose 
is to assimilate or even deny it''.
<P>
	The new Canadian multicultural identity which the 
government is trying to impose is in fact a ploy to acculturate 
Quebecers. Even worse is the fact that it will not slow down the 
growing assimilation of French speaking people who live 
outside Quebec.
<P>
	In the promotion of this glorious Canadian multicultural 
mosaic, the government is rather quick to forget the concept of 
two founding nations. The Liberals, both as party and 
government, recognize the first nations but do not recognize the 
Quebec nation. As I said: If there is an Acadian community, 
there is also a Quebec nation. In June, the current Prime 
Minister stated, regarding the operations of CBC, that there is an 
act regulating these operations and that he would ask the 
corporation to comply with it.
<P>
	Among the requirements contained in this legislation, there is 
an obligation to inform people of the benefits related to our 
country. However, Canada is not the only one financing CBC. 
Quebec also pays its fair share, but has hardly any say in the 
administrative decisions of that federal institution.
<P>
	Let us not forget that, in recent years, numerous regional TV 
stations in Quebec, including Rimouski, Matane and Sept-Îles, 
had to shut down their operations. In addition to being 
underprivileged in terms of resource allocation, Quebec is about 
to absorb more than its fair share of budget restrictions. For 
example, <I>Prime Time News</I>, the 9 p.m. TV newscast on the CBC, 
has an annual budget of $15 million, or $60,000 per show. By  
comparison, the SRC budget for <I>Le Téléjournal</I> and <I>Le Point</I> in 
Quebec barely exceeds $8 million.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7286"> 7286 </A></B>
<P>
	In a brief submitted yesterday to the Standing Committee on 
Canadian Heritage, Mrs. France Dauphin, from the Coalition for 
the Defense of the French CBC network, the raised a number of 
issues. For example, investment in programs per hour of 
broadcast time has increased by approximately $7,000 as far as 
the English network is concerned, but only marginally in the 
case of the French network. In just five years, from 1987 to 
1992, investment rose from $30,500 to $37,500 at the CBC 
while rising from $17,500 to $18,300 at SRC. In other words, a 
mere five per cent increase for the French network, as compared 
to a 20 per cent increase for the English network. What does this 
mean? It will become obvious later.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation has made strategic 
choices that favoured the English network programming over 
that of the French network. These choices were made in spite of 
the objective the CRTC had set for the CBC in February 1987, 
i.e. to strike a fair and equitable balance between production, 
distribution and the scheduling of regional and network 
programs, on both networks.
<P>
	In addition, over $380 million were recently invested in 
building new headquarters in Toronto. Jean-François Lisée 
wrote in <I>Le Tricheur</I> that we can see how, in spite of Trudeau's 
efforts to attach a Canadian identity to Quebecers, the 
inclination to go the opposite way is strong and resists the 
hazards of election policy. In 1990, 59 per cent of the people of 
Quebec perceived themselves as Quebecers first, 28 per cent as 
French Canadians and nine per cent as Canadians.
<P>
	In fact, it is normal for Canada to describe itself more and 
more as an English-speaking multicultural entity in an attempt 
to differentiate itself from its American neighbour.
<P>
	At the same time, it is not considered either normal or 
legitimate by this centralizing administration for Quebec-a 
clearly defined nation, the cultural vitality of which is 
recognized around the world, a truly distinct nation on the basis 
of its specific culture and its language among other things-to 
promote its own culture and specificity. It does not require a 
constitutional amendment to do so.
<P>
	Finally, the multicultural Canadian identity. The issue of 
multiculturalism, which is to say the least debatable, must not 
be overlooked.
<P>
	Professor Claude Corbo, dean of the Université du Québec in 
Montreal, concludes it is a failure. According to Corbo, the 
solicitude shown by the federal government for ethnic 
communities is suspicious. He says that such a policy could well 
exacerbate the minorization or the trivialization of the Quebec 
identity.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that, in Quebec, the principle of 
ethnic diversity must center around the French dimension of our 
culture which is present in all of our institutions and serves as a 
basis for Quebec's specificity. Above all however, structures are 
required to facilitate the integration of immigrants into their 
host society.
<P>
	So, I intend to support the amendment put forth by my hon. 
colleague from Rimouski-Témiscouata, asking for the bill to be 
withdrawn and deferred to the Standing Committee on Canadian 
Heritage.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to address the House in relation to 
Bill C-53 and the amendment put forward by my colleague from 
the Bloc. I am supporting the amendment but for very different 
reasons from those put forward by the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	Apparently the operative word in the whole bill is 
reorganization, but in light of recent events perhaps the 
operative word we should be discussing this morning is 
resignation.
<P>
	It appears the minister in charge of the Department of 
Canadian Heritage tabled a letter this morning which indicates 
he had approached the CRTC concerning specific licensing of a 
special language radio program. The fact that the document was 
stamped with the word ``intervention'' causes great concern. 
The fact that the letter was written on the minister's letterhead 
also causes great concern.
<P>
	I join with the many Canadians who last night and this 
morning called for the minister's resignation. It is unfortunate 
to see this type of intervention in a quasi-judicial branch under 
the minister's control. I hope he will reconsider his decision to 
stay on as minister and will do the honourable thing and step 
aside.
<P>
	As has been stated by my colleague for Calgary-Southeast, 
the bill should be renamed the special interest funding bill 
because that will be the effect of the legislation. Bill C-53 will 
create a ministry comprised of all the odds and ends of the 
government intervention in Canadian culture under a minister 
whose sole responsibility is to dole out handfuls of cash to 
whichever groups the Liberal government has decided to favour.
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	The scope of this ministry would be large and sprawling with 
at least 24 areas of responsibility that include-now hang on to 
your hats: the Canada Council; the CBC; Telefilm Canada; the 
Museum of Civilization across the river; the Museum of Nature; 
and the CRTC which I have spoken about. Also included are: the 
National Archives; the National Arts Centre; the National 
Battlefields Commission; the National Film Board; the National 
Gallery; the National Library; the Museum of Science and 
Technology; the Public Service Commission; the Advisory 
Council on the Status of Women, as well as  Status of Women 
Canada; amateur sports and official games; official languages; 
Parks Canada; Historic Sites and Monuments; Canadian Race 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7287"> 7287 </A></B>
<P>
Relations Foundation; Canadian Heritage Languages Institute; 
multiculturalism; and copyright.
<P>
	This is an unruly collection of agencies which has been 
lumped together arbitrarily. It truly is the ministry of lost souls, 
a ministry put together consisting of many irrelevant and 
outdated agencies with nowhere else to go. That being said, 
there are some valid reasons for the government to have a role in 
a select few of those areas outlined. However in the majority of 
cases those functions could be performed more effectively in 
either the private sector or by individual Canadians and private 
organizations.
<P>
	All this government intervention costs Canadian taxpayers 
over $4.4 billion. We have put forward constructive suggestions 
that would save over $1.6 billion in program spending alone. 
Once the spinoff reductions in the bureaucracy and overhead are 
factored in the savings could go much higher.
<P>
	I want to focus the remainder of my remarks today on the 
multicultural funding programs within the department. My 
colleague from Port Moody-Coquitlam asked the government 
for a list of multicultural grants given in 1993. What she 
received was astounding. It was a 703-page document listing 
over 1,300 separate grants totalling over $25 million. Most of 
these grants are questionable. I will mention one or two which I 
think my constituents in Kindersley-Lloydminster would be 
very concerned to discover that their hard earned tax dollars 
have gone to pay for.
<P>
	One grant was to the Toronto Arts Council. It received 
$25,000 for phase two of a national forum on cultural equity in 
Toronto as well as the training of a pool of cultural equity 
consultants. What in the world does cultural equity have to do 
with reality? What does it have to do with the real world? Also, 
the Folk Arts Council of St. Catharines Multicultural Centre 
received $28,000 for a community needs assessment. The 
council was to carry out a community needs assessment and 
prepare a strategic plan.
<P>
	It really makes one wonder what the priorities of this 
government are when it would support initiatives like those 
when the health care system is starved for funds. We are closing 
hospitals in Saskatchewan in part because the federal share of 
health care funding is being so drastically reduced.
<P>
	A few months ago I received notice of an application for one 
of these grants from within my own province of Saskatchewan. I 
was sent a letter from the Ukrainian Canadian Congress, 
Saskatchewan Provincial Council asking for a grant of $45,000. 
The money was to help perform a needs assessment study 
intended to determine the following four things.
<P>
	First is that access to information about government 
departments, agencies and services is available to  Ukrainian 
seniors. Second is the development of outreach programs to 
address specific health care and sociocultural needs, interesting. 
The
<P>
third one is a real winner. Can we believe this? It is for the 
development of seniors advocacy and lobbying skills; $45,000 
to teach seniors how to lobby the government. The seniors I 
know are very intelligent. I do not think they need that kind of 
education. Fourth is another lulu. It is to develop a model for 
ethnocultural wellness. Why in heaven's name do we need a 
grant for Ukrainian seniors to help them develop a model for 
ethnocultural wellness?
<P>
	This is quite amusing. The NDP jumped on the special interest 
bandwagon immediately. The member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake wrote to me and implored me to 
support such a giveaway. So much for the NDP discovering its 
roots and returning to reality.
<P>
	I wrote to the Minister of Canadian Heritage, the minister who 
is under so much criticism today, to inform him that I did not 
support the approval of that application. I did so for three main 
reasons.
<P>
	First, I reject the premise that health care needs should be met 
on the basis of ethnicity. If a senior citizen in Canada or any 
citizen for that matter is in need of health care services those 
services should be available on the basis of need, not based on 
any ethnocultural criteria. If you are sick or you break your leg 
on the job, it does not matter if you are a Canadian of Ukrainian, 
Polish, Chinese or Norwegian descent, I would think the doctor 
is going to treat your case in pretty much the same way.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	I can see no reason for special health care for Ukrainians. 
Most of the Canadians of Ukrainian descent who I know would 
be deeply offended to learn they were being categorized as a 
special case. They are proud Canadians, proud of their culture 
and very capable of looking after their needs and interests 
without the paternalistic help of the government.
<P>
	Second, giving people tax dollars to teach them how to lobby 
for more tax dollars is not effective stewardship of Canadians' 
tax money. Unfortunately the government does this sort of thing 
all the time, but I would not and I will not endorse this activity.
<P>
	Third, I felt that the $45,000 the Ukrainian Canadian 
Congress was asking for would have been put to much better use 
if it were spent on health care in general. This way it would 
benefit all senior citizens, in fact all Canadians in Saskatchewan 
and the rest of Canada regardless of ethnicity.
<P>
	The minister's office was kind enough to phone me and let me 
know that the grant was being approved anyway. This is one 
more example where the government makes a show of involving 
individual MPs but goes ahead and does what it wants in any 
case.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7288"> 7288 </A></B>
<P>
	I am curious as to why the minister approved the grant. It 
may be the minister feels there is some legitimate reason that 
Canadians of varying ethnic backgrounds need different health 
care services. Maybe he thinks that. It may be the minister feels 
that giving people tax money so they can lobby for more tax 
money is an effective spending restraint.
<P>
	Perhaps the minister is naive, but I believe the objective here 
is more politically motivated. It is clear that all these special 
interest and lobby group grants are being done in a crass old 
style politics attempt to buy the support of Canadians with their 
own money. It is the old politics.
<P>
	In fact the entire Department of Canadian Heritage is nothing 
more than an entrenchment of special interest funding and 
Liberal giveaways. That is why I am supporting the amendment 
to send the subject matter to the Standing Committee on 
Canadian Heritage. In the committee perhaps the wheat can be 
separated from the chaff. Perhaps the government can get out of 
the business and be told to get out of the business of designing 
culture and buying support with other people's money, often 
with their own money. We can save the taxpayers of Canada a lot 
of money in the process.
<P>
	There has been a lot of talk about Reform versus the status 
quo. I appeal to members and say that status quo multicultural 
policy cheapens our rich and diverse culture. The Reform 
position of placing the onus on lower levels of government, 
private associations and individuals to preserve and promote 
their cultural heritage deepens and ensures the future of our rich 
and diverse culture. Let us deepen rather than cheapen the 
multicultural nature of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, how 
ironic that today is the day we are looking at the reorganization 
of this department, particularly in light of the allegations that 
have been made against the minister of this department. I once 
had a boss who told me that a fish always rots from the head 
down. Today we should see a reorganization of the department 
starting at the top.
<P>
	Last spring I sat in on the committee on Canadian heritage. I 
sat 10 feet away from the minister when he told us that agencies 
like the CRTC are to be at arm's length from the government. He 
has said it on countless occasions and now we are going to make 
him live up to his words.
<P>
	Implicit in that letter he sent no matter what he says because 
he is a minister of the crown is the fact that he is the one who 
approves along with cabinet orders in council for the positions 
on the CRTC. His department sets the guidelines. His 
department sets the budget for the CRTC.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	I remind the minister and the members across the way that it 
was not long ago when the hon. member for Sherbrooke was 
facing the same sort of situation. The leader of the Conservative 
Party was facing the same  situation and Liberals across the way 
screamed for his head. They got it. They should have. Now they 
should hold themselves to the same standards at least of the 
Mulroney government, a government that did not have very high 
standards.
<P>
	I encourage members across the way to get to their feet and 
tell the Prime Minister in no uncertain terms that this is 
absolutely not acceptable. I encourage them to move today 
while they still have a chance to cut their losses and ensure that 
no more damage is done to the credibility of the government.
<P>
	That is at the top of the department. I want to move through 
the department now and talk about some other issues. When we 
look at all the issues that are within that department; 
multiculturalism, CBC, status of women, the Canadian Heritage 
Languages Institute, the National Film Board, there are so many 
targets. It is an embarrassment of riches. So many boondoggles, 
so much waste, so little time.
<P>
	I want to talk in general about Canadian heritage and how it 
protects Canadian artists and the whole idea of government 
intervention in the artistic community. This is a relatively new 
occurrence in western civilization, to have a government 
involved in protecting particular artists, choosing some and 
saying they are worthy of the support of the government while 
others are not. In ancient times when patrons regularly 
supported artists, those artists were at least accountable to that 
patron. If they did not produce art work it was guaranteed they 
would not be supported again by that particular patron. Such is 
not the case in Canada.
<P>
	For instance, the Canada Council uses peer juries to select 
which artists should be worthy of support by the government. 
This is a closed system. It is like a bell jar, the jar they use in 
scientific experiments. There is no accountability to the public, 
the people who are paying the money. At the risk of repeating 
what I said the other day in a member's statement, they ``breathe 
each other's air''. We do not get input from regular people about 
what constitutes real art.
<P>
	It is well and fine for artists to produce art for their own 
pleasure but it should be at their own expense, not the expense of 
Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	Who does not stop and wonder about the huge distortion that 
government intervention in the arts community has had after 
they tour the National Gallery. I have talked on this issue before 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7289"> 7289 </A></B>
<P>
but I must repeat what I have stated because it is so utterly 
unbelievable.
<P>
	I remember distinctly the first time I went to the National 
Gallery. I was impressed with some of the art work. There were 
pieces of art work from classical artists which are universally 
accepted as great art. That rightfully belongs in a national 
gallery.
<P>
	I remember like it was yesterday walking into a huge room 
and seeing in the corner boxes of Brillo pads stacked to the 
ceiling. This was not a supply room. This was a display of art, 
believe it or not, in a corner, brightly coloured boxes of Brillo 
pads.
<P>
	In another room there was what I thought was some 
construction in progress. It was carpet underlay lying in the 
middle of the floor. This was a work of art according to the 
National Gallery. It was paid for by Canadian taxpayers. This 
piece of art, if you want to call it that, was called ``256 pieces of 
felt'' and it was a pile in the middle of the floor.
<P>
	Another room had bricks lying on the floor in a line coming 
out from the wall-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> At least they were in a line.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> ``At least they were in a line'' the hon. member 
says. This was also art work.
<P>
	If these people want to do this for their own pleasure, fine. If 
they want to put some underlay in the middle of their living 
room floor and marvel at it, that is great. We support that. On the 
other hand, if they expect Canadian taxpayers to shell out money 
so this can be displayed in the National Gallery it is crazy. The 
people are fed up with the waste in government. If it wants some 
areas where it can cut it can start with Canadian heritage. There 
is no end of waste in that department.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	I remember reading about Charles Dickens. In England in 
those days there was no support from the government for artists. 
One fall that great writer was pressed to come up with a new 
book because he had a large family to support. Christmas was 
coming and he needed some revenue. Therefore, this prolific 
writer, who was prolific probably because he knew that if he 
wanted to survive he had to produce these works of art, was 
facing this Christmas deadline and knew he had to get something 
out so he could have an income. Faced with those pressures and 
faced with the fact that he had to be excellent in what he 
produced if he wished to sell his book to have some money, he 
produced one of the great classics of all time ``A Christmas 
Carol''.
<P>
	I do not see why the principles of that time cannot apply today. 
Why do we have to have the Canada Council involved at every 
step of the way? People who have no business publishing a book 
because their work is not worthy are getting grants from the 
Canadian taxpayer to do it. That is crazy. I again urge the 
government to look at all these areas where it intervenes into the 
artistic community, to get out of there and allow real artists to 
blossom and do their thing.
<P>
	We have great artists in the country from every area of the 
artistic community. They will prosper irrespective of whether or 
not they get grants from the Canada Council or protection from 
the Ministry of Canadian Heritage. We do not need to worry 
about them. We do not need to feel that we are somehow inferior. 
We have shown time and again that we have people who can 
compete in the international community with respect to the 
whole Department of Canadian Heritage and artistic 
accomplishments.
<P>
	We have a deficit of $40 billion a year, a debt of $535 billion a 
year and the high taxes that go with that. Canadians used to have 
some disposable income to spend on art. By running up the 
deficit because of this ridiculous boondoggle of handing out 
grants, now they have less disposable income to go out and buy 
the art that we would all like to see produced. The government 
across the way is therefore cutting off access that Canadian 
people have to art.
<P>
	I urge the government not only to reorganize the department 
but to cut spending dramatically and reorganize it right at the top 
starting today with the minister.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am delighted 
to also add a few comments, thoughts and ideas on the bill.
<P>
	I cannot help but wonder why it is that we feel it is a legitimate 
role of government to pluck the pockets of the taxpayers by the 
coercive process called taxation without giving them a choice. 
We are forcing them against their will to support any and every 
cause which some bureaucrat or some deputy minister or some 
head of a department decides is worthy.
<P>
	My hon. colleague from Medicine Hat has just gone through 
some of these ridiculous decisions which have absolutely no 
defence in terms of representing the mainstream of Canadian 
society.
<P>
	I am one of those proud Canadians who was born here. I am a 
first generation Canadian. My parents did not speak English. My 
first language was neither English nor French. I could be called 
one of those ethnic immigrants although I was born in 
Saskatchewan, a point of which I am justly proud.
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
	When we were growing up we had absolutely no access to 
public funds. As a matter of fact, my grandfather would have 
dutifully declined if it had been offered because he firmly 
believed that it was his responsibility to provide for and look 
after his family.
<P>
	My grandfather and his sons, my dad and his brothers worked 
out at a very low wage in order to keep their identity and their 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7290"> 7290 </A></B>
<P>
pride. I am very happy that is my heritage. I learned too that hard 
work and self-effort was required in order to get ahead.
<P>
	When different people are able, by the spending power of the 
federal government, to merely access money at will and use it 
however they wish without accountability, whether or not it has 
any measure of support out there in the public, promotes and 
extends a standard of dependence. There is no excuse for that in 
the long run.
<P>
	We are sometimes criticized in the Reform Party for harping 
on the debt. I cannot think of anything that is more important. 
Whether it is an individual, a family, a business, a province, a 
municipality or a country, we need to be sound financially if we 
want to be sound in other ways.
<P>
	This morning I could not help but think of this when one of my 
colleagues from the Bloc was speaking. Perhaps part of the 
reason for the desire of divorce is the fact that we have such 
tremendous fiscal mismanagement. I read in a book not long ago 
that fiscal mismanagement and debt is one of the leading causes 
of divorce in families. Perhaps that is one of the reasons why 
Bloc members are representing a lack of trust and a lack of 
consideration for remaining in our Confederation.
<P>
	We need to start looking at the use of our federal moneys 
much more carefully than we do. This whole department is a 
sinkhole of money that does not go anywhere. I cannot 
overemphasize this any more than I just have.
<P>
	We have the problem of grants to different societal groups. I 
think about the past generations. In my area there are a number 
of Ukrainians and German speaking people as well as English 
speaking people in great numbers. Most of them, when they 
came out west, were independent, rugged pioneers. They would 
not accept handouts.
<P>
	We keep talking about how we want to be tolerant and loving, 
we want to be multicultural. I agree with that profoundly. We 
need to reach out and touch each other, as the good phrase goes. 
We are building resentment by these programs. One group asks 
for a grant and they get so much. Another group asks for a grant, 
but because they do not have as powerful a connection to the 
decision makers, the grant is less or perhaps is even denied.
<P>
	This can only produce one result. One group now resents the 
other group. The only real way of having a level playing field 
among all these different ethnic groups and promoting true 
ethnicity in our country is to treat them the same. Allow them to 
fund themselves at whatever rate they want to. Frankly most of 
the practice of ethnic culture does not require any money.
<P>
	I was proud the other day to attend the meeting in this city 
with the Greeks, the AHEPA, their educational society.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	They had put on a dinner and they wanted to inform us about 
their society. A wonderful thing happened. This was a formal 
occasion and those who could afford it-of course I was not 
among them-had tuxedos with black ties. It was a very elegant 
situation.
<P>
	Suddenly some of those people gathered around the piano. 
There was one person there playing piano and two or three 
people came and started singing. It did not take long until there 
were about 20 people crowded around the piano. In this formal 
setting this little informal occasion had arisen.
<P>
	We did not need a federal grant for that. That happened. It was 
spontaneous. It was genuine. It was real. I liked it. That is the 
kind of thing we need to promote. The federal government 
should be in the role of guaranteeing the freedom to speak in the 
country any language we want, guaranteeing the freedom to 
practise our culture any way we can legally. We ought not to be 
in the business of taking money and transferring it from the 
taxpayers, often against their will. We know there is an 
increasing resentment and a decreasing support for this 
involuntary taxation.
<P>
	We can help renew that trust of the Canadian people by 
reducing the amount of money that we take from them in order to 
promote and give grants to people without just cause.
<P>
	I want to say something about the CBC. My hon. colleague 
from the Bloc made mention of funding and that it was not 
equitable between French and English. I wrote it down while he 
was speaking that in the area whereof I speak, and this is just a 
statistical fact, the English speaking people in Alberta 
outnumber all of the others.
<P>
	We also have a great number of people who speak Ukrainian. 
There are German people and I believe the French place fourth, 
although they may now be even lower in numbers because of 
quite a bit of immigration from the Orient in recent years.
<P>
	We have a French television channel there, CBC. Most of the 
time it broadcasts the test pattern and plays nice music. I admit I 
sometimes watch it because I like the background music that is 
on while it displays the test pattern. That is other than the times 
it just has the 1,000 kilohertz signal.
<P>
	We fund that. I do not know how new my statistics are, 
probably two or three years ago, but only about one per cent of 
Albertans speak French, and of those if I remember correctly 
only one-quarter spoke French but not English.
<P>
	If our objective is to communicate with one another it is only 
important that we speak the same language. How I wish I could 
speak French so that I could debate and enter into discourse with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7291"> 7291 </A></B>
<P>
my colleagues to my right here. I wish I knew that language. 
Unfortunately when I was a youngster I did not learn it and I am 
discouraged at  trying now. It is difficult. It is so important for us 
to be able to communicate with one another. Spending federal 
money on promoting French broadcasting of the test pattern in 
Alberta makes no sense, absolutely none.
<P>
	I would like to see those funds, if continued to be expended, to 
be used in an area where at least the people hearing the 
programming can understand it and benefit from it.
<P>
	It is atrocious that when we have television and radio stations 
that make a profit-I am told by some of my contacts that radio 
these days is very competitive-we need to subsidize the CBC at 
the rate of over $1 billion per year. Surely we can get 
management in there that will produce a profit for the Canadian 
taxpayers and not be a continual drain.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the time to debate this reorganizational bill today.
<P>
<B>(1205 ) </B>
<P>
	I must start by mentioning what some of my colleagues have 
already brought to the attention of the House. I should bring to 
the attention of those listening to this debate and watching on 
television to the crisis within the department, starting right at 
the top.
<P>
	In <I>Quorum</I> I read a couple of days ago, although I do not 
remember the exact quote, where the minister said that we 
would now see a whole new way of protecting Canadian culture. 
A couple of days later we find out that the whole new way of 
protecting that culture involves personal letters from the 
minister on behalf of friends to the CRTC, an independent 
quasi-judicial body.
<P>
	That whole new way of protecting Canadian culture will not 
wash in the House or with the Canadian people. It did not wash 
with past ministers who tried that. We are probably seeing the 
first serious case that at the minimum the ethics commissioner 
should investigate. Preferably the honourable thing will happen 
here in the next few hours and we will see a minister step 
forward with his resignation. It is unfortunate but I think to clear 
the air this will be necessary.
<P>
	What is the cultural background of the country? We on the 
foreign affairs committee, of which I was member for a few 
months, found this to be a very controversial issue. Some would 
bring up the idea that culture is a personal thing, that it follows 
our actions, that it is a legacy and the heritage we pass down to 
the next generation. Other people would argue that culture only 
thrives when the government is behind it and spends money on it 
and forces it, when the government regulates it and decides 
which culture is good and which is bad.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois brings the issue up very forcefully that 
the Canadian federal government has very little reason to be 
involved in promoting and selecting the culture Canadians 
would enjoy.
<P>
	This is not a job for the federal government. The federal 
government's job is to protect against discrimination, to ensure 
that people are not discriminated against because of their ethnic 
background, not persecuted or prosecuted unduly because of 
their choices.
<P>
	If individuals, lower levels of government, the provinces and 
other people and private organizations want to enhance culture, 
then by all means that is where it should be done. For the federal 
government to spend billions of dollars on what its idea of 
culture should be does not wash with the Bloc Quebecois and it 
does not wash with me and the Reform Party. Culture is not 
something a bureaucrat can choose from.
<P>
	The Canadian film board has put forward several pieces of 
questionable, dubious trash and these are now available to the 
school boards. I told witnesses who came before the committee: 
``If you ever got out of the cloistered halls where you are making 
these decisions and to Fraser Valley East where I live and told 
the citizens there who do not understand this difficult issue that 
what they need is a government grant to the Canadian film board 
to show how lesbian relationships are the way of the future and 
that this is an excellent thing to promote, the citizens would 
want to do the old tar and feather routine''. They would say that 
if somebody wanted to put out that film, by all means. There are 
probably thousands of those films put out every year. Is it the job 
of the federal government to support that? The answer of course 
is absolutely not.
<P>
	We are going in the hole financially-in many ways in the 
country but financially especially-$110 million per day. How 
can a government that says it is trying to wrestle the deficit and 
debt to the ground continue to spend money on discretionary 
spendings when some priority items in the country are not being 
funded properly?
<P>
	It asks students to take on more student loans because it has 
run out of money for them. There is still money for the Canadian 
heritage society and every other boondoggle in the country, but 
no more money for students.
<P>
<B>(1210 ) </B>
<P>
	We tell the provinces that they are going to have to cough up a 
bigger percentage of the health care costs, but we still have 
money to expand the museum in one of the minister's 
departments next year. We do not have any money to increase 
the basic pension requirements but we have money for the CBC 
to the tune of $1 billion a year.
<P>
	People are rejecting that wholesale, as they well should. The 
other day I told members a story and I know how much they 
enjoyed it; we had laughs over that story. I would like to tell 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7292"> 7292 </A></B>
<P>
another story. This one is not quite so  funny but it is a true story. 
Again it is a very personal story involving my father.
<P>
	My father was born into a community that looked after its own 
cultural background. It was a Swedish community back in the 
prairies in Minnedosa, Manitoba. Many a happy hour I spent 
back there visiting my aunts, uncles and other relatives. It was 
basically a Swedish community. It did the Swedish thing. It still 
has pickled herring and a few things from the Swedish past. I 
enjoy some of the heritage on that side of the family.
<P>
	My dad's dad, my grandfather, died when dad was only six 
years old. Really the cultural things became very important. The 
community things, the family things became very important 
because that is where my father was raised. He had no father. In 
those days he had to pick up the support where he could. He got 
the support from the community.
<P>
	When my dad was 17 years old and the second world war was 
on, he left that community and went to Winnipeg to enlist. He 
was only 17 years old. He was not old enough legally to sign up 
but being a big, strapping boy from the prairies and probably 
well fed-maybe underfed, I do not know-he looked the part 
but the enlistment guy told him he could not sign up and that he 
needed his mother's signature.
<P>
	Dad took the forms and went out around the block to the back 
of the building, forged his mother's signature, went around to 
another door and came back in and enlisted as a 17-year-old.
<P>
	There is a whole other story that goes with that but the point 
about the cultural thing in this is that dad never talked much 
about the army days. He spent a couple of years in. He did not 
have to go overseas and he made it through those war years okay, 
but the thing that stuck out in his mind and the only thing that 
dad talked about was that he did not think he did a very brave 
thing. It was what millions of Canadians were prepared to do.
<P>
	The form on which he had to forge his mother's signature 
asked what ethnic background he was. This was back in 1943. 
Dad said that he just put a big line through there and said: ``I am 
Canadian. That is what I am. I am not a hyphenated Canadian. I 
am not less a Canadian. I am not a half Canadian or anything 
else. I am a Canadian''.
<P>
	When people have a strong sense of their Canadianism, what 
they are, they do not need government subsidies. My father 
certainly did not. People in my community certainly do not.
<P>
	An hon. member over here mentioned a case a while ago about 
someone playing a piano who looked up and said: ``Does 
anybody happen to know this song?''. Out of the crowd came 
about 40 or 50 people singing it in German. I do not even know 
what the song is because I do not speak German but they sang a 
song in German. Then the crowd went back out, proud of its 
heritage.
<P>
	In Vancouver there will be the Chinatown festivities and so 
on. There will be the dragon dances and all that kind of thing. 
That has been going on for decades and decades without 
government help. When culture is part of a person they say: ``I 
am a proud Canadian. I happen to have some of my background, 
my traditions, my heritage''.
<P>
	Members will find Canadians say: ``I do not need government 
support for that. I am a proud Canadian. I have my own culture. 
It is my business. The government should not intrude into my 
life or dictate what I can watch on television or listen to on the 
radio. It is my business. Stay out of it''.
<P>
	When there are billions and billions of dollars involved, it is 
time that the Canadian government decided what its priorities 
are. The priorities are not in this heritage department. The 
priorities are health, pensions and the best education for our 
next generation. It is not the boondoggles that we see time after 
time in the Canadian heritage department.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	I am disappointed to find that in this reorganization plan there 
is not a bottom line that reads: ``This department will be 
severely curtailed''. Unless that is in there I cannot believe that 
any reorganizational plan will be an improvement. The first 
reorganization of course as I mentioned earlier should be a 
change in ministers. Then we would see how Canadian heritage 
should be maintained in the hearts and lives of individual 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to rise today to speak on Bill C-53, 
a reorganization bill.
<P>
	I would like to follow up on what my colleagues on this side of 
the House have been saying and relate it back to the election of 
one year ago when I ran successfully against a Liberal. I heard 
the words of the Liberals during that election campaign, things 
like: ``This government, a Liberal government, will be different 
than a Conservative government. It will be more accountable''. 
They said they would be more accountable.
<P>
	Today the headline reads ``Minister aids radio licence bid at 
CRTC''. That is what we see today in our headlines. An apology 
from the minister is not good enough. The minister says that all 
he did was act as a member of Parliament. A minister of the 
crown is not an ordinary member of Parliament.
<P>
	In March he wrote a letter to Keith Spicer asking him to give 
due consideration to an application for a 24-hour Greek 
language radio station. Also, which he did not mention this 
morning in his statement, he asked Mr. Spicer to keep him 
abreast of developments, adding: ``Please do not hesitate to 
contact me if you require any further information''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7293"> 7293 </A></B>
<P>
	If this is not interference, I do not know what is. This is 
blatant interference. I would also like to mention that the letter 
sent back to the minister from the commission's secretary 
general said: ``Thank you for your letter of support''.
<P>
	One thing everyone in this business should learn is 
perception. Perception is everything. If the perception at the 
CRTC was that this minister was supporting and if the general 
public and the people of Canada also feel strongly that the 
minister was supporting then the minister has an obligation to do 
the honourable thing.
<P>
	Tomorrow in the House we will be debating Bill C-210, a 
recall bill. If this minister and government do not bring 
accountability to the House, members on this side will certainly 
try to bring accountability here by introducing such legislation 
as recall. We know that we will receive some support from that 
side of the House. I have talked to members on that side who are 
very supportive of this. I hope the minister will do the 
honourable thing.
<P>
	With regard to the bill, I have a few comments I would like to 
make, in particular about bilingualism and official languages. I 
get a little frustrated when I find out that the reason 
governments, including the government, sometimes spend 
money is to promote particular groups or particular people in 
this country. I know the member is very interested in this 
subject.
<P>
<B>(1220 ) </B>
<P>
	I am going to talk about the Department of National Defence 
in the province of Quebec for a couple of moments. The 
Department of National Defence feels it is very important to 
encourage francophones to join the Canadian Armed Forces, in 
the navy. In order to do that the government felt it was important 
to build a fleet school in Quebec City. It spent millions and 
millions of dollars on a fleet school. The reason for this, and 
officials from the Department of National Defence have been 
quite open, is that it wants more francophones in the Canadian 
Armed Forces. Why spend millions and millions of dollars on 
that item? Not only is it building a fleet school there, but four of 
the twelve new coastal patrol vessels will be in Quebec City.
<P>
	We have the largest coastline in the world to protect and we 
are going to have four of our coastal patrol vessels, on which we 
are again spending millions of dollars, in Quebec City with a 
fleet school.
<P>
	Why do we not promote people from the province of Alberta? 
How about farmers in Alberta? Maybe we should promote them 
being in the navy. Why not build a fleet school on the Bow 
River? Maybe that is a good idea. Maybe we should do that in 
order to encourage Alberta farmers to join the navy.
<P>
	I get laughs from all sides of the House. They are right. It is 
absolutely ridiculous that we are doing that. People in Quebec, 
Alberta, Newfoundland and across the country have the 
opportunity to join the Canadian Armed Forces, and in 
particular the navy if they want to,  but we spend millions and 
millions of dollars to build a fleet school in Quebec City.
<P>
	I might point out that the citizens of Quebec City do not even 
support it. The mayor of Quebec City at one time said that it did 
not even fit in with the landscape of the city. That is absolutely 
absurd. The people of Canada will not put up with this nonsense 
any more.
<P>
	Official languages in the country, yes. There should be 
freedom of speech. There is no question about it. It should be 
respected in the House of Commons and the other place as well. 
However, we are spending millions and billions. We cannot even 
get the actual figures for bilingualism. It is said to be $310 
million a year. That is absolutely absurd. It is probably closer to 
a billion or more dollars per year that is spent on bilingualism in 
the country. It has been proven it does not work. It creates walls 
and it divides people. It has not worked and it will not work. We 
have to move toward something new, a new approach, a new way 
of doing things to respect freedom of speech.
<P>
	Multiculturalism is something that I feel was created with all 
the best intentions in the world. They wanted to bring people 
from other countries into Canada in the hope that it would bring 
people closer together.
<P>
	It has put people in separate little rooms of the country. It has 
separated us all. It has divided us and split us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Nonsense.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> The hon. member says no, no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I said ``nonsense''. Quote me correctly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> It gives specific ethnic groups pockets of money 
that other Canadians cannot have. It is not right.
<P>
	The country should be looking at ensuring equality. That is 
what the government should be doing. It should not have a 
department of multiculturalism. It should be working against 
discrimination, ensuring that all Canadians, regardless of race, 
religion and gender, are equal. It does not matter. This is a 
tremendous waste of money.
<P>
	In closing I will say that hon. members on the other side of the 
House are not stupid; they are just wrong. They are simply 
wrong.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
add to what some of my colleagues have had to say here today on 
culture and heritage.
<P>
	I have a deep appreciation for Canada's culture and our 
heritage. I have many generations of ancestors in Canada. They 
started out in the maritimes and came to British Columbia over a 
period of 150 years. Contrary to what some might say or think, I 
believe that Reformers and Canadians in general have a deep 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7294"> 7294 </A></B>
<P>
appreciation of our heritage. I believe that Canadians for the 
most part like art, films, and books. They like many of the things 
our minister of cultural heritage is promoting.
<P>
	Most of us express our desire and enjoyment of our culture 
and art through our personal decisions. We make decisions as to 
what we are going to buy, which art for our homes and which 
books to read. We visit art galleries when we choose. In general 
through the marketplace we express our appreciation with our 
money in the forums where we feel that it is appropriate to do so.
<P>
	The operative word here is marketplace. The marketplace is 
the proper place to determine whether art is saleable, whether it 
is desirable and whether the people who are creating it should be 
supported.
<P>
	What we have in Canada is government directed heritage and 
cultural policy that ignores the market altogether. The 
government funded cultural community needs taxpayers' 
money to survive because it cannot convince people to buy its 
products on their own. It is not successful in the marketplace.
<P>
	If writers want my money and the Canadian taxpayers' money 
they can write books that Canadian taxpayers will buy. If artists 
want my money they can create art that I and Canadian taxpayers 
will buy. If film makers want my money they can create films 
that I will pay money to see and they will therefore be 
successful.
<P>
	These people do not need to convince me to buy their art or 
their books or pay to see their films. They can go to Ottawa and 
convince the government to fund their projects and their 
initiatives and I as a taxpayer along with millions of others from 
coast to coast who do not agree with the kind of products these 
people are producing are forced through a coercive taxation 
system to support it in any event.
<P>
	This is why we have a National Art Gallery that is full of 
goofy paraphernalia that common sense Canadians would never 
ever buy. We have so-called treasures in our National Art 
Gallery. I come from the construction industry. People in the 
construction industry tell me that the notorious painting ``Voice 
of Fire'' could be created in about one-half day by a couple of 
good painters.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Three minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> Three minutes with a spray gun. Yet the 
government has been spending millions and millions of dollars 
to acquire these goods and put them in our National Art Gallery. 
We have at times hung paintings and writings on the walls of that 
gallery that some Canadians would indeed believe to be 
bordering on pornographic. They would not let their children 
have these at home, yet they are confronted with them when they 
visit our National Art Gallery.
<P>
	Why? Because the elite have determined that this is good for 
us without our consent. They take our tax dollars to support 
these artists when clearly Canadians never would.
<P>
	The Reform Party and I say it is time to get the government 
out of the business of heritage, out of the business of culture and 
let the marketplace establish what people want and what they do 
not want.
<P>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
	It is very simple. If somebody produces something that has 
value and is desirable, Canadians will buy it. But when we have 
people who can go to the government, get grants and be funded 
through a coercive taxation system with no regard for whether 
Canadians actually want this paraphernalia, we are going to 
have what we have right now, a tremendous waste of Canadian 
taxpayers' money and a collection of what I consider to be, and I 
think many people consider to be, nonsense in our National 
Gallery.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
generally not considered an expert on culture and the heritage 
department. I am a farmer from Saskatchewan. However I do 
read. I do write. I do look at art. I do watch plays. I do watch 
television and all the things that all Canadians do.
<P>
	In this discussion we should remind ourselves that cultural 
pursuits are an expression of all of society and they have always 
had difficulty being recognized for what they are trying to do.
<P>
	We have heard a number of speeches this morning stating that 
if the market will not support it then it should not be produced. 
Yet when I look back at my very modest understanding of the 
history of artistic endeavour, I see a great many works that are 
now considered to be the epitome of that genre of art. It would 
not have been accepted by the market in the day it was produced. 
It was very controversial and yet because the state or the church 
was determined to pay the artist to do the work and support the 
artist in his or her endeavour it was produced.
<P>
	People asked why waste money painting the Sistine Chapel 
ceiling, paying an artist for the years and years it takes to 
produce that stuff. When it was finished the population was agog 
because Michelangelo had painted some of the people without 
as many clothes on as they thought there should be. While the 
church and the Pope had financed the project, they did succumb 
to popular pressure and have him come back and paint over some 
parts of it.
<P>
	However without the backing of the state or the church-in 
that case the church was collecting money from all of the 
population-without a firm commitment to that artist, we would 
not know Michelangelo ever existed. He is still considered to be 
one of the greatest painters and sculptors of all time.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7295"> 7295 </A></B>
<P>
	That is just one example. We have many in Canada to which 
I am sure people in the artistic community could point. Because 
most of my friends of the Reform Party are from western 
Canada I would just mention the name William Kurelek 
.Without some assistance from Canadian governments we 
probably would not realize that William Kurelek was a great 
talent in his own right. He was considered kind of a nut case 
by his colleagues and the people who knew him, but some 
people in the artistic community convinced others he should 
receive financial support, so we got the paintings that he 
produced in his lifetime.
<P>
	We tend to think that Heritage Canada is only supporting 
experimental art and playing with new ideas, that they support 
exotica or things that are quite foolish. We have heard quite a lot 
of some of those perceived to be foolish things. Not being 
terribly modern and culturally aware, some of those seem a little 
foolish to me as well, but we have to be prepared to make those 
kinds of experiments if we are going to move forward as a 
society.
<P>
	As we have only eight to ten minutes each to speak I do not 
want to spend too much time on this, but we should remind 
ourselves that some of what Heritage Canada does with its 
grants and its money is quite mundane. If we pulled back all the 
support the department gives, even my friends in the Reform 
Party would up on their feet crying about the interference that 
had been precipitated by the pulling back of those funds.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	As an example, I have in my community a second newspaper 
that started up in the last few years which portrays a very right 
wing point of view. My friends in the Reform Party would love 
the editorials. Basically the reason for the newspaper is to put 
those editorials and those opinions in front of the general public 
in that community. Because this lady has these extreme views 
she has trouble getting advertisers to support the paper.
<P>
	She wanted to set up a second paper and keep it going. She had 
started one up in a neighbouring community which was in 
danger of folding so she took over the management of it again. I 
got a call from her to say she was having trouble getting the 
postal subsidy needed to keep both newspapers going. This 
comes from, guess where? Heritage Canada. As I recall it is 
about 88 cents per paper per week. The paper cannot operate and 
cannot circulate this other opinion in those communities without 
the support of Heritage Canada.
<P>
	While she is an avowed believer in letting the market be 
determined, she was very concerned as well about the duality of 
these arguments we get into and the fact that she might not be 
able to get a grant from Heritage Canada because she was 
starting up a second paper and policies were changing. This in 
effect would be a restriction of freedom of speech. Freedom of 
speech is only one forum of the freedom of expression our  
societies and the tribes we have come from feel is the root of our 
existence.
<P>
	If we are going to have freedom of expression it has to go 
beyond just producing newspapers with a point of view. It 
ultimately has to include putting paintings on ceilings, even 
though it was thought to be a stupid place to put a painting, and 
living with the kind of criticism that even that glorious work in 
the Sistine Chapel got when it was performed. Sometimes 
backing off from criticism has happened, with a little paint here 
and there to cover up what the general public is opposed to and 
making adjustments but not by withdrawing all support from 
society in general.
<P>
	I hope in opposing the restructuring of Heritage Canada that 
some of my friends in the House do not mean that all forms of 
support would stop. Even as a group, we are not wise enough to 
recognize a potential talent or a product of the artistic mind that 
will fly and be famous for centuries.
<P>
	One time as a farm boy I was able to get to Paris for a day or 
two and go through the Louvre. There are many works I 
remember of course. Everyone sees the ``Mona Lisa'' and 
wonders at the Dutch masters and the works of the French, the 
Spanish and the Italians. However, the one thing I personally 
admired was some of the sculpture in stone from the early Greek 
period. Some of this stuff weighs thousands of pounds. The art is 
so great it appears as if these winged creatures will take off 
momentarily. They look as light as a feather, they are ethereal. 
They almost look like lace, but they are stone and weigh 
thousands of pounds. Nobody knows who did that work. But we 
still have it and we still admire it.
<P>
<B>(1240 ) </B>
<P>
	Some time thousands of years ago, some king or priest or 
bishop or whoever helped to finance this work of art. It was 
probably criticized by a few people in the street or maybe all the 
people in the street as a waste of public funds for keeping this 
poor sculptor in food and drink for the time it took him or her to 
produce it. Nobody knows who produced it and yet millions 
have appreciated the thought and the expertise and the feeling 
that went with it.
<P>
	To be so careful with our dollars and cents that we lose all 
common sense has to be something we avoid. I hope for just a 
few political moments, we will let common sense prevail and 
not just follow public demand. The public demand to stop 
spending is always there from the taxpayers' side of our psyche. 
We also must remember we have more than that in our 
individuality and in our group consciousness and in our group 
needs. We 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7296"> 7296 </A></B>
<P>
must recognize that this also includes recognizing freedom of 
expression and supporting it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am surprised 
that this is a bill of such profound importance as I detect from 
the opposite members.
<P>
	I wanted to rise on Bill C-53 with a specific interest. The 
interest is this. Why would the bill come to the House now? I 
would like to ask that rhetorical question. Why is the bill in front 
of us now?
<P>
	I have listened to my Liberal colleagues speak very 
eloquently about a fairly major review of much of the 
government's operations. In my view the bill would fit very well 
into a fairly significant review of those operations.
<P>
	I looked actually for the department to give some specific 
recognition that there is some controversy here. The controversy 
has been heightened by the minister's actions. Those actions 
might provide a lightning rod for the Canadian public in terms of 
his department.
<P>
	Why now? Why would the government bring in a bill on 
multiculturalism before a major program review? I am not sure I 
can answer that. I ask for some advice from my colleagues 
across the way.
<P>
	I listened just a moment ago to an eloquent discussion of how 
the elites in our society should be the ones to provide our 
cultural heritage for us. I reject that allegation. I listened to how 
a king, a pope, a prince, someone with tremendous recognition 
of value looked after the artistic community, looked after the 
needs, wants and wishes of the artistic community.
<P>
	I reflect on the individuals in our society today who are 
pushing the cultural agenda. Who are those individuals? They 
are individuals who have been elected to public office. Were 
they elected to public office to produce artistic works, to decide 
what had merit?
<P>
	My constituents did not elect me to do that. They elected me 
to provide some very specific leadership on issues that had 
nothing to do with culture, nothing to do with language. They 
asked me to come to Parliament to bring common sense to the 
debate here. I do not see common sense well displayed by 
individuals who say that the government should be the provider 
of cultural direction. Elites should not decide what is good for 
the public. The public should decide.
<P>
	What will the bill not do? If I am going to criticize a bill, I 
would like to criticize the things that it will not do and look for 
some positives. It will not streamline the department. I see no 
indication that there will be less administration nor do I see any 
indication that it will downsize the department. I do not see 
anything in the bill that will save the Canadian taxpayer money 
and why would I want to see those things happen? Why would I 
care if the department were streamlined, downsized and fiscally 
responsible?
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	I want that because I have come here hoping that our health 
care system can be saved. I have put a very high priority on our 
health care system. Looking at the health care system 
throughout our country I ask: What is happening to it? I see 
streamlining and downsizing. I see a decrease in administration. 
I see hospital beds being closed. I see surgical operating room 
time being diminished.
<P>
	I look at those things and I ask: Where is the priority in our 
country? Where is the priority that would allow a government to 
put this department, no downsizing, no streamlining, no 
decrease in administration, ahead of the health needs of 
Canadians?
<P>
	I look at the proportion of dollars that the party in government 
puts toward health care. I have watched those funds drop in the 
last 10 years. Federal government funding has gone from some 
30 per cent of health care dollars down to 22 per cent and I am 
sorry to report it is still falling. That is wrong.
<P>
	If there were a prioritization of issues for the government, the 
department would not have high priority. It should not have high 
priority when we face the financial situation we are in today. I 
call for and plead the government to change its priorities, to 
actually reverse the momentum toward things like this that do 
not have long term significance, that will not help the patient 
with cancer and will not help the mother with a problem 
pregnancy. It will do none of those things.
<P>
	Where do I come from in a personal cultural sense? My own 
background is one-half English, one-quarter Irish and 
one-quarter Norwegian. I had a very close relationship with my 
Norwegian grandma. I actually lived with her when I went to 
university.
<P>
	She expressed in a very interesting way how she maintained 
her Norwegian background by saying: ``I maintained my 
Norwegian background by my honesty. I did not come to Canada 
to become a mini-Norwegian here; I came to Canada to become 
an honest citizen of Canada''. She had a cute little poem which is 
the only thing she reflected upon about her own particular 
ancestry. She decried the idea that somebody should help her 
look after her culture. ``I am a Canadian. I am a Canadian who 
came via Oyen to Edmonton to be just that, a Canadian''.
<P>
	I look at what I consider to be the scandal facing the 
government today with this department and its minister. For 
those watching on television, comments are coming from across 
the way that there is no scandal here but I would like to reflect on 
one precedent of scandal.
<P>
	One precedent when the Liberals sat in opposition is as 
follows: The member for Sherbrooke, the Minister of Justice at 
the time, made a phone call to a judge. Members sitting on the 
government side today called for that minister to resign. They 
called for his resignation because of a conflict of interest. A 
minister calling someone whom he had direct responsibility for 
was a  conflict of interest. The minister resigned. He did not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7297"> 7297 </A></B>
<P>
want to resign. It would have looked better for him if he could 
have said: ``I did not intend to influence the judge, I was just 
representing a constituent''. I think that was one of the 
comments I heard.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> This morning?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Yes, it came to me clearly. And where do 
we sit with this scandal today? A minister writes a letter to 
somebody under his direct responsibility. He owes his job to the 
minister. I see a straight line relationship there. Most Canadians 
can understand that.
<P>
	The minister has a direct responsibility, a direct 
understanding of that responsibility. The minister should follow 
the precedent that was established when the Liberals sat in 
opposition and called for the resignation of a minister.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Read the letters.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Now I hear there was a second letter 
written which obviates all responsibility. I would ask for a 
report on how soon that letter was written after the first.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Six months later.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Six months later could be called a 
covering of the backside.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> As soon as they knew the media was on it. As soon 
as the media got word of it that letter went out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Indeed that was my understanding. 
Should the minister resign? The Canadian people really should 
decide that. I wish there were a direct, specific mechanism for 
ministerial recall as well as member of Parliament recall.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to address Bill C-53, the reorganization of the Department 
of Canadian Heritage. I have two suggestions to make on this 
bill.
<P>
	First, the minister, or the new minister, should consider 
eliminating funding for multiculturalism to achieve a savings of 
$30 million to $40 million. Multiculturalism is creating 
divisiveness in the country. It is creating confusion and it is 
creating prejudice in the country. I will come back to this point 
shortly. The second suggestion is that the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage resign.
<P>
	Going back to my first suggestion on multiculturalism, I am a 
first generation immigrant of Hungarian parents born in 
Vöcklabruck, Austria. We came here in 1951. I was close to six 
years old. I am proud of my ethnic background. I am also proud 
to be Canadian today. The fact that we came to a new country, 
that we had to learn a new language and that we had to learn to 
get along with people were all things which helped develop and 
build my personal character and my outlook on life.
<P>
	Some of the rules we had back then were a lot better than the 
rules we have today. Many of the rules back then still allowed 
for some prejudice, still allowed for some confusion, still 
allowed for some divisiveness, but overall for all intents and 
purposes immigrants were welcomed into the country.
<P>
	Our current program of immigration which I do not want to 
dwell on leads to multiculturalism and the funding for the 
immigrants here. The various ethnocultural groups get funding 
to represent their specific ethnic groups and they are not even 
reaching out to the people they purport to represent.
<P>
	There was a food fair in Ottawa about three or four months 
ago. Various ethnic backgrounds and cultures were represented. 
I attended because I like to see various heritages and cultures. I 
like to try foods from different parts of the world as well.
<P>
	As I was circulating and meeting people visiting the various 
booths I came upon two different ethnic groups, one from 
Columbia and one from Asia. As I talked to them I revealed that 
I was a member of Parliament but I did not tell them that I was 
also an immigrant. During the course of our conversation I 
asked if they were associated with any of the ethnic groups and 
they said no. I asked if the groups were helping them and they 
said no.
<P>
	The family who came here from Columbia worked part time. 
They picked up any job they could. They went back to school 
and got themselves re-educated as engineers. As a matter of fact 
both of them work for the government. They have three children 
8, 10 and 11 years old, who are presently going to school in 
Ottawa. They are picked on and called names. The blatant 
discrimination is obvious. The rest of the kids in school have the 
impression they are being treated differently, that they are 
getting something they should not be getting.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	This is what I mean by divisiveness and the confusion we are 
creating. The intent of the program although it may have been 
honourable and worth while has certainly deteriorated to a point 
where it is not helping the ethnic groups that come here, it is 
hurting them.
<P>
	I really believe that funding to learn English is unnecessary. 
Funding to have them retain the language of the country they left 
is a complete waste of money. I still speak Hungarian. There was 
a 10-year period when I never uttered one word in Hungarian 
but I have retained and still remember quite a bit of it. I am not 
as fluent as I should be but I am proud of the fact that I can still 
speak it, that I am bilingual and do not speak just one language.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7298"> 7298 </A></B>
<P>
	Multiculturalism is not so much to save money but it is also 
to start to respect immigrants who come here, to work with 
them to fit into our society. Just throwing money at groups and 
organizations is not necessarily the best way of doing it.
<P>
	Some of the rules we apply to immigrants should be revisited. 
Some of the rules we had in the 1950s and 1960s could probably 
be reintroduced. Perhaps the government would like to strike a 
committee. It likes to strike committees; it is up to about 25 now. 
Perhaps it would like to strike number 26 and look into ways and 
means of improving multiculturalism and immigration and 
looking for ways and means not to just throw money at people 
but to help them fit into society through better mechanisms.
<P>
	The second suggestion I have for the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage is that he resign. The gentleman has had this position 
for a year. When he took his cabinet position he was told the 
same thing all ministers of the crown are told when they swear 
an oath of allegiance to uphold to the best of their ability their 
responsibilities. They are briefed on what is proper behaviour 
and proper conduct. They know full well when they accept that 
job what lines they are not supposed to cross over, what 
constitutes conflict of interest and what constitutes impropriety. 
They are told all this and they accept the job knowing that if they 
commit a serious mistake, they have no choice but to resign.
<P>
	Using ministerial stationery the minister wrote to CRTC 
chairman Keith Spicer last March asking him to ``give due 
consideration to an application to start a 24 hour Greek language 
radio station''. The minister also asked Spicer to keep him 
abreast of developments adding: ``Please do not hesitate to 
contact me should you require additional information''. The full 
letter was tabled earlier today.
<P>
	I would like some more information. I would like to know 
how the minister can rationalize what he did in this situation 
versus what he was told he could or could not do. Was the 
minister not listening when he was being sworn in? Was the 
minister not listening when he was told what the proper rules of 
conduct are for a cabinet minister and what he has to do to pull 
himself out?
<P>
	I am sorry but there is no way the actions in this matter are not 
examples of the worst kind of incompetence and impropriety. It 
is my humble opinion-and I feel the House should really speak 
out on this today-that he should do the honourable thing, not 
only apologize to the Canadian public, not only apologize to his 
peers as he did today. He has shown he is incapable of listening 
to instruction. I know financially he is incapable of handling 
that huge budget with all the areas that fall into his department.
<P>
	I feel I have no choice. I know I am supported by a lot of 
members of our party and other members. Perhaps even 
members of the government would feel they could have a better 
minister running the Department of  Canadian Heritage than the 
current minister. The man should not only reorganize his 
department but he should just resign and get out of the way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Ministry of Canadian Heritage is a fine example of how 
governments just get into people's faces, how they interfere in 
other people's lives. The ministry of heritage spends its entire 
time trying to force Canadians to accept a piece of art work, 
French language training in B.C., particular activities in the 
sports arena and so on.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	My colleague from the NDP a little earlier in his speech 
mentioned that he does not feel we are in a position in the House 
to make judgments about the appropriateness of particular art 
works. Yet the old line parties in the House certainly felt 
completely competent to try to force the Charlottetown accord 
on the people of Canada.
<P>
	There is a new approach needed in the House which pays a lot 
more attention to individual Canadians and what they want out 
of their government.
<P>
	I have an example here of how the government, the ministry 
of heritage, is trying to force its way on the people of B.C. In 
B.C. fewer than one-half of 1 per cent of the people speak 
French at home. Yet the minister of heritage is sponsoring a 
court case in B.C. to try to force the province of British 
Columbia to install a francophone school board. It is absolutely 
an outrage.
<P>
	A francophone society in B.C. set up a task force to study the 
situation. The minority language education task force report 
regarding francophone school boards for school district No. 22 
got a total of 696 individuals and 467 of those replies were 
negative. The report completely ignored the negatives and 
decided based on what appeared to be about 223 unsigned form 
letters in French that there was an overwhelming demand for a 
French school board in B.C.; 223 form letters and it decides 
there is this overwhelming need for it.
<P>
	What happens? The Canadian people now are forced to pay 
for a court case that will probably go all the way to the Supreme 
Court of Canada at immense expense for something that we just 
do not need. If ever there was an example of a way that the 
government could save money at a time of fiscal restraint it is 
right now in this case.
<P>
	There is another example in today's Toronto <I>Star</I>. The 
headline: ``Amateur Sport is a Living Corpse''. It gives an 
example from its investigation that the bureaucracy and 
politically motivated agendas are swallowing up as much as $70 
million of the budget for amateur sport.
<P>
	The prediction from the report in the Toronto <I>Star</I> is that the 
entire amateur sport situation is going to collapse into disarray 
that will be incapable of winning medals by the turn of the 
century. Instead of the money getting to the people who need it, 
the sports men and women on the field, it is going to the
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7299"> 7299 </A></B>
<P>
bureaucracy. Is that not typical of what happens in Indian 
affairs?
<P>
	Enormous amounts of money get lost in the bureaucracy of 
the Canadian heritage department. The entire department is a 
disgrace. The minister should resign. Let us get rid of the 
department and apply the money elsewhere in government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
what a pleasure it is to speak to Bill C-53.
<P>
	My, my, my, what a surprise. I thought we were through with 
all of this patronage with the new government and we are right 
back to where we started from, all the things we believed in year 
after year in the country and we are back to where we started.
<P>
	Lots of times we are asked what the difference is between 
Liberal patronage and Conservative patronage. The answer is 
there really is not any difference other than the Liberals have 
more of it.
<P>
	Here we are already a little over a year into their term as 
government and let us have a look at what kind of patronage we 
are talking about. There are three Liberal Party hacks given jobs 
to age 75 with the Senate. It is who you know and who you 
support with this same old traditional party. That is what it is all 
about, is it not?
<P>
	One of the recent occurrences I had in my riding was chasing a 
fellow by the name of José Salinas Mendoza who skipped out 
due to the incompetence of the immigration department. One of 
the interesting patronage appointments there which is so 
indicative of the government is a fellow who was working on the 
Liberal campaign in 1993 who just happened to donate some 
money to the party, who just happened to be appointed to the 
refugee board, who just happened to be a lawyer for José Salinas 
Mendoza.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	How does the government figure all this out? How does it get 
so convoluted and so entwined in its own party politics, in its 
own rhetoric, that it keeps appointing people to these kinds of 
things?
<P>
	Let us look at our latest boondoggle by the minister of 
heritage. We have actually caught him in the act of a minister 
supporting an application for an individual in his riding. How 
blatant can one get? The reason this is blatant is that these 
appointments are going on without the community out there, 
without the people of Canada getting a grasp on exactly what is 
happening with these political parties; without the people of 
Canada complaining about these three Liberal Party hacks in the 
Senate, without the people of Canada complaining about refugee 
board appointments, about parole board appointments, about 
immigration adjudicator appointments. We cannot stop this.
<P>
	Today we are going to ask if we can probably put an end to it 
by showing the government that the minister should step down. 
If he could step down maybe the Prime Minister might be looked 
upon by the bulk of the Canadian people as being forceful, as 
being a leader of integrity, one who believes in the importance 
of receiving and approving applications and appointing people 
to government positions on the basis of merit, on the basis of 
their qualifications, and not on the basis of whom you know and 
to whom you donate money.
<P>
	I have a long list of failed Liberal candidates who donated to 
this party over here and it looks like a who's who on the list of 
patronage. I guess that is just how to do it. That is the reward, 
that is the pie in the sky if you support this party. Maybe you will 
get the plum, the biggest plum of the Senate, and then you get all 
these other paid plums down from the Liberal Party. They are all 
there.
<P>
	One of the Liberal members wants me to read the list. I have 
not the time to read the list, it is too long. I only have 10 minutes.
<P>
	Heritage is something we want to preserve. In the year 2010 
and the year 2020 one would presume that we would want to 
preserve the heritage of 1994. I have to ask: Are we proud 
enough of what is going on in the country today with the 
government to preserve it?
<P>
	I think as we go along with the government we are going to 
find that when the Reform Party government is in we will not 
need that department of heritage down the road in the year 2020 
because we will not be very proud of what the government is 
doing today.
<P>
	The real heritage in the country is where our people come 
from, what we are preserving of our language and our culture, 
our parks, all of that kind of heritage. I am not very proud of 
what is going on with the government today.
<P>
	I just want to look at a bit of heritage and talk about some of 
the taxpayer dollars that have been going into the pet projects of 
governments like this one, from departments of the minister of 
cultural heritage.
<P>
	Let us look at some of the simple little dollars that were spent 
and what they were spent on. A couple of hundred thousand 
dollars to study religious and historical practice among northern 
Malagasy speakers is important to the Canadian taxpayer, is it 
not? That is the kind of money these people spend. Those are 
taxpayer dollars being spent on their pet peeves. It does not 
make any sense at all.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	Twenty-one thousand dollars was spent on experimental 
studies of interactive gestures. We can imagine what kind of 
interactive gestures we have for the government. It should study 
a few of those.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7300"> 7300 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us find the bureaucrats who want to spend $58,000 from 
the department on an experiment of what it is like to work for 
the Dominion grocery stores. There is an important issue on 
which to spend taxpayer dollars. What do you have to do to pay 
$58,000? In the country today you probably have to earn 
$120,000 minimum. For anyone out there who made $120,000, 
or any family out there that made a combination of that, the 
grant that was spent on what it is like to work for the Dominion 
grocery stores is one whole year of that family's total income 
tax.
<P>
	Whoever authorizes such grants as this should be fired. There 
is no question in my mind. If that were my organization and I 
found that kind of waste they would be gone. They would be 
history.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> It is other people's money. They spend it like it is 
water.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Let us have a look. Here is 
an interesting dollar spent out of a department, $10,800 to 
finance a poll-this is just to finance the poll; we have to find 
out what people think of it-to find out what Canadians thought 
about Christmas lights. Really, that is important.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> On or off?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> ``On or off'' my colleague 
says. That is another study. It is only $10,800 to find out what 
they think about Christmas lights so maybe we can spend 
another $10,000 to find out what they like if they are off, and 
another $10,000 to find out what they are like if they are on, and 
if they are different sizes. The government could think of all 
kinds of ways to spend our money.
<P>
	Although we sort of jest about it, it is kind of sick to think 
about what this government is doing and the government before 
it because there is no difference between the Conservatives and 
the Liberals.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Just the colour.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> I do not know if the 
Montreal Museum of Humour is still in business.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Toast.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> I hear it is toast. It probably 
has not made enough money but I know it had $3.3 million given 
to it a few years ago and that was not enough of the taxpayers' 
money to keep it profitable perhaps so maybe we should have 
given it some more. I do not know how the bureaucrats are 
thinking these days.
<P>
	We gave $46,000 of your taxpayer money to assist artists in 
the presentation of music in non-traditional spaces. We really 
have to wonder about the logic behind this kind of thinking. 
Why would they give any money at all in a grant like this one? 
The topic is so stupid it defies any kind of logical conclusion. 
Perhaps we should meld that with another interactive gesture 
and see what we think of it.
<P>
	We know Hurtig Publishers gets lots of money, or had lots of 
money. I do not know about recently but I know in the past it has.
<P>
	Under bilingualism there is grant after grant. I asked a 
question in the House in the last session about the $5,000 grant 
to the Canadian Kennel Club. This is very interesting. I received 
an answer that it is all right, that it is only $5,000. That is 
taxpayers' money. I got a letter from the Canadian Kennel Club 
and it was really unhappy with the question I asked because it 
felt it should have the money to support its bilingualism 
program of whatever it was.
<P>
	In the letter it told me it had a budget of around $4 million. I 
wrote back to it and said: ``Wait a minute here. If you have a 
budget of $4 million why do you need $5,000 of taxpayers' 
money? What is the purpose?''
<P>
	The real idea is that most of these organizations if not all of 
them do not need the money. It is being made available by 
governments like this so that they can spend on it for whatever 
reason and much of it is very much unaccountable. Do we want 
to preserve the ideas of the government?
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	Do we want to support the government? It is like supporting 
that other government from Jurassic Park. That is what it is. If 
the government keeps spending money the way it is doing and 
blowing it out the door it too will join Jurassic Park just like its 
brothers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this issue. 
Many of the questions raised here today are exactly the same as 
those raised by my constituents and continue to be raised by 
them.
<P>
	They are wondering: ``What is going on in Ottawa. What are 
they doing there? What is this government doing? We are 
wondering what substantive legislation is being considered''. 
When I tell them that the government has brought a bill forward 
that reorganizes the department, they ask me: ``What is that 
going to do for us? What does that mean?'' They ask questions 
like: ``Does this mean that the bureaucrats are going to keep 
shuffling the paper from one side of the desk to the other?'' I 
say: ``I guess it means that they are shuffling bureaucrats. What 
they are doing is very often unknown''.
<P>
	They would like to know how this improves their situation in 
Canada. They ask: ``Is this going to save money?'' We ask the 
government the same thing. Is this going to save money? We are 
met with stone silence. The government is not saving money. In 
fact it is entrenching government spending in ways that will 
make it more difficult to change in the future. Then they ask 
questions like: ``Does this reorganization make the government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7301"> 7301 </A></B>
<P>
more accountable to us? Will we have more control over the way 
it spends money in the department?''
<P>
	I ask the government: Does it do that? The government is 
silent because it does not. It does not give the people of Canada 
more control over what happens at the CBC or how these grants 
that my hon. friend has just listed are given out. In fact it makes 
it more difficult for taxpayers to have control over how this 
government spends its money.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> It is the incompetent minister who hands those 
moneys out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> My friend has 
mentioned that it is the incompetent minister who hands these 
things out, a minister who at the drop of a hat will interfere in 
affairs or try to manipulate the applications of some special 
interest group.
<P>
	People are appalled at this. They ask: ``Has the government 
not got the message yet that we want the government to be 
accountable directly to the people?'' The government remains 
silent and goes on its merry way without answering these 
questions.
<P>
	People are not happy with what is happening here. They feel 
that if bills are introduced into the House they ought to be 
substantive and they ought to meet the needs of this nation.
<P>
	Then they ask: ``What's going on at that national art 
museum?'' I say to them: ``I went there for a visit. I walked 
through''. As I viewed the various so-called pieces of art I 
wondered if the people of Canada could see this whether they 
would actually contribute directly to these paintings, this art 
that was displayed there. I describe to them some of the things I 
saw. I told them that I walked into a large room which would cost 
something to heat and to keep under those nice glass domes. I 
saw what looked to me like a piece of baling wire running from 
that corner to that corner. I asked the security person if they 
forgot to put the art in this room and he said no, that is the piece 
of art.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> How much was it?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> I do not know what it 
would cost to string a piece of baling wire from one corner to the 
other but I question that. Then I saw a toilet bowl hanging in a 
doorway and I thought: ``That is interesting. I wonder how you 
use that or why is that regarded as a piece of art?'' Things like 
this are unbelievable.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	I had heard of the ``Voice of Fire'' so I looked for this painting 
that had cost us over $1.5 million. I walked into a quite large 
room and saw what I thought was a replica of this painting. I 
asked the security guard: ``Where is the real thing?'' He said: 
``That's it. That has actually cost us over $1.5 million''. I told 
this to the people of Saskatchewan and they said: ``Do you mean 
they are cutting back on health care so that we can have that 
sitting there?'' They asked: ``Why are we not being given more 
of a choice as to whether we want health care preserved in 
Saskatchewan rather than it being cut  back so that it is almost 
inaccessible to some of the people in remote areas or that art?'' I 
told them: ``Ask your government''.
<P>
	We asked the government today and it cannot give us any 
answers. I think that is very unfortunate.
<P>
	During the election people made it very clear that 
multiculturalism is not a priority and that official bilingualism 
is not a priority. They feel that the government should be 
looking at these areas.
<P>
	When I was in the constituency last week I listened to the 
radio. We hear a lot about how the CBC preserves culture and so 
on in the province. I listened very carefully to the news reports. I 
realized as I did that it concentrates on certain kinds of items and 
in that way it can manipulate what people think about. Then I 
listened to the so-called balance that it is purported to have.
<P>
	I heard a very good economist give a three or four minute 
account of what is happening in the country. I thought good for 
you, this is excellent. However it was given at 6.30 in the 
morning when very few people were listening. At 7.45 there was 
a long interview with someone who had allegedly been abused 
because of their sexual orientation. In that way they begin to 
manipulate what people are thinking about.
<P>
	Eighty per cent of the people in my province want to hear 
more about certain issues but they cannot get the CBC to address 
them. Instead, they have to put up with a lot of things that they 
feel are not priorities in their lives and their society. They feel 
the government is trying to manipulate what is happening in this 
country, that it is trying to force a culture upon them that they 
have no control over. That is why we advocate that people who 
believe in certain things should pay for them. The government 
should not be free to use their tax dollars in any way that the 
elitists can and do.
<P>
	I was surprised to hear the Liberals and the NDP in the House 
defending the fact that the elite should be making these 
decisions because they know better. People are appalled at this 
kind of attitude. It is high time that it changed. A culture that is 
paid for by the government tends to be very phoney. It is not a 
real culture. That is what people are telling me.
<P>
	Many decisions are made on projects because money is there 
to spend on those projects. If you can apply for the money you 
can have the project, but if you had to pay for it yourself it 
probably would never take place.
<P>
	My wife is of Norwegian ancestry. Her family has been here 
for over a hundred years. They have preserved their culture and 
their language. My wife is fluent in Norwegian. They have 
preserved these things because it is important to them. There is 
something real about that culture because it has not been funded 
by taxpayers' dollars.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7302"> 7302 </A></B>
<P>
	My first language is not English or French. Some of you may 
smile and say: ``We can tell that by the way you speak''. We 
preserved our language and our heritage  because it was 
important to us. That is the message people want to get.
<P>
	Ukrainian people in my area have preserved their culture and 
their language because it is very important to them. I enjoy 
going to their gatherings and meeting with them because it is 
real. The government has not interfered with it. I feel that is the 
kind of culture we need in Canada. We do not need a culture that 
is imposed on us from the top, that is manipulated by 
bureaucrats and people who think they know better what is going 
on.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	If there is one message I hope the government will get, it is 
that people are tired of the elite in society deciding what is good 
for them. If we believe in culture we should preserve it.
<P>
	The government does not really understand what culture 
means and what people want. We should let people define their 
own Canadian culture here in Canada. The bill entrenches 
multiculturalism. It enforces official bilingualism. It preserves 
funding for special interest groups. People do not want that. 
They do not want the government misspending their money. The 
government is giving the impression it is doing something. The 
bill is symbolic of the fact there is nothing substantive 
happening in the country today.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this is going to be a very short intervention to reply to some of 
the nonsense I have heard today in the debate.
<P>
	The debate has focused on what culture means to a society and 
to a nation. I have come to the conclusion there is very little 
understanding on the other side of the House when they can ask 
how many gallons of paint does a painting take to determine the 
worth of the painting.
<P>
	I had the privilege and the pleasure this morning of being at 
breakfast with the director of the National Gallery. We were 
talking about ``Voice of Fire''. We were talking about other 
things too. Next year, and I am sure members opposite are not 
aware of this, is the 75th anniversary of the Group of Seven. I 
asked the director of the gallery what she thought the media 
reports would have been about and the outraged comments of the 
House of Commons would have been at the time our National 
Gallery was purchasing paintings of the Group of Seven, when 
the popular taste was pastoral landscapes in the European style. 
Those purchases were very unpopular and yet what is one of our 
great Canadian icons? The Group of Seven.
<P>
	A gallery that was independent of political control 75 years 
ago had the foresight to recognize something uniquely Canadian 
in the style of Canada, something not based on imitating what 
was being done elsewhere.
<P>
	I am not qualified to judge ``Voice of Fire''. I really do not 
know if that is the kind of painting that 75 years from now we 
will be extremely proud to have had the foresight to buy and 
have in our national collection. I hope so. I do not know.
<P>
	I do know that I want a gallery that is free to buy what it 
believes is the best being produced. I thank the gallery for 
having fulfilled that role and for having preserved for us 
something as uniquely Canadian and valuable as the paintings of 
the Group of Seven, among others.
<P>
	I want to make another comment. We have heard about 
multiculturalism today as if all it does is support cultures that 
are unique to specific groups. What in fact it does is build 
understanding among Canadians.
<P>
	Members on the opposite side have demonstrated that they 
really do not know a lot about what they are saying because they 
consistently talk about certain ethnic groups which do not rely 
on government funding not being aware obviously that in fact 
those groups do rely on government funding and are quite 
competent in getting it.
<P>
	Let me report another incident recently. I attended an award 
ceremony at the Boys and Girls Club in my riding not too long 
ago. It was a wrap up of their summer program. I saw young 
people whose families have been in Canada for generations and 
whose skins are white. I also saw young people whose families 
have been in Canada for less than six months, Somalians, 
Ethiopians, people from southeast Asia, people from all over the 
world playing together, working together, and getting to know 
each other.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	I know that many of those Somalia youths are involved in the 
community to the extent that they are because of organizations 
like the Somali integration and settlement agency, which gets 
funding from the very program that the members opposite are 
criticizing.
<P>
	They get funding because they are coming here as refugees. 
They have left everything behind. The majority are women with 
young children coming here for safety. These people do not 
come here with a lot. This agency gives these people coming to 
our country job training, language training, access to services so 
they have the ability not to separate themselves, but to integrate 
more fully and more completely into Canadian society. One of 
the results of that is young Somalian, Ethiopian and Cambodian 
children and children from all over the world I see playing 
together at the Boys and Girls Club in my riding.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7303"> 7303 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to say one final word about special interest groups. 
The people who talk about special interest groups frankly are 
the biggest special interest group in the country. They are the 
ones who by tradition and by the practice of all our laws, our 
courts and all our systems are the privileged class.
<P>
	If we fund certain groups in our society it is because without 
government support the poorest, the disabled, women, children 
would not have a voice in our public debate. I do not want a 
public debate on public issues on the future of this country that 
is dominated only by those who already have the wealth to make 
their voices heard.
<P>
	I do not want the decisions we make in the House made on the 
basis only of opinions from those who can afford to travel to 
Ottawa, to write to Ottawa, to hire lobbyists, to hire lawyers and 
to hire accountants. I want the voices of all Canadians to be part 
of what we decide in the House, what we determine in our 
committees and what the future of Canadian society is. 
Canadian society is not just for the privileged few; it is for all 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the bill today. To 
begin, I would like to address the issue of federal multicultural 
policy. We will hear several Reformers speak against this policy 
and the former government's policy of multiculturalism but we 
will not hear the discontented backbenchers of the government 
side speaking their views.
<P>
	There are many on the other side now who share the Reform 
position on multicultural policy. Multiculturalism is currently 
under debate at all levels of our society. Recently CBC aired two 
special episodes highlighting this very debate. The thrust of its 
broadcast was whether multiculturalism policy brings us 
together as Canadians or does exactly the opposite, pulls us 
apart.
<P>
	Even a member of the Liberal Party, the party that first put 
forward its multicultural agenda and proposes to entrench it into 
the legislation, came forward to oppose multiculturalism. It is a 
fact that there is a great deal of support for the Reform position 
on multiculturalism everywhere within the House.
<P>
	During this televised debate the Liberal member for York 
South-Weston referred to multiculturalism policy as a fraud 
that continues to be perpetuated on Canadians.
<P>
	The member referred to multicultural policy as a policy that 
separates Canadians. He pressed that it is time for change. 
Remember this is a Liberal. The member opposite proposed that 
Canada dump its multicultural policy and begin to promote what 
Canadians have in common, not their differences.
<P>
	I am pleased to see such progressive and logical thinking 
coming from the opposite side, as the member has come up with 
some very valid points.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	It is my hope that the government will consult with all elected 
members in the House before it passes the legislation because 
Canada's multicultural policy is a fraud. Rather than take a 
different approach to Canada's multicultural landscape as the 
member has suggested, I believe the federal government should 
get out of the social landscaping business altogether. The 
government should not be funding or promoting one ethnic 
group over another. This is not the role of government.
<P>
	A true liberal democracy simply does not try to legislate 
culture. Twenty-three years ago, the architect of 
multiculturalism, Pierre Trudeau, implemented the policy in a 
misguided attempt to assure the cultural freedoms of Canadians.
<P>
	These freedoms were already there. Canadians were already 
free to nourish their own culture, speak their own language, sing 
their own songs, play their own music and wear their traditional 
clothes.
<P>
	Canadians do not need government multicultural grants to 
practice their cultural freedoms. Canadian culture is not created 
or sustained, nor is it maintained through government grants. 
Canada is a multicultural nation not because of government 
policy but as a result of each individual who comprises this great 
country.
<P>
	Multiculturalism exists regardless and in spite of government 
policy. Canadians do not need a song and dance fund to maintain 
their individual cultures. Canadians do not maintain or develop 
their culture through conferences or workshops or through 
dances or craft shows.
<P>
	Culture is not something that we buy at the corner store. It is 
something that we learn at home mainly from our parents and 
our grandparents. It is an acquired attribute. It is not something 
that we buy.
<P>
	In addition, the multiculturalism program is nothing more 
than a funding program for special interest groups. Last year 
grants to special interest groups for dances, conferences, film 
making, books and other miscellaneous projects totalled $25.5 
million. Grants from the previous three years totalled $27 
million annually.
<P>
	The government may argue that $25 million or $27 million is 
not much in the larger scheme of things but when we are 
spending $100 million a day more than we are taking in, it does 
put it into perspective. It is a program that one, we do not need 
and two, we cannot afford.
<P>
	We desperately require fiscal restraint. If we are going to save 
our social programs this government must be prepared to trim its 
funding. Canada cannot sustain the spending binges of this and 
previous Liberal governments.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7304"> 7304 </A></B>
<P>
	Canadians are facing severe fiscal restraint with our health 
system and social systems deeply in trouble. The government 
cannot argue to maintain transfers for health care at the same 
levels and yet it seems determined to wander back to the Liberal 
spending days of the 1970s with wasteful multicultural 
spending.
<P>
	The time has come to get with the times and show some 
responsibility and leadership. Canadians do not want a song and 
dance fund. They want jobs. They want health care. They want 
pensions, higher education and a clean environment.
<P>
	Spending priority is not the only issue here but regardless of 
fiscal constraints, government should not be in the cultural 
policy business. It is not the business of government to ensure 
that Canadians maintain their cultures and traditions. That is the 
responsibility of the groups themselves and should not be 
financed with taxpayer's money.
<P>
	Federal government activities should enhance the citizenship 
of all Canadians regardless of race, language or culture. It 
should be up to the provinces to choose whether they wish to 
promote language and culture within their individual 
jurisdictions.
<P>
	I have another major concern. The program does not work. 
Even the chairman of the human rights commission admits that 
the program is not working. All the grants for miscellaneous 
conferences, workshops and dances are not achieving the 
intended goal. According to the human rights chair, racism is 
growing.
<P>
	Multiculturalism policy actively categorizes people on the 
basis of race and countries of origin. This is wrong because it is 
active discrimination. Multiculturalism policy separates people 
on the basis of their origin instead of treating all Canadians 
equally regardless of race.
<P>
	The Reform Party is the only party that actively promotes 
equality of all Canadians. It is the only party that officially 
recognizes that all Canadians are equal and should be treated 
equally.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	We support programs that involve the elimination of 
discrimination and the right of individuals to participate in 
Confederation without discrimination. Such programs would be 
more logically transferred to the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission, as the CHRC's mandate clearly states that the 
commission has statutory responsibility to develop and conduct 
programs to foster public understanding of the principles 
enshrined in the Canadian Human Rights Act.
<P>
	In conclusion, we oppose the current concept of 
multiculturalism pursued by the government and would end all 
funding for multiculturalism programs. Whether an ethnic 
group preserves its cultural background is the group's choice, 
not the government's.
<P>
	In short, Canadians do not need nor do they want a song and 
dance fund enshrined in legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when I was asked if I would like to say a few words I 
was of two minds. This being a debate on heritage it does bring 
in the minister of heritage. That brings in the letter in the press 
today in which the minister of heritage, I think quite innocently, 
used his office or wrote a letter in support of a constituent asking 
for the support of a constituent in an application before the 
CRTC.
<P>
	As I say, I was of two minds just how I would approach the 
matter because a minister of the government is still a member 
representing constituents. Therefore how do you balance your 
responsibilities as a member of Parliament representing your 
constituents and as a minister of the crown? What would be the 
fiduciary responsibilities implied in both?
<P>
	My concern was further complicated because I was asked just 
after the election when we were all rookies, including the 
minister opposite, to write a letter in support of an application 
for a television station licence in my constituency. I did. I wrote 
a letter to the CRTC and asked that it look favourably upon an 
application. I thought about it for a while and I sent another 
letter in rescinding the first letter because I recognized that I did 
not have knowledge on either side of the issue. We hire people at 
the CRTC to make these decisions. These decisions should be 
made by the people who are being paid and who have the ability 
to make the decision based on fact.
<P>
	Additionally other people have asked for my support in 
establishing or getting a licence for radio broadcasting. I wrote 
in support of that because in my capacity as a member of 
Parliament I should have the obligation to support members of 
my constituency and Canadians in general who come to me for 
help. I use my wisdom and I use my office after deciding the 
merits of that case.
<P>
	The difference of course is that I am a humble backbencher in 
the third party. The minister-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> You are a frontbencher. You are a frontliner.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> My hon. colleague tells me I am no longer a 
humble backbencher. I am a humble frontbencher in a third party 
very close to the door.
<P>
	The difference is that a minister of the crown has a very 
different fiduciary responsibility than a humble backbencher of 
any party. This is the gist of the problem we have facing us 
today.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> If he does not know the difference he 
should step down.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7305"> 7305 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> The thing that concerns me most is that 
our country has suffered under nine years of almost visceral 
dislike and hate for the Tories who were displaced by most here 
in the Chamber today. You do not have to be a rocket scientist 
to figure it out. They were dumped by the electorate and we 
were elected because the Canadian people lost their trust in the 
people who were governing them. They felt that the people who 
were in power were more interested in protecting their friends, 
hubris, getting rich, looking after their own interests than they 
were in looking after the interests of the ordinary people, the 
people who pay the freight $10 at a time.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	The consequence is that we were elected to the House. We 
have a profound responsibility. Our country is going into a time 
of distemper never before seen in this land. We have in the loyal 
opposition a party dedicated to breaking up the country. We have 
a third party, all but one of whom are absolute rookies. We have 
the Liberal Party in power, the vast majority of whom are 
absolute rookies. We have to use the opportunity and not 
squander it. We have to use it to make some very fundamental 
changes in the way our country is governed and the way we 
inter-relate one with another and the way we get things done.
<P>
	Everything ministers do is based on a foundation of trust. If 
that foundation of trust between the electorate, the Canadian 
citizenry, and Parliament, those elected to lead, is broken then 
we lose our reason to be here. We have lost the moral authority 
to provide leadership to a country desperately in need of 
leadership.
<P>
	That is the reason I asked to speak in the debate. It is not that I 
have an axe to grind with the hon. minister opposite. I do not in 
any respect. In my view this was an honest mistake made by a 
rookie, just as I am a rookie. When one makes a mistake it is an 
opportunity to learn. Rather than stonewalling, rather than 
saying: ``Hey, I did all right. I did the right thing. You have it all 
wrong''. He should have the courage to come to the table and 
say: ``Look, I made a mistake. I have learned from it and it will 
not happen again''. It should be a caution to all of us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> He did.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Then it becomes experience. We put it 
behind us and we go on from there. That is the very least we in 
this Parliament and Canadians in general should expect from a 
minister of the crown.
<P>
	I would like to speak to the issue of multiculturalism and the 
department of heritage. Much has been said in recent times 
about the value of multiculturalism in Canada. We are a much 
stronger, much finer, much more varied and rich nation because 
of our multicultural heritage, because by and large people get 
along with each other. We respect each other for our differences.
<P>
	Let me give a personal indication of what is so wonderful 
about our country. Perhaps it is just serendipitous that this 
happened to me this morning. I was walking to the House and I 
stopped at the Apollo Restaurant on Bank Street for breakfast. I 
sat down. I did not know a soul there. I was reading the paper and 
having breakfast. The people next to me were speaking to each 
other in Greek and in English. There would be four or five words 
in Greek, four or five words in English, a sentence in Greek and 
then a sentence in English. I was sitting there thinking it was 
marvellous that they could go back and forth in these two 
languages. This is part of our common culture.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	I started chatting with them and it came out in conversation 
that the reason these two people were speaking in English and 
Greek was because they noticed that when I ordered I spoke in 
English and they assumed that I could not speak Greek. They did 
not want me to feel out of place or that they were saying 
something I should not know or whatever. They were trying to 
make me feel comfortable in the fact that I could not speak 
Greek.
<P>
	Here we were having breakfast and talking about how 
wonderful it is that we have this multilingual heritage in our 
country and that we have it because we want it. We have it 
because it springs indigenously from the hearts of the people to 
whom it belongs. It is not something that is force fed or 
cultivated by the government.
<P>
	As this debate unfolds, we need to draw a distinction between 
multiculturalism that springs naturally from the fact that our 
nation is built up of people all over the world and government 
multiculturalism that is force fed to us in order to curry favour 
with multi-ethnic groups. It is a very important distinction.
<P>
	Therefore I would like to move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That we add after the words Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``and the standing committee report back to the House no later than June 23, 1995''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The subamendment 
moved is in order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am provoked to speak in the debate today because of 
the misrepresentations being placed before the House by the 
members in the Reform Party who are suggesting that somehow 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage has done something wrong 
and therefore ought to resign his post.
<P>
	I want to argue against that proposition because it is palpable 
rubbish and nonsense. The minister came into the House this 
morning and made a very clear and succinct statement, as 
suggested by the hon. member for Edmonton Southeast in his 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7306"> 7306 </A></B>
<P>
most reasoned address. It is the only beam of reason we have 
heard from the other side of the House on this issue this day.
<P>
	The hon. member for Edmonton Southeast presented a 
veritable feast of reason in his address because he made it very 
clear that the minister should come and do what in fact the 
minister did earlier this morning.
<P>
	He came into the House. He apologized. He said he was sorry 
that he made an error in sending a letter. This was not the case of 
a minister who had been exposed having done something 
improper.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I say to hon. members, listen to the facts. Some 
of them were not here this morning when the minister made his 
remarks. Of course they did not have notice of it so they 
probably did not understand it when he delivered it. The 
minister came into the House and said: ``Here are the facts of the 
case''. He produced his letter of March 13, tabled it in the 
House, and read the letter into the record.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	Let me read what the minister's letter says. He says he is 
writing about a problem and then he said: ``I would be most 
grateful if you could give this application due consideration''. 
Did he say special treatment? No. Did he say fancy treatment, 
something out of the ordinary? No. He said due consideration. 
Then he said: ``I trust that you will keep me abreast of any 
developments in this matter and please do not hesitate to contact 
me should you require additional information'', a standard letter 
that a member of Parliament representing a constituent would 
send.
<P>
	If hon. members opposite will not send that kind of letter I 
suggest to them they are not doing their job for their 
constituents. Here was a minister diligently doing his duty as a 
member of Parliament for his constituent.
<P>
	As he said, he realized that was not the thing for him to do. It 
came to his attention soon after when another constituent wrote, 
had noted the letter, and wanted to know if this was support for 
the application. He wrote back on September 30 and he tabled 
that letter in the House this morning. Hon. members opposite in 
their speeches often conveniently neglect to mention this. I tried 
to remind them in my remarks from my seat, but of course they 
do not pay much attention to that.
<P>
	He said: ``This is further to your letter of September 20'' and 
so on. He wrote: ``My letter of March 15, 1994 to the CRTC 
simply asked that due consideration be given to the application. 
It is not intended to convey support for or opposition to the 
application''. He sent a copy of this letter to the CRTC to 
reinforce the message that this was neither in opposition nor in 
support. It was a very decent letter and he did it in a timely way.
<P>
	That is what the minister did. It is not as though he sent this 
after there had been an exposure of the facts in the press or in the 
House. He did the honourable thing as soon as he realized there 
was some mistake. He came into the House this morning and 
gave this explanation so all hon. members could hear.
<P>
	As I said earlier, he did not send an advance copy to the 
Reform Party so maybe they did not understand it. He did not 
send it to them last night. Maybe they had trouble reading it. I do 
not know what happened with the Reform Party members. 
However I invite them to get the blues which are available to 
them and read the minister's statement. Then they will agree 
with me that this minister has acted with complete propriety. He 
apologized for sending the-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. It being 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing 
Order 30(5), the House will now proceed to Statements by 
Members pursuant to Standing Order 31.

their hands out for grants. I find this an absolute insult.
<P>
	My children have attended and continue to attend Ukrainian 
cultural events that are totally paid for by the families and the 
local churches. Such comments of the hon. member do nothing 
to advance multiculturalism in this country.
<P>
	Canadians of Ukrainian ancestry are asking for redress for the 
internment of Ukrainians during World War I. This is not a 
request for a handout but, instead, is a demand for return of 
property seized from these new Canadians and never returned to 
them after the war.

nothing more than government funding of special interest 
groups, which more often than not exhibit bias or promote a 
view that is not in accordance with the majority of society.
<P>
	Perhaps even more alarming is the fact that the Liberals 
managed to find almost $3 million floating in some abyss to 
fund this wasteful program. Yet this same level of government is 
contemplating raising personal taxes, implementing a carbon

	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act and its amendments 
seek to improve key elements of the federal process. The Act 
contains mechanisms whereby different levels of government 
can harmonize their processes through administrative 
agreements and reduce duplication and uncertainty.
<P>
	These mechanisms are intended to facilitate the delegation of 
environmental assessments to the provinces and thus to make 
things easier for developers. Almost all the provinces in Canada 
are now negotiating harmonization agreements with the federal 
government. I sincerely hope that the Government of Quebec 
will do the same and negotiate a harmonization agreement as 
soon as possible, so that Quebec developers can enjoy a level of 
service comparable to that available in the other provinces of 
Canada.

Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food, the federal 
government obtained from manufacturers of BST-bovine 
somatotropin-in Canada a promise to voluntarily defer the sale 
and use of BST until July 1, 1995. I was delighted to learn that 
the Government of Canada has just appointed a seven-member 
task force that will also review the safety of recombinant bovine 
somatotropin for animal and human health.
<P>
	I wish to bring to the attention of this advisory group and of 
the Minister of Health that, contrary to what was said and 
written, some studies show that BST alters the nutritional 
quality of milk, producing more fat and less protein. I am 
concerned about the impact this change in the percentage of 
milk components might have on the future health of our young

	The council granted Hilarey Mackey and Shelly Wine 
$16,000 to produce the video ``Fury of The Sound'' even though 
these women were under criminal contempt charges for the very 
activity that was to be the subject of the video: criminally 
blocking forestry workers from going to work in Clayoquot 
Sound. Mackey and Wine were each sentenced to 21 days in jail 
on October 6 for criminal contempt.
<P>
	The minister states he does not have any authority over the 
awarding of these grants and the director of the Canada Council 
defers to a system of evaluation by peers. Canadian taxpayers

	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Vancouver Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
October is known as Child Abuse Prevention Month.
<P>
	Child abuse is the most disturbing problem facing Canadian 
society today. It is not a new problem but as a society we 
recognize that violence against children whether it is physical, 
sexual or emotional is a problem which concerns us all.
<P>
	For too long children have been silenced by fear and isolation 
and by attitudes which deny the seriousness and extent of the 
problem. Child abuse can no longer be tolerated in Canada. It is 
time to act against child abuse in all of its forms. We must 
challenge the attitudes which devalue our children. We must 
intervene when we know that a child is being threatened.
<P>
	As the federal government we are committed to stopping child 
abuse through the family violence initiative. Working in 
partnership with community and national organizations, 
corporate and voluntary sectors and all levels of government we 
have developed prevention and intervention strategies to protect 
children and families.
<P>

Mr. Speaker, in addition to his apparent inability to discharge his

Heritage has failed to bring a sensitivity of Canada's First 
Nations to his department.
<P>
	Earlier this year Heritage Canada published an otherwise fine 
publication for youth entitled ``The Great Canadian

about Canada and in doing so continues to state as fact that 
Quebec and Prince Edward Island were discovered by 
Europeans. This language is no longer appropriate.

	At the same time the department has just awarded a half 
million dollar contract to develop curriculum materials 
pertaining to aboriginal people in Canada to a Montreal

non-governmental organizations attempting to assess the

allowed Amnesty International to conduct studies in the city of

	As Canadians we must be concerned when a human rights 
organization is restricted in its efforts to assess the human rights 
conditions of any country. I was pleased to learn during

made representation to the Government of India on behalf of 
Amnesty International so that more thorough studies may be 
conducted.

	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to inform the House of the visit to Ottawa today of 14 
CEOs representing a cross-section of a growing, vibrant 
information technology sector from the federal riding of 
Waterloo. They are part of the computer technology network in 
Canada's technology triangle.
<P>
	The computer technology network is made up of over 125 
companies employing 5,500 people and with annual revenues in 
excess of $600 million. Sixty per cent of their sales are derived 
from exports with expenditures on research and development 
close to $100 million annually. More than half of the 5,500 
employees have been hired in the past two years.
<P>
	As entrepreneurs and leaders in one of Canada's hotbeds of 
technology with strong connections to the University of 
Waterloo, these firms represent the very best that Canada has to 
offer to the new economy. It is companies like these that assure 
Canada's present and future prosperity.

	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have been 
advised that documents within Parks Canada recommend the 
permanent closure of the Banff and Jasper Park airstrips. This is 
another example of the heritage minister's incompetence.
<P>
	These grass airstrips are vital to the safe air transportation of 
local pilots through the main mountain pass corridors. 
Furthermore, these airstrips are maintained primarily by local 
pilots.
<P>
	Under the department's existing recommendation, local pilots 
who encounter bad weather or equipment failure would have to 
land their aircraft on the main highways. That is stupid.
<P>
	The private pilots need to be considered. In the name of public 
safety and common sense, I urge Parks Canada to trash this 
proposal.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CRTC">CRTC</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is now common knowledge that a member of 
cabinet, in this case the Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
intervened directly with the CRTC to support an application for 
a radio licence, at the request of the party concerned. This was 
done in the form of a letter sent to the chairman of the CRTC, the 
regulatory body responsible for issuing licences.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Does he 
consider such action acceptable and appropriate, considering 
the obligation incumbent on all ministers to respect the 
autonomy of judicial and quasi-judicial bodies?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I discussed the incident with the minister who, like all 
members of this House, is the member of Parliament for his 
riding. All members must be available to their constituents and 
try to provide the services expected of a member.
<P>
	In this particular case, all the minister did was bring this 
application to the attention of the chairman of the CRTC, with 
the comment: ``This application should receive due 
consideration. To me, this means: Could you take care of this 
dossier, and if there are any problems, if I can be of any 
assistance as the member for Laval, fine.
<P>
	Subsequently, when his letter was interpreted as a letter of 
support, as soon as the minister heard about this, without any 
pressure from anyone, he immediately wrote to this person, and 
a copy was sent to the commission to make it clear he had not 
supported the application in any way. He had simply asked the 
commission to do its job.
<P>
	This is always a problem for ministers. The Hon. Leader of 
the Opposition must have had that experience himself. A 
minister is also a member of Parliament, and we have a duty to 
represent our constituents without influencing bodies like the 
CRTC.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, B.Q.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has been unconscionably 
irresponsible in his attempts to downplay the seriousness of his 
minister's action. How can he claim it was the member of 
Parliament who took this action and not the minister? How could 
the chairman of the CRTC overlook the fact that the letter was 
sent by a member of Cabinet who also happen to be his own 
minister?
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister not agree that the CRTC is a 
quasi-judicial body that, as such, should not be subject to any 
interference or pressure from the minister?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I could not agree more, and if the minister acted as the 
member for Laval when he asked the commission to do its job, it 
was not undue pressure. The minister himself said in the House 
this morning that perhaps he should have acted differently. 
Everyone makes honest mistakes, and he corrected his mistake 
as soon as possible.
<P>
	In the circumstances, after checking with my advisers, I 
concluded there was nothing here to justify changing the 
membership of my cabinet.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7311"> 7311 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister knows the precedents. They 
are immutable and inescapable. A minister who fails to respect 
the autonomy of a judicial or quasi-judicial body must 
relinquish his post. The present minister of Foreign Affairs and 
the present member for Sherbrooke know this rule and had to 
resign because of it.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Does he realize 
that he is guilty of dereliction of duty if he does not immediately 
demand the resignation of the Minister of Canadian Heritage? 
Does he not realize it is a matter of honour and integrity?
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have acted responsibly. I have eighteen years 
experience as a minister, and I have seen other complex 
situations. As for this one, I think the minister made it clear that 
he had made an honest mistake and corrected it in short order.
<P>
	I am surprised to see the Leader of the Opposition in such a 
furor, when his head office in Quebec summons its bureaucrats 
and tells them to knuckle under and change their political views 
if they want to keep their jobs.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister downplays the action of the 
heritage minister by claiming that the letter to the Chairman of 
the CRTC is not a letter of support. Yet, this is precisely what the 
CRTC understood and, in fact, its secretary-general wrote to the 
minister to thank him for what he referred to as a letter of 
support.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister not realize that his minister's 
interference is compounded by the fact that it was directed at an 
organization whose independent status is under the protection of 
the minister and that, consequently, the heritage minister was all 
the more guilty?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister's letter is very clear. It says:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``I would be most grateful if you could give this application 
due consideration''. Yes, due consideration. You are right.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	You give this application due consideration and make a 
decision.
<P>
	Later, when told that his action had been interpreted as 
interfering with due process, the minister said:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is not intended to convince support for or opposition to the 
application.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	So, it is very clear in my mind that the minister acted the way a 
member of Parliament should, in that he tried to represent the 
interests of one of his constituents whom he had never met 
before.
<P>
	I represent the riding of Saint-Maurice; I was a minister for 
18 years and I have now been Prime Minister for one year. Every 
time my constituents, who have been voting for me for 25 years, 
have problems, I always give them due consideration.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister said this morning that he would 
not be as lenient towards other ministers guilty of similar 
actions.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister recognize the seriousness of that 
interference on the heritage minister's part, and not have the 
courage to impose the sanction he deserves, that is to expel him 
from Cabinet?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I reviewed the issue, I consulted experts in my office 
and in the government, and I have come to the conclusion that, 
under the circumstances, the hon. member can remain Minister 
of Canadian Heritage and keep serving Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when this government was elected the Prime Minister 
promised a new era of integrity, including a code of conduct for 
ministers and an ethics counsellor.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister, in ushering in this new era of 
integrity specifically what guidelines were given to cabinet 
ministers in regard to communication with quasi-judicial 
regulatory bodies like the CRTC?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is very simple. A minister should not interfere or put 
pressure on anybody like the CRTC. He can, and it is his duty, as 
you would do for your constituents-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. My colleagues I would ask you to please 
address the Chair in all of your questions and answers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for one thing I am not a minister and not in the same 
position as the hon. minister.
<P>
	There is a simple guideline that applies in these cases and it is 
a most elementary one. It is understood in most jurisdictions. 
That is that ministers do not communicate with quasi-judicial 
regulatory bodies except in three ways: through statute, through 
orders in council, and through public formal submissions to that 
body. They do not communicate through telephone calls or 
casual conversations or casual letters on behalf of applicants or 
interveners.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7312"> 7312 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister assure this House that that simple 
guideline, which is understood in most jurisdictions, was given 
to the ministers of his government, including the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I explained that every cabinet minister is a member of 
Parliament. When you are in your riding on Saturday, Sunday or 
Monday receiving your constituents you have to receive them. 
In this case, this person asked his member of Parliament if he 
would make sure that his application would be considered, and 
he just asked the CRTC to do exactly what is their duty to do. He 
did not put apply pressure. He just asked them to consider this 
application, as it was his duty to ask as a member of Parliament.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wonder if the Prime Minister read all of the letter that 
the minister sent to the chairman of the CRTC. In his last 
paragraph he said this: ``I trust that you will keep me abreast of 
developments in this matter and please do not hesitate to contact 
me should you require additional information''.
<P>
	What was the minister thinking of? Was he contemplating 
entering into an ongoing dialogue with the chairman of a 
regulatory authority over an application?
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister really saying that this type of activity is 
acceptable? Will he not ask the minister to resign?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> 
According to the House of Commons circumstances the minister 
has explained what he has done. I said that he made an honest 
error in sending-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> No, he did it. When he 
realized that it was interpreted as trying to apply pressure he 
clarified it on his own without pressure from anybody from 
anywhere. He said to the commission: ``Do not interpret that as 
wanting to support or oppose this application'' and that he was 
just asking them to look at the application and render the 
judgment that they have to render under the law.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	In his letter to the CRTC, the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
wrote that he wished to be kept abreast of developments in the 
matter. Does the Prime Minister not realize that in so writing, 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage is putting pressure on the 
CRTC to issue a licence?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I think that the hon. member should read the letter that 
the minister sent. When he heard that his action was being 
interpreted as bringing pressure to bear, he made it clear to the 
CRTC that he had not intended to support or oppose the 
application, but that he had merely referred it, as a member of 
Parliament, to the Commission.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in his letter on ministerial letterhead, the minister goes even 
further, offering to provide the CRTC personally with additional 
information on the licence application.
<P>
	Has the Prime Minister really read this letter, and if so, how 
can he not conclude that the CRTC would assume that he was 
writing in his capacity as minister?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, perhaps the minister should have used the letterhead he 
keeps for his correspondence as the member for Laval West, just 
as I could use a letterhead identifying myself as the member for 
Saint-Maurice. But everyone knows very well that Jean 
Chrétien is the Prime Minister, and if I used a different 
letterhead, people would perhaps find it a bit ridiculous.
<P>
	I did indeed read the original letter and the letter of 
explanation. It was an honest mistake on the part of the minister 
and he took corrective action himself without any pressure from 
anyone. Under the circumstances, I think that it is my 
responsibility to declare the matter closed at this point.
<P>
	I consulted the government's ethics counsellor and one I 
appointed myself, and both confirmed that I had made the right 
decision in this matter.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	The CRTC received two applications for a 24-hour Greek 
language specialty service to be played on radio. The first is by 
CHOM from Montreal and the second was by a Mr. Daniilidis in 
Telemedia.
<P>
	On May 5 of this year the CRTC rejected the CHOM 
application. On March 15 the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
intervened by sending a letter of support for the application of 
Mr. Daniilidis.
<P>
	The minister's intervention supporting the second application 
came prior to the rejection of the first application. How can the 
minister deny that his intervention did not influence the CRTC 
decision?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7313"> 7313 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the letter I sent to the CRTC was the letter 
of an MP designed to ensure that a constituent received due 
process.
<P>
	I attach great importance to my role as a member of 
Parliament. I am sure that my colleague feels the same way 
when she has constituents coming to visit her constituency 
office. She takes account of what they are requesting.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the issue is clear and the minister did not answer my question.
<P>
	My supplemental is for the Prime Minister. The Minister of 
Canadian Heritage has stated in the House that the CRTC is a 
quasi-judicial agency and that the Canadian government, 
including the Minister of Canadian Heritage, should not 
interfere in the process.
<P>
	His current action is an obvious and flagrant breach of the 
judicial principle. Will the Prime Minister now demand the 
resignation of his minister?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I said earlier that I would look into the matter very 
carefully. I have consulted those who have responsibility in the 
matter.
<P>
	The minister made an honest error. He corrected it 
immediately without any pressure. It is one of those things. 
Every member of the cabinet is confronted with the same 
problem. Some constituents write to me about problems in every 
department and I have a responsibility over every department. I 
send requests to ministers and ask that they be looked into. It is 
part of my job as the member of Parliament for Saint-Maurice.
<P>
	In this case, I concluded after consultation, as explained to the 
House, that there was no need for a resignation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister, who has told us repeatedly over the past year 
that he attaches the utmost importance to the integrity of his 
ministers, is now turning a blind eye to a very serious mistake on 
the part of the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister be taken seriously when, at the 
first opportunity to come his way, in view of such a serious 
mistake, he chooses to forgive and forget rather than enforce his 
code of ethics? Clearly, the Prime Minister is not equal to the 
situation.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I said that I had consulted the government's ethics 
counsellor who told me that the minister had been careless but 
had taken corrective action himself as soon as he realized that 
sending the letter was being construed as interference. It was put 
in very clear terms. Under the circumstances, I accepted this 
piece of advice as well as the explanation provided by the 
minister. I believe that he has done his job as a member of 
Parliament.
<P>
	Some people say that MPs who do not do their job as MPs 
should be relieved of their duties. I find it somewhat surprising 
that a member who insists that MPs should do their job would 
expect MPs who are ministers as well not to do their job as MPs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister hides behind the advice of his advisors. But they 
are not the ones who have been elected. He should assume his 
responsibilities.
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	Are we to understand from the decision of the Prime Minister 
of Canada that he puts personal friendship above the integrity of 
his Cabinet?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I take full responsibility for this decision. Never did I 
attempt to evade my responsibilities in making this decision. In 
response to a question, I said that I could have not requested any 
advice, but chose to do so and was told that, under the 
circumstances, it was totally acceptable, and I take full 
responsibility for that.
<P>
	Again, I find it somewhat surprising to hear the Bloc 
Quebecois come here and talk about integrity when employees 
are blackmailed by its parent organization to retain their jobs. 
What is going on in Quebec City is a disgrace. It is 
embarrassing!
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first 
we hear the Prime Minister say that he was making a 
representation as an ordinary MP. Then in the next breath the 
Prime Minister said: ``Well, it was an honest mistake''.
<P>
	We want the true answer to this. Was it representation or was 
it a mistake?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. We must presume that our word will be 
taken at face value in this House. I do not know that the truth 
should be questioned like that. Perhaps the hon. member could 
rephrase the question.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
claims that he wrote the letter to the CRTC on behalf of a 
constituent to ensure that he received ``a fair hearing and due 
consideration''.
<P>
	He also claims he had absolutely no intention of influencing 
the CRTC. Does the minister have any reason to believe that the 
CRTC would not give his application a fair hearing and due 
consideration unless he personally wrote them a letter?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have the fullest confidence in the CRTC. 
The CRTC is an arm's length agency, which I respect, as I stated 
in this House on several occasions when some members of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7314"> 7314 </A></B>
<P>
opposition were suggesting that I should interfere in its 
operations.
<P>
	When there was an indication that the letter I sent could lend 
itself to misinterpretation, I quickly made arrangements through 
a second letter to make sure the original meaning was 
understood.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
gives new meaning to the phrase ``the six month's hoist''. 
Improper ministerial influence is apparent when only one 
application to the CRTC is favoured with a personal 
introduction by the Minister of Canadian Heritage on 
ministerial letterhead.
<P>
	This morning the minister said that he ``never for a moment 
had any hesitation or misunderstanding about my role or 
responsibilities as a minister''.
<P>
	If that is the case then he knowingly and grossly violated that 
understanding by favouring this application. For his 
incompetence and his incredible lack of judgment, will this 
minister resign?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, no I will not.

	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister. None of the government 
ministers was able to confirm that no spying was done on 
members of the Quebec government and on the Quebec 
sovereignty movement. Their ignorance is probably due to the 
fact that the Communications Security Establishment reports 
directly to the Prime Minister and to him alone.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister assure us that members of the Quebec 
government and the sovereignty movement were not spied on by 
the CSE?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Privacy Commissioner conducted an investigation 
to determine if there had been any wrongdoing and he reported 
to the government that nothing wrong was done. The 
commissioner is still investigating the matter. He has a duty to 
tell us if this organization illegally monitored the conversations 
of Canadian citizens or spied on them.
<P>
	As far as I know, it was not done and I say to the House that I 
do not want this to be done because we do not need this in a 
democratic society.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	The commissioner will submit his report. I did not appoint 
him; he has been in that job for a very long time. I think that he is 
a competent man, and I am sure that if there has been abuse in 
this area, he will notify me and I will act accordingly. So far, I 
have seen no evidence that anyone was spied on illegally in 
Canada, at least since I have been Prime Minister.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, how 
can the Prime Minister claim that his government has nothing to 
hide when his Minister of Defence refuses to release any 
information on the CSE's mandate, activities and budget, and 
even refuses to give the name of its director, even though it 
appears in the government telephone directory?
<P>

hard for Canadians to find out who he is, it is no secret.

complete holdings in a communications company when he 
declared bankruptcy in July 1992.

supports, cleared his name from the bankruptcy file in only one 
year and surfaced as a major shareholder of a new company?
<P>

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, B.Q.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The latest events concerning the Communications Security 
Establishment have highlighted the lack of external control over 
the activities of this federal spy agency. It is completely 
unacceptable that the CSE, with nearly 2,000 civilian and 
military employees and an annual budget of over $200 million, 
is not subject to any external control.
<P>
	In a democratic society like ours, how can the Prime Minister 
accept spending over $200 million a year on espionage activities 
without making CSE officials accountable to the public?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of National Defence is answerable to the 
House for such questions.
<P>
	Earlier, I answered the question of whether Canadian citizens 
are subject to illegal espionage. The Privacy Commissioner is 
investigating. A report a few years ago said that they were not. I 
hope that the same positive report will come out of this 
investigation. As for the structure of this commission, it 
answers to the House through the Minister of National Defence, 
who must  defend his budget estimates before the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, perhaps the Prime Minister should reread some 
answers which his minister gave on this subject.
<P>
	I shall ask my second question. How can the Prime Minister 
refuse to set up a real external control mechanism for the CSE's 
activities, when the Liberal Party in opposition barely five years 
ago demanded just such a system to control the CSE?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are looking into this situation now. It is something 
that has come up recently. The minister said that it was possible, 
but people must also understand that this kind of activity 
concerns what goes on outside our country, and helps to ensure 
that terrorist acts do not occur in our society; various 
governments throughout the world exchange information so that 
all societies in the world can protect one another.
<P>
	I think that we must do so in a reasonable manner, in 
co-operation with the other levels of government. If there were 
a way to find an acceptable control mechanism, I would really 
like to do so. For now, I do not have the solution, but if I can find 
it, I will be pleased to submit it to the House of Commons.

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have clearly explained what happened many times to 
the House. I came to the conclusion that the minister sent a letter 
as a member of Parliament. When it was interpreted by some 
people to be a recommendation, he explained clearly to all 
concerned that was not his intention. He corrected himself 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7316"> 7316 </A></B>
<P>
without any pressure from anybody when he realized that his 
letter had caused some confusion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have no 
choice but to interpret that answer as meaning that the Prime 
Minister does not believe the principle was violated.
<P>
	Could we then ask the Prime Minister, in order to bring some 
level of confidence to the people of this country that things are 
going right, that the ethics counsellor should now be asked to 
conduct a full and open investigation, making the results public 
in this House as well as to all Canadians? Will the Prime 
Minister undertake to give the ethics counsellor that authority 
today?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the ethics counsellor has informed me that he is 
satisfied with the conclusion I have come to at this time. I do not 
know what else is needed at this time. He has reported to me, as 
it is his responsibility, and I have reported that to the House of

creation throughout Canada.
<P>
	This announcement means that the federal government is 
back in the business of selling Canada as the world's best

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. In spite of the 
election promise made by the Prime Minister not to increase 
taxes, the Minister of Finance, through irresponsible 
statements, and particularly since yesterday, lets the uncertainty 
persist regarding the possibility that RRSPs will be taxed. Yet, 
all agree that such a measure would be irresponsible, despicable 
as well as a step backward.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister eliminate the uncertainty that 
prevails by pledging not to tax RRSPs?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Finance is doing something that has 
never been done previously, before a budget is tabled. He is 
holding vast consultations with Canadians. Everything is 
subject to review. There may be people who favour that option. I 
do not know. Once this consultation exercise is completed, the 
minister will have all the necessary information to prepare a 
budget with a very clear objective: To create jobs and to reduce 
the deficit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister does not realize that his Minister of 
Finance is himself responsible for that uncertainty and that 
unacceptable situation. Yesterday morning, RRSPs were not 
going to be taxed; in the afternoon, the minister did not know for 
sure, while in the evening there was a possibility that RRSPs 
might be taxed. This is irresponsible on the part of the 
government.
<P>
	If the government really wants to show taxpayers that it is 
serious about reducing spending and not increasing taxes, why 
does the Prime Minister refuse to formally pledge that he will 
not raise taxes and that he will not tax RRSPs? The Prime 
Minister must fulfill his promise!
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have to wait. The budget will be tabled in February, 
as is the case every year. The answer will then be known. In the 
meantime, the Minister of Finance is doing his homework. I 
think it is a very good idea to consult people and not rule out any 
solution. Let us not forget that some people complain that our 
tax system is not always adequate and is sometimes unfair. The 
minister is considering the whole issue of taxation. Moreover, 
he is inviting all Canadians to make representations. For 
example, Mr. Battle, who works in the field of social policy in 
Canada, appeared before the committee yesterday and said that 
the government could go ahead with its reform but should also 
look at the taxation issue to ensure that the system is fair to all 
Canadians.

IMPLEMENTATION ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-57, an act to implement the agreement 
establishing the World Trade Organization, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, the legislation we are considering 
today, Bill C-57, is an act to implement the agreement 
establishing the World Trade Organization. The bill will ensure 
the implementation of the GATT agreement which I signed on 
behalf of Canada in Morocco in April.
<P>
	Adoption of this legislation will enable Canadians to reap the 
benefits of the biggest trade deal in history. By creating a more 
open and stable international trading environment this 
agreement will generate increased Canadian exports and 
investment. Exports, the driving force behind Canada's recent 
economic recovery, are crucial to the achievement of this 
government's job and growth agenda and to Canada's 
continuing prosperity.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	The legislation before us today approves the agreement. It 
amends Canada's existing laws and tariff schedules to bring 
them into conformity with our obligations under the Uruguay 
round agreement. Finally, it provides for the appointment of 
representatives to the new World Trade Organization and for the 
payment of Canada's share of its budget.
<P>
	We made clear before assuming office that a Liberal 
government would continue to support GATT as the cornerstone 
of Canada's trade policy. We undertook to focus our efforts on 
breaking the deadlock in the GATT Uruguay round of 
negotiations and on building a new World Trade Organization. 
This legislation before us today is the fruit of those efforts.
<P>
	The Uruguay round, the largest most comprehensive trade 
negotiation ever undertaken, involved more governments than 
any of the previous rounds of the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade. The final package contains over 30 agreements, 
understandings and declarations, capped by the agreement to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7319"> 7319 </A></B>
<P>
create the new World Trade Organization. The agreements 
include an  enormous package of national commitments to lower 
tariffs and non-tariff barriers to merchandise trade, a thorough 
reform of trade rules and the extension of the world trading 
system to cover such new issues as trade in services and trade in 
intellectual property.
<P>
	Completion of the Uruguay round will have major 
implications for the world and for the Canadian economy well 
into the next century. Conclusion of the round after seven and a 
half years of difficult and uncertain negotiations has already had 
a positive impact through improved confidence in the global 
economy.
<P>
	The GATT Secretariat in Geneva estimates that the global 
income will be at least $500 billion higher in the year 2005, 
some 10 years hence, than it would have been without the 
Uruguay round. Some economists believe that even these 
numbers, large though they are, may underestimate the impetus 
to growth, innovation and investment that will result from the 
Uruguay round agreement. Economists without exception have 
underlined the substantial potential benefits for all members of 
the global trading system, including Canada.
<P>
	Using prudent economic assumptions, we estimate 
quantifiable Canadian gains of at least a .4 per cent increase in 
real income, or $3 billion annually when the agreement is fully 
phased in. These are however only a fraction of the actual gains 
that will certainly occur.
<P>
	Although this Uruguay round agreement covers a wide array 
of issues affecting international trade relations, three areas 
stand out, both as a result of the leadership role that Canada 
played in promoting progress and consensus and as a result of 
these elements representing for us the most important and 
beneficial achievements of the Uruguay round. I refer to the 
market access package, to the agreement on subsidies and 
countervailing duties which grew out of a Canadian draft, and to 
the agreement to establish a new institution, the World Trade 
Organization, with a greatly strengthened and integrated dispute 
settlement system. The creation of the World Trade 
Organization is largely the result of a joint initiative by Canada 
and the European union.
<P>
	Under the Uruguay round agreement access to markets for 
industrial products will be substantially improved with most 
tariffs being cut by at least one-third. Deeper cuts including 
zero tariffs in some 10 sectors will also be made. Overall, 
Canadian exports to the European union for example will benefit 
from tariff reductions of almost 60 per cent. To take another 
example, tariffs on our exports to Japan will be reduced by about 
70 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	The impact of tariff escalation will also be reduced. For 
example the gaps between tariffs on finished products and raw 
materials will fall by as much as two-thirds for products of 
importance to Canada such as copper, lead, zinc, and other 
non-ferrous metals.
<P>
	A major achievement of the Uruguay round is that for the first 
time the agricultural sector is brought under the rules based 
multilateral trade regime. Agricultural tariffs will be cut overall 
by 36 per cent with domestic support measures to be reduced by 
20 per cent and export subsidies by 36 per cent in terms of 
budgetary expenditures over a six year period. This represents a 
significant gain for Canadian agricultural exporters. More 
generally the agricultural reforms will contribute to improving 
efficiency in the world economy, providing a good start for 
future disciplines particularly on agricultural export subsidies.
<P>
	Also for the first time trade in services and trade related 
intellectual property are brought within the framework of the 
multilateral trade disciplines. The agreement on services covers 
trade and investment worth some $2 trillion annually and will 
promote continuing liberalization in these sectors. Multilateral 
rules on intellectual property will provide a stronger basis for 
the development and transfer of technology. Agreements in 
areas as diverse as rules of origin, import licensing and 
pre-shipment inspection will improve conditions for all 
international traders.
<P>
	As I already mentioned the agreement strengthens trade 
remedy rules, thus realizing one of Canada's priority objectives 
on going into the Uruguay round some seven and a half years 
ago. The agreement defines the concept of subsidy for the first 
time in a multilateral trade agreement. Further, it sets out 
criteria exempting certain subsidies for regional development, 
research and development, and the environment from 
countervailing measures. In this era of fiscal constraint, Canada 
will benefit from the strengthening of multilateral disciplines on 
subsidies that can have such an adverse effect on our 
competitive position in both domestic and foreign markets.
<P>
	Although the Uruguay round agreement does contain some 
improvements with respect to anti-dumping measures, we shall 
have to go further to ensure that such measures are not used in 
the future as an instrument for continuing protectionism.
<P>
	The agreement effectively precludes unilateral measures in 
responding to trade disputes. The new integrated dispute 
settlement system, one with clearer rules, tighter deadlines and 
for the first time an appeal process with binding effect is a major 
improvement over the existing GATT system. In the final 
analysis rules after all are only as effective as the means of 
enforcing them. This wholesale reform of the multilateral trade 
dispute settlement system therefore can represent an important 
if unquantifiable benefit for the small and medium size trade 
players like Canada which are inherently vulnerable to the threat 
of unilateralism by the economic giants.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7320"> 7320 </A></B>
<P>
	Without a doubt the crowning achievement however of the 
Uruguay round is the creation of the new World Trade 
Organization that will replace the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trade. Such a new organization is indispensable in 
overseeing the operation of the complex series of agreements 
and other instruments resulting from the Uruguay round. It will 
also provide for greater political surveillance of the system by 
trade ministers in coming years.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	The new World Trade Organization will finally put 
international trade on a firm institutional footing by becoming 
the third pillar of the world's commercial and financial 
structure, along with the World Bank and the International 
Monetary Fund.
<P>
	As a successor to the GATT, the World Trade Organization 
will provide the forum for future trade negotiations aimed at 
further trade liberalization world wide and the development of 
new global trade rules.
<P>
	All parts of Canada, all regions, most sectors of our economy 
will reap substantial benefit from the Uruguay round 
agreements. The business and agricultural communities as well 
as the provinces were closely consulted throughout the course of 
the seven years and more of negotiation. It is in no small part due 
to their contributions that these agreements will provide real 
tangible benefits for Canadian producers and consumers in all 
regions.
<P>
	Elimination of tariffs for example on paper and allied 
products and lower tariffs on lumber will substantially improve 
access to the European union and Japanese markets for our 
forest products industry, particularly in British Columbia, 
Ontario, Quebec and the Atlantic provinces.
<P>
	The reduction in tariffs and non-tariff barriers in Europe, 
Japan and Korea, although more limited than we would have 
wished, will enhance the export competitiveness of our fish 
products based in Atlantic Canada and British Columbia.
<P>
	The agreement will produce a more market oriented and 
global trading environment for our agricultural sector. The 
reduction in export subsidies and in the volume of subsidized 
exports will put our field crops, particularly grains and oilseeds 
from our prairie provinces, on a more equal footing with those of 
our principal competitors.
<P>
	At the same time, supply management will be able to continue 
operating as an effective Canadian approach to producing and 
marketing dairy and poultry products. The Uruguay round 
agreement allows for the continuation of supply management 
through high import tariffs that will maintain a real security for 
these sectors.
<P>
	New rules and disciplines on sanitary and phytosanitary 
measures will improve prospects for exports of many Canadian 
agricultural and forest products.
<P>
	The reduction and harmonization at lower rates of tariffs for 
chemicals and chemical products will improve access to world 
markets especially in Asia and Latin America for our producers 
concentrated in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario and Quebec.
<P>
	Sectoral free trade for pharmaceuticals will result in lower 
import costs and improved market access and will enhance 
exports to offshore markets, particularly from Quebec and 
Ontario. Improved protection for intellectual property will 
enhance prospects for investment and for research and 
development.
<P>
	The Canadian communications and electronic equipment 
industries concentrated in Quebec and Ontario will benefit from 
the substantial reduction of tariffs in important industrialized 
markets. Software and computer service exports will be 
facilitated by the agreements on services and trade related 
intellectual property.
<P>
	Canada has many strengths in the services sector that will 
benefit from increased global market opportunities brought 
about by the new General Agreement on Trade and Services. 
Services in which Canada is competitive internationally include 
various professional and management consulting services, 
technical testing, financial, computer and environmental 
services, telecommunications, air transport, tourism, 
commercial education and training, health related services, 
maintenance and repair, and services incidental to agriculture, 
mining, forestry, energy and manufacturing.
<P>
	Increased clarity and discipline in the use of multilateral trade 
rules, particularly countervailing duties as well as more 
effective dispute settlement mechanisms, will provide greater 
security of access for Canadian products in many markets. 
Canadian products that have in the past suffered harassment 
from countervail actions that can expect more secure access as a 
result of the agreement include lumber, fish, pork and 
magnesium.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	In addition, new rules under the Uruguay round agreement on 
subsidies provide for the possibility of taking action against 
subsidized products that displace Canadian products in foreign 
markets, including those of the subsidizing country. These 
provisions alone can be a real benefit to Canadian manufacturers 
of civil aircraft and ground transport equipment, steel and steel 
products and other sectors that have often been heavily 
subsidized by foreign governments.
<P>
	As a country that stands to benefit greatly from these 
agreements, Canada has insisted that our principal partners fully 
implement their Uruguay round obligations by legislating them 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7321"> 7321 </A></B>
<P>
into domestic law. We paid particular attention to the United 
States implementing of legislation. We were in frequent touch  
with the American authorities at the highest level. We urged 
them to ensure that the United States legislation faithfully 
reflects the international agreements.
<P>
	We are satisfied that the United States legislation now 
awaiting vote in Congress while not perfect, substantially 
implements the Uruguay round agreements. All of our principal 
trading partners are now in the process of moving their 
legislation forward. We are currently reviewing the European 
union and Japanese implementing bills, which have just been 
tabled. While none of our major partners has yet completed the 
legislative processes, it appears probable that they will in fact 
do so in time to bring the agreements into force and to establish 
the new World Trade Organization two months or so hence on 
January 1, 1995.
<P>
	It is important that Canada play its part and give a clear signal 
to the world community that we intend to complete our domestic 
procedures and implement these agreements into Canadian law 
in time for the January 1 start-up. However, we shall keep a 
close eye on the course of the legislative process in Washington, 
Tokyo and the European union.
<P>
	We do not intend to complete our legislative procedures until 
we see how events unfold elsewhere. Accordingly, we shall 
proclaim our legislation only after our principal partners have 
obtained their necessary legislative approval.
<P>
	With the exception of Germany, Canada is more dependent on 
international trade for its economic well-being than any of the 
other G-7 countries. Canadians understand that our domestic 
market is too small to generate alone the level of prosperity we 
enjoy.
<P>
	It behoves Canadians to make a contribution to the 
functioning of the international trading system proportionate to 
our interest in the system itself. That is why Canada played a key 
role in the seven years or more of negotiations that led to the 
agreement to establish the new World Trade Organization which 
will replace the GATT on January 1. That is why we are now 
playing a leadership role in the complex, detailed, preparatory 
work required to get the new World Trade Organization up and 
running.
<P>
	We in Canada are committed to completing as soon as 
possible the unfinished work of the Uruguay round in such areas 
as government procurement, financial and telecommunications 
services. We are also committed to beginning work on that new 
generation of trade policy issues including such matters as the 
relationship of international trade to the environment, to 
competition policy, to investment and to labour standards. We 
intend to help shape the agenda and basic concepts at an early 
stage so that future negotiations will advance Canadian 
interests.
<P>
	Canada's economic strength now and in the future will depend 
fundamentally on our willingness to stay on the leading edge of 
freer trade, to continue to take an active and creative role in 
forging new relationships and in building new structures that 
over time can extend the reach of a rules-based international 
order.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	The multinational system centred on the World Trade 
Organization will be the foundation of that international order 
but it is not the only element of what is and must be a complex 
and constantly evolving trade order.
<P>
	We must harness for positive ends the profound forces 
pushing us all toward deeper economic integration. Today it is 
more accurate to speak not of trade policy as such but of 
international economic policy. Jurisdictions and policy areas 
that have long been considered to be quintessentially domestic 
are now increasingly subject to international negotiations and 
rule making.
<P>
	The old trade policy issues of tariff and non-tariff barriers 
remain on the table but they are being overtaken by a new 
agenda: concerns over investment policy, regulatory regimes, 
intellectual property, competition law and even international 
monetary policy, a trend which in turn reflects the evolution of a 
yet more globally integrated world economy.
<P>
	If we accept that economic security inevitably lies in 
deepening our commitment to open rules based trade, then the 
issue is really no longer whether we should surrender 
sovereignty but how we take a leading role in building a new 
kind of sovereignty to reflect a new economic order.
<P>
	The reality is that Canada cannot wait for the international 
community to provide the institutions of mechanisms that will 
ensure our economic security. Multilateralism while remaining 
our first option cannot remain our only option. For Canada, this 
means taking a yet more active and creative role in forging 
additional relationships and in building new structures that can 
over time extend the reach of rules based trade.
<P>
	This was the original justification for the U.S.-Canada Free 
Trade Agreement and the subsequent North American Free 
Trade Agreement. It was really just that, to push forward in 
areas where our degree of economic integration seemed to call 
for a deeper, more comprehensive, more expeditious regime of 
rules and procedures than the GATT itself could provide.
<P>
	It is Canada's goal to extend this deeper free trade 
relationship throughout the western hemisphere and beyond, 
regionally if possible, bilaterally if necessary. We are already 
engaged in the negotiation of bilateral investment agreements 
with some international partners. We shall have to consider the 
negotiation of bilateral trade agreements if other avenues 
forward should become blocked.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7322"> 7322 </A></B>
<P>
	Although the negotiation and implementation of NAFTA has 
focused Canada's attention in recent years southward to the rest 
of our hemisphere, we must also begin to explore additional 
means of expanding our trade relations eastward, across the 
Atlantic to Europe and westward across the Pacific to Asia.
<P>
	The momentum for trade liberalization both in the western 
hemisphere and around the world is strong. Canada seeks to 
maintain that momentum. Accordingly I shall convene a 
meeting of the trade ministers of Japan, the United States and 
the European union here in Canada this spring.
<P>
	We shall strive to develop a consensus for new common trade 
initiatives that will be considered at the G-7 summit next June 
in Halifax.
<P>
	In submitting this bill today to the House for approval, the 
government counts on the consensus of all parties in this House 
that the cornerstone of trade policy is a multilateral system of 
mutually agreed market access conditions and 
non-discriminatory trade rules applicable to all that free, fair 
and open trade is essential for the future of the Canadian 
economy and for securing the competitiveness and long-term 
sustainable development of Canada and that trade expansion 
contributes to job creation, achieves higher standards of living, 
offers greater choice to consumers and strengthens the Canadian 
economic union. Such are the objectives that the bill before us 
today seeks to promote.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	I invite members from each side of the House to join in 
considering its provisions, its purposes and ensuring its timely 
adoption.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity today to speak on second reading of 
Bill C-57, an Act to implement the Agreement Establishing the 
World Trade Organization. On April 15 in Marrakesh, Morocco, 
the 125 signatories to the General Agreement on Tariff and 
Trade, commonly referred to as GATT, finally signed the 
agreement that finalized the lengthy negotiations of the 
Uruguay Round, which had taken nearly eight years.
<P>
	Later on, I will elaborate somewhat on the process that led to 
the conclusion of this agreement and on the various stages of the 
Uruguay Round. By signing the Marrakesh agreement, member 
countries created the World Trade Organization, which is to 
replace GATT from now on. However, implementing the various 
provisions of this agreement and the tariff tabled by Canada in 
February will require a number of adjustments to existing 
legislation.
<P>
	The bill before the House today is essentially concerned with 
consequential amendments to existing legislation. Part I of the 
bill covers the ratification of the agreement, identifies the 
positions of Canadian representatives with the various bodies of 
the World  Trade Organization, determines the payment of 
Canada's contribution towards the operating expenses of the 
World Trade Organization and contains provisions for 
suspending concessions the agreement allows in specific cases.
<P>
	Part II of the bill, which is also the most substantial part, 
amends certain acts to reflect the obligations contained in the 
agreement, and as a result, many existing acts will be amended 
by this bill. These include, for instance, the Bank Act, the 
Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act, the Canadian Wheat 
Board Act, the Canada Cooperative Associations Act, the 
Copyright Act, the Customs Act, the Export and Import Permits 
Act, the Financial Administration Act, the Investment Canada 
Act, the Investment Companies Act, the Meat Import Act, the 
Patent Act, the Special Import Measures Act, the Trade-marks 
Act, the Trust Companies Act, the Loan Companies Act and the 
Western Grain Transportation Act.
<P>
	Part III deals with the coming into effect of this bill, showing 
the extent of the ramifications and implications this bill will 
have in our everyday life. In this regard, it is obvious that the 
significant changes brought about by trade liberalization are 
likely to raise a number of concerns in certain circles. The 
changes made in international trade rules are undoubtedly 
bound to result in a restructuring of the various national 
economies and certain economic sectors are more affected than 
others.
<P>
	But apart from these structural adjustments, which are 
temporary and transitional, we must recognize that trade 
liberalization presents us with to formidable challenges and 
note the remarkable adaptability demonstrated so far by the 
various sectors of our economy as well as the vitality shown by 
Canadian and Quebec businesses in the face of market 
expansion.
<P>
	Trade liberalization forces us to become competitive. We 
must rely on those areas where we excel, occupy new market 
niches, put the emphasis on value-added products and, 
consequently, invest massively in research and development as 
well as put in place coherent and efficient vocational training 
and manpower adjustment policies.
<P>
	The establishment of the World Trade Organization will result 
in the strengthening and hastening of the planetary trade 
liberalization movement. There is every indication that it will 
soon be joined by new members, some of which, like China, 
show a major potential for economic development.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	Needless to say that we will be supporting this bill, since it is 
intended to implement an
