</H3><P align=left>
<P><A NAME="LINK3"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from October 2 consideration of the motion for 
an address to His Excellency the Governor General in reply to his 
speech at the opening of the session. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure for me in my capacity as Minister of Health to 
address the House in the course of the debate on the Speech from 
the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before doing anything else, Mr. Speaker, may I extend my warmest 
congratulations to you on your appointment.  Your appointment as 
Deputy Speaker reflects the respect in which you are held on all 
sides of the House.  Members are confident that you will preside 
in a way that is both fair and appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I also say, as this is the first opportunity I have had to 
speak in the House since the election, how grateful I am to the 
voters of Etobicoke Centre for, on a second occasion, affording 
me the privilege to represent their interests in the Parliament 
of Canada.  May I reaffirm to the voters of my riding of 
Etobicoke Centre my solemn commitment to devote all of my 
energies to their service in the coming years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne made clear that one of the three main 
priorities of the government in the current mandate is going to 
be health and health policy.  I welcome the opportunity this 
morning to elaborate on our plans and on our objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members know that medicare represents an extraordinary 
Canadian achievement.  It is an asset, both social and economic, 
of singular value.  It not only provides equality of access to 
Canadians across the country to health care, it also embodies and 
reflects shared Canadian values of compassion, of sharing and of 
equality.  It is an institution in which Canadians take great 
pride. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must also be said that in recent years medicare has become a 
source of increasing anxiety among Canadians.  Canadians worry 
about whether it is going to be there to provide access to the 
highest possible quality of health care as and when that care is 
needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The source of this anxiety, among other things, are the cuts in 
spending by all levels of government, and the necessary 
restructuring that the delivery of health care services has gone 
through in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact remains that the growing concern among Canadians about 
the future of health care and about medicare must be addressed 
because we cannot take the overwhelming support for the public 
health care system for granted.  Canadians overwhelmingly support 
the single payer publicly financed system of providing health 
services across Canada. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1005"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT2"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT2"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1005
<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That support comes at a price.  It is part of a bargain between 
the Canadian people and their government.  Our part of the 
bargain, if we are to retain that support, is that we along with 
the professionals who are the health care providers and in 
partnership with the provinces who deliver the services, must 
ensure that Canadians will have access to the highest quality 
possible in health care as and when it is needed. If we let down 
our part of that bargain we shall lose the support of Canadians 
for the publicly financed single payer medicare system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the levers that influence the quality and access of 
medicare are in the hands of the provinces because they actually 
deliver the services.  But there are important ways in which the 
federal government can assist as well.  It is to those federal 
contributions that we will direct our attention and on which we 
will focus our efforts. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first obvious way we can help is by ensuring that the 
principles set out in the Canada Health Act are respected.  Those 
principles do not just reflect the priorities of the minister or 
his department, they express the choices of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, they reflect the position of this government and its 
party, the same party which inaugurated health insurance some years 
ago.  Those same principles are still the object of strong Canadian 
consensus today. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to enforce the principles of the Canada Health 
Act, not out of devotion to stale ideology or some dated 
catechism but because the Canada Health Act and the public system 
of health insurance which it provides remains the best approach 
to health care for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make clear that I see the federal role in health care 
as something more than just the enforcer of the principles in the 
statute.  We have a very positive role to play as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning let me touch briefly on three ways in which I 
believe the federal government can contribute positively and 
constructively toward restoring the confidence of Canadians in 
the quality of and access to health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing we can do is to stabilize federal transfer 
levels at appropriate amounts.  That we have undertaken to do. 
Commencing next year and for five years the cash portion of the 
transfer to the provinces will be stabilized at $12.5 billion 
annually, exactly the amount recommended by the National Forum on 
Health, a blue ribbon panel that spent two years closely 
examining medicare, its financing and its needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prime minister has already committed the government as 
surpluses become available to investing one-half of any future 
surplus in social programs where need can be shown, and health 
will be among the first priorities for that spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second way the federal government can help in restoring the 
confidence of Canadians in the quality of and access to health 
care is by encouraging innovation.  This we have started to do 
with the creation of the health transition fund. In partnership 
with the provinces we will invest $150 million over the next 
three years.  That effort, which we undertake in common, will 
underwrite our efforts to develop more knowledge about four 
aspects of innovation in particular. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, by reorganizing primary care.  Second, by 
improving the integration of medical services so that family 
physicians, specialists and other health professionals may work 
together more effectively. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1010"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, by finding out how the delivery, organization and 
funding of home care can be improved and, finally, by exploring 
various formulas for financial support and a potential drug plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal and provincial governments will be able to access 
a wealth of information through investments in the Health 
Transition Fund, particularly where innovations to improve the 
quality and accessibility of health care are concerned.  > 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third way that the federal government can contribute 
directly toward assuring continued quality and access to health 
care is by leading and co-ordinating efforts to establish a 
national integrated system of medical information, cutting 
through the walls that now separate the separate information 
systems maintained from place to place around the country.  Only 
with such an integrated, comprehensive system will we enable 
health care providers, administrators and governments to make 
evidence based decisions about the management and the delivery of 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all of this let me assure the House that our objective as a 
government will be not only to maintain medicare but to preserve 
it.  Our objective will be to achieve in the provision of its 
services a standard of excellence.  Canadians deserve nothing 
less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apart from medicare there are other subjects of importance that 
will preoccupy the government during the current mandate.  We 
will continue in a wide variety of ways to promote and protect 
the health and safety of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can report to the House that over the summer considerable 
progress was made, for example, in partnership with provincial 
ministers and with the advice of consumer groups toward the 
creation of a new national blood agency, an agency that will be 
put in place in keeping with principles of accountability and 
safety, learning from the tragic lessons of the past and based on 
a format designed for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say as well that we are committed to excellence in medical 
research.  Through the Foundation for Innovation we are providing 
ways in which research infrastructure can be made available. 
Through the Medical Research Council we are seeing to it that 
peer review awards are made available for those who have 
inquiring minds and who are looking for the treatments, the cures 
and the technologies of tomorrow.  Through the National Network 
of Centres for Excellence, now with permanent status and 
stabilized funding we are encouraging research at our 
universities so that we can truly say that Canada is at the 
leading edge of new ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I also say that we intend to be vigilant in our surveillance 
and in our regulations to protect Canadians from threats to their 
food and to the environment.  The health protection branch will 
continue to fulfil its responsibilities in this regard. Last week 
I announced that we are undertaking a broad and very public 
re-evaluation of the way in which the health protection branch 
does its job.  We will soon publish a consultation document that 
will sketch out alternative approaches to the fulfilment of its 
mandate.  Our effort at every stage will be to ensure that it is 
there to protect the safety of Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the period of consultation, funding to the Health 
Protection Branch will be maintained, until the outcome of the 
analysis is known.  Shortly, I will be announcing the creation of 
a scientific advisory committee comprised of Canadians well known 
and respected in their fields, whose wise advice and comments will 
assist the Health Protection Branch in fulfilling its 
responsibilities better.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we will focus as always on the determinants of health 
because the best way to ensure that we have sufficient supply of 
health care is to reduce demand.  By focusing on the determinants 
of health, whether through diet or proper amount of exercise or 
lifestyle choices, we are ensuring that Canadians of all ages 
will preserve their health and will not need the health care 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before closing let me touch on a separate but related issue, 
Canada's children.  By reason of my office I serve as chair as 
the national children's agenda.  The plight of Canada's children 
is a shared responsibility of all levels of government.  It has 
now been identified as a priority both by the federal government 
and by the premiers who, in a recent annual meeting, reaffirmed 
that doing something about the level of poverty among Canada's 
children is a priority for provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is often said that children are our most precious asset.  We 
must remember that they are our foremost responsibility. Child 
poverty is now at such levels in this country, and of such 
duration, that it threatens to create two tiered citizenship.  We 
all know the appalling numbers.  One in five Canadian children 
lives in poverty.  Forty percent of today's welfare recipients 
are children.  We all know as well that a childhood spent in 
poverty makes it far more likely that child will have difficulty 
in school, will have problems with physical and mental health and 
is more likely to become involved in the criminal justice and 
correction system.  Nowhere is the challenge greater than in the 
aboriginal communities of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians and this government cannot tolerate this problem in 
its present state.  It not only makes good economic and social 
sense to do something about it but it is also a moral imperative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the Minister of Human Resources Development, in 
the last year of the last mandate made a significant contribution 
to this effort by negotiating with his provincial counterparts 
the Canada child tax benefit, an investment of some $850 million 
by the Government of Canada toward those who need it most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have undertaken to at least double that investment as soon as 
resources permit.  Apart from the family income side of the 
equation there is more that the government can and will do.  The 
national children's agenda itself will provide us with an 
opportunity to integrate the efforts being made now sometimes on 
a fragmented basis by the federal and the provincial governments 
to ensure that we are getting the most out of each dollar spent 
toward helping children, to target those who are most in need and 
to avoid duplication and overlap and, as said in the throne 
speech, to measure the results of our efforts by looking at 
outcomes such as a child's readiness to learn when they reach 
school age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The focus of our work will be on investing more, more wisely and 
in a more integrated way, for example in the Canada prenatal 
nutrition program, focusing on early intervention, attention to 
children at the preschool age, learning from the research of Dr. 
Fraser Mustard, Dr. Dan Offord and others who have spoken so 
wisely in identifying the early years of life as the most 
important as a precursor of an individual's success in the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will reinvest in the community action program for children, a 
remarkable Canadian success story, a success that cuts across 
lines of government, that combines the efforts of the Government 
of Canada with the governments of provinces and indeed with 
people in communities to serve the needs of children.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every day of every week in 700 projects in over 500 communities 
across the country, 7,500 volunteer hours per week are devoted to 
these projects that are intended to ensure that children have a 
hot meal in the morning before they go to school, that they are 
protected from abuse, prepared to learn and that they get the 
kind of guidance they need in their earliest years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We shall also establish a network of centres of excellence for 
children to encourage and to bring together research about 
children's needs so that we might know better how to help.  We 
shall invest in the creation of the head start program on 
reserves so that aboriginal children on reserves might have 
benefits that have been extended to others in the urban 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me close by saying that all of these are but examples of 
things that must be done in the health portfolio in the coming 
years.  Progress can be made and must be made toward the 
objectives that I have described if we are to sustain and to 
strengthen the high quality of health care of which we have all 
become proud in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will not be easy, but it seems to me that this House, this 
government is up to the challenge.  Indeed, Canadians are up to 
the challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fitting that a Liberal government will lead the way. The 
Liberals tamed the deficit that so constrained government action 
just four years ago.  The Liberal Party put medicare in place 
three decades ago and it will be we as Liberals who will reinvest 
in the priorities of the Canadian people.  When Liberals are 
faced with challenges they do not simply throw up their hands. 
They roll up their sleeves and get the job done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals do not seek to avoid tough choices, we face them head 
on. If we meet this challenge, if we restore the confidence of 
Canadians in the public system of health care, if we ensure that 
our part of the public bargain is kept then we will have achieved 
what I believe is within our grasp, the achievement of a 
generation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first 
of all, I would like to congratulate the minister on his re-election 
and wish him the best of luck in his new job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very tempted to remind him that the last time he rolled up his 
sleeves and got down to work, it was to make cuts in transfers to the 
provinces, but that is not the point I want to discuss with him today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the minister shares my concern about the national AIDS 
strategy. Some $40 million is to be spent in the next few years to fight 
AIDS. 
Of course all diseases are important. All degenerative diseases, all 
diseases that cause suffering are important, except that AIDS is a viral 
disease. We know the ways in which it can be transmitted, and we know we 
could get this epidemic under control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also know that the Minister of Health has proceeded with an 
evaluation of the strategy, and I may recall it consists of five main 
components. It makes it possible for community groups to provide 
services locally. There is also a research component funded by the 
community strategy. There is also a treatment component. There is a 
component for co-ordination, and there is, of course, the laboratory 
centre for disease control which is more concerned with epidemiology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two questions for the minister. Could he let us know what he 
intends to do about component three of the strategy, considering that 
his department is proceeding with an evaluation? I also want to remind 
the minister that when I was vice-chairman of the committee, I had the 
privilege of presenting a motion that was accepted by the government, as 
a result of which we spent three years examining the whole issue of 
AIDS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I may recall that we spent some time discussing drug licensing. We 
found that the health protection branch had far fewer human resources 
than its U.S. counterpart. Furthermore, a number of witnesses suggested 
we might consider a joint licensing process for the United States and 
Canada. Has the minister had time to consider this?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are my two questions. What direction does the minister intend 
to give the national AIDS strategy and is he considering the possibility 
of resorting to joint licensing by the United States and Canada to 
accelerate the process? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to inform the hon. 
member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve that we reiterated in the Speech 
from the Throne the commitment we made during the election campaign 
to invest $40 million annually over five years in the fight against 
AIDS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very much aware that we have to consult those involved in 
preparing an integrated strategy for the money we intend to spend. 
I can tell him that officials in my department and in my office are 
currently talking to those involved across Canada in the 
preparation of this strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the hon. member that there are various elements 
to this strategy, such as research, treatment, co-ordination 
between laboratories, pharmaceutical companies and so on.  We 
intend to include all these elements in the strategy we are 
preparing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, in the coming weeks I myself will have the 
opportunity to meet with the experts and those active in the 
community.  I will be in Montreal shortly to meet these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, in Toronto, I took part in the march against AIDS 
and I met a number of those leading the fight in Toronto. 
I hope later this fall to be able to announce the details of our 
strategy. But I would stress that we intend to fully honour our 
commitment to invest in this strategy to ensure that every possible 
effort is made in the fight against AIDS in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
do not think I have had the opportunity to congratulate you on 
your appointment. We certainly look forward to your impartial 
judgments on all of our proceedings.  That was not a tongue in 
cheek comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe Canadians all across this country are very concerned 
and have some very grave reservations not only about the health 
of our country in terms of our national unity but also about the 
health and well-being of the many important matters that fall 
under this minister's purview. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had in the past few years some very strong confidence 
shaking concerns in matters of health in this country.  We have 
seen the whole blood transfusion system in this country put in 
grave jeopardy.  Perhaps the results of the Krever report and the 
recent supreme court judgment will finally give Canadians some 
real answers about where blame should be laid in that very 
important area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those of us, including myself, who take natural health products, 
25 percent of all Canadians and 34 percent of all Americans, 
cannot understand why this government continues in many cases to 
deny each one of us freedom of choice in the purchase and use of 
natural products which many of us have been consuming all of our 
lives and which people around the world have in some instances 
been consuming for 2000 years.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The owners of health food stores in my riding of 
Nanaimo—Cowichan have told me about the arbitrary removal of 
hundreds of products from their shelves by the health protection 
branch.  The ministry is cutting not only into their profits but 
more important also into Canadians' right of access to natural 
health products and their freedom of choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This problem has to be resolved by the minister and the 
government.  As the deputy health critic for the Reform Party, I 
and the rest of the members of the Reform Party will hold the 
government and the minister accountable for actions in this 
matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently we heard from a senior official who at one time was the 
assistant head of the health protection branch of the Department 
of Health, Dr. Michèle Brill-Edwards.  She continued to express 
some very grave concerns about inadequate testing of drugs which 
Canadians use daily.  Standards often are not as high as we find 
in neighbouring jurisdictions such as the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently in an interview she talked about the drug Imitrex which 
is used to combat the debilitating effects of migraine headaches. 
My wife is a user of this drug.  As her husband I want to be 
assured that it is safe.  When I hear a former official of the 
health protection branch expressing grave concerns, I worry about 
the competence of the minister and his ministry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure the minister that we will do all we can to 
co-operate in his agenda but we are going to be keeping his feet 
to the fire on these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to the hon. 
member from Nanaimo—Cowichan for touching on these important 
subjects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First in relation to the blood system, we all await the delivery 
of the Krever report.  Mr. Justice Krever is bound to make an 
important contribution toward our knowledge of the best way to 
ensure the safety of the blood system.  When his report is 
received it will be made public and Canadians will see our 
reaction to his recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of herbal remedies, there is somewhat of an 
inconsistency in the hon. member's position.  With respect to 
herbal remedies, he decries the regulation by the Department of 
Health that it interferes with the unrestricted access by 
Canadians to certain products.  On the other hand when it comes 
to medication, in this case for migraine headaches, he says that 
there is not sufficient regulation, or the health protection 
branch is not interfering sufficiently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me assure the hon. member that our focus is on getting it 
right.  With respect to herbal remedies, we do recognize the 
importance of choice by Canadians.  We recognize the importance 
of allowing Canadians access to appropriate natural products 
which they believe will enhance their health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time we have to worry that there is the appropriate 
amount of regulation to ensure that Canadians are not victimized 
by those who would swindle them or make unfounded demands or put 
improperly labelled products on the shelf.  Striking the right 
balance between regulation for safety and choice is something we 
will work toward. I will have an announcement in Toronto tomorrow 
that will deal with this very matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of the health protection branch, Canadians should 
not have to choose between a former employee who is critical and 
a minister who responds about what the health protection branch 
is doing.  Instead they should have confidence in the health 
protection branch and that confidence should be engendered by an 
open appraisal of its work.

consultation document about the way the health protection branch 
is organized. We are appointing an arm's length independent 
science advisory board to offer its views about whether we have 
it right and let Canadians know whether we are doing the job 
properly.  And we are suspending all further cuts in the branch 
until that process is finished.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank 
you for this opportunity to respond to the government's Speech 
from the Throne.  I would like to inform the Speaker that I will 
be splitting my time this morning with the hon. member for Prince 
George—Peace River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to start by congratulating you, Mr. Speaker, for 
your appointment to the Chair and also the hon. Minister of 
Natural Resources for his appointment, the minister that I will 
be critiquing in this Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to thank the constituents of the constituency 
of Athabasca for re-electing me to represent them for a second 
term in a riding that certainly without any question is key to 
the energy future and the energy self-sufficiency of Canada.  I 
am honoured to be able to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present the natural resources industry is confronted by many 
impediments to its continued contribution to Canadian employment 
and wealth creation.  It is my hope that the newly appointed 
Minister of Natural Resources will heed the many voices from 
within the industry and use the expertise of the Canadian 
population when deciding what his legislative priorities will be 
and which policies he will be advocating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time I would like to express my regret over the lack of 
attention to the natural resources industry in the Speech from 
the Throne.  No more than four lines made reference to natural 
resources and not a single mention was made of either forestry or 
mining.  This is perhaps understandable but nonetheless 
astounding considering the significance of the contribution the 
resource sector makes to Canadian wealth and employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 mining, energy and forestry contributed a combined total 
of $91.6 billion to Canada's GDP which constituted over 13.5 
percent of Canada's total GDP.  These three industries directly 
employ 750,000 Canadians and create countless spin-off jobs in 
the industry and in the service sectors.  The products of these 
three industries alone account for approximately 38 percent of 
Canada's domestic exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's total lack of attention to these significant 
contributions is indicative of the low priority that this 
government and past Liberal governments place on the needs of the 
resource sector.  I hope the limited mention of natural resources 
in the Speech from the Throne was simply an oversight and not a 
continuation of the Liberals' traditional lack of attention to 
the important role of natural resources in the Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am particularly concerned about the future of the mining 
industry in Canada, an industry that accounts for approximately 
16 percent of Canada's exports and generates employment for over 
400,000 Canadians both directly and indirectly.  Approximately 
150 communities which are home to over one million Canadians are 
supported almost exclusively by the mining industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present the future of the mining sector is in some doubt 
because mineral reserves are being depleted at a faster pace than 
they are being replenished.  Mineral exploration is absolutely 
critical to the replenishment of the reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Significant changes need to be made in mining regulations, and 
environmental regulations need to be streamlined if mineral 
exploration is to flourish. A single environmental assessment 
process based on nationally agreed upon standards is crucial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These were the conclusions of the Standing Committee on Natural 
Resources, in which I participated, in reports tabled in 1994 and 
1996.  In the federal government's response to the report tabled 
in 1996 the government expressed agreement with many of the 
recommendations and solidly committed to make environmental 
regulations affecting mining more efficient. Yet the government 
has been slow to streamline mining regulations, placing projects 
like Voisey's Bay nickel in serious jeopardy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Newfoundland court of appeal's decision to halt construction 
of a road or airstrip at Voisey's Bay without a full scale 
environmental review may cost 3,000 construction and 2,000 
permanent jobs in a part of Canada that most desperately needs 
employment.  It is impossible for a company to know whether it 
wants to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on a complete 
environmental assessment until they know the size and extent of 
the ore body. Without a road or an airstrip, site exploration is 
impossible.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Voisey's Bay is to set the precedent for other mining 
projects, making a full scale environmental assessment necessary 
before exploration is completed, we can be fairly sure that 
mining companies will be more reluctant to undertake new 
exploration projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The formation of a joint federal-provincial review panel to hear 
concerns regarding the Cheviot mine project in Alberta was an 
important first step toward establishing a national environmental 
assessment process based on nationally agreed upon standards. 
Government endorsement of the joint panel's recommendations was 
equally important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The outcome of this first attempt at streamlining is commendable 
but the process is far from complete.  The panel hearings were 
far from efficient, drawn out over a period of three years.  In 
the mining industry this is unacceptable as time is of the 
essence because of the volatility of the markets. However I am 
encouraged by this small step in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was certainly less than encouraged by the brevity of the 
mention of greenhouse gas emissions in the Speech from the 
Throne.  So brief was this mention that it failed to even hint at 
the prime minister's intentions regarding a legally binding 
greenhouse emissions cap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The secrecy surrounding the prime minister's intentions is 
alarming given the serious impacts that such a cap would have on 
the Canadian economy.  The oil and gas industry will suffer 
tremendous financial losses as will the electrical industry in 
Alberta and now in Ontario which will return to coal burning 
after serious problems at Ontario Hydro nuclear plants. If a cap 
is introduced, Canadians can expect dramatic increases not only 
in gasoline and home heating fuel but also in electrical energy 
rates. At this time it is imperative that the prime minister 
proceed with caution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While some scientists and environmentalists have developed 
models that imply a link between rising greenhouse gas emissions 
and global warming, not all scientists subscribe to this theory. 
I am not trying to imply that this lack of consensus means that 
the government should not act. However, given the lack of solid 
scientific evidence in support of the theory of global warming, 
it seems a legislated emissions cap is premature especially in 
light of the fact that many companies have thus far shown 
compliance with voluntary programs aimed at reducing greenhouse 
gas emissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If as anticipated the prime minister announces a legally binding 
emissions cap in Kyoto, Japan in December of this year, the 
announcement will effectively kill the goodwill built between 
government and industry and will result in a loss of jobs as well 
as government wealth generated through taxation and royalty 
revenues. Precautionary measures like voluntary programs are much 
more economically viable and are in fact making progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suncor Energy for example, a company with oil sands operations 
in my riding, has released its third annual progress report on 
Canada's climate change voluntary challenge and registry program 
in which it states that in compliance with commitments made in 
the Rio accord, it is on track to stabilize greenhouse gas 
emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other large corporations in the oil and gas industry are also 
making tremendous progress in the reduction of greenhouse gas 
emissions.  A legislated cap will only serve to jeopardize the 
viability of other operations that are unable to reduce emissions 
as quickly as the cap might require. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To force compliance by imposing harsh penalties is an extreme 
and unco-operative approach.  Regardless this seems to be the 
approach the government is taking with greenhouse gas emissions 
legislation as well as with Bill C-65, the Canadian Endangered 
Species Protection Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberal government resurrects Bill C-65 in its flawed and 
accusatory form, it will be a slap in the face to all of those 
farmers, ranchers and resource industry workers who are already 
participating in programs and initiatives designed to protect 
endangered species and who have already set aside sections of 
their land as wildlife habitat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If resurrected, Bill C-65 may result in the expropriation of 
private land and the prevention of industrial expansion in areas 
housing endangered species.  There is no question that these 
species need to be protected but private landowners must be 
compensated for their loss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recent tendency of government officials to too quickly side 
with environmentalists is especially frightening to those in the 
forestry sector.  Over 800,000 Canadians are directly and 
indirectly employed in the forestry sector, yet the same 
government that claims to be so concerned with job creation 
strategies seems to give more credence to environmental lobby 
groups than it does to experts from within the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public consultation is also necessary before this government 
agrees to import over 100 tonnes of plutonium from Russian and 
American nuclear warheads to burn as fuel in Candu reactors. 
The recent problems with the premature failure of the Candu 
reactor and disclosure of the problems within Ontario Hydro by 
its employees and the people who run the reactors should 
certainly give government pause for concern over that program.

stop advocating policies and legislation which are damaging to 
the resource industries and instead effect change that will 
promote the growth of the industries.  The continued success of 
natural resource industries is in the best interests of all 
Canadians who benefit from the wealth and employment these 
industries create. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that the government discard the same tired ideas 
that have been used over the past 20 years and put some faith in 
the judgment and ideas of the industry and individuals they were 
elected to represent.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to respond to the hon. member's discussion on the 
issue of resource development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>North America has matured in the last few years.  Resource 
development is taking place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about replenished resources in the mining industry and 
offering them to the lowest bidder, at any environmental cost, 
for the sake of creating jobs and profits.  Usually the 
interested parties are away from the mine or forestry sites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being a neighbour of his constituency, a lot of the emissions 
that are being released in Swan Hills from the many industries 
from which his province profits end up in northern Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of these resources have an end.  The coal mine in Cheviot 
will be developed because the resources were depleted in Luscar. 
They are going to a very pristine valley and digging up an area 
that will be 23 kilometres long by three kilometres wide. This is 
a huge undertaking, but at what price?  That is what the 
consciousness environmentalists are telling the government. That 
is why the aboriginal people are reminding you of the whole 
global climate change which is taking place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talks on the one hand of the emissions that are creating 
ozone depletion.  On the other hand he applauds the coal miners 
for digging up more coal which will create more emissions. These 
things have to be looked at in a global perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can think of the forest industry and the people of Voisey's 
Bay.  A lot of people live in the forest regions and in the areas 
rich in resources, which are usually found in north.  As his hon. 
leader said, it is the final frontier.  The north is not a place 
where the rich come to exploit the lands of the people and take 
back the profits.  We want development the involves local people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Voisey's Bay are saying that.  They do not want 
roads built through their traditional areas without considering 
the environmental and the long term impact it will have on their 
communities.  Any development needs a second look, and should 
involve the local people.  They should be involved in the 
ownership and profit sharing of the development of our resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without Canada we would not have resources.  Without resources 
this Parliament would not be here.  We would still be in Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us respect this continent.  Let us respect who we are and 
where we are going. Let the member consider his conscience and 
let us work together.  It is not a one-way street with one guy 
holding the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that certainly was a classic 
NDP speech.  I am surprised that the member is not speaking to us 
wearing hemp sackcloth clothing and living on bean sprouts.  That 
is what he would have us all do if we were to follow his advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have just as much concern as anyone else does for the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  My hon. colleague from Churchill River would not stand 
up, because it is unparliamentary, to ask the member to take back 
the remark he just made.  I ask, Mr. Speaker, that he take back 
that remark, which borders on racism toward this man's heritage. 
I ask that he—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would only suggest 
that the member should visit some of the modern day mines in 
Canada and look at the work that is being done for environmental 
reclamation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would he not visit the Syncrude and Suncor sites in my 
riding where the mined out areas are now rolling hills retrieved 
with pine, spruce and poplar.  The grass is growing and buffalo 
are grazing where they have not grazed for 300 years.  Why would 
he not visit the TransAlta Utilities mine site west of Edmonton, 
Alberta where tremendous work has been done and the coal mine has 
been reclaimed to a state that is far more productive and just as 
aesthetically acceptable as the ground and the country ever was 
before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I get so tired of the rhetoric that we hear on the issue. We all

would like to congratulate you on your appointment as Deputy 
Speaker.  I am sure you will do a fine job in overseeing the 
sometimes rowdy debates which take place here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to take the opportunity to congratulate the

to that post, as well as the assistant Speakers from Edmonton 
Southwest and Saint—Lambert. I am sure they will all do a 
wonderful job and do honour to this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to congratulate the other 300 MPs who were 
elected to Parliament on June 2 which will bring a wide 
divergence of opinion in this place and across the land. 
However, that does not detract from the fact that we have one 
common goal, which is to represent our constituents as best we 
can.  Congratulations to all members of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noted with some sadness that yesterday we heard of our first 
vacancy of the 36th Parliament created by the resignation of my 
colleague, Sharon Hayes, the past member for Port 
Moody—Coquitlam.  She will be sorely missed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As is customary in making the first speech of a Parliament, I 
want to begin by paying tribute to my riding and my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been honoured three times in 1997.  It has been a pretty 
good year for me.  On January 18, knowing that an election was in 
the air the Reform Party in the riding of Prince George—Peace 
River held a nomination meeting to choose a candidate and I was 
chosen by acclamation. Some would say, surprise, surprise. What 
is the big surprise in that?  Those people would be somewhat 
ignorant of the procedure in the Reform Party of Canada. Two of 
my colleagues from the 35th Parliament learned that in the Reform 
Party every nomination is an open process.  As a result of that 
process, we now have two rookie MPs sitting in the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the Reformers of Prince George—Peace River for allowing 
me to carry our banner through a third election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second was the huge honour bestowed on me by the electorate in 
Prince George—Peace River.  Fully two-thirds of the men and 
women who chose to cast a ballot on June 2 voted for me and the 
Reform Party.  It is my pledge to them today to continue to build 
on the experience that I gained during the last Parliament, to 
continue to work as hard as they do and continue to work toward 
my goal of becoming the best MP possible in representing my 
constituents here in Ottawa.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to digress for a moment and speculate on the 
increase in support that was given to me because even though I 
was very pleased and honoured to be supported by about 56 percent 
of the electorate in the 1993 election, that grew to somewhere 
close to 67 percent on June 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe not a lot of people in the House know that 13 Reform MPs 
out of a caucus of 60 had 60 percent support or over at the polls on 
June 2.  Almost half of our caucus received 50 percent or more. 
I am sure members know how hard, in Canada's multiparty system, 
it is to get a majority win. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask members who were present last time to reflect back 
on the 35th Parliament.  Reform was constantly accused by the 
government and the two other old parties of being a one election 
anomaly. We were, supposedly, a protest vote.  “You won't be 
back” echoed in these chambers.  No more.  We are back, bigger 
and stronger than ever.  A third of our caucus are fresh recruits 
eager to join the veterans in the verbal battle in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third honour I had was when the Reform leader asked me to be 
the chief agricultural critic in the official opposition shadow 
cabinet.  In addition, my colleague from Fraser Valley, the 
official opposition whip, asked me to serve as his deputy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the fact that some of my colleagues started calling me 
the half-whip, I consider it to be an honour to serve in those 
two capacities.  In the weeks and months ahead, I will endeavour 
to live up to the expectations and trust that these people have 
shown in me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the three minutes that I see are remaining in this, my maiden 
speech, I want members present to be assured they can look 
forward to many more great speeches by me in this place over the 
next four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I turn my attention to the throne speech.  Never in the 
history of throne speeches has so much been said about so little 
to so few.  If members recall the throne speech—it is quite a 
while ago—it seemed that even the Prime Minister appeared to be 
having trouble staying awake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From an agricultural perspective I will be blunt.  I think the 
throne speech was absolutely pathetic.  It very clearly showed 
that the government is picking up where it left off in April, 
ignoring the needs of farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the term aboriginal was heard 17 times during the 
51-minute speech, agriculture was mentioned once.  I commend the 
government for its apparent commitment to our country's natives, 
but other Canadians require attention as well. I say apparent 
because like most of the rhetoric coming from the government, all 
is illusion.  If money could solve the problems facing native 
Canadians, it would have done so long, long ago.  Where is the 
vision? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we find is continued support of the Indian industry, the 
chiefs, councils, government bodies, the lawyers, the 
accountants, the consultants but mostly the bureaucrats.  It is 
my contention that DIAND should be renamed the department of 
Indian and northern dependency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the people?  There is no vision for the people. Other 
people too require some vision, require some leadership from the 
government.  Where is the vision for agriculture to carry this 
vital industry into the new millennium?  It is not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am very reluctant to interrupt the 
hon. member in what he is calling his second maiden speech but I 
think it is time to move on to statements by members.  He will 
have two and a half minutes remaining in his speech after 
question period.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadians born prior to September 28, 1972 recall when 
Henderson scored what has come to be known as hockey's most 
famous goal.  Team Canada was playing against the sport's top 
ranked team.  Both the series and the game were tied.  However, 
that changed as Henderson snapped in a rebound and scored the 
winning goal in the final 34 seconds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a nation with an identity crisis the goal did more than 
reaffirm our hockey supremacy.  That spine tingling victory 
somehow became a symbol of Canadianism. Canada rallied behind a 
team that refused to give up even when defeat seemed inevitable. 
The resulting emotional rush bolstered our national confidence 
and the sport's overall image. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 25th anniversary of the Summit Series sparked a flood of 
reminiscence.  The effects of Henderson's goal are as profound 
today as they were when the puck first slammed against the meshing 
of the Soviet net. As a result of that single unifying event we 
were given a tangible reminder of what it feels like to be 
Canadian.

the railways, the railways blame the wheat board and the farmers 
pay.  Bureaucratic inefficiency has cost farmers between $65 
million and $115 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some farmers in the Yorkton—Melville area have been denied this 
year's initial payment from the wheat board because they have not 
been able to pay back last year's initial payment.  And why is 
that?  They have not been able to sell their grain because all 
the elevators are plugged, again thanks to government 
intervention in the marketplace.

Liberal Party who is now under criminal investigation for trying 
to shake down companies that are applying for government grants. 
This fundraiser tried to blackmail those companies by demanding 
they give thousands of dollars to the Liberal Party or risk 
losing their grants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the prime minister.  Who in the government 
leaked the names of the companies applying for grants to the 
Liberal Party? 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member should have begun his question by 
congratulating and praising the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He should have praised him because the minister acted quickly, 
responsibly, and with integrity by immediately bringing the 
allegations to the attention of the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member, in his supplementary question, may want to 
explain this very serious lack in the content of his question. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we 
will get to that, actually.  The RCMP learned about these illegal 
Liberal fundraising tactics in March from a boy scout in the 
Ministry of Human Resources Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big boys in the prime minister's office refused to listen to 
him.  They did not fire this bagmen until June, after the 
election, several months later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the four months the prime minister and his Liberal 
campaign managers knew that their fundraiser was under criminal 
investigation, which ministers continued to associate with the 
fundraiser under investigation? 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
do not have that information.  It does not pertain to the 
administrative responsibilities of the government.  More 
important, there is a criminal investigation under way and I am 
sure the issues the hon. member has raised will be gone into 
thoroughly in the course of the investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to let the investigation proceed in the normal 
and effective fashion the RCMP will be undertaking.  We will see 
what comes out as a result of the investigation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>   Mr. Speaker, 
let us just talk about that for a moment.  We know the RCMP is 
investigating the Liberal Party for its corrupt fundraising 
practices.  I do not care as much about the corruption in the 
Liberal Party as I care about corruption in the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the RCMP is investigating the Liberal Party, but will 
the prime minister launch an independent inquiry into potential 
corruption in the government itself? 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
think one has to reject the premise of the hon. member's 
question.  It has not been confirmed exactly who the targets of 
the investigation might be.  The solicitor general said yesterday 
they could be on one side of the House or his side of the House, 
or it could involve any Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore it would be improper, if not unfair, to speculate and 
create innuendo about something that is under investigation, 
unless the hon. member wants to take steps to prevent the 
investigation from reaching a successful conclusion.  I hope that 
is not his objective because that would be wrong.

is for the Minister of Public Works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues raised by the ongoing investigation into allegations of 
influence peddling throws the whole federal government contract award 
process into question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the public works minister give us the assurance, beyond all

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I can assure this house and my hon. 
colleague that all government contracts are awarded by public tendering, 
open to all. The hon. member and all Canadians can put in a bid, they 
can even use the Internet to do so, and I can assure you that there is 
no influence peddling and that it is all done by the book and in 
accordance with the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a supplementary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that 37 percent of all federal contracts, totalling $3.2 billion in 
1995, were untendered, does the minister not recognize that this 
approach opens the door to all sorts of abuse, including strong 
possibilities of influence peddling? 
<P><A NAME="LINK92"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yes, it does happen, in an emergency or 
for security reasons, that we award what is called sole source 
contracts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I should point out to the hon. member and to the House 
that, when we took office in 1993, 50 percent of government contracts were 
awarded that way, compared to only 35 percent today. And we will keep reducing 
this number.

yesterday I tabled an affidavit by Mr. Dennis Coffey, a 25-year 
customs investigator, in which he confirmed allegations of fraud, 
nepotism and abuse in the Department of National Revenue. 
The minister has repeatedly denied these allegations.  He must 
have some pretty compelling evidence to offhandedly dismiss Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

<P><A NAME="LINK96"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
these are publicly made allegations, publicly reported in the 
newspapers about fraud, corruption, nepotism and abuse in the 
department.  Surely the government takes that seriously enough to 
investigate those independent of the appeal happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the parliamentary secretary deny we have learned that Mr. 
Coffey has alleged that Marvin Goodman, a senior customs manager, 
authorized the use of a government office at 1 Front Street in 
Toronto for his sister to run a dress shop rent free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the government think of this?  Does it think it is

<P><A NAME="LINK97"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

Canada gives preferential treatment to any courier company in 
this country are false and unfounded.  Right now there is a risk 
management system that has been in place and is supported by all

</I></B></P><P align=left>If any member of this House has any evidence that we should be

</I></B></P><P align=left>In what the front page of the New York <I>Times</I> calls “a 
child labour victory”, the U.S. Congress is set to ban the 
importation of goods made by bondaged child labourers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the fact that there is an estimated 15 million 
children working in Southeast Asia and in light of the fact that

comparable legislation that would outlaw the importation and sale 
of goods manufactured by child labour? 
<P><A NAME="LINK111"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, while I compliment the member on question, I would 
like to remind him that last year we set up a special fund to 
encourage Canadian enterprises and organizations to come forward 
with a series of initiatives to deal with the importation of 
products made by child labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we are now working with the ILO to come up with a new 
draft convention dealing with children working in hazardous 
industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, as he probably knows, Canada is one of the few countries

Canadian citizens who go abroad to exploit children. 
<P><A NAME="LINK112"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
White House has also initiated a process that has led to a 
workplace code of practice for monitoring the garment industry in 
that country.  In our country some garment contractors use 
sweatshops and homeworkers on piece work often in violation of 
wage and labour standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister and his cabinet colleagues commit to develop a 
similar code of conduct to end the exploitation of sweatshop 
workers and to help the many fair Canadian manufacturers who

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to give the hon. member three pieces of 
information.  First, we are working actively to have an 
international standard through the Oslo convention.  Canada is 
sponsoring one of the founding meetings that is leading toward 
that international code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we have worked to develop a code of conduct for private 
businesses.  They announced it about a month ago and our 
department was very much involved in pulling it together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we are attempting to develop specific projects overseas 
through the work of CIDA to help remove children from hazardous 
child labour and provide alternative working opportunities for 
them in company with local NGOs in those areas.

he did.

over 25 percent of the population use or rely on natural health 
care products.  These people have galvanized support for the 
right of Canadians to freely choose these products, and they want 
an answer.

the challenge facing any government is to strike the right 
balance between regulation to protect consumers from fraud or 
abuse and, on the other hand, allowing Canadians freedom of 
choice for health related products.  The government is determined 
to find that right balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tomorrow in Toronto, I am going to be making an announcement

I have personal knowledge of the awful tragedy to which the hon.

the areas to which she has referred and I have seen people who 
have died as a result of abusing drugs and using dirty needles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no one simple answer to this issue.  The municipal 
government—and I have spoken with the mayor of Vancouver about 
it—the provincial government and the federal government must, as

over by a judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the law should require money or security to be posted 
before the release of a person accused of a violent crime. Third, 
the law should hold agents of the crown directly accountable for 
the actions or omissions in permitting the release of offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, the law should ensure that sentences reflect society's 
abhorrence for the criminal act in order to act as a true

ask that the Food and Drug Act be revised in various ways, 
including that the definition of food include dietary supplements

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE ADDRESS IN REPLY

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion for an address to 
His Excellency the Governor General in reply to his speech at the 
opening of the session. 
<P><A NAME="LINK163"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
before the important business of question period, and it is too 
bad there is not a little answer period as well, I was on a bit 
of a roll and it is really hard when interrupted to get back up 
to speed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During my brief remarks I was congratulating you, the other 
speakers and all members of Parliament on their election or 
re-election to this august Chamber.  I was remiss in not 
congratulating the new minister of agriculture on his 
appointment. He has a very difficult job ahead to convince his 
cabinet and his caucus colleagues to develop a new vision for the 
industry that will keep pace with the vision that is being 
developed out in the real world by the farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party has been quite critical of the so-called 50:50 
arrangement in the throne speech that has been put into place 
with a commitment by the government once we move beyond a 
balanced budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two days ago an open line show was conducted in my riding of 
Dawson Creek.  There were about 69 calls from Canadians.  About 
eight and a half were in favour of increased spending for social 
programs, and about nine and a half favoured tax relief. 
Interestingly enough, 51 calls favoured debt reduction.  That 
says to me this government is on the wrong track, that the 
majority of Canadians recognize the huge threat to the Canadian 
economy, indeed to the security of all Canadians, that $600 
billion of debt represents.

but in the way it governs this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers in Canada will not survive because of government action 
but because of their own ambition, innovation and initiative. 
That is the way it has always been, that is the way it will 
always be.  But this government can take some leadership, show 
some vision and help the farmers not only in my riding but across 
the nation to achieve their goals, and it is not doing it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK164"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate 
my colleague from British Columbia on a wonderful speech.  He 
made a number of commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was interested about the role of a member of Parliament. He 
talked a little about that, about the aspirations he had in 
representing his people here.  I would like him to give us a 
little comment on the record of the Liberals versus the record of 
Reformers on listening to the people, responding to them and 
representing them in this House.  That would be an interesting 
part to his speech which he really did not get into that much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, every member of the Reform 
Party could go on and on at great length about the lack of real 
representation that has come from the opposite side of the House 
over the life that we have been here which is only one Parliament 
for most of us with the exception of our deputy leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Liberal government is not representing the wishes of its 
constituents by and large.  Something interesting was pointed out 
in the 35th Parliament which I am sure we are going to see 
repeated in the 36th Parliament.  Time and time again when a 
member who sits on the government side truly tries to represent 
the best interests and the wishes of his or her constituents, if 
those interests run contrary to the position of the government or 
that of the cabinet and the prime minister, what happens? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens with the old parties?  We saw it under the Mulroney 
Tories before the Liberals.  Members of Parliament were 
disciplined, at times even thrown out of their parties for trying 
to represent the interests of their constituents.  That is also 
what happens with the Liberal Party.  We saw that in the last 
Parliament with the hon. member for York South—Weston when he 
tried to represent his constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He ran his campaign on the issue of abolishing the GST, as did a 
lot of members in this House who sit opposite on the government 
benches.  He had the integrity to vote against a budget measure 
because he said it did not fulfil that campaign promise.  He was 
bitterly disappointed in the government for not taking decisive 
action, for not living up to its campaign promise. Therefore he 
voted against it and what happened?  He was thrown out of his 
party and sits now in this House as an independent. It is a 
credit to him and to the Canadian electorate in his riding that 
it re-elected him as an independent.  It is a tough job to get 
elected as an independent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question dealt specifically with the representation provided 
by Reformers versus the representation of Liberals and Tories and 
the other parties in this place.  I suggest that we really 
need some reform of this place.  We need to see many more 
free votes in this place, real free votes, where individuals 
regardless of partisan political stripe can really represent the 
interests of their constituents.

the party discipline in the Liberal Party would be crying out 
along with us for those types of reforms so that they can really 
represent the interests of their constituents and not worry that 
the big broad axe is going to fall on their necks and they are 
going to be publicly disciplined and chastised by their 
leadership and perhaps even ultimately thrown out of their party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke earlier in my remarks before question period about the 
fact that Reform is in this House despite the fact that in the 
last Parliament they said we would not be back.  But we are back 
and we are going to continue to come back until this place is 
reformed and we have real democracy in this House of Commons.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with my colleague, the hon. member for Longueuil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like, if I may, to begin by speaking to my 
constituents in the riding of Rosemont.  I would like to thank the 
people of Rosemont and Petite-Patrie, as well as all of my riding 
volunteers, for the trust they have given me in the last federal 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank them in particular for the confidence they have shown 
in my generation and in the future of Quebec, a Quebec which we 
wish to be modern and sovereign, a Quebec that reflects my 
generation, open to the world and master of its destiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to offer thanks on their behalf to the man 
who defended them with vigour throughout the previous two mandates, 
Benoît Tremblay.  Mr. Tremblay always had an attentive ear to the 
needs of his fellow citizens of Rosemont—Petite-Patrie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech again shows that the voters of 
Rosemont—Petite-Patrie were right in their choice.  By electing 
a representative of the Bloc Quebecois, they have made sure that 
any threat to the democratic interests of the Quebec people will 
be condemned.  With their support solidly behind me, I rise today 
in the House of Commons to react strongly to the thinly veiled 
desire of the government across the way to put Quebecers back in 
their place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My fellow citizens who still had any doubt could see in this 
speech that the Liberals have dropped the commitment they made in 
the 1995 referendum to recognize Quebec as a distinct society. 
They dropped this description of Quebec because Canadians felt it 
gave too much to Quebec.  Rather, they adopted the notion of unique 
character proposed in Calgary.  So they want to force Quebeckers to 
choose between being like Pacific salmon or facing the threats of 
plan B. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Never has a government in a Speech from the Throne so openly 
questioned Quebec's right to decide its future alone.  Naturally, 
after the action taken in the supreme court, it would be surprising 
if the government were to change its tune and try to accommodate 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister said during his address on the Speech from 
the Throne that elections were fascinating, that they provided him 
with the opportunity to meet Canadians of all walks.  He said that 
the dreams and aspirations of young Canadians were a source of 
inspiration for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I would like to say to him that young Quebecers dream of 
freedom and aspire to sovereignty.  Nothing in the government's 
legislative agenda meets the political expectations of the young 
people of Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This throne speech is an outstanding example of a strategy for 
centralization. After slashing budgets for health care, education and 
social services in Quebec and the provinces, this government now claims 
to be concerned about the well-being of our citizens. In fact, this is 
just the logical continuation of a long federal offensive to interfere 
in areas of provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues previously condemned many examples of this 
interference in the throne speech. I would rather use the time I am 
allowed today to discuss a matter of the utmost importance to members of 
my generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Protecting our environment is important to all of us and it is a 
matter of concern for Quebeckers. 
I was astonished to see this government allowed this important question, 
the environment, only two short paragraphs. And since this government is 
extremely vague about its intentions and would rather not discuss its 
far from outstanding record in this area, I would like to recall some of 
the main points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have often claimed that their strategy for the 
environment was a perfect example of enlightened, open and decentralized 
federalism. However, during the previous mandate, they had no 
compunction about tabling bills that were a direct intrusion in the 
jurisdiction of Quebec. There are plenty of examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the Environmental Assessment Act, which came into 
effect during the previous mandate, impinges directly on provincial 
responsibilities and in many ways duplicates Quebec's legislation in 
this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then this government tabled a bill to replace the existing Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act.  The proposed legislation would once again 
have given the federal government greater power to interfere in order to 
protect the marine environment and reduce atmospheric pollution, to name 
just two sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, this government tabled a bill for the protection of 
endangered species.  Enforcement of this legislation could have been 
extended to provincially held land, and all provincial environmental 
ministers opposed it.  This government rejected the amendments suggested 
by the Bloc Quebecois to uphold the provinces' jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Returning to the throne speech, I read and reread it, but did not 
find a single line telling us what this government intends to do with 
these two bills, which died on the <I>Order Paper</I> in the last Parliament. 
I am, however, pleased to note that the throne speech raised the problem 
of the emission of greenhouse gases.  I am still, however, trying to 
find out exactly where the government stands on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not need to remind anybody that, in under two months, this 
same government will be representing Canada and Quebec at the 
international conference on greenhouse gases in Kyoto.  With only two 
months to go, there is still no news on where Canada stands on this 
issue.  Worse yet, it looks like the Liberals want to develop the entire 
Canadian policy on greenhouse gases behind closed doors.  This would 
perhaps be less disturbing if the government's track record in this area 
were not so disastrous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992, in Rio, the Canadian government made a commitment to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the 1990 level by the year 2000. 
In addition, in 1995, the Liberal government repeated this commitment at 
the Berlin conference on climate change.  On that occasion, it 
introduced a framework of voluntary measures in its national action plan 
regarding climate change in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What must be pointed out is that the most recent data, including 
those from Environment Canada, show that Canada has not respected its 
commitments.  In fact, the Royal Society of Canada estimates that, in 
the year 2000, greenhouse gas emissions will exceed the 1990 reference 
level by 9.5 percent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not surprising therefore that the former environment minister 
tacitly admitted before the UN Commission on Sustainable Development 
last April that Canada was falling short in its efforts to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
Furthermore, Canada is still lagging behind OECD countries as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government must now stiffen its resolve and meet its 
responsibilities. 
The consequences of global warming are too serious to be taken lightly. 
Also, we must bear in mind the economic implications of the commitments 
that will be made in Kyoto. In that sense, it seems unacceptable to me 
that the position that will be put forward as Canada's position be taken 
by a mere handful of Liberals and senior civil servants.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with an environmental, political and technological 
problem that leaves no room for improvisation. In that context, I am 
puzzled by the priorities of a government which, in its Speech from the 
Throne, seemed to give as much importance to celebrating the coming of 
the next millennium as to the challenge of global warming that faces 
humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The young people in Quebec want to build a fair and responsible 
society, while at the same time taking an active part in the great 
international currents of the third millennium, and they want to do so 
with all the tools available to a normal country or society. That is why 
we are convinced that sovereignty is the only option for the future of 
Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I endorse, with 
great pride, what my hon. colleague just said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He spoke of his generation and we, who are of an older generation 
shall I say, share the same concerns and feel more acutely the urgency 
of finding a solution to these problems. He discussed at length the 
greenhouse gas issue, but that is not the only issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that all that is done be done under the 
national urisdiction, without affecting all that comes under provincial 
jurisdiction. I must say that one of the Quebec government's priorities 
is indeed to protect the environment. I consider that we have gone far 
enough in that direction to know something about agriculture, for 
instance. We have exceeded by far every national standard and do not 
wish to lag behind, but at the same time we expect a great deal of 
transparency in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think it was clearly shown 
in the Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable 
Development that we in the Bloc want to improve our environment. 
We think that Quebec, like Canada, is an ecosystem and that the 
provinces and Quebec are capable of establishing their own 
standards and environmental policies.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member speaks of commitment to democracy.  He is committed 
to the democratic process or he states so. The hon. member seems 
very focused on protecting democracy.  If he is telling the 
truth, I ask will he break ranks with his party and respect the 
majority of Quebeckers as they demonstrated in the last 
referendum?  Democracy has spoken, sir, will you listen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I remind hon. members that it is 
necessary to address the Chair.  And of course it is assumed that 
all members in the House are always telling the truth.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think perhaps it would be 
appropriate to recall some of Quebec's recent history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that, in 1980, a referendum was held in 
Quebec on that question and, as far as I know, the Government of 
Quebec honoured the choice of the majority of Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also point out that, in 1995, another referendum was 
held.  Even if the sovereignists lost the battle by 50,000 votes, 
we are a democracy, and the Government of Quebec is democratic.  It 
honoured the democratic choice of Quebeckers.  In this respect, I 
hope the Government of Canada will honour the results of the next 
referendum, because Quebec has always been a democratic nation.

Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the member 
for Rosemont.  He is a quality replacement for Benoît Tremblay, a 
member of Parliament who represented Quebec in the past. I am 
particularly proud to see that young people are providing 
reinforcements to the sovereignist ranks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been trying to find a solution for twenty years.  We 
have tried every way to get Canada to budge.  In the end, the only 
way will be for Quebeckers to accord a political mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member for Rosemont what he would like most to 
be achieved at the end of this mandate so that, when he leaves 
Parliament, he can say “mission accomplished” to all Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think young Quebeckers are 
joining the legitimate march of the people of Quebec in the course 
of their history.  Young people in Quebec have always believed in 
the political action of the people of Quebec in its history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best indicator of the future, as all the polls show, are 
the results of the 1995 referendum, which were clear.  What young 
Quebeckers want is to be part of the changes that are happening now 
in Quebec, but the only way we can fully achieve our collective 
destiny is by becoming sovereign. 
<P><A NAME="LINK169"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the first 
words I speak in this House are directed to those who supported me from 
the very beginning and believed in me. In Longueuil, we proved that when 
people want something, when they put all their energy into a plan in 
which they believe and a dream they cherish, the combined strength of 
these individuals can move mountains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank those who give me their encouragement, support and 
advice during the last election campaign, so that I could come here to 
represent them. I want to thank all the volunteers who worked so hard to 
ensure that the riding of Longueuil is once again represented in the 
House of Commons by the only party that looks after their interests and 
has done so since 1993, the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To all those men and women who put their trust in me, especially my 
family and my husband, I say thank you from the bottom of my heart. I 
also thank the people of Longueuil who voted for the youngest woman in 
this Parliament. Today I want to reiterate my commitment to serving and 
representing them to the best of my ability and with the utmost 
dedication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to thank my friends among the hearing impaired whom it 
is always a pleasure to meet. Today I want to confirm my commitment to 
working for the deaf. It is an honour and a privilege to salute them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was curious to read the throne speech, and I was disappointed 
when I read it a second time. The only conclusion I could draw is the 
message sent to Quebec: Be satisfied with a centralist Canada as it is 
now. Otherwise, it will be plan B. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After repeating this message for months and after it was almost 
unanimously criticized by Quebec, the Prime Minister has come back 
again, with the same centralist message, this time in writing, saying he 
thinks he knows what is best for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Prime Minister again trying to scare Quebeckers? Is he 
trying to make Quebecers accept the “lesser of two evils”? Never before 
did a throne speech contain such direct threats to Quebec's right to 
determine its own future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers will never agree to be satisfied with the “lesser of two 
evils”, much less with the alternative, which we all realize consists in 
making Quebec go along with the centralist vision of the Liberals and 
give up its historical expectations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet I would not be honest if I did not admit that I agree with 
one point which passed virtually unnoticed in the torrent of words 
in the throne speech. I interpret it as a surprise overture coming 
from our friends across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As everyone is well aware, what we representatives of the Bloc 
Quebecois want is a country for the year 2000.  That we have never 
hidden.  Now, in reading the throne speech to keep myself awake 
between coffees, I see in black and white that the federal 
government is prepared to form a partnership with the Quebec 
government to celebrate the new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course we will have suggestions of activities to submit to 
the government, and we may even perhaps send an invitation to the 
head of state of the next country to come celebrate the new 
millennium with us in Quebec. 
That is the least partners can do, celebrate with pomp and 
circumstance the occasion of an event as important as the arrival 
of a new country among the nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to accept the idea of the Canadian Prime Minister 
and I invite him to Quebec three years from now.  We will drink a 
toast to the new economic partnership between Quebec and Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the exception of this small overture, what can be seen 
clearly in this speech is the federal government's stubborn 
determination not to recognize the legitimate right of Quebec to 
decide its own future.  The federal government even seems to want 
to reserve the right to draft and impose its referendum question 
during the next referendum.  One wonders whether the referendum 
ballot will have a red maple leaf printed at the top. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I find most upsetting in this speech is that the sovereignist 
movement's proposal is misrepresented by the excessive repetition of the 
word “partnership” when what is meant is interference, overlap and 
costly duplication.  You will agree that this is not the same thing as 
the real economic partnership we are proposing to Canada.  We are used 
to seeing this government glibly twist any proposal coming from Quebec. 
They have outdone themselves in the bad faith department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point in my speech, I would like to turn to a subject of 
great interest to me and one that my party has entrusted me with 
defending:  the status of women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I would like to express my surprise and 
disappointment at the throne speech's complete silence on women's 
concerns.  Nothing in this speech has women in mind. 
Worse yet, no one is speaking about them or for them.  The government 
has not even taken the trouble to “feminize” the text.  My search for 
some reference to women netted only one occurrence, in the very first 
line of the speech, where the Governor General tells us how happy he and 
his wife were to welcome Her Majesty the Queen last June.  Need I say 
more? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is the best our political system can do for women, I can 
tell you that we have our work cut out for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In case he is listening, I would like to remind the Prime 
Minister some facts about the most beautiful country in the world 
and the best country in the world to live in, as he likes to say. 
In Canada, women hold 75 percent of the ten lowest paying jobs; 
36 percent of women work part time, because they are unable to 
find full time jobs. In 1996, Canadian women earned 73 percent of 
what their male colleagues made. Moreover, 57.3 percent of single 
mothers with children under 18 years of age live in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Need I go on about the tragic plight of women in the most beautiful 
country in the world and the best country in the world to live in? The 
government must realize that it is women who are paying the price for 
the cuts made in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost-cutting measures taken by this government were felt more 
deeply by women than by any other group in our society. 
The government does not seem to be too upset, since nothing is provided 
for women in the throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the government has a duty to do something to help women 
because, in addition to the numerous cuts, the government also reduced 
by some 26 percent funding for women's programs, which were already operating 
on a shoestring budget. The government has got its priorities wrong. 
Ideally, women should get a little more to make up for what they lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to all the women who 
preceded us and who worked so that, today, the situation has improved 
somewhat, thanks to the many battles they fought. We have come a long 
way, but the road ahead is still a long one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to these women, some progress was made regarding equity, 
including the “equal pay for equal work” principle. 
I thought the government had understood the meaning of this principle 
when it passed its pay equity legislation, in 1977. Unfortunately, it 
was just wishful thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given all this, you will agree with Canadian women in saying that, 
if the Liberals really want a just society, as they claim to in their 
speech, they forgot to show that they are concerned with economic 
equality for women, otherwise they would have acted differently.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always felt that my environment, my way of being, my 
education, my language, which make up my culture, make me a Quebecker. 
Therefore, you can understand my disarray when the Liberal government 
arrogantly claims there is no Quebec culture. I always thought culture 
was the nourishing element of a people. My people is being insulted 
whenever such remarks are made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse still, the federal government is now holding accountable the 
major Canadian cultural institutions which funded sovereignist Quebec 
artists. We recently learned that Telefilm Canada refused, for political 
reasons, to provide financing for Pierre Falardeau's film on the 
Patriotes. 
This is a tragic decision for all Quebeckers, but the government does 
not care, because the Quebec culture obviously does not exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you know, I am a young person. But do you know that the plight 
of young people is a source of concern, particularly the high rate of 
unemployment and poverty? In 1997, just barely one young person out of 
two has a full or part time job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point, allow me to make a short digression and to offer my 
most sincere condolences to the families and friends of the four 
teenagers who recently committed suicide in my riding. I want to assure 
them that I will support any initiative to prevent young people from 
committing suicide. To all those affected by this ultimate act of 
despair, my thoughts are with you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude on a happier note, I would like to repeat the line 
which the late Doris Lussier, an artist who made Longueuil his home, 
often quoted from the great writer Félix-Antoine Savard “I have much 
more to do than to worry about the future: I must work toward 
it”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to thank the hon. member for her comments.  I understand the 
emotional aspect of her speech, particularly at the end.  I think 
all of us in Canada can identify with these kinds of 
circumstances and we realize they are something we all have in 
common. However, I would like to ask the hon. member a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In her speech, which was very fine, she said the best country 
in the world in which to live and then went on to talk about 
Canada.  I would certainly agree with her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, why does the member and her party, in light of that 
kind of statement which I believe we both find to be true, 
continue to attempt to break up the best country in the world? 
The words of the old proverb are true, united we stand, divided 
we fall. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire:</B> Mr. Speaker, once again, we, in Quebec, 
are misunderstood. I quoted the Prime Minister who said that Canada was 
“the best country in the world in which to live”. We, however, believe 
that Quebec is, not Canada. Sorry.

struck by the compassionate and passionate speech by the member 
for Longueuil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate her comments about women.  I think she would know 
that all of us in this House welcome members who are women. We 
made much in the last Parliament about there being more women 
representatives than in any previous Parliament. I am not sure 
whether that is true of the 36th, but I believe it is.  I believe 
that the hon. member's party has been instrumental in improving 
that ratio. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no difficulty in acknowledging that Quebec has a culture. 
The member said that Quebec was its culture and it is what made a 
people but that somebody did not seem to recognize that. I would 
suggest that many of us recognize that.  I certainly recognize it 
and I applaud it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder whether the member is not being a little hard on 
everyone else in that the premiers in Calgary indicated that the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand—Norfolk—Brant, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am here today speaking on the Speech from the Throne 
that this government gave to the country outlining the 
government's policies and the government's priorities leading 
into the next millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne is a product of work done not only by 
the bureaucrats but also by members of Parliament, backbenchers 
and by members of the Liberal Party who have worked in little 
policy groups across this country bringing forward ideas and 
bringing forward priorities with which they feel the government 
should set its policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All governments that bring forward their priorities and policies 
in speeches from the throne do so within the fiscal framework 
that the country faces at any given time. When we first started 
as a government in 1993 our priorities were set by the fact that 
at that time we faced a $42 billion deficit. Anything we did, any 
ideas we could bring forward always had to be tempered by the 
fact that the government was spending $42 billion more than it 
was taking in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was one of the first priorities that our government in 1993 
went after.  I feel we succeeded.  We succeeded in bringing that 
deficit down to a point where in 1998-99 there will no longer be 
any deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had I promised in 1993 that we would be able to do that, I do 
not think I would have believed it myself, but we have done it. 
Now we can move forward.  We have a dividend and I believe our 
party and our policies over the next five years will be to help 
Canadians, the Canadians who have had to pay the price so that we 
could get that high deficit under control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed it is our responsibility now to move forward and to 
recognize that young Canadians, old Canadians, seniors, children, 
Canadians who have had to pay the price get some of the benefits 
from this dividend.  That is what this Speech from the Throne 
tries to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, unemployment has been one of the problems 
facing not only this government but governments around the world. 
Youth unemployment is certainly far too high. If we look at the 
numbers over the last three years, the economists say that we 
have created over a million jobs in our last mandate.  I see that 
as a priority this time and it is a priority in the Speech from 
the Throne to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take not only my constituents who are listening but 
all Canadians through the Speech from the Throne.  I encourage 
them all to pick up a copy—they can call their member of 
Parliament's office—and read the speech from the throne because 
it is what their government is going to be doing over the next 
five years.  I think it is important that they read it for 
themselves rather than listen to our colleagues across the way 
who somewhat filter it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it surprising that my colleagues on the other side of the 
House would be scared that Canadians would actually pick up the 
Speech from the Throne and read it.  They should be proud of it 
because it sets out an agenda for the next millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, speeches from the throne are always set up by any 
government due to the fiscal situation.  Certainly all Canadians 
recognize that the economy has turned around. The economy is 
starting to grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems in this country, and it has been a problem 
for some time and has been mentioned in this House over the last 
few hours, is the whole question of national unity.  There are 
different approaches to the question of national unity and how 
the government should respond to the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We listen to what our colleague from British Columbia in the 
other House has been saying about this country.  One wonders, 
given her long history with the former Conservative government, 
why she would try to grab headlines at the expense of a nation. I 
find it very shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might as well at the same time remind our colleagues at the 
other end, the NDP, I also find it shameful that somebody would 
stand in this House and try to one up the Conservative Party, try 
to grab the stage on national unity in British Columbia at the 
expense of a country. It is not the way to do it.  It is not the 
way to build a strong country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we set out in the Speech from the Throne the way to do 
it.  We should co-operate.  We should work with the premiers and 
the territorial leaders in bringing together those areas that can 
be worked on.  We have seen the work done in Calgary by the 
premiers and the territorial leaders.  We have seen this 
government go from province to province to province consulting on 
the best way to do it. That is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Boring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller:</B>  I get calls across the way that it may 
be boring.  Well I do not think so.  I do not think a long 
concerted effort to try to save this country is boring.  I do not 
agree with the approach of the last government which was to build 
some national consensus through the media on a constitutional 
decision, roll the dice and that is the way to solve the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this approach that we have taken in the Speech from the 
Throne is a serious approach.  From what we have seen in recent 
polls taken in Quebec and in the co-operation shown across this 
country in areas such as child care and health care, this country 
can work. I do not think we need to make constitutional changes 
to make that work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support and continue to call on all members of this House to 
take this issue seriously and to work with their respective 
premiers or territorial leaders in making sure that the proposals 
put forward are understood and are a reflection of what Canadians 
want in a country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems outlined in the Speech from the Throne, 
which is a serious problem, is the whole question of children and 
children living in poverty.  We certainly need to put more effort 
into that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller:</B>  Yes, we have balanced the budget. The 
hon. member says to cut taxes.  I totally agree that is one of 
the best approaches we should have to this problem. But there are 
serious problems in this country that need to be addressed, that 
cannot be addressed by saying we can solve them just by reducing 
taxes.  There are investments in our future, in our children that 
this government needs to make.  It is important that the Reform 
Party recognizes that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many children living in poverty.  There is a role not 
only for private business but there is a role specifically for 
government to be involved in solving these problems.  That is why 
we have decided in the Speech from the Throne to establish 
centres of excellence, why we have expanded the aboriginal head 
start program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the hon. member across the way mentioned the fact that we 
mentioned aboriginals in the Speech from the Throne eight or ten 
times.  They are an important aspect of this country I remind the 
hon. member.  If his party would recognize that, we might have a 
better way of working together in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present minister of aboriginal affairs has done an exemplary 
job of working together with aboriginal communities in trying to 
solve some of the problems. There are enormous problems on 
reserves in this country and the Reform Party should recognize 
that rather than just trying to bring aboriginal communities and 
aboriginal peoples down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On quality health care, the Speech from the Throne talks about 
the importance of health care in our society. We have indicated 
that now we have brought the economy under control and we are now 
going to have a dividend that a lot of this dividend will be put 
toward health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because my allotted time is ending, I will wrap up, Mr. Speaker. 
I believe all Canadians should take a look at the Speech from the 
Throne.  It is important for all Canadians to call their members 
of Parliament to get a copy to understand where the government is 
going and how we plan to take this country into the next 
millennium. 
<P><A NAME="LINK174"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to be able to ask the hon. member a question or two, or 
three, or four. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing I am really getting tired of is hearing all the warm 
fuzzy talk.  Yes it is true the deficit has come down. That is 
really good.  But the member nor anyone else on that side of the 
House ever mentions for a moment that they have just added over 
$100 billion to the national debt.  Servicing that debt is now 
the hugest chunk of the pie that it takes to operate the business 
of this land.  They brag about those kinds of things. They boast 
and boast, yet they never mention anything about that huge black 
cloud called the national debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about the aboriginal people.  He made some 
comments about what the throne speech said about that.  In 1993 
in my riding the Stony reserve had programs in place that were 
doing good work for a lot of the aboriginal people.  In 1997 
those programs are gone. There is no help at all.  They have just 
disappeared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is not talking about all the things that are 
disappearing.  He is talking about all the warm fuzzy stuff that 
the government is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest to the hon. member that if he is going to send 
out the throne speech to every Canadian throughout the land it 
might be a good idea.  It could be the magic cure for insomnia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the electoral system never 
ceases to amaze me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talks about the deficit.  I can understand the 
hon. member's real concern because that was their policy. Their 
policy was to bring it under control and these spendthrift 
Liberals as they call us could never do it. Well we did it. We 
brought it under control.  We made a commitment in the red book 
to make sure of that and because we now have a dividend we can 
turn some of that toward the national debt.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time I cannot see how the hon. member cannot 
recognize that Canadians helped to pay so that we could get this 
deficit under control.  They should be able to reap some of the 
benefits now that it is under control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller:</B>  If the hon. member would listen he would 
know that I specifically said it was in the red book.  If the 
member would like a copy, I would be glad to send him over one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We plan to take half that dividend and put it toward the debt. 
It makes common sense to do it that way, and not the whole lot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Canadians deserve to get a little back for all their 
hard work in helping us to get the deficit under control.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to the 
speech made by the hon. member opposite, and remember previous speeches 
of his. I know that, in his riding, there are tobacco producers, whose 
interests he tried to defend in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was critic on tobacco in the last Parliament. A promise was made 
just before the election campaign regarding the anti-tobacco legislation 
that did not find its way into the throne speech. We were told that the 
legislation would be amended as soon as possible with regard to 
international car races. The Prime Minister said so, but I have read 
nothing to that effect on the throne speech and, so far, the Minister of 
Health has not said a word about this commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is of serious concern to me, not so much for producers as for 
sport and cultural events. 
A recent study conducted in the Quebec City area shod that every dollar 
invested in the Quebec summer festival, for instance, generated $8 in 
tax revenues and so on for the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear him on that. Will he made representations to 
the Minister of Health to have the legislation changed? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not sure if the hon. 
member was just making a point.  He might want to address that in 
a question during question period to the Minister of Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is right that in my area I represent about 90 percent of the 
tobacco growers in the country.  I always make sure they are 
represented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the Reform Party has never supported tobacco growers.  I 
know it has a hard time recognizing that tobacco growers are 
legitimate formers with a legitimate right to farm.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great pleasure that I speak today in support of the government's 
Speech from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin by saying that it is a pleasure to be back in the 
House on behalf of the people of Cambridge, Kitchener, Ayr and 
North Dumfries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go any further I would like to thank my family, my 
staff, Betty, Stan, Elizabete, Debbie and Stevie in the riding 
office, as well as all my supporters, all the people who were 
involved in the election campaign on June 2, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said on many occasions, in my riding I am the servant 
of the people.  My constituents are my priority and I promise 
never to lose sight of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 2 the people of Canada put their faith in the hands of 
the Liberal government for the second time in four years.  The 
results on election night were a strong indication that Canadians 
have faith in the direction the government was taking them.  They 
were pleased that we had won the war against the deficit, that 
the unemployment rate had dropped by over 2 percent and that 
974,000 jobs were created by September 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians also expressed confidence in the government's 
commitment to the protection of social programs on June 2.  The 
Speech from the Throne reaffirmed the commitment of the Liberal 
government to issues that matter to all Canadians:  jobs, health 
care, safe streets and national unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we enter the 21st century the government will begin to 
reinvest the fiscal dividends that will come from the elimination 
of the deficit.  We will do so in a responsible manner by 
applying one half of any budgetary surplus to the social and 
economic needs of Canadians and the other half to tax reduction 
and the national debt.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not act in the wasteful manner that the opposition 
parties would have everyone believe.  After all, why would we 
plunge the nation back into bankruptcy after we have worked so 
hard to free it from the deficit burden?  It makes absolutely no 
sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the most important initiatives announced in the Speech 
from the Throne were those that focused on the youth of our 
nation.  Our youth are the future of Canada, which is why the 
government is committed to the national child benefit system 
announced this past spring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are centres for excellence to advance our understanding of 
the needs of children, the millennium scholarship endowment fund 
to help students secure a post-secondary education, an extension 
of the internship program to give youth needed work experience, 
enhanced funding for student summer placement, and a Canada-wide 
mentorship program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Social programs have always been a priority of the government. 
That is why in the area of health care the Minister of Health 
reconfirmed in his speech of this morning that the government was 
committed to health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other efforts to protect our social programs the government 
has introduced an amendment to the Canada pension plan and the 
new seniors benefit to ensure the sustainability of Canada's 
pension plan system.  I applaud this initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members may remember that in 1994 I introduced a private 
member's bill that proposed numerous changes to the current 
pension system.  More needs to be done.  I am pleased to see that 
some of my recommendations have been incorporated in amendments 
introduced by the Minister of Finance, in particular the 
establishment of an agency that would operate at arm's length 
from the government to manage the pension fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This initiative will give Canadians greater confidence in their 
pension system.  Based on the research I have conducted in 
preparing my bill, it became apparent that CPP premiums would 
have to be increased if the pension system were to survive.  That 
is one of the reasons the amendments before the House are calling 
for an increase in premiums.  This is being done to ensure that 
our children will receive a pension under the CPP.  I am 
confident we will be successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech also outlined the government's commitment to 
public safety.  This area is a priority for me.  I will continue 
to press the government to adopt stricter measures for the 
deportation of serious criminals who are not citizens of the 
country.  I will do so by reintroducing the immigration 
enforcement improvement act, my private member's bill that died 
at committee when the House was dissolved in the spring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I conclude I will touch on the issue of national unity. 
The government commitment to keeping the country united was quite 
clear in the throne speech.  We must work to strengthen and unite 
the country by joining in the common purpose of keeping Canada 
one of the best places in the world in which to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I travelled recently to Asia and through most of Europe, and I 
can say this is absolutely the best country in the world.  We 
have an excellent standard of living, a beautiful nation, warm 
and compassionate citizens, and a booming economy.  We must do 
all we can to preserve that in the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Just recently ComDev, a company in my Cambridge riding, 
announced that it would be participating in a joint venture with 
an Ottawa company to establish a high tech research and 
development centre in Hull, Quebec.  This new company, 
Spacebridge, will hire approximately 200 employees over the next 
four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a recent CBC interview ComDev CEO, Val O'Donovan, indicated 
that he decided to venture into Hull when many others were 
leaving because “people who have good, exciting jobs are less 
likely to get involved with marching up and down whether it is 
labour, political or whatever kind of cause”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not be afraid to reach out to our Quebec neighbours, and 
that is exactly what ComDev is doing.  There is also another 
company from my riding that opened a plant in Quebec, Arriscraft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently returned from Bosnia-Hercegovina where tensions still 
run deep.  Its economy is in shambles.  The one time beauty of 
the country has been destroyed.  Coming home to Canada I realized 
yet again how truly lucky we are to live in such a wonderful 
nation.

preserve the best country and the best nation in the world.

is always a pleasure to see you again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to congratulate the member on his re-election.  I am 
aware of his commitment to international causes.  I was very aware 
of the congratulations he directed to the company in his riding, 
when it decided to do business in Hull.  It gives me an opportunity 
to enlighten him from a slightly different perspective on his 
understanding of the Quebec problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member aware and would he acknowledge that for at least 
40 years there has been a succession of governments in Quebec, each 
more legitimate than the last, which has given rise to the process 
of constitutional review.  Should the member take the trouble—if 
he ever has the time, the desire or the interest—he could no 
doubt come up with a list of the demands made by the various 
governments on language, fisheries or immigration.  There are some 
thirty of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member be prepared to admit that, since Quebec 
is the only francophone province in this part of North America, for 
his government to consider all provinces equal would be absolutely 
suicidal, deadly and incompatible with the survival of Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he be prepared to rise in his place and say that, 
because Quebeckers are French speakers in North America, his 
government can no longer talk of homogeneity, because such talk 
would essentially put an end to any future for Quebec. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Janko Peric:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his comments and questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am aware there are Quebeckers and Ontarians.  I am aware there 
are anglophones and francophones in the province of Quebec.  I 
know there are francophones in Ontario as well as in New 
Brunswick, and I treat them and respect them as Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think it 
was probably wise to let the Bloc member go first because I was a 
little animated.  Now I am all cooled down and I can give a nice 
calm response to the speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am getting so sick and tired of hearing the Liberals talk 
about their financial success. I thought of an analogy.  I happen 
to be a motorcyclist.  I am driving along and there is a big 
truck stopped in the middle of the lane in front of me.  I am 
going at 100 kilometres and hour and I am still accelerating. 
Instead of going at 100 kilometres an hour as I approach this 
truck, I begin to speed up at a slower rate.  In other words, I 
was going 50, 60, 70, 80 and now, instead of going 90 and 100 as 
I come to the truck, I only go up to 85, and then 90 and 95. That 
is what is happening with our debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These Liberals do not like to talk about the debt.  They only 
talk about the deficit because they are speeding up at a slower 
rate.  It is annoying that they will not come clean with 
Canadians and say what they are really doing. I do not know how 
we can get them to smarten up and tell the truth to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say one more thing and then I will let the member 
respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They keep talking about spending, spending, spending.  I wonder 
if any of them know how much surplus they need.  They are 
bragging about bringing the deficit down from $40 billion to $20 
billion, $17 billion, $15 billion, $10 billion or whatever it is. 
We need a surplus of $51 billion a year for 25 years to pay off 
the debt.  That is how big the surplus has to be and these goons 
are talking about— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Cambridge, a 
brief response, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Janko Peric:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will use an analogy also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difference between the Liberal philosophy and the commitment 
we made during the last election campaign and the Reform and 
other parties is this.  They want to cut, cut, cut so fast that 
they would bleed the country to death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The left side wants to spend, but we do not have it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We made a commitment in the election campaign and we will keep 
that commitment.  It has been approved by Canadians.

sharing my time with the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a great honour and privilege for me to be here speaking to 
members today about the people of Dartmouth, Nova Scotia whom I 
am here to represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I am sure is the case with everyone present, there were 
burning issues which compelled me to run for office and to take 
my place here.  I will try to spell out some of those issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before becoming a member of Parliament I made my living as an 
Atlantic playwright and film writer.  I will become a cultural 
worker again when the time comes for me to leave here.  Until 
that time I will use whatever communication skills I have to 
fight for the interests of the people of Dartmouth as their 
member of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dartmouth is a community of 70,000-plus souls on the Atlantic

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last four years the people of Dartmouth have been beaten 
up by the heavy handed cuts to the civil service in this country. 
Massive increases in unemployment, and they have been massive in 
Atlantic Canada, have left thousands of families affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No less an authority than the former premier of Nova Scotia in 
his speech to the Empire Club last winter said that 16 percent of 
all federal spending cuts had fallen on Nova Scotia, a province 
with about 3 percent of the country's population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marine biologists, scientists, librarians, teachers, health care 
workers, radio and film producers, thousands and thousands of 
important community strengthening jobs have disappeared in the 
interests of balancing the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every home I visited during the federal campaign has somehow 
been hurt by the cuts to the public sector.  Is this progress? 
The workers of Dartmouth, and they are hard workers, have been 
rocked by another grim reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thousands of civilians military workers have been affected by 
the government's policies to shove anything that moves into the 
private sector.  Somehow the private sector is by definition 
more effective and more efficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through a process called ASD, alternate service delivery, every 
function which now exists in the civilian military workforce is 
earmarked for privatization.  Thousands of good paying, important 
community strengthening jobs again are being put on the chopping 
block and then put out to tender to the lowest bidder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Presto, the jobs are reincarnated only with lower wages, no 
security and twice the workload.  Since my election, dozens of 
civilian workers have approached me and asked that I fight for 
their rights for a decent salary, for job security in the face of 
privatization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure whether Canadians are aware that the military of 
this country has made a decision to privatize all its functions. 
I do not know whether they know the same thing is happening in 
the national parks, their hospitals, their health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this what Canadians want?  Have we really thought about these 
things carefully?  I do not believe so.  Everywhere I look in my 
community I see people much poorer and more insecure than they 
were five years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see struggling families dealing with unemployment or waiting 
for the axe to fall.  Is it not time that we started to talk 
about the sad state of work in this country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Speech from the Throne we talked about the surplus which 
now exists in the treasury but we did not hear about how it was 
brought about.  It was brought about by cutting the legs out from 
under the workers who were doing important jobs in their 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was brought about by decimating longstanding meaningful 
community infrastructures which have given us pride and a sense 
of ourselves and where we come from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was at an event in my riding not long ago, the Dartmouth North 
community centre activity day.  It was a beautiful sunny 
afternoon.  There were hundreds of children running around with 
face paint and hotdogs screaming with glee as they knocked 
someone off the chair into the dunk tank.  It was a perfect 
picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of children in North Dartmouth and I think 99 
percent of them were there that day, but the lives of many of the 
Dartmouth children and families are far from perfect.  In fact, 
25 percent of child protection cases in Nova Scotia are in 
Dartmouth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is that?  Why are so many of our young people at risk? 
Instead of trusting wholly in the vision put forward by the 
business section of the <I>Globe and Mail</I> I sometimes seek out 
other sources such as the National Anti-Poverty Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what it says about what is happening in this country. 
From the latest statistics I learned that an estimated 4.941 
million, almost one Canadian in six, were living below the 
poverty line.  About 40 percent of the people being served by 
Canada's food banks are children under the age of 18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than 25 percent of Canada's homeless are children and, 
despite cheerful words to the contrary in the Speech from the 
Throne, it is not getting any better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact of the Canada health and social transfer is just 
starting to take effect like a slow release time bomb.  The poor, 
the disabled, the children, the aged and the ill are all bearing 
the brunt of less money, less commitment to such things as public 
health, public education and the whole concept of community.

crossing guards working for $5.50 an hour because the amalgamated 
city, which was supposed to be a money saver, has no money to pay 
them a decent wage.  Imagine, the crossing guards, the people who 
are entrusted to protect our most precious loved ones, our 
children, are not being paid a living wage.  Is that progress? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are fewer police on the streets, fewer teachers in the 
classrooms and fewer nurses in the hospitals but there are a 
whole lot more people being pensioned off who still want to be 
working and contributing to their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is moribund and shameful to see the latest statistics on arts 
funding and realize that the only area of growth this year was in 
public broadcasting due to an increase in the area of severance 
pay.  Is this progress?  I would say not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are having a crisis of work in this country.  We now have 
thousands of people in my community who are unemployed or 
underemployed and undervalued.  We now have thousands of Nova 
Scotia university graduates carrying debtloads of up to $20,000 
without any hope of getting work or if they do they are cobbling 
together a living on a string of minimum wage jobs.  We have a 
crisis of work in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are desperate young people coming into my office who are 
being hounded by collection agencies to pay off their student 
loans.  One young woman was fired from a good job and a job that 
she loved because she was being harassed by a loan agency that 
did not think she was coming up with the goods fast enough.  Her 
employer let her go because he did not want to have to field 
phone calls from thugs any longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I had the time and the genius of a playwright like Arthur 
Miller I would write a play about this incredible scenario.  The 
theme of it would be right up there with “Death of a Salesman” 
in terms of human tragedy.  Yet we are being told that the good 
times are back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Speech from the Throne we hear that we have a surplus and 
the next big debate for us to concern ourselves with is how to 
spend it.  Should we cut taxes here or there or should we drop a 
little into our programs?  There is no talk whatsoever about the 
horrible human and social deficits which have been created in 
communities like mine by the policies of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps that is not surprising.  In the Speech from the Throne, 
as we all stood in the Senate Chamber listening to the governor 
general present the flowery words of the government, I was struck 
by the different realities within these walls and without. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There in the Senate Chamber there was no sense of need or 
desperation, no sense that so many people out there are stretched 
to the limit.  This was a warm, rich and prosperous place, a 
place of plenty.  At meetings we are supplied with tables filled 
with fruits and croissants, melons, grapes and strawberries. 
Raise your hand in the House of Commons and a page immediately 
brings you a glass of water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My esteemed Metis colleague and seatmate from Saskatchewan said 
something with regard to the incredible discord that we see in 
the House of Commons on a daily basis.  He suggested the whole 
structure of the place is wrong, that maybe we should be moving 
across to the Library of Parliament which is round. Perhaps we 
should all sit in a circle and try to move this group of warring 
factions into some unity.  Perhaps we should use the methods of 
the First Nations people to try to fix the disunity of this 
country and this Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to work with all members of the House of Commons to 
fix the deep and widening gaps in our society.  I make that 
pledge.  I offer this challenge to all of you.  Thank you for the 
opportunity to share my thoughts with you today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the member on her maiden speech.  It was very good. 
Congratulations and welcome to this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of quick things I would like to ask the 
member.  I toured her riding around the Dartmouth area and that 
is one of the prettiest places in Canada.  She is very fortunate 
to be in such a place. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1330"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During my tour there I had conversations with a lot of people. 
I would like to know if the hon. member could disclose to me what 
the people in her riding are saying regarding the merging of the 
GST and the PST.  Could she tell me what they are saying to her 
in regard to crime and the justice system?  I talked to a number 
of people and I know what they told me.  I would like to see how 
our stories match up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the people of Dartmouth and 
of Nova Scotia are very concerned with the blended sales tax 
which is the son of the GST.  We would like to see it removed. We 
think it is a very unfair tax that hits consumers and low income 
earners.  It hits people when they are paying for diapers and 
heating oil, although it does not hit people when they are paying 
for $400 suits. We think it is an unfair tax and we will be 
fighting to have it eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not exactly sure what the member's question is regarding 
the justice system so I am afraid I will have to ask for 
clarification, if the hon. member wants to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member wants to do so, but I 
am not sure the Chair will allow him to.  Questions and comments, 
the hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona. 
<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
too would like to congratulate the member for Dartmouth on her 
inaugural speech in the House of Commons.  She mentioned 
something that is of concern to a lot of people right across the 
country wherever there are Canadian Armed Forces bases.  For 
instance, I know there are people in Shiloh, Manitoba who have 
made similar representations to me about the alternative service 
delivery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure many other members have had similar representations 
about the way in which we see being replicated now by the 
national defence department an ideological drive over the last 10 
or 15 years whereby people who had good paying jobs in the public 
sector are losing those jobs by virtue of privatization, 
contracting out or alternative service delivery, to use fancier 
words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The upshot is that these jobs are not disappearing. The work 
still has to be done.  These people either come back to do the 
work themselves or other people are doing the work for a lot 
less.  We see a trend toward a lower and lower wage economy.  It 
is robbing from many Canadians the ability to have the kind of 
standard of living that they legitimately expect. Could the 
member elaborate on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have been struck by 
exactly what my hon. colleague from Winnipeg has been talking 
about.  People who have been working for 20 or 25 years in the 
civilian military are now being made redundant or are being put 
on affected status.  They are finding that they can no longer 
depend on even their pensions being honoured.  It is causing 
incredible stress for their families.  It is not a situation I 
would ever want to find my family in and yet there are thousands 
of families across the country that are being affected that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is all part of the deficit cutting picture presented by the 
government.  I question its morality and effectiveness. 
<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank 
you for this opportunity to respond to the Speech from the 
Throne.  This is my first speech in the House of Commons.  I am 
honoured to be here to share my views and to speak on behalf of 
the people of Winnipeg Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Winnipeg Centre has a great history and tradition of sending 
social democrats to Ottawa.  The seat I am taking in the House of 
Commons has been held by two of the greatest champions for social 
justice in our nation's history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seventy-six years ago the voters of Winnipeg Centre ignored the 
fact that the Canadian government wanted to send J.S. Woodsworth 
to prison for his role in the Winnipeg general strike.  Instead 
they sent him to Parliament.  Here he became the leader of what 
he called the labour group, and the voters of Winnipeg Centre 
kept re-electing him year after year and that labour group kept 
getting bigger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On his death after 20 years in Parliament he was replaced by 
Stanley Knowles who held this seat until he suffered his stroke 
in 1981.  Cyril Keeper then held this seat until 1988.  This past 
June was cause for national mourning when Stanley Knowles passed 
away. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1335"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>J.S. Woodsworth and Stanley Knowles won the admiration of all 
Canadians for their honesty, their dignity and for their courage. 
I am pleased that the leaders of all political parties paid 
tribute to brother Knowles in the House of Commons this past 
Thursday.  Both the prime minister and the leader of the 
opposition were full of praise.  However, there is a danger to 
this sort of praise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the sort of praise that is used when one wants to bury the 
cause for which these men fought. We must not only remember these 
men for their admirable personal qualities, we must remember the 
ideals that sustained them.  I ask the House to listen to these 
words from J.S. Woodsworth's first speech to the House 75 years 
ago. He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I claim that we have come to a period in the history of our 
country when we decide once and for all which shall prevail, 
profits or human welfare.  I feel confident that there is a group 
of men here, new Members of the House, if you will, who have 
clearly made up their minds that insofar as they decide it, human 
welfare is to be given the precedence. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are new members here today, 76 years later, the men and 
women who make up the NDP caucus who still see this as the key 
question facing us.  It is a question of justice, a question of 
social justice and it means far more than just the social safety 
net. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the past two decades Canadian governments have been tearing 
apart the social programs that men like Woodsworth, Knowles and 
Cyril Keeper fought to put in place.  Our caucus is going to be 
fighting to protect what is left of that tattered social safety 
net. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These words were taken from Stanley Knowles first speech to this 
Chamber.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Social justice involves a system in which those who toil, being 
part of the community, own the productive machinery of the nation 
and therefore receive every day and every month their full and 
just share of the wealth that they produce. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret that last week's Speech from the Throne does not move 
us any closer to that noble vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like J.S. Woodsworth and Stanley Knowles, I believe that the day 
will come when nations will be judged not by their military and 
economic strength, nor by the splendour of their capital cities 
and public buildings, but by the well-being of their people, by 
their level of health, nutrition and education, by their 
opportunities to earn a fair reward for their labour and by the 
protection that is afforded to the growing minds and bodies of 
their children. That must and will be the yardstick by which we 
measure progress and by which we are judged.  Society does not 
move forward unless we all move forward together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne does not address the growing gap in 
this country between the rich and the poor, between the haves and 
the have nots.  It does nothing to address the need for a more 
equitable redistribution of wealth in the country.  Instead, it 
relies on an outdated, neo-conservative approach that the free 
market will provide for all if it is simply left alone.  History 
has shown us otherwise.  History has shown us that capital has no 
conscience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a socialist and as a trade unionist I reject the prevailing 
wisdom that we can no longer afford Canadian social programs.  We 
have endured endless years of cutbacks that have severely 
affected the lives of the many poor and unemployed Canadians who 
live in the inner city of Winnipeg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that our deficit problem is a result of 
overspending on social programs. We spend less on social programs 
than most developed nations. Our debt and deficit problems are 
due to a deliberate economic policy of fighting inflation with 
high interest rates.  The predictable and unfortunate 
consequences of this tight money economic policy have been 
chronic levels of long term unemployment and spiralling 
compounding interest on our national debt.  I for one am tired of 
the flat earth society version of our economic problems that we 
keep hearing from the government and from the official 
opposition. Their analysis is both false and ultimately 
dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Manitoba just went through what has been called the flood of the 
century.  As hard as it was, it could have been very much worse 
if successive governments had not spent millions of dollars on 
the Red River floodway diversion system. They knew that money 
spent on prevention was not money thrown away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to present the government with another flood warning. 
This time it is not the Red River that is rising, it is the 
rising tide of desperation in our inner cities.  It is the rising 
tide of poverty and all the consequences of crime, violence, 
substance abuse, the breakdown of the family.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as the blizzard of the century led to the flood of the 
century, a decade of budget cutting has led to a social crisis 
and what could amount to a permanent underclass in our society. 
Rather than investing in the future, the government has opened 
the floodgates to social disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Common sense dictates that it is time to start investing in 
flood protection to stem the tide of despair that threatens to 
sweep away our inner cities and social justice demands it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take my seat today, the latest in a long line of people who 
have been sent to this House by the people of Winnipeg Centre to 
fight for social justice.  As I take my place I am conscious of 
the honour that is mine.  I wish to renew Stanley Knowles' pledge 
of loyalty to the cause of social justice that J.S. Woodsworth 
served so well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I may never fill their shoes but likewise I promise the people 
of Winnipeg Centre that I will never abandon their cause. 
<P><A NAME="LINK183"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to congratulate the member on his maiden speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While many of us on this side of the House respect the passion 
with which he speaks, I would state that his thinking is really a 
factor of the flat earth society of social democratic thinking 
that we keep hearing over and over again.  It is that business is 
bad and anything that business does is bad and instead of 
thinking of how we can increase the pie we have to think about 
how we can divide up the pie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Businesses in Canada are beginning to increasingly recognize 
that they have multi-stakeholder responsibilities.  Only recently 
Mr. Courtney Pratt, president of Noranda, talked about the need 
for corporations to take an inclusive approach, to invest in 
people, to be conscious about the environment and to take 
responsibilities with respect to the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are seeing this kind of thinking coming back into the social 
responsibilities of business.  If we keep saying that business is 
bad and everyone else is good— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  He did not say that.  Open your ears and 
listen to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  That was the essence of what he said. 
Then we are wrong footed.  We have to increase the size of the 
pie before we can decide how to divide it up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did talk about the 
redistribution of wealth in my speech. I suppose we are arguing 
that there is sufficient wealth in this nation to provide for the 
basics of a family to survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was once fortunate to hear the Rev. Jesse Jackson speak when 
he tried to explain the difference between the social democratic 
view of the world and the other side, the corporate community, 
the neo-conservatives, the neo-liberals.  The analogy he used is 
“If you have five children and only three pork chops the 
solution is not to kill two of the children.  Neither is it a 
solution to divide those three pork chops into five equal pieces. 
Then none of the kids have enough to eat and they all go to bed 
hungry”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The social democratic position would be to challenge the whole 
assumption that there are only three pork chops.  The challenge 
is to ask why, in the richest and most powerful civilization in 
the history of the world, there is not enough wealth to provide 
for the basic needs of a family to survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that is flat earth society and I resent the 
implication.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to the speech 
by my colleague in the New Democratic Party, and I want to ask him a 
question that I have had for a very long time and that I think is 
relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is surely very aware that there is a very strong social 
democratic tradition in Quebec.  It has had very progressive legislation 
for many years, such as the anti-scab legislation, and the new equity 
legislation passed by the Quebec National Assembly, which will apply to 
all private sector enterprises, a first in North America and perhaps in 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have a tradition in terms of the anti-scab legislation I 
was mentioning, as well as a number of other similar examples.  I have 
always wondered why the New Democratic Party has never managed to see 
eye to eye with us on these social values, and, at the same time, why it 
has not been possible to get the social democrats to recognize the 
Quebec people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear what he has to say about this, whether there 
is not a way to get the New Democrats to change their position so that 
they can lead the way in Canada for what could become a good partnership 
between Quebec and Canada, between two sovereign states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They could develop a model.  Right now, the social and 
environmental side of things is often neglected in international trade 
agreements.  There is much to be done in this regard, and perhaps an 
interesting model could be developed. 
If you were to speak for Canadians who want a reasonable approach, who 
do not oppose Quebeckers' wish for full autonomy, that would perhaps be 
a productive route for the next century, both for Quebec and for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear what he thinks about this and about the 
possibility of the New Democratic Party spearheading this original idea, 
that could be of much-needed benefit to Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as a working carpenter and a 
tradesman I have long envied the labour relations climate in the 
province of Quebec, the recognition of workers rights and the 
health and safety legislation.  The hon. member is right that 
many aspects of its labour relations climate are far ahead of the 
rest of the country.  As such, I have often looked at Quebec very 
favourably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the NDP working closely on social democratic 
positions, it is our policy to move forward the rights of workers 
and the rights of the citizens of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a large community of interest between the members I 
have spoken to in the Bloc Quebecois and our own caucus.  We 
would welcome the opportunity to work with members of the Bloc 
Quebecois as we advance social issues. 
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont—Dundas, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
on a point of order.  Normally we would not conduct negotiations 
among the parties on the floor of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am aware that the question would be put at 2.15 this 
afternoon.  I understand four members are still on the roster to 
speak.  There are two Liberals, one of whom is a new member, and 
I believe the Progressive Conservative Party also has two new 
members who would like to make their maiden speeches in the 36th 
Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If each of those four members could have 10 minutes we would 
waive the five minutes for questions and comments for each one of 
them respectively, which would have the net effect of extending 
the business of the House by approximately 10 to 15 minutes.  We 
then would ask the Chair to put the question at 2.30 p.m. rather 
than at 2.15 p.m. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if that is agreeable to the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
seeing as we are negotiating on the floor of the House, I wonder 
whether the government whip would agree to add the name of the 
hon. member for Halifax West who was also anxious to speak but 
was not going to have the opportunity for a 10 minute speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if we could extend the hour accordingly so that he 
might have a chance to make his speech as well.  Then there would 
be agreement. 
<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Perhaps you Speaker could intervene. 
I am not trying to stop the discussion, but I can see that we 
might get into protracted negotiation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps we could start with the next speech, which will go ahead 
in any event and in the 10 minutes during that speech, if a 
resolution can be reached, we will decide whether to have 
questions or comments at the conclusion of the speech after a 
report from one of the whips. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would that be agreeable to the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judi Longfield (Whitby—Ajax, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am sharing my time this afternoon with my colleague, the hon. 
member for Perth—Middlesex.  I begin by congratulating you on 
your appointment to the Chair.  I know you will execute your 
duties fairly and in the best interest of the House.  I assure 
you that you have my confidence as you carry out your duties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with great humility that I rise today to give my first 
speech in the House of Commons.  The people of Whitby—Ajax have 
bestowed upon me an unequalled honour in selecting me to be their 
voice in parliament as Canada moves from this millennium into the 
next.  They have elected me to be part of an honest, responsible 
government and they demand that the future of the nation, the 
greatest place in the world in which to live, is assured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the voters of Whitby—Ajax for the trust they have shown 
in me and assure them that I will do my utmost to dignify their 
choice with tireless work, constant communication and faithful 
representation.  I will not let them down.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Whitby—Ajax is a new riding carved from the eastern end of the 
proud former riding of Ontario.  It is made up of all the town of 
Whitby including the heritage village of Brookland and the 
southern portion of the town of Ajax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ajax is a vibrant community located east of Pickering on the 
north shore of Lake Ontario.  Named for the World War II warship 
<I>HMS Ajax</I>, the town is a living monument to the allied 
efforts during that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Streets are named for crew members.  The town fountain is formed 
from part of the original ship's anchor.  Each town council 
meeting is called to order by the original ship's bell.  Anyone

experience in Ajax and the surrounding area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moving east from Ajax along the shore of Lake Ontario is Whitby, 
Durham's business centre and the heart of the region.  Like Ajax, 
Whitby has a waterfront trail that is the envy of the GTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Geographically Whitby is able to supply a large and affluent 
consumer market within a day's trucking of all of Ontario, 
two-thirds of the Canadian market and half the American market 
readily available.

draws.  A growing dynamic community, I have been proud to make 
Whitby my home for the past 25 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the residents of Whitby—Ajax elected me on June 2, they 
also gave a substantial vote of confidence to the government and 
its unequalled record of sound fiscal management.  They 
acknowledge that there have been many challenges, but they 
appreciate that for the first time in 30 years the Government of 
Canada will not have to face a crushing deficit, a deficit that 
was systematically and rapidly destroying our ability to care for 
those who need help the most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand that deficit reduction is not an end in itself. It 
is a means to an end.  The efforts of the Liberal government have 
given us the ability to address the priorities of compassionate 
and responsible Canadians while living within our means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take a great deal of pride in knowing that it was my party 
that built the framework for this financial turnaround.  I 
recognize that without the support and co-operation of individual 
Canadians we would not have been successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having made these sacrifices, my constituents have told me that 
they want the government to stay the course.  They warn that we 
must be mindful of the still excessive debt.  They ask that we 
make strategic investments in key areas while maintaining prudent 
controls over spending to guarantee continued steady economic 
growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just two weeks ago, the Governor of the Bank of Canada said 
“Canada is in better shape now than it has been for many years 
to face the economic challenges of the future”.  He went on to 
say “Canada's recovery has the potential for a long period of 
sustained growth in output and employment with rising 
productivity and improving living standards”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance in his last budget reminded us that a 
government relieved of its deficit burden is not a government 
relieved of its obligations.  It is a government able to exercise 
its obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech speaks to those obligations.  We have an 
obligation to build a stronger Canada.  To this end, the 
government has committed to taking a very broad and consultative 
approach to promoting and strengthening our national unity.  It 
is committed to forging a strong, progressive partnership for all 
stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see the most common yet most successful types of partnerships 
in our families.  A family is made up of individuals with 
different hopes, different dreams, diverging opinions and 
conflicting ideas, but they remain united.  They face challenges 
together and they help one another in times of need.  The 
individuals grow from sharing the experiences of their brothers 
and sisters and the family grows and becomes stronger as a 
result.  Never is the departure of a family member beneficial to 
the family or to the individual.  Everyone loses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in that context that I appeal to my hon. members across 
the way to stop their campaigns to destroy what has been and 
continues to be the most beautiful and most successful 
partnership in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada may have had its rough spots and tough times, but I am 
willing to give everything I have to addressing the concerns of 
Canadians, whether they live in Quebec or British Columbia, and 
to preserving the country I love.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The next obligation of the government is the investment in our 
youth.  Our children are our most precious resource.  Quite 
literally they are the future of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am truly heartened by the government's announcement that it is 
increasing its contribution to the Canada child tax benefit by 
$850 million a year, with higher payments to families beginning 
July 1, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A country that has decided to invest in its children is a country 
confident of its future.  A country that invests in children 
successfully will have a better future—. We must equip our 
children with the capacities they need to be ready to learn and 
to participate fully in society. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech also speaks to the need to create 
opportunities for youth.  Youth unemployment continues to be a 
serious problem.  All Canadians have a stake in meeting this 
challenge successfully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government continues to move forward on the issue.  With the 
recently announced millennium scholarship fund we have 
demonstrated that the issue is a priority for the government. The 
fund will reward academic excellence and provide thousands of 
scholarships each year.  It is my sincere hope students of 
knowledge based technologies will be the primary benefactors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any successful business operator or economic adviser will say 
that in order to succeed one should identify that which one does 
best and then do it better than anyone else.  We have the 
opportunity to do this with our knowledge based industries. 
Canada can no longer compete in the unskilled manufacturing 
sector with the emerging economies around the world which offer 
low wages, relaxed labour standards and fewer environmental 
controls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canadians we must focus our attention and resources on 
nurturing and developing industries in which we can compete and 
in fact do lead the world.  I am specifically referring to the 
information and communication technology sectors, but the same 
holds true for any high tech areas that require a highly trained 
and highly paid workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our health care system is often considered as one of the key 
identifying characteristics of what it means to be Canadian.  As 
I campaigned this spring one pressing concern was the 
preservation and acceptability of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal Liberal government is firmly committed to a publicly 
administered comprehensive health care system that provides 
universal access to high quality care to Canadians everywhere. 
Access as contemplated by the Canada Health Act is important to 
all Canadians, especially women with children and seniors who are 
the majority users of our health services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased the government's objectives are in the national 
pharmacare program, the maintenance of our HIV-AIDS strategy and 
the commitment to deal with the unique needs of our aboriginal 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spent six years as a municipal councillor prior to my election 
to the House.  I had the opportunity to work in a collaborative 
atmosphere with my council colleagues.  Issues were addressed 
quickly and effectively with meaningful consultation among 
stakeholders.  We faced obstacles together and we succeeded. 
Working together in the spirit of co-operation was the key to 
successfully finding solutions to the various challenges we 
encountered on a daily basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One example of partnership is the federal government's 
infrastructure program.  As a result of the program the 
municipalities in my riding were able to complete infrastructure 
programs that would not have been possible without the assistance 
of federal and provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only last week I attended the official opening of the Garden 
Street grade separation in Whitby.  This separation was required 
not only to ensure the safety of residents but to provide the 
arterial road upgrade needed to attract new industrial and 
commercial investment to the area, investment that will lead to 
the creation of long term meaningful jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Working together in partnership with all levels of government is 
the only effective way to ensure the delivery of services to 
people within a sound economic framework. Partnerships work.  The 
throne speech is about partnerships, partnerships with Canadian 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members of the House to work together to fulfil their

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise on 
this important occasion to relate my thoughts on the Speech from 
the Throne.  However, before I do that I want to thank the people 
of Perth—Middlesex who have given me the great honour to serve 
in this place for another term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to congratulate you, Mr. Speaker, on your 
appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak today about how the Liberal government has 
set forth a bold plan to lead the country into the next 
millennium, a plan that will benefit Canadians and the people of 
Perth—Middlesex.  The Speech from the Throne has demonstrated 
our government's vision and leadership and the people from 
Perth—Middlesex will be pleased about our initiatives in four 
key areas that impact on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government's continued commitment to young Canadians, to 
innovation, to trade and rural development are the cornerstones 
to ensure a strong and prosperous future for the riding of 
Perth—Middlesex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's primary focus since taking office was to 
restore the hope to those who lost it during the early part of 
this decade, especially young Canadians.  Our government will 
continue to give young people the hope for the future through 
programs targeted at youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our plan for an improved student loans program will make it 
easier for young Canadians to gain the skills and knowledge 
essential to succeed.  In 1994 we announced that we would put in 
an additional $2.5 billion over five years into Canadian student 
loans.  More than $1 billion in Canada student loans helped about 
300,000 Canadian students go to college or university this year. 
That level of commitment is continuing. This is welcome news for 
students in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week the prime minister announced the additional $1 billion 
for a millennium scholarship fund to help young Canadians prepare 
to take their place in continuing to shape the greatness of this 
land.  We also increased loan limits by more than 50 percent and 
brought about more flexible repayment rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have brought in new measures to ease access to higher 
education.  We have doubled the education credit and extended the 
tuition credit.  The federal-provincial tax assistance to a 
typical student will rise from $900 a year to $1,200 a year in 
1998.  That is progress for young Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also doubled the annual limit of contributions to the 
RESPs to $4,000 so that young families can put more money aside 
for their children's future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When fully implemented we will increase federal assistance to 
post-secondary education by $275 million a year alone.  This will 
be welcomed by families in my riding.  In the past three months 
we saw gains of 52,000 jobs for young Canadians, but it is not 
enough.  Finding work these days remains a challenge for young 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government introduced Youth Service Canada and the youth 
internship program in 1994 to help, and it will continue with 
these programs.  Earlier this year we announced the new youth 
employment strategy that builds on more than $2 billion in new 
and existing funding for these programs.  These programs provide 
opportunities for youth and people who need to find work and 
build careers in the new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This month we went further by committing $90 million to create a 
public service youth internship program to complement the other 
internship programs in science, trade, First Nations, non-profit 
and private sectors.  We will remain committed to those needed 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have continued funding for summer jobs up to $120 million 
this year which meant an additional 30,000 jobs for students.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The student connections program brings together young people and 
new technologies.  Student connections is employing 2,000 
students from places like Fanshawe College for over three years 
to help small business get connected on the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a similar way, hundreds of young people are getting 
experience in working with the new technologies through 
employment with community access programs and SchoolNet.  These 
two programs are working to connect 5,000 rural communities like 
the ones in Perth—Middlesex plus all of Canada's schools and 
libraries to the Internet by 1998.  Affordable Internet access is 
particularly important to a rural community where improved 
communications links will open up new opportunities for job 
creation, trade and economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 the Liberal government saw the SchoolNet's potential. We 
raised SchoolNet's funding to $13 million a year as part of our 
strategy for building an innovative economy.  The SchoolNet is 
turning out to be an ideal learning tool. Recently scientists and 
engineers from around the world were brought together with 
teachers and students through an on line discussion news group. 
That is the 21st century in action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also raised the funding for SchoolNet's companion 
program. Community access was originally meant to connect 1,000 
rural communities on the Internet.  Our increased funding will 
mean that 5,000 rural and remote communities across Canada can 
benefit from the economic and learning potential of the 
information highway. That is the 21st century infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government's visionary science and technology strategy has 
created partnerships with the private sector to develop and bring 
advanced technology to the market.  Technology partnerships 
Canada has a $250 million investment fund where the federal 
government and the private sector finance leading edge 
technologies that fuel job creation and economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another key science and technology initiative is the Canada 
foundation for innovation. Announced in the 1997 budget with 
funding of over $800 million for the next five years, the 
foundation will invest $180 million a year in labs and equipment 
in Canadian universities and research hospitals.  Canada's young 
scientists need this equipment to do innovative research, the 
source of future job growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investments in science and technology increase Canada's 
productivity and competitiveness which fuel export growth and 
promote job creation at home. The progressive strategy of 
combining youth, government and the private sector is working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Perth—Middlesex we will see this partnership produce three 
transmission towers that will lay the infrastructure for our 
rural communities to gain access to the Internet, and our 
students will be employed to help our farmers get on the net. 
That is the 21st century partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada and Perth—Middlesex rely on trade for their prosperity. 
The value of Canadian exports accounts for nearly 40 percent of 
our gross domestic product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian exports have soared under the Liberal government and in 
1996 the value of Canadian exports exceeded the imports by $34 
billion, a record high. As many as 11,000 jobs in Canada are 
supported by every billion dollars in existing exports.  Between 
5,000 and 8,000 jobs are created by every additional billion 
dollars that Canadians export in goods and services.  That is why 
the prime minister will lead Team Canada on trade missions, 
including one to Latin America in January 1998.  The four 
missions to date have resulted in more than $20 billion for 
Canadian businesses and thousands of new jobs for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hard at work recruiting many of the local businesses in 
Perth—Middlesex to participate because what is good for Canadian 
trade is better for Perth—Middlesex trade because that is the 
21st century commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a similar way, our government has led important initiatives 
in agriculture.  Canadians may not know that 9 percent of our 
country's economic input and 50 percent of all employment is 
involved in that sector, but the people of Perth—Middlesex do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians may not know that the domestic market is $95 billion 
and exports over $20 billion, but the people of Perth—Middlesex 
do. That is why we have not forgotten the farmers. That is why we 
have set forth initiatives like the family farm loan program 
introduced in the fall of 1994.  This program makes it easier for 
retiring farmers to hand the family farm down to the next 
generation without jeopardizing their own security and 
retirement.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have established a $140 million Canadian adaptation and rural 
development strategy to assist farmers and farm organizations by 
funding research to develop farming and crop technology.  The 
agriculture adaptation council has committed $3.96 million for 
108 research components plus a trace cost sector commitment of 
$660,000. For example, the Ontario soya bean growers marketing 
board received $387,000 for 17 projects for the corn producers 
too.  It goes on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our opponents have not offered anything more than cuts to the 
programs for farmers.  It is clear that our government is heading 
into the next century with vision and action, not words of 
derision.  The Leader of the Opposition in his speech often 
quoted one of my political heroes, Wilfrid Laurier, but by doing 
so was able to betray this great statesman by carefully selecting 
words to bolster his weak arguments. The Leader of the Opposition 
is fueling fear and hate through his espousing an extreme Canada 
that is anti-bilingual, anti-multicultural, anti-rural, 
anti-immigrant, disunited, weak and Americanized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind him of the following words spoken by Sir Wilfrid 
Laurier in 1903:  “Canada has been the inspiration of my life. 
I have had before me a pillar of fire by night and a pillar of 
cloud by day, the policy of true Canadianism, of moderation and 
conciliation.  In all the difficulties, all the pains and all the 
vicissitudes of our situation, let us remember that love is 
better than hatred and faith better than doubt.  Let hope in our 
future destinies be the pillar of fire to guide us in our 
future”. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I 
rise in the House today I would like to acknowledge and thank the 
constituents of Fundy—Royal.  It is indeed an honour and a 
privilege to represent them in the House of Commons.  They have 
placed a trust in me and it is one that I do not take lightly.  I 
assure them I will work hard for each and every one of them each 
and every day that I represent them in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Fundy—Royal, like all Canadians across the 
country, have made fiscal sacrifices in the name of deficit 
elimination. When we are in sight of the goal of balancing the 
budget, this government is willing to throw away all the 
sacrifices Canadians have made.  Why? The tax and cut government 
of the Liberal's first term has been replaced by the tax and 
spend government of the second. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian taxpayers have been on the frontlines in the war 
against the deficit.  It has been a tough battle.  I would argue 
they deserve nothing less than a legal guarantee enshrined in law 
against future deficits.  We must make it law that politicians 
balance the budget.  In order to provide taxpayer protection we 
must pass legislation to cut the pay of the prime minister and 
cabinet ministers if they break this deficit band. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the government is very proud of the fact that it is headed 
toward a fiscal surplus.  This is very good news.  The bad news 
is that Canadians will not see a penny of it.  In addition to 
protecting Canadians with balanced budget legislation clear 
priorities must be set for the fiscal dividends paid for by 
Canadians.  These priorities must come in the form of specific 
annual targets to which we can hold the government accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation must contain specific goals for debt reduction 
expressed as a fixed debt to GDP ratio and what portion of fiscal 
dividend will be in cut taxes and what portion is to be 
reinvested in national priorities such as health care and 
education. Clearly all parties could have done better in 
eliminating the deficit and reducing the debt.  With this in mind 
it is imperative that we no longer live in the past, that we move 
forward into the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I outlined, the best way to ensure we never repeat the 
mistakes of the past is to provide Canadians with guarantees, 
guarantees in the forms of balanced budget legislation and 
targets and benchmarks for the fiscal dividend and debt 
reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election the Progressive Conservative Party put 
forward a visionary and sound plan to bring Canada into the next 
century.  This government is not moving forward and is pushing 
Canadians back to a period of tax and spend liberalism. We are 
the only party that wants to give Canadians tax relief now. The 
budget surplus we are approaching has been achieved through 
sacrifices made by all Canadians and we believe Canadians deserve 
to have a little more in their pockets.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the impending zero deficit or balanced budget is indeed 
good news, I would strongly caution the government that its 
struggle by no means is over.  We have on our hands a very 
expensive problem, a $600 billion debt.  It is a problem which 
mortgages the future, especially the future of younger 
generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the past 30 years this country has been fiscally abusing the 
future of our children.  It must come to an end.  I believe it is 
fiscally immoral to continue to ask the younger generation to pay 
for a higher proportion of the debt which they were not 
responsible for accumulating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need benchmarks to ensure debt reduction.  A balanced budget 
is not enough.  That is why a Progressive Conservative government 
would apply one-third of all surpluses after the year 2000 to 
debt reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care and education are top priorities for Canadians yet 
the current government's plans to cut cash transfers for these 
vital programs by 40 percent while barely touching its own 
program spending is unacceptable.  It did not have the courage to 
restructure government. To make matters worse, the Speech from 
the Throne contains no commitment to national health care 
standards, no guarantees and no mechanisms to ensure co-operation 
with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party has put forward a 
co-operative approach to fixing the health care system through a 
Canadian covenant.  Together the federal and provincial 
governments would set priorities and standards for the management 
and delivery of health care services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians must know that they can count on their health care 
system.  Not a two tier system.  Our plan for a partnership with 
the provinces would allow for stable funding and delivery and 
would mean that the federal government could never unilaterally 
cut health care spending again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as our health care system has suffered under this 
government, so has the future of young Canadians.  One of the 
challenges we face as a nation is youth unemployment. There are 
currently 410,000 unemployed young Canadians in the country.  The 
youth unemployment rate in August was 16.7 percent, almost double 
the national rate of 9 percent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prime minister's announcement of only 3,000 internships over 
three years is a perfect example of the government's inability to 
recognize the scope of the problem. We need a more concentrated 
and focused youth strategy, one that will resonate with all 
Canadians.  We believe that this strategy would not require 
dipping into taxpayers' pockets, but rather the funds could come 
from the myriad of training programs already in existence at the 
many levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premiers' decision to present the federal government with a 
proposal to combat youth unemployment was encouraging.  However 
it was disheartening to hear his outright refusal to consider 
their proposals.  I am however relieved to hear that he has 
reconsidered as a result of the premiers' initiative at the 
Calgary conference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bringing a renewed focus to youth unemployment crosses all party 
lines and all levels of government.  No one party has a monopoly 
on ideas.  We must put our collective energies together to 
develop a national vision to solve this crisis. If we set 
national goals and establish clear targets, we can indeed make a 
difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must develop better solutions in assisting students with the 
critical transition from school to work.  Education, information 
age training and skill development are vital.  Internships, 
apprenticeships and co-op programs are components of any 
solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are truly serious about helping our nation's youth move 
beyond this crisis, we must all foster a co-operative approach 
with the private sector.  With private sector involvement, 
education and training programs would be better directed and 
would thus better equip young Canadians with the skill sets that 
employers need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must find ways, perhaps through the tax system, to motivate 
businesses to fulfil this role.  Yet the government is content to 
smother small business, which is the real engine of job creation, 
with excessive tax rates.  This impossible tax burden on small 
businesses has an extremely detrimental effect on job creation. 
High taxes kill jobs. I wish the hon. members across the floor 
could understand this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within Canada our high payroll and corporate taxes form a 
barrier to jobs and growth by taxing businesses for every job 
which they create.  The current government has steadfastly 
refused to take action.  We must eliminate the excessive surplus 
in the EI fund.  Why does this government refuse to reduce job 
killing payroll taxes such as the surplus that we have in the EI 
fund?

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this moment to touch upon the environment. 
It is important given its absence from the national agenda in the 
past years.  Canada has always been regarded as a world leader 
and a driving force on the critical issues that threaten the 
preservation of our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government was left with an excellent environmental legacy 
in 1993.  Yet this government has let the environment disappear 
from the national agenda.  It is not hard to see why when we look 
at the regional interests of the opposition parties that 
environment is no longer a national issue. Environment is a 
national issue, one best addressed by national parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party plans to put environment back 
on the political agenda so that Canada can assume its role as an 
environmental world leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier we can never afford to mortgage the future of 
our country.  As we move forward into the next millennium, 
changes will continue to take place in our economy.  We must be 
prepared to move forward and meet the challenges we face as a 
nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately for Canadians I do not think the government is 
prepared to move forward.  The throne speech was evidence of 
that. I believe the government has missed an opportunity to offer 
Canadians real leadership.  We should not fear the future but we 
should look forward to it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
on behalf of the people of the constituency of South Shore in 
Nova Scotia to speak in reply to the throne speech which opened 
the 36th Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As is customary I wish to congratulate you, Mr. Speaker, on your 
appointment to the Chair.  I would also like to extend 
congratulations to those who assist you in your job. They have an 
important job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to congratulate my colleague on his remarks. I 
listened to his words carefully.  I think everyone in this 
Chamber should also listen to those words and take note of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I offer hearty congratulations to the mover of the throne speech 
and to its seconder.  They did their duty well.  Personally I 
would have been a little embarrassed to have moved such a piece 
of literature.  I suppose that is because I am a Progressive 
Conservative and I am not much for the type of empty rhetoric 
that this particular throne speech represents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is Parliament's responsibility to scrutinize, question, 
explain, criticize and improve.  In other words, Parliament 
talks.  I am here to talk plainly to you, Mr. Speaker, and 
through you to the members present.  I have a few things to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First the people of South Shore deserve better than what this 
government is putting forward as its plan for the future.  I am 
honoured to be their representative.  I am charged with a solemn 
duty.  My riding has been represented by good people in the past. 
I want to learn from their example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my most distinguished predecessors from South Shore came 
to this Parliament in 1957.  I hope to do the legacy of Mr. Lloyd 
Crouse justice.  He represented for many years the people of 
South Shore and I owe him a debt of gratitude. South Shore is a 
beautiful place and he was a very fine caretaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have much to learn about Mr. Crouse's record of persistence 
and fighting for his constituents.  I have not had the 
opportunity to do that yet, but I have started my education by 
studying some of his replies to throne speeches over the years. 
Almost 35 years ago in a reply to the throne speech Mr. Crouse 
talked about trade and its importance.  He is no doubt as 
perplexed as I am with the Liberals' about-face on this matter. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1425"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT54"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT54"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1425
<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT53"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, he talked about our riding's many exporting 
activities.  In the South Shore of Nova Scotia, we export fish, 
Christmas trees, paper as well as other forest products, and 
manufactured goods. However as Canada's closest land access 
departure point to Europe, our potential is sadly underutilized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Education. It is ironic that Mr. Crouse did not put much faith 
in the Liberals' sincerity on this matter of making education 
accessible, affordable and excellent.  It is ironic because of 
the recently announced plan of this government to endow 
excellence.  This after having gutted the federal funding 
transfers to the provinces for education. Does anyone on that 
side of the House remember the ill-conceived Canada health and 
social transfer? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Crouse emphasized in his reply the close economic connection 
the riding has with the New England states.  In this era of free 
trade, Canadians would be foolish to allow their government to 
impose decisions upon them that would lessen the potential 
benefits of trade with the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nova Scotia has a great competitive advantage in this regard and 
would be hurt by this government if it superimposes partisan 
politics on Nova Scotia trade matters.  It would be foolish to 
deny the right to get us our innovations, our products, our 
resources and our gas to the appropriate markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his reply Mr. Crouse talked about the people back home in the 
riding.  He spoke of their independence, their indomitable will, 
their belief in earning their own keep.  South Shore families 
have many farmers, lumbermen and fishers connected with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We of the South Shore make much of our living from primary 
industries.  We work hard and we work long hours.  We do this to 
provide for our families and for our future.  Let no person in 
this House cast aspersions on the work ethic of the people of the 
South Shore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxation.  Mr. Crouse talked about taxation.  He stated “In the 
opinion of my constituents, taxation, especially direct taxation, 
has the effect of choking off business recovery and stifling 
expansion”.  No truer words need to be spoken.  It is a simple 
proposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>EI premiums.  As well, the small business person needs a break 
but by the looks of things we should not expect too much in the 
way of growth and prosperity from this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was completely exasperated by what I read in the debates of 
that other place in this Parliament, the red chamber.  The leader 
of the government in the other place is a fellow Nova Scotian. I 
was intrigued to see his reply to a question about getting the 
government—I do not think I can say this—to rethink their 
insistence on burdening small business owners with unreasonably 
high EI premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader in the other place, a fine but lonely federal Liberal 
Nova Scotian, was informed that according to the estimates of the 
Canadian Chamber of Commerce, the surplus in the EI fund will be 
at $16 billion this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was asked to explain to members why the Minister of Finance 
is continuing to insist on burdening those who create jobs with 
unreasonably high EI premiums. He replied that this Liberal 
government was not reducing the surplus intake because they want 
“to ensure that there will be enough revenue over a business 
cycle to pay the amounts authorized to be charged to the 
employment insurance account”. Pardon me, but does this 
government expect a great influx of EI claimants?  Is this 
government expecting a recession? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Spending.  This government is being careful perhaps.  I am not 
sure many would agree that this is totally out of character for 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance in the last Parliament they allowed the former 
deputy prime minister to go on periodic spending sprees whenever 
she got the desire to be patriotic. As well there was the matter 
of cancelling the EH-101 helicopter contract and paying the 
enormous penalties, not to mention the flagrant disregard for 
human lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was the cancellation of the Pearson airport privatization 
and the cost of putting that political quagmire to bed or at 
least partially tucking it in.  And of course there was the prime 
minister's insistence on looking like a Chevy kind of guy while 
he still kept the Caddy.

<A HREF="#LINKT54"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is definitely a wolf in sheep's clothing when it 
comes to spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Natural resources.  To be entirely honest, I did not think I 
read the throne speech correctly.  I thought I had made a mistake 
because I did not see an iota of real substance about natural 
resources.  I did not see anything that speaks to Canadians 
working hard to harvest, maintain and make a living by their wits 
and by their sweat the bounty of Canada's natural resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard nothing about sustainability.  All I read was, and I 
quote “Canada's rich and diverse natural heritage is also a 
source of national pride and international acclaim.  Canadians 
are both the beneficiary and the stewards of the land that holds 
9 percent of the earth's fresh water, 10 percent of its forests 
and 25 percent of its wetlands”.  I thought it was a postcard. 
I really did.  I could not wrap my head around it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps someone on the government side can pinpoint the 
inconsistency.  The government has not assured Nova Scotia that 
the fishery in Nova Scotia will survive.  What about the fishery 
off my shore?  What about the woodlands and our forests?  What 
did Nova Scotians get from their oil and gas?  What assurance do 
we have that it will be our oil and gas?  Will it be used to 
benefit our economy and our standard of living? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will wrap up.  I would like to finish on Indian affairs.  I am 
the critic for the Progressive Conservative Party on Indian 
affairs and northern development and nature resources.  I will 
bring it down to one quote which I think is very important.  It 
was made by a famous Canadian and certainly a famous Nova 
Scotian. The government and all the members in the House would do 
well to remember the words of the Right Hon. Robert Stanfield, a 
fellow Nova Scotian.  He said this while visiting Calgary 30 
years ago: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leadership within the Indian community has, for the most 
part, been responsible and moderate.  Their methods have 
generally been the peaceful demonstration and the reasoned brief. 
But if we do not respond to the moderate spokesmen of Indian 
Canada, there is a danger they will be displaced by the less 
patient and more militant leaders. 
</UL>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
deeply honoured, as I rise today in humility, to present a few 
remarks on the Address in Reply to the Speech from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I dedicate my remarks to my parents, Katherine Earle and the 
late Maurice Earle, both of whom taught me the importance of a 
belief in God our creator, a belief in oneself and a belief in 
and respect for one's fellow human beings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also pay homage to my wife and children for the immeasurable 
love and support that they have given me over the years and 
particularly during this venture into what for me is a new, 
exciting and challenging world of politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, I extend my heartfelt thanks to the constituents of 
Halifax West who expressed their faith and confidence in me that 
I will work for and represent them in the House of Commons during 
this 36th Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During my election campaign I made it very clear to the voters 
that I would not make any promises that I could not keep and that 
in fact the only promise I would make was that to the best of my 
abilities I would work hard both with and on behalf of my 
constituents to ensure that their voice is heard in Ottawa in 
this great Chamber, the hallmark of our democratic system of 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also campaigned on the personal commitment to bring a new face 
to politics.  As I went from door to door, from community to 
community, from urban areas to rural areas I found, as I am sure 
many other candidates did, an immense degree of apathy and 
cynicism among both young and old alike, so much so that many had 
moved to the point of deciding that they were not going to vote 
at all.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It disturbed me greatly then, as it does now, that so many of 
our citizens have become so discouraged with our politicians and 
our political system that they have chosen not to exercise the 
basic rights for which our forefathers fought and died. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are so many moved to such a state of apathy and cynicism? If 
one wishes to open one's eyes the answer is clear.  We have a 
high degree of unemployment in one of the most developed 
countries in the world.  We have a high cost of post-secondary 
education in a country where wealth abounds.  We have an ever 
increasing number of homeless people that we can see as we walk 
down the streets of Ottawa in a highly industrial and 
technological society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have health care concerns and epidemics developing in a land 
where we have access to the latest scientific and medical 
knowledge.  We have seniors concerned about their future 
socioeconomic well-being, despite their many years of solid 
contributions to our society.  We have immigrant groups 
struggling for fair and equitable treatment under the immigration 
laws of our country.  We have the disabled suffering 
unconscionable bureaucratic delays as they attempt to obtain 
disability pensions under the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have women, minority groups, individuals of differing sexual 
orientation all struggling to be accorded their basic human 
rights.  We have our francophone brothers and sisters fighting an 
uphill battle to have their language, culture and heritage 
recognized as a distinctive element of our Canadian society.  And 
we have the plight of our aboriginal brothers and sisters being 
ignored as they attempt to heal and rebuild their communities 
through self-determination and self-government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on citing the ills of our society as the 
reasons why so many people have become apathetic and cynical. 
However, the real question is where does the politician fit into 
all of this?  The plain truth of the matter is that citizens look 
to their political leaders for a cure to these ills of our 
society.  We look to those whom we have elected to represent and 
govern us to provide a measure of leadership to help us to meet 
the challenges of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the sad reality is, and it came across loudly and clearly to 
me during the election campaign, that many citizens have lost 
faith in their politicians.  Politicians were described to me as 
not really caring, being in it only for themselves or for the 
money, being dishonest or full of empty promises.  Perhaps the 
most hurtful statement of all was “you politicians are all the 
same”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You know and I know that politicians are not all the same. 
There are good and there are bad politicians, the same as there 
are good and bad in all professions, and history will attest to 
this. However, the fact remains that for a good portion of the 
public, the perception is that politicians are all the same: 
dishonest, self-serving and without compassion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel it is time to put a new face on politics.  It is time to 
show that politicians can bring truth, integrity, compassion and 
indeed honour to the profession.  It is time to show that we are 
truly interested in providing jobs for the unemployed, feeding 
the hungry, clothing the naked, sheltering the homeless, caring 
for the sick, educating our youth, embracing our fellow human 
beings and allowing for growth, development and 
self-determination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally believe that a good starting point in putting a new 
face on politics and showing the world that we mean business is 
by maintaining proper decorum and respect not just outside the 
walls of the House of Commons but, more importantly, inside the 
walls of this place where we conduct the nation's business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As politicians we are always under the public scrutiny.  It is 
even more so today with the modern means of communications 
available. We should ever be mindful of the fact that our actions 
in this House are transmitted by television into the homes of the 
nation where the impressionable young minds of children witness 
our respect or our lack of respect for each other as we debate 
the issues of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all well and good to excuse rudeness and lack of common 
courtesy as part of the political game or as part of 
parliamentary tradition, but when young children watching 
parliamentary debates ask their parents why those men and women 
are so angry at each other, why they are being so rude to each 
other, why they are fighting with each other, then I ask if this 
is a tradition that is worth keeping?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this the face we want to put on politics?  Is this the 
example we want to set for our young children? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In July this year I had the honour of attending the First 
Nations convention in Vancouver, where the national chief of the 
Assembly of First Nations was elected.  What struck me as really 
significant was the high degree of respect and decorum that was 
present during that convention.  Unlike non-aboriginal political 
conventions where there is a lot of cheering and booing of 
candidates, at that convention there was a certain solemnity and 
respect shown to all candidates regardless of whom individuals 
may have been personally supporting.  I believe there is a lesson 
to be learned here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One must listen to hear.  What I have often observed in watching 
parliamentary debates is that often individuals are so wrapped up 
in their own view and in shouting down and heckling others that 
one does not hear what is being said. One loses the sense of true 
dialogue and communication, respect and putting a new face on 
politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I stand here today I pledge that I will do my best to put a 
new face on politics.  While you may get the odd desk thump or 
applause from me, I pray that I will never sink to the point of 
being discourteous when others are speaking.  If that should ever 
happen I ask you remind me of this moment so that I may correct 
myself and offer to others the kind of respect that I would 
expect to receive from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the government for the positive statements in the 
throne speech, particularly the initiatives regarding aboriginal 
people.  The government's commitment to develop relationships 
with aboriginal people based on principles of partnership, 
transparency, predictability and accountability is very important 
and very significant. I firmly believe Canada will never solve 
its national unity problem until we have dealt fairly with our 
aboriginal population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge that the commitments made in the throne speech not become 
empty words but that the government give real meaning to phrase 
“moving forward into the 21st century” by tackling in a very 
substantial way the problems which the people of Canada have 
identified as being crucial to them, namely jobs, education, 
health care, fairer taxation, opportunities for youth and so 
forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I extend my congratulations and best wishes to 
all who have been elected to the House.  Although we are of 
different political stripes and although we hold different 
viewpoints on various issues, I believe that the one thing we all 
hold in common is that we deeply believe in the principles for 
which we are fighting.  While our principles may vary somewhat, I 
am optimistic enough to believe that deep down within most of us, 
we have one common desire and that is to build a better society 
for this generation and for the generations to come.  May we live 
up to that expectation, to the expectation of those who elected 
us, so that together we may work to make Canada a truly great 
nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Perhaps before I put the question I 
may be permitted to say a few words of thanks to all the hon.
