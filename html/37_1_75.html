</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Robert Thibault (for the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food)</B> moved that Bill C-25, an act to amend the Farm 
Credit Corporation Act and to make consequential amendments to 
other acts, be read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to begin third reading debate today with regard to Bill C-25, 
which amends the Farm Credit Corporation Act of 1993.  These 
amendments would enable Farm Credit Corporation to continue its 
tradition of anticipating the changing needs of agriculture with 
innovative products and services.  The main focus of the FCC 
remains the same:  to save and work with Canadian farm families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian farmers are well known for their resourcefulness, 
flexibility and determination to succeed in the long term.  They 
need a financial institution that shows the same flexibility and 
commitment to change with their evolving needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 41 years Farm Credit Corporation has been the national 
financial institution that has consistently identified emerging 
needs, specifically, to work with and save Canadian family farms 
and farm families as well as to introduce needed services to 
address the gaps wherever they are in agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These new amendments would allow FCC to continue this tradition. 
The federal government has created these amendments to ensure the 
continued relevancy of the act.  It is very relevant to all of 
these family farms.  After review by the standing committee, the 
amendments remain unchanged.  I will briefly review the major 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first amendment would change the name of Farm Credit 
Corporation to farm credit Canada.  In French it would change 
from Société du crédit agricole to Financement agricole Canada. 
This change reflects the corporation's mandate to serve rural 
Canada as a federal crown.  Adding the word Canada to the 
corporation's name also demonstrates the federal government's 
ongoing commitment to rural Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another key amendment would allow FCC to offer business services 
to producers either directly or through partnerships.  Producers 
would have access to the broad range of business services they 
need to succeed in a competitive environment.  The new 
legislation would enable FCC to offer equity financing to 
producers and farm related businesses.  Many farming and farm 
related operations need access to equity as well as term 
financing.  In fact, rural communities cannot develop local value 
added agricultural industries without venture and equity capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An important amendment to the act would allow FCC to provide 
financial services to farm related businesses that benefit 
agriculture.  Currently the corporation can lend only to 
businesses that are majority farmer owned.  By extending services 
to more farm related businesses, FCC would help rural economies 
grow and would create jobs in rural communities.  These are the 
key amendments directly impacting producers and farm related 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before beginning the amendments process, I asked FCC to consult 
the industry it serves, and I know the minister worked with it 
too.  It is amazing, but the corporation really did its work.  It 
met with more than 100 agricultural and financial industry groups 
last year to get their input.  It met with more than 400 people 
to talk about what the bill would deliver to Canadian farm and 
farm families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general, the agricultural groups consulted were very 
supportive of the proposed changes.  However, some producer 
organizations expressed the concern that FCC should continue to 
concentrate on serving the needs of producers.  As a result, we 
created an amendment specifically to address this concern.  The 
amendment states that the primary producers would continue to be 
the main focus of FCC's activities.  Again, we consulted with 
producer groups in developing this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The corporation has a long tradition of consulting the 
agricultural industry to identify the needs.  When the Canadian 
Federation of Agriculture told FCC that beginning farmers need 
more financial options, FCC listened.  In 1998 it introduced 
agri-start loans to help young farm families build successful 
farming operations.  The lending volume in the past few years 
tells us that agri-start addresses a real and compelling need. 
Since it was first introduced agri-start has generated almost 
1,300 loans at a value of $134 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999, a hog producer near Brandon, Manitoba came to FCC with 
an idea and FCC listened.  Why not offer a lending product that 
allows hog producers flexible payment options so they can make it 
through the price downturns in the industry that exist today?  To 
address this identified need, FCC designed the flexi-hog loan 
last spring.  Since then, lending for this loan has amounted to 
$20 million.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the year 2000, many Quebec producers signed up for a 
provincial subsidy program to help them adapt their waste 
management facilities to meet current environmental standards. 
FCC created the enviro-loan, which enables producers to make the 
upgrades and pay off the loan when they receive the subsidy at 
the end of the project.  The enviro-loan is now available across 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At FCC innovation is not confined to products and services.  FCC 
is at the forefront of a growing movement in agriculture to enter 
partnerships to give customers more comprehensive solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past several years FCC has built a network of 27 partners 
to offer more comprehensive financial packages to producers and 
to farm related businesses.  FCC works with agriculture based 
businesses including input suppliers, livestock brokers and a 
national network of equipment dealers.  FCC partners with public 
sector financial institutions such as the Business Development 
Bank of Canada and the Alberta Financial Services Corporation. 
The corporation also works with private sector institutions such 
as credit unions and is very successful with this across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March FCC announced an innovative partnership with private 
and public sector organizations to help farmers with life cycle 
planning.  AgriSuccess is a joint initiative that offers seminars 
and online information to help producers to address long term 
planning issues.  The initiative increases access to business 
planning services throughout rural Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments we are discussing today would position FCC to 
continue in its role as a catalyst and innovator.  Through FCC, 
producers and farm related businesses would be able to access the 
range of services they require no matter where they live in rural 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>FCC recognizes that the future of farming is linked to the 
growth of the value added sector in agriculture.  This new 
legislation would position FCC to support the future growth of 
this sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship is alive and well 
in agriculture today.  What the industry requires is a financial 
institution that understands the needs of agriculture and acts as 
a partner to support future growth and success.  Certainly, as 
one of the farmers here in this Chamber is saying, part of this 
success is due to the people who work for FCC in the more than 
100 offices across the country.  These people most often have 
farm related backgrounds and are very close to their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>FCC has served that purpose for 41 years.  These amendments 
would help ensure that FCC continues to contribute relevant 
solutions to agriculture for many years to come.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in essence what Bill C-25 would do is 
expand the mandate of the Farm Credit Corporation.  We in the 
Canadian Alliance, and I as a farmer from Manitoba, support the 
FCC.  Certainly it is a vehicle that the federal government has 
used over the years to implement federal government policy where 
the FCC is able to provide a service that is not being provided 
by the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Canadian Alliance are still concerned that this 
expansion will take away from and provide unfair competition to 
lending institutions like the credit unions as well as farmers, 
the primary producers, who now have to compete not only with each 
other in the immediate farming sector, but also with those beyond 
the primary producer level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that when lending institutions, including the Farm 
Credit Corporation, look at who they lend money to they look at 
the cashflow of the borrower.  As it is now with the farm income 
situation in Canada in many sectors and in many commodities, it 
may well turn out that the cashflow is insufficient in farmers' 
primary production, and the money will end up flowing from the 
Farm Credit Corporation to the agribusinesses as opposed to the 
farmers.  Then where will the farmers get credit? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By extending FCC's lending abilities beyond primary production, 
the bill would put FCC into direct competition with private 
lending institutions and would overlap with other government 
institutions such as the Business Development Bank.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has various vehicles that are necessary 
to deliver credit to value added businesses and industrial 
complexes.  However if farmers do not hold primary ownership, the 
Farm Credit Corporation to a large extent will turn into another 
Business Development Bank of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the official opposition attempted to correct the problems 
through amendments to the legislation both at the committee level 
and during report stage.  For example, we brought forward an 
amendment which would have limited lending to businesses not 
directly related to primary production. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment, defeated by the government at committee, would 
have addressed one of our primary concerns; that FCC would shift 
its focus away from primary production to non-farm businesses. 
The amendment would have ensured that the needs of farmers do not 
become secondary to business lending by FCC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>FCC has stated that it will continue to focus on primary 
producers.  That is fine and dandy but it is just an intention. 
We tried to have the legislation reflect and put on parameters 
and outside limits as to where FCC could go with its lending. 
Right now it is virtually unlimited.  The legislation did not 
define who primary producers were.  We tried to define that with 
our amendment but it was defeated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farm Credit Corporation has stated that 80% of its internal goal 
will go to primary producers.  It should therefore not have 
objected to putting the limit into legislation.  Why would it not 
agree to put it in legislation?  It obviously wants to ensure it 
will be totally unhindered if it decides to move away from the 
primary producer and move its primary lending to agribusiness 
beyond the farm gate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also brought forward an amendment that would have limited 
FCC's ability to provide lease financing to primary producers 
only.  The amendment would have helped ensure that the focus of 
FCC remained on primary producers.  It would also have limited 
the government's ability to directly undercut private financial 
institutions in the lucrative lease market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we get into the issue of unfair competition by a government 
agency which has all the advantages because it is insulated to a 
large degree from market forces.  FCC has unrestricted ability to 
undercut private financial institutions.  Under the World Trade 
Organization, this type of unfair activity breaches trade rules 
and there are mechanisms by which it can be rectified. Internally 
in Canada I do not know that there is anything that can control 
government misuse of Farm Credit Corporation's abilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition also brought forward an amendment that 
would have limited FCC's ability to provide equity financing only 
to businesses whose majority owners were primary producers.  The 
amendment would have helped ensure that the primary focus of FCC 
remained on farming operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is disturbing that every attempt to guarantee through law 
that FCC remain focused on farmers has been rejected by the 
corporation and the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some have expressed concern that farmers may pay higher interest 
rates to cover the increased risk associated with equity 
financing.  Our amendment limiting equity financing only to 
businesses owned by farmers would have reduced that risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others in the business world have expressed concern that the 
changes to the Farm Credit Corporation would allow the government 
to use FCC to bail out large, even multinational, agriculture 
businesses.  Here again there is nothing to restrict the FCC from 
taking that kind of action.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have a potential return to the situation of the early 
1990s when the taxpayer of Canada had to put close to $900 
million into the Farm Credit Corporation to get it back on its 
feet. That kind of exposure without limits only serves to 
increase the exposure of the Canadian taxpayer who is already 
heavily overtaxed by the government and always on the hook for 
its misuse and waste of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our amendment would have allowed FCC to help develop farmer 
driven, value added processing but would have limited its ability 
to lend to large agribusinesses such as grain companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Farm Credit Corporation has repeatedly stated that its focus 
will be on small and medium sized businesses that directly help 
improve the financial outlook for farmers.  It therefore should 
have had no objection to our amendment.  However, the defeat of 
our attempts to put this stated goal into law brings into 
question the government's commitment to keeping FCC's lending 
focused on small and medium sized businesses and it gives farmers 
another reason for concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition made another attempt to keep FCC focused 
on farmers by bringing forward an amendment to Bill C-25 which 
would have limited the size of loans FCC could provide to 
businesses not owned by farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, if the FCC is committed to primarily lending to farmers 
why would it object to the amendment?  Why would the government 
object to the amendment if it had no intention of changing the 
focus of the Farm Credit Corporation without coming back to 
parliament? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also brought forward two amendments at report stage that 
would have ensured that the Farm Credit Corporation complemented 
the services already provided by private financial institutions 
and crown corporations.  Credit unions have testified before the 
agriculture committee that the Farm Credit Corporation has 
already undertaken predatory pricing actions.  An example was 
cited from the Niagara region of Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One credit union told the committee how FCC deliberately lowered 
the interest rate to farmers after it learned that the rate 
provided by the credit union was better than the government rate. 
The credit union people came before our committee and their 
testimony is in the committee minutes.  It is factual.  They said 
it.  They were not being dishonest with us.  They were reporting 
the facts as they saw them in the business world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This might have helped one or two farmers at the time, but what 
happens after the government forces credit unions out of 
business?  Maybe in the Niagara region there is not much concern 
about the issue but I can tell hon. members that in many small 
towns in the maritimes and on the prairies it is very tenuous as 
to whether a town can keep a credit union or a big bank because 
the business volume is not there to keep them going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Farm Credit Corporation is expanding and taking predatory 
action that could cause small towns to lose their banks or credit 
unions.  That would be devastating to many towns and communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original wording of Bill C-25 would have formalized the Farm 
Credit Corporation's ability to own and lease land.  The Farm 
Credit Corporation has stated that this is not the intent of the 
amendment.  It claims that the leasing provisions are for 
equipment but this was not made clear in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We brought forward amendments at the committee and report stages 
of the bill that would have corrected the problem.  It is not 
appropriate for the federal government to be an owner of Canadian 
farmland.  Allowing the Farm Credit Corporation to permanently 
hold and lease land could result in Canadian government holdings 
influencing the market value of farmland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allowing FCC to permanently hold and lease land would also have 
provided the corporation an incentive not to pursue every 
possible means to allow farmers experiencing financial difficulty 
to stay on the land.  In short, the bill could provide FCC an 
incentive to prematurely foreclose on Canadian farmland.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Even under the current legislation, the FCC has significant land 
holding ability.  In the year 2000, the FCC owned over 360,000 
acres. Ninety-five per cent of that land was in Saskatchewan, the 
province hardest hit by the farm income crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that the government has agreed to the amendment to 
restrict the amount of time the Farm Credit Corporation can hold 
on to land acquired as a result of foreclosures and other means. 
Under the amendment, such land would be disposed of within five 
years of acquisition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the farming community and everyone else could rely on the 
good intentions of government, we would probably not have 
problems with a lot of the bills but governments over the years 
have often demonstrated changes of attitude to the good 
intentions they have brought out in legislation and promised in 
elections.  That is why legislation must be framed and drafted so 
that it is clear what the government intends to do, in this case 
with the extension of credit primarily in the area of agriculture 
and agribusiness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is strange that the corporation and the government did not 
agree to defining primary producer and setting limits to ensure 
that the focus remains on the primary producer.  That is what we 
are asking for in the bill.  We did not get it, and that is why 
we are opposing the bill.  I guess in the end we must rely on the 
good graces and good conduct of the federal government and hope 
it does not misuse the lending authority of the Farm Credit 
Corporation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Marcel Gagnon (Champlain, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is with 
pleasure that I rise to speak to this bill, which is so 
important for the development of agriculture, I believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings back memories, since I worked all my life in 
agriculture. I know to what extent financing for agriculture was 
lacking in the past. I also know to what extent this financing 
played a major role in the development of our farms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always great respect for family farms and I have always 
worked hard to promote them. When I was involved in Quebec's 
farm union movement, family farming was defined as an operation 
providing work for a single person work unit, that is a man and 
his family, or a woman and her family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, with the development of agricultural technology, we know 
that the definition of family farming is no longer the same. It 
is definitely much broader because in the past a farm that was 
valued at, say, a quarter of a million dollars, was a big farm. 
Now, some farms are valued at $3 million or $4 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, the Farm Credit Corporation Act has played a major role in the 
development of agriculture and it is normal to review it and to 
adjust it as needs evolve. The bill provides that, from now on, 
the Farm Credit Corporation will provide financing to businesses 
that are upstream or downstream from primary agriculture or 
traditional farms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This could involve financing for the processing of products and 
for the commodities used in agriculture. This is where I begin 
to have some concerns.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be acceptable to modernize agriculture, but what is a 
cause for concern is the fact that farms have become so large 
and so specialized that we have in many instances completely 
lost the concept of the family farm.  Increasingly, agriculture 
is becoming highly industrialized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I realize that we cannot stop this trend completely, I 
am not sure that it is necessarily good for the community as a 
whole.  For example, one need only think of the concentrated 
livestock operations and the pollution problems they will cause, 
and in fact already have caused, for the water supply. 
There have been incidents in Ontario and there will be others 
elsewhere.  We have seen how a single farm can contaminate the 
water supply of a whole town. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to financing for these major agri-businesses, 
particularly when one thinks of their effects on the immediate 
vicinity, I feel we should take a few more precautions.  Why I 
am opposed to this bill?  Because, in my opinion, it means 
opening things up too far without taking any basic precautions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the parliamentary committee, the Canadian Alliance and the 
Bloc Quebecois suggested amendments aimed at trying to set some 
conditions for the credit the bill proposes to offer to 
agri-businesses.  We are far from the family farm type of 
operation.  We have been told that the Farm Credit Corporation 
has already lent $20 million to a single company. 
We wanted the Farm Credit Corporation to be limited to $5 
million, with our amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were told, and I can see the minister opposite saying he agrees 
with this to some extent, it was what the government wanted. 
However the problem with this government is that we have to trust its 
intentions.  If the government really intends this, why did it 
not indicate it in the bill?  It could have done so at least for 
a period of time, the time needed to see whether the intent was 
really there and whether the government would act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To my way of thinking, this is an important matter.  If we are 
going to provide financing for megabusinesses, it means that the 
family business is on the point of disappearing.  That would be 
a real shame. 
Perhaps a way should be found to revive it at least, for example 
in specialty farming.  We should make an effort to keep this 
type of business, which ensures a sort of food safety, security 
for Quebecers and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These businesses are therefore on the brink of extinction.  With 
almost unlimited financing, upstream or downstream, clearly the 
end of family type farms is in sight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point I want to raise is that we were told that, 
just about everyone in Quebec approved the improvements to the 
Farm Credit Corporation.  We have learned that the UPA, the labour 
organization representing all of Quebec's farmers, has serious 
concerns along the lines I have just mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means that we were misled, when we were told that the 
government had checked with the UPA.  It would also like 
guidelines and parameters in the bill.  I think that when the 
UPA speaks, it speaks for Quebec's farmers.  It is a highly 
credible organization and regarded as such. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's caisses populaires are also concerned.  The Canadian 
Alliance member mentioned that the FCC is competing with big 
financial corporations.  What we must remember is that, when the 
Farm Credit Corporation makes a loan, it includes a little of 
our money.  There is a bit of us in it, as we say. 
This comes out of our taxes for the purpose of supporting 
farming.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the idea is not to compete with a bank or a caisse 
populaire, for example, because it would not make any sense to 
use our tax dollars for that purpose. We would be competing 
against the private sector, which makes no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When loans of $5, $10, $15 or $20 million are made to a single 
business, who are we competing with?  The private sector.  The 
minister mentioned that the caisses were a bit dubious, but it 
was more than a bit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want the Farm Credit Corporation using public funds to 
compete with the private sector. 
We are told that there is no risk, that that is not what they 
want to do.  If it is not what they intend to do, if there is no 
risk, why not say so in the bill so that everyone will feel 
safer? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with regret that I oppose this bill.  As I said earlier, 
the Farm Credit Corporation is a basic tool for farmers and for 
the development of agriculture, but it should not become a risk. 
It should not go too far and be too quick to rush into helping 
out megafarms.  Time should be taken to study what is being 
produced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the concentrations of livestock and production, time should 
be taken to consider the direction being taken.  The regulation 
also needs to be adjusted and more emphasis placed on research 
into such areas as environmental protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons, I will be voting against the bill at third 
reading.  Since it is never too late to do the right thing, my 
party is calling on the government to include in the bill the 
safeguards we are requesting for everyone's sake.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
rising today to speak to third reading of Bill C-25, an act to 
amend the Farm Credit Corporation Act.  I intend to be brief 
because we dealt with this at report stage yesterday.  I made an 
intervention at that time and I have no intention of repeating 
myself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The major provisions of the bill would allow the Farm Credit 
Corporation, soon to be called farm credit Canada, to lend money 
to farm related businesses not owned by farmers, in other words 
by agribusiness, and extend equity financing to producers and 
farm related businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Federation of Agriculture, as I mentioned 
yesterday, supported the bill in committee.  I failed to mention 
at that time that the Canadian Cattlemen's Association also 
supported the bill.  Both groups indicated that more financing 
and more equity financing was required and, in particular, the 
Canadian Federation of Agriculture was confident that the primary 
producers would remain the primary focus for farm credit Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Credit Union Central of Canada was not opposed to the bill so 
long as it complemented its work in the community.  We 
endeavoured to have an amendment added to the bill to ensure that 
this kind of complementary activity worked.  We were not 
successful but it was not for lack of effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my legislative report, I said that the only farm group 
opposed to the bill was the National Farmers Union. The Canadian 
Bankers Association was also opposed.  It indicated that a 
broader mandate would allow farm credit Canada to compete 
unfairly with private lenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard yesterday, and just now from Bloc Quebecois 
representatives, that the UPA in Quebec, which represents Quebec 
farmers, have said that it has serious reservations about the 
bill.  It is unfortunate that the UPA did not come before the 
Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food when we had the 
debate so that it could have informed the committee of its 
reservations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At least one group from Quebec was present, a group that 
purported to deal with a number of co-operatives in that 
province.  Overall it was supportive of the change in the mandate 
of Farm Credit Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard this morning from both the Canadian Alliance and the 
Bloc Quebecois in committee.  The objections to the bill were 
based on two major issues: first, to what extent a business has 
to be involved in farming to be considered a business related to 
farming and, second, with the changes to the mandate of Farm 
Credit Canada, how much of the corporations lending activities 
may be transferred from the primary producer to agribusiness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 the FCC board of directors set the maximum loan size at 
$20 million.  We were advised that less than 2% of the current 
loans in the portfolio of the corporation exceed $1 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently primary producers are about 94% of the FCC's overall 
clientele.  With the proposed changes FCC president, John Ryan, 
anticipates that this would change to about 80%.  There would be 
a change over the next five years as it grows and moves out into 
this emerging field.  Some 20% of its lending would be to farm 
related enterprises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened with some care to points that were made this morning 
by my colleague on the agriculture committee from the Canadian 
Alliance as well as by the member from the Bloc Quebecois.  The 
Alliance member was concerned that the Farm Credit Corporation 
was intruding into the marketplace.  Whereas I believe in many 
parts of rural Canada there is not an explosion of choice when it 
comes to lending institutions.  It is just the reverse.  There is 
less and less choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in the province of Saskatchewan a number of small 
banks have recently gone out of business. In most cases the local 
credit union has taken over those operations.  It is not that 
there is too much choice among lending institutions.  It is that 
there is not enough choice.  That was recognized by two 
Saskatchewan members who sit in the Canadian Alliance who I noted 
voted against their party's recommendation on the bill yesterday 
at third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt the primary focus will continue to remain on 
primary producers.  There are times when Farm Credit Canada will 
probably have more land than it would want to hold on to, 
depending on the ups and downs and the cyclical nature of the 
agricultural industry.  We saw no evidence that it is interested 
in getting into the landholding business in any serious way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois, which incidentally voted in favour of it at 
second reading but appears to have changed its mind, indicates 
that the gates are being opened too wide.  However there is an 
ongoing revolution in agriculture across the country. We are 
trying to get more value added on the prairies and elsewhere.  In 
order to do that we will have to take some initiative, break some 
new ground, get out there and encourage value added.  Farm Credit 
Canada is one of the tools in the kit that we could use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party supports the changes and will be voting 
in favour of the bill at third reading.

pose a question to my hon. NDP colleague from Palliser. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened very carefully to the speeches of all hon. members. I 
was a full time farmer for about 20 years on a family farm which 
eventually grew, through good management and a lot of hard work 
on the part of my family and myself, to the size of 3,000 acres 
in the Peace River country of British Columbia. In fact, my 
brother still farms the farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having that background, one of the things that concerns me with 
Bill C-25 is what I see as a return to equity financing.  Farms 
across Canada, particularly in western Canada, got into a lot of 
trouble back in the eighties when I was actively farming.  One 
big problem was rather than base financing on cash flow, in other 
words whether the farmer could actually service the debt that he 
or she was carrying, the Farm Credit Corporation at that time and 
banks pushed financing to the farmers based on an inflated value 
for their land.  When land values plummeted, farmers could not 
maintain their loans and the land was eventually repossessed by 
the lending institutions, including the Farm Credit Corporation, 
which ended up owning vast amounts of land in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we return to equity financing, what concerns me is we could 
see a similar situation develop in the future.  The reality is 
the value of the land is of no consequence to a farmer if he 
stays in the business of farming.  It is only what the land can 
produce and the money that can be turned over in order to service 
the farmer's debt on a yearly basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that concern echoed by the NDP and by the member for 
Palliser?  I know he has been the agricultural critic for his 
party for quite some time and has a lot of background in this 
industry.  It certainly concerns me when I hear these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Madam Speaker, yes it does concern me. 
The member has raised a good point.  However I feel that there 
has been a significant change, not only within the Farm Credit 
Corporation but also among lending institutions themselves. 
There has been a dramatic shift since the late 1980s when equity 
financing began, which was the reference point that the member 
gave in his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked with lending institutions in and around my riding. 
A lot more attention is being paid now to files and loans, and 
more managers are managing those files to make sure that people 
are not in a great deal of difficulty.  The 1980s was perhaps 
more laissez-faire, and not as much attention was paid to the 
files of farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though we have a very steep downturn in the agricultural 
economy, when I talk to FCC, the banks and credit unions I have 
been told that the files of farmers who are in serious trouble 
are remaining relatively stable and are being managed more 
carefully than they were at the reference point that the member 
indicated.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened with interest to my colleague's reply to the Alliance 
question and the fact that the Alliance member referred to his 
family farm.  We all think the family farm is something which is 
very important and one of the bases of the farming economy, in 
part because it is the type of farming which produces farmers. 
This is a very special thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side are strong supporters of the Farm Credit 
Corporation, and we look forward to it having strengthened roles 
in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could my colleague explain to me why in the debate on this topic 
yesterday the Alliance tried to take the family farm out of the 
terms of reference of the legislation?  What are his views on 
that?  Does he think, as the Alliance did yesterday, that the 
family farm should be removed from explicit mention in the 
legislation?

opportunity later to ask the Alliance why it did that.  I will 
simply restrict my comments to say that the family is an integral 
part of the fabric of the country and hopefully will continue to 
remain so for a long time.  That is the assurance frankly that we 
were given by Mr. Ryan and other representatives from Farm Credit 
Corporation when it was before the committee to explain why it 
was requesting the change in the mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP certainly has always been a strong proponent of the 
family farm and will continue be so for the foreseeable future.

is being laid out here today by Liberal members and the NDP

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance amendments, as I said in my speech in the 
House a mere 20 minutes ago, were designed to keep the focus of 
Farm Credit Corporation squarely on primary producers and the 
family farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The organic farmers of Canada came here from western Canada, 
from his province of Saskatchewan and said they would value add, 
that they had been value adding, to make their farms prosper 
without subsidies.  They said it was the Liberal government and 
NDP people, especially the NDP parties, that were saying the 
Canadian Wheat Board had to be a monopoly, that they were the 
ones who were saying keep the wheat board and the thumb down on 
farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member stand up right now and free up farmers so they 
can market outside the Canadian Wheat Board?  Would he stand up 
and talk about it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will not talk about 
the Canadian Wheat Board today because we are talking about the 
Farm Credit Corporation.  There are other opportunities to deal 
with the board.  An effective member such as the member for 
Selkirk—Interlake ought to know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to a number of us that two rural members from 
Saskatchewan chose to vote against the Canadian Alliance 
yesterday on this issue.  That speaks for itself.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
a pleasure to rise in the House to speak to third reading of Bill 
C-25 and to represent our PC agricultural critic, the member for 
Brandon—Souris. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked to the member and he wanted to go through a chronology 
of events on how it evolved in Canadian history from 1927 to the 
present date.  I think there were five or six pages, which I will 
leave out of my speech today.  However, a brief chronology is 
certainly in line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The FCC, Farm Credit Corporation, was created on October 5, 
1959, by the Diefenbaker Conservative government when the Farm 
Credit Act was proclaimed into law.  It provided a consistent 
source of lending services that farmers could rely on through all 
the economic cycles, the ups and downs of the economic cycles. At 
the time the corporation was mandated to provide one product at 
one rate.  First, it was mortgages to farmers to a maximum loan 
of $20,000.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the first 34 years the Farm Credit Corporation and the 
Farm Credit Act went through many evolutions to keep step with 
the agriculture industry.  In 1968 farming corporations became 
eligible for farm credit loans and loan limits increased to 
$150,000 in 1975.  The 1982 amendments to the act led to the 
introduction of more loan product and the FCC made its debut on 
capital markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the Farm Credit Act was replaced with the Farm Credit 
Corporation Act, which expanded the mandate of the FCC to better 
respond to the needs of the agriculture sector.  Farm Credit 
Corporation could now offer producers financing to purchase or 
improve farmland and buildings, buy personal property for farming 
purposes and consolidate debts.  It enabled the corporation to 
support value added production by providing financing for 
diversified enterprises on and off the farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This act helped bring the FCC in sync with the changing 
marketplace.  The Farm Credit Corporation's loan portfolio has 
grown since those days from $3.4 billion in 1993 when the act was 
introduced to $6 billion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today this crown corporation services 44,000 customers, has 900 
employees and 100 offices across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to understand that little chronology of events 
because what that tells us is the Farm Credit Corporation, from 
its introduction in 1959 by the Diefenbaker government, 
recognizes the needs and wants of farmers, and the agriculture 
community has responded and changed its situation, its portfolios 
and the services that it offers to accommodate changing times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1984 to 1993 specifically, the Progressive Conservative 
government of the day improved the way the Farm Credit 
Corporation was managed.  We brought in the Farm Credit 
Corporation equity building plan in 1990 to allow farmers to 
extend their leases and buyback land once they were on firmer 
financial ground.  We moved the head office of Farm Credit 
Corporation to Regina, so it could be closer to those who used it 
the most.  We passed a bill to expand the role of the Farm Credit 
Corporation allowing it to make loans to farmers who wanted to 
diversify their operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these things were asked for by the agriculture community, 
and the Conservative government of the day responded to the 
wishes of the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a few major elements of Bill C-25.  One, it would 
change the name to Farm Credit Canada.  The mandate of the FCC 
would be expanded from financial services to farming operations 
and businesses related to farming to also include business 
services and products to such enterprises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farm Credit Corporation would have the authority to provide 
loans to businesses relating to farming in both cases where the 
business was majority owned by farmers and when it was not, quite 
significantly changing the mandate of the Farm Credit 
Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is specific provision in the bill to emphasize the focus 
of the Farm Credit Corporation activities on farming operations 
including family farms.  The FCC would be given authority to 
incorporate, amalgamate and dissolve subsidiaries.  It would also 
provide lease financing for assets used or to be used in a 
farming operation or a business related to farming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Farm Credit Corporation would be given the authority to 
acquire and dispose of equity interests in farming operations or 
in businesses related to farming.  The president of the FCC would 
be designated as its CEO and provision would be made for the 
appointment of an acting president and an acting chairperson when 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not come to the House without some criticisms and 
it is only fair to mention some of those criticisms here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the name change is unnecessary and costly.  It is 
certainly our belief that the minister is looking for a legacy 
for years of failed federal leadership in supporting agriculture 
from this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has the potential to unnecessarily compete directly 
with credit unions and banks.  We are not sure that will happen 
but the potential is there.  The purpose of the FCC is to provide 
lending to farmers specifically, not to equipment dealers, wheat 
pools, for example the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool or any other wheat 
pool.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the bill expands lending powers of the Farm Credit 
Corporation, farmers do not need more debt at the present time. 
While the federal budgets for agriculture have been cut since 
1993 by 65%, the total farm debt in Canada has increased by 44% 
since 1994.  Statistics Canada and Revenue Canada statistics in 
1999 report that the average farm debt in the country is 
$135,000.

their customers.

place that would ensure that Canadian exports are not held

there is a predetermined dispute settlement mechanism in place 
that will be used for issues that cannot be resolved at the 
bargaining table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government partially protects grain exports, and that is 
good, but grain only represents 8% of the value of products 
moving through those ports.  Shippers and manufacturers are 
worried about the loss of markets, reputations and revenues when 
the present collective agreement expires.  They need and deserve 
protection now.

tenacity and spirit.  She loved holidays with her family, 
cooking, reading, sitting by the ocean, British sitcoms, 
gardening, music and talking about her children, her life and her 
politics.  She believed in sharing the simple joys of life with 
everyone she met.

reinvigorate the economy of his province through tax relief and 
through eliminating the barriers to growth and productivity, and 
that is commendable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that there is a productivity and competitive gap between

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

directions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all, we have already introduced and put in place the 
largest tax cuts in Canadian history of $100 billion over five

provincial partners. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

before the last election do not quite match the 25% cut that we 
are hearing about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just in western Canada but in Atlantic Canada also. 
The Canadian Alliance has consistently supported renegotiating 
the equalization formula, especially with a view to doing 
something about the clawback provision that keeps provinces like 
Nova Scotia and Newfoundland from truly moving to economic 
independence and moving away from dependence on federal aid 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister for Nova Scotia has also called for changes.  The 
Minister of Industry when he was premier of Newfoundland and 
Labrador called for changes.  When will the federal government 
announce that it will sit down and meet with our Atlantic 
Canadian partners to look at renegotiating the equalization 
formula in a way that will invigorate Atlantic Canada?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International

welcome a debate on this issue, but one must recognize that if we 
exclude resource revenues then we are being unfair to those 
provinces which do not have them and would be getting 
equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the objective of our equalization program is to provide

are talking about having a discussion with Atlantic Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate, however, lies within their own government because we 
have the Minister of Finance who has one position, we read today, 
on equalization.  I can hear them still debating among themselves 
on this issue.  The Minister of Finance has one position but his 
leadership rival, the Minister of Industry, former premier of 
Newfoundland, has another position.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, a tradition existed in this country before the

tradition and at taxpayers' right to know the government's 
financial priorities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

<I>National Post</I>, a few days ago, and I quote: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“I voted against the tax cut last year for a whole lot of 
reasons”.  Why does he not explain why he voted against the tax 
cut and is going in the opposite direction today? 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this party proudly stands for real tax relief for 
working families, not the kind of token tax relief which 
continues, by the way, to discriminate against single income 
families and which continues to see Canada fall behind the United 
States in terms of productivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week we learned that Canada had lost 30% against the United 
States in terms of personal disposable income.  How can the 
government continue to carry us through two years without a 
federal budget when Canadians have a disposable income 30% lower 
than the United States?  While Canadians are getting poorer the 
government does not act.  Why does it not bring in— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. Secretary of State for 
International Financial Institutions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we brought in 
record tax cuts of $100 billion over five years.  Those tax cuts 
on the personal income tax level were 27% on average, 35% for 
families with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that many of our low income families, 800,000 of 
which have been removed from the tax roles, are better off than 
they would be in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However it is not just about taxes.  It is about a balanced 
approach, tax cuts, paying down the debt and making those 
strategic investments in our future which are critical for all 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the tone used on the anonymous site of the Council for

</I></B></P><P align=left>So, if he wants to lead by example, I will be very pleased. I 
personally have no enemies. However, some of my fellow citizens 
want Quebec out of Canada. It would be nice if separatist

Canadian. No one is attacking Quebec.

the statements made by the Minister for International Trade on

Mr. Speaker, I would point out, if I may, once more here in this

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been asked to follow the Bloc Quebecois position, but it

However, I find the reference to cheese sticks very risky. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have for years stressed the fact that these are breaded 
cheese sticks, because the product contains less than 50%

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's department has taken on a culture of secrecy 
since last year's disastrous billion dollar mess.  It is 
completely disregarding the spirit and letter of the access law 
passed by the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister immediately direct her officials to clean up

this represents a 106% increase over the previous year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the member of parliament opposite is using vastly 
overblown language because the ever increasing number and

animals is a form of violence that cannot be tolerated and that 
must be treated seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing in the bill puts at risk lawful and humane activities 
involving animals for such purposes as agriculture.  It does not

announcing the move; (<I>b</I>) the reasons for the move; (<I>c</I>)

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> (a) Following the end of Mr. Barney 
Danson's term as chair in June 2000, the Canadian War Museum 
advisory committee evolved into two committees, the Canadian War 
Museum committee, a committee of the Canadian Museum of 
Civilization Corporation, CMCC, Board of Trustees, and the 
Canadian War Museum advisory council, a committee established to 
provide advice to the director of the Canadian War Museum. On 
March 11, 2001, at a meeting of the board's Canadian War Museum 
committee, all options for the location of the new museum were 
discussed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian War Museum advisory council's membership was 
confirmed in April 2001 and a meeting of this council was held on 
April 28, during which site options were discussed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) The choice of LeBreton Flats as the location of the new 
Canadian War Museum was made because the LeBreton site, close to 
Parliament Hill and in the heart of the National Capital, will 
make the museum more accessible to the Canadian public and to the 
many tourists that visit the National Capital Region. It is 
anticipated that construction of the Canadian War Museum on 
LeBreton Flats will result in a substantial increase in 
attendance and visibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) The land at Rockcliffe originally identified for 
construction of the Canadian War Museum will be transferred to 
the Canada Lands Company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) (i) Funds generated through the Friends of the Canadian War 
Museum campaign will be directed to exhibitions and programming 
on the LeBreton Flats site. Construction costs for the new museum 
will be funded by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(ii) The raising of private sector funds by volunteer 
organizations for the development of museological exhibitions and 
programming is common practice in federal, provincial, municipal 
and international sectors and is completely consistent with 
federal government policies.

Bill C-24 is meant to remedy an anomaly that resulted from that 
decision.  It left law enforcement officers throughout Canada in 
the unenviable position of confusion about their ability to, on 
occasion, act outside the bounds of the criminal code in an 
effort to infiltrate or to apprehend those engaged in unlawful 
activity.

the title of the bill itself.  It focuses on the neverending 
efforts of our brave men and women in law enforcement who are 
faced with the tremendous task of trying to curtail organized 
crime in Canada.  This problem has been exaggerated and 
exacerbated over the past number of years to the point where many 
people in communities throughout Canada, but particularly in the 
province of Quebec, are feeling threatened in their communities 
and very ill at ease in their homes and in their towns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is meant to address the fallout from the 
Campbell and Shirose decision.  It is meant to provide police a 
level of immunity from prosecution for acting in their capacity 
as law enforcement officers, but allowing them to, on occasion, 
transgress the law.  There are certain limitations that have been 
placed upon that, such as serious crimes involving sexual 
assault, bodily harm and murder.  These are obviously the types 
of offences that would be completely out of bounds when it comes 
to police officers acting in the line of duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are certainly exceptional cases.  The case can be made 
where police officers must demonstrate to potential gang activity 
and those engaged in unlawful gang activity that they are part of 
that gang.  They must demonstrate that they are prepared, given 
certain circumstances, to break the law in order to ingratiate 
themselves or get into the club so they might infiltrate and gain 
information by attaining the trust of those who are involved in 
this nefarious activity in the hope of bringing them to justice. 
The police, by doing this, hope to collect evidence that will 
eventually lead to prosecution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill in its current form grants police officers this special 
designation that allows them to transgress the law. 
That discretion or authority is now vested in the police, albeit 
through superior officers, and in some instances attorneys 
general.  In some instances there is reference to the solicitor 
general being the top minister in the department.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is fine and dandy.  However, in terms of direct 
accountability, knowledge and discretion over who should be 
immune from prosecution and who should receive this special 
designation, it is my submission and earnest suggestion that the 
competent authority be a judicial authority.  Simply put, it 
should be a judge.  Judges understand the law and could make 
learned and competent decisions as to who should be granted these 
very special powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have worked in the justice system and have a great deal of 
respect and admiration for our police.  However we all know that 
there have been instances, sadly, where police officers have gone 
outside their duties and have in some instances undermined public 
confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strenuously suggest that for the new system and the new law to 
take effect, win public confidence and operate in a smooth and 
satisfactory way, judges should be granted the discretion to make 
decisions as to who is granted immunity.  That would be a much 
more practical and professional way to go about it and would be 
very much in keeping with current practice as it pertains to 
wiretaps and to warrants for search and seizure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the designation is made there would be a greater level of 
accountability and review.  As contemplated in the legislation, 
the designation would be for an indeterminate period.  However, 
that is not to say that no supervision or checks and balances 
would be in place or that reports would not be made to those in 
authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again strongly suggest that it would make greater sense and be 
more consistent with our current legal practices to have the 
judiciary make the designations.  Judges in Canada practise 
criminal law daily and are aware of recent developments in the 
law and of the practices that take place in courtrooms across the 
land.  They should have the power vested in them.  That is the 
direction in which we should be going with the legislation.  That 
is the sole purpose behind the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been quite animated discussions along this line at 
committee level.  I would go so far as to say it was one of the 
most productive committee hearings I have had the pleasure to 
take part in during my short tenure here in Ottawa.  There was a 
full and open exchange of ideas.  Members of parliament were 
fully engaged in the debate as to where this very special, 
extraordinary power should rest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The special designation granting this form of immunity would not 
apply only to organized crime.  That may come as a surprise to 
many, given the title of the bill and the intent of the 
legislation as it was presented and sold to the general public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The designated special power would apply to police officers 
deemed immune from prosecution in their efforts to infiltrate 
organized crime.  It would apply to their general practice of law 
enforcement; that is to say, they would be given powers that used 
to exist under common law.  There was, after the fact obviously, 
a judicial examination of those acts and those actions on the 
part of police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the designation is made, subject to the amendment being 
accepted by a judge for a police officer or superior officer, or 
a provincial attorney general in the case of municipal or 
provincial police forces, it would not be for the sole purpose of 
dealing with organized crime.  That must fully be understood by 
the Canadian public.  Police officers would return, subject to 
the legislation passing, to having discretion in the field to act 
in emergency situations.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the legislation is intended to do.  It is intended 
to correct the fallout and the upshot from the supreme court 
decision which threw into disarray the understanding of police 
officers as to what they could do in a given circumstance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes without saying that police often find themselves in 
dangerous situations where they must make split second decisions 
as to their actions.  They must apply force but within reason. 
They must on occasion enter premises.  The practice has always 
been to use reason and a certain discretion as to how much force 
they should apply and how much of a transgression of the law they 
should embark upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, given the size, scope and breadth of Canada and the 
many rural communities that exist, it is virtually impossible for 
police officers on every occasion and in every instance to 
receive prior judicial authorization when contemplating whether 
to enter a premise or take a vehicle or other property that may 
not belong to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of this is aimed at allowing police officers to carry out 
their very important role of protecting the public.  The 
amendment is aimed at putting a balance in place so that checks 
will exist to allow judges the opportunity to intervene and make 
a proper designation and thereby allow police to act 
appropriately.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I rise to speak to Bill C-24, an act to amend the criminal code 
in relation to organized crime and law enforcement and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee has completed its consideration of the 
bill.  I am pleased to say that the committee endorsed the bill 
with only a few amendments.  Bill C-24 has been reported back to 
the House of Commons with those amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to first thank my colleagues on the committee for their 
work with respect to the bill.  In particular, I would point out 
that there were members on the standing committee who had 
participated in the subcommittee on organized crime during the 
last parliament. It was their report and the recommendations 
contained therein that are reflected in the government's 
legislation before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, it is a matter of utmost importance that we 
expand and enhance the tools available to law enforcement 
authorities and the criminal justice system to address the 
serious problem of organized crime.  The committee members 
examining Bill C-24 understood this and recognized the need to 
move forward quickly with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, they recognized that we must ensure that the 
tools provided are the correct tools.  Bill C-24 includes 
provisions of some complexity that would make important additions 
to the law of Canada.  The committee members considered the 
provisions of the bill very carefully and with a clear 
understanding of its objectives.  We can be confident in their 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must also highlight the assistance provided to the committee 
by the numerous witnesses who appeared before it.  These 
witnesses provided substantial, thought provoking testimony and 
often did so on very short notice.  Their efforts in preparing 
and presenting testimony were vital to the committee's 
proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House will recall that Bill C-24, as approved at second 
reading, included proposals that fall under four main categories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it would improve protection from intimidation for persons 
who play a role in the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it would create an accountable process to protect law 
enforcement officers from criminal liability for certain 
otherwise illegal acts committed in the course of an 
investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, it would broaden the powers of law enforcement officers 
to seize and forfeit the proceeds of crime and property used in 
crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, it would create important new offences targeting 
involvement in criminal organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While endorsing all four main elements of the bill, the 
committee made a number of amendments in its report to the House. 
The amendments would not alter the main thrust of the bill but 
rather make improvements upon it.  The amendments would reinforce 
the effectiveness of the bill and refine the application of 
certain law enforcement tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will briefly discuss the principal amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to protection from intimidation, the definition of 
a participant in the criminal justice system has been expanded to 
include members of provincial legislative assemblies and 
municipal councils. 
The definition already included members of the Senate and of this 
House as well as persons playing a role in the administration of 
justice.  Expanding it to include members of legislative 
assemblies and municipal councils would recognize that other 
legislators have been called upon to play a role in the fight 
against organized crime and could be vulnerable as a result.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A further amendment was adopted which would extend the 
intimidation offence to include situations where journalists are 
threatened.  Committee members felt that journalists play a vital 
public role by reporting on organized crime.  Groundbreaking 
investigative journalism has assisted Canadians in understanding 
the nature and extent of organized crime in Canada.  However, as 
we are aware, reporting on organized crime can come at a price. 
That is why the committee decided to amend the new intimidation 
offence to include journalists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government accepted the change to include journalists. 
However, upon further examination, it recognized that 
improvements to the amendment accepted by the committee were 
necessary to achieve the intended objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are therefore presenting an amendment on behalf of the 
government that would add references to journalists to the intent 
provisions in subsection 423.1(1) and the description of 
prohibited conduct in subsection 423.1(2).  The change to those 
provisions would add the specific intent of impeding journalists 
in the fulfilment of their role in reporting on criminal 
organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no definition in the criminal code of what organized 
crime means.  There has never been an agreement, either 
domestically or internationally, as to exactly what such a term 
may comprise.  However a definition of criminal organization was 
added to the criminal code in 1997.  Bill C-24 would refine and 
sharpen that definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new paragraph in the bill, 423.1(1)(c), would thus make it an 
offence to intimidate a journalist: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—in order to impede him or her in the transmission to the public 
of information in relation to a criminal organization. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion proposed by the Bloc Quebecois would address the same 
issue but in far too broad a manner.  The motion from the member 
for Berthier—Montcalm would make it an offence to intimidate a 
journalist with the intent of impeding the performance of his or 
her duties.  That would mean journalists would be covered by this 
serious offence regardless of whether their work involved 
organized crime or any part of the criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government agrees that journalists who report on criminal 
organizations are in danger and should be protected by the new 
offence.  We should not underestimate the implications of such a 
broad amendment.  It is a very serious offence indeed, punishable 
by up to 14 years imprisonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of another provision in Bill C-24, a murder which 
occurs as a result of this offence would be first degree murder. 
The application of the offence to journalists must be limited to 
those whose work puts them in danger from criminal organizations. 
The government's motion would do exactly that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the amendment made by the government's motion, it would 
also be an offence to intimidate a journalist when the intent, 
under paragraph 423.1(1)(a), is: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—to provoke a state of fear in a group of persons or the general 
public in order to impede the administration of justice; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were technical problems in the amendment adopted by the 
committee.  To address these problems, the amendment I have 
presented would add references to journalists to subsection 
423.1(2).  Such references are necessary to ensure that the 
definition of prohibited conduct includes conduct aimed both at 
journalists and at persons known to them.  This would ensure that 
acts which seek to intimidate journalists through their family 
and friends are caught by the offence, as I am sure the committee 
would have wished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are proposing in the same motion limited amendments that 
would:  first, add the word “criminal” in regard to the 
administration of justice in paragraph 423.1(1)(a) in order to be 
consistent with the definition of justice system participant in 
clause 1 of the bill; and second, add the words “provoke a state 
of fear” in the opening words of subsection 423.1(1) so that it 
describes the intent involved in all the paragraphs of that 
subsection rather than just paragraph (a) as is now the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would better express the bill's original intent to penalize 
conduct which seeks to intimidate by causing fear.  It would also 
address concerns expressed by witnesses before the committee that 
the new offence might be interpreted to apply to peaceful 
lobbying or protest activity aimed at legislators.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In connection with the amendments to section 423.1, we are also 
presenting two other consequential amendments.  These involve the 
reference to the new offence in section 423.1 in the list of 
offences under section 183 of the criminal code, both in the main 
part of the bill and in a co-ordinating clause.  The change 
simply reflects the addition of the application to journalists in 
the description of the offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I return now to the other amendments that were endorsed by the 
committee and that have been reported back to this House.  With 
respect to the limited protection for law enforcement officers 
and agents who work under their direction and control, an 
amendment was added to provide specific examples of the 
conditions that ministers may impose on the designations that 
bring officers under these provisions.  The protection from 
criminal liability is subject to important controls and 
limitations, and this amendment helps to clarify the nature of 
one of these controls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another amendment to the provisions on protection from criminal 
liability clarifies the requirements for the application of the 
protection to agents acting under the direction of law 
enforcement officers.  This refinement adds a further safeguard 
to ensure the proper operation of these provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A further amendment provides for a parliamentary review of these 
provisions within three years of their coming into force.  This 
review will examine the sections dealing with protection from 
criminal liability.  Parliament will then have an opportunity to 
consider whether improvements are needed.  The supreme court has 
indicated that parliament has a responsibility for providing for 
protection from criminal liability for law enforcement officers. 
The three year review provision emphasizes this parliamentary 
authority and responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the provisions defining a criminal organization, 
an amendment was made to clarify that a criminal group will fall 
under this definition whether its members are situated inside or 
outside Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment recognizes the international nature of organized 
crime and ensures that the new offences of participating in, 
benefiting and directing a criminal organization will have the 
corresponding adequate scope.  The criminal activity affected 
will still have to have a substantial connection with Canada and 
the amendment thus does not involve any extraterritorial 
application of Canadian law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee also made a number of other technical amendments 
to improve Bill C-24. These are included in the amended text of 
the bill that has been reported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to thank the committee for its work on 
all these amendments, substantive and technical, and for its work 
in examining the bill as a whole.  The result is an effective and 
balanced bill that would substantively improve our ability to 
fight organized crime in this country as well as improve law 
enforcement generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look forward to the debate at third reading. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Vic Toews (Provencher, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I would like to speak to the amendments to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I would like to thank my colleague from the Bloc, the 
member for Berthier—Montcalm, for originally bringing forth the 
amendments to extend additional protection from intimidation to 
journalists.  I think journalists play a very special and 
important role in our society.  They are fundamental to free 
speech and in covering organized crime.  The case of the 
journalist in Quebec being shot in the way he was last year 
demonstrated that fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a number of recent cases demonstrate, journalists who serve 
the public interest by reporting on organized crime are very much 
in need of and deserve enhanced protection under our criminal 
law.  Again I thank my colleague from the Bloc for bringing that 
forward originally in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought it was interesting, too, that in the course of our 
committee certain government members appeared to only vote in 
favour of this amendment brought forward by the Bloc once it was 
implied that their names would get out to the media if they did 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is somewhat amusing, but in fact is kind of sad at the same 
time.  When a member has to be persuaded—I do not like to use 
the word coerced—to extending protection to journalists by the 
threat of his or her name being published in the media, it is 
quite an interesting state of affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it demonstrates the power of the media and indeed 
reveals the exact importance of the role of the media in 
uncovering matters of interest.  Indeed, it is crucial to our 
democratic process. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1250"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even that small situation confirmed to me the importance of this 
amendment because of the significant role that journalists play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will, however, be supporting the government amendments as 
opposed to the Bloc amendments.  The Bloc raised the matter, 
however, a government member denied unanimous consent for the 
matter to be placed in the correct positioning and therefore the 
amendment proceeded as it did in committee.  However, in 
listening to the government's explanation, I think the 
appropriate amendment would be as proposed by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In respect of the amendment brought forward by the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, I cannot support it.  I would 
indicate that under Bill C-24 only the Solicitor General of 
Canada for the RCMP or provincial ministers responsible for the 
police are given the authority to designate police officers who 
may commit offences during the course of a legitimate criminal 
investigation.  The amendment says that public officials will 
have the authority to designate these police officers only after 
acquiring authorization from a competent judicial authority, in 
other words, a judge.  I cannot support that amendment.  I do not 
believe that this is a process that constitutionally or otherwise 
requires the supervision of a judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard from police evidence and other evidence that such 
a requirement which this amendment would impose would 
unnecessarily encumber police investigations without a real 
enhancement of the quality of justice or the quality of the 
police investigation.  I think it is unnecessary to have judicial 
intervention at this time.  There are unique circumstances that 
apply to undercover and other police investigations in this 
context, which I would think would grind to a halt if this 
process were adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to remember that police officers regularly exercise this 
authority without legislative sanction.  It was as a requirement 
or as a consequence of the Supreme Court of Canada that this 
amendment became necessary.  It is a good amendment because it 
does set out clearly the legislated extent to which police 
officers may embark upon this course of action.  I think it takes 
a lot of the guesswork and discretion out of it.  It becomes a 
transparent process.  Canadians and those enforcing the law will 
understand exactly what is required.  I think most police forces 
would agree that the Liberal bill as it stands on that issue is a 
reasonable compromise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the amendment brought forward by the member does not 
enhance the ability of police to get the job done in an 
appropriate and timely fashion.  The bill already outlines quite 
clearly what police officers may or may not do and in which 
circumstances they may do it.  It takes away that hidden 
discretion, the discretion that is unencumbered by legislation. I 
think this is a very good step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general I support the amendments being brought forward by the 
government.  I again commend the member for the Bloc for bringing 
forward the matters related to the journalists.  I also want to 
point out that there is a review process which was proposed in 
committee, that is, that this legislation would be reviewed 
within three years.  That is important when we are adopting this 
kind of legislation.

by the government and the Bloc, is appropriate. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I too 
would like to pay tribute to my Bloc Quebecois colleague, the 
hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm, not only for his work in 
committee, as the Canadian Alliance member pointed out, but also 
for his continuous work, since 1994, in the fight against 
organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1994, the Bloc Quebecois has always put forward 
initiatives to improve the criminal code, so that criminals, 
particularly those who belong to biker gangs and to organized 
crime in general, will be given meaningful sentences that 
reflect their crimes and the terrorism they institutionalized in 
today's society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in 1997, when it decided to amend the criminal code, the 
government used several of the Bloc Quebecois' ideas. We were 
very pleased with that but, at the time, we were also aware that 
the criminal code had to be strengthened even further. At the 
time, we had pointed to certain flaws, about 80% of which are 
being corrected in the new bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still wonder, and the hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm, 
often about this: since we were able to identify the problems 
with the criminal code, the flaws relating to the tools 
available to police officers to combat organized crime, why did 
the government take so long to recognize the need to strengthen 
the criminal code and to have specific provisions to lead a 
continuous, constant and determined fight against organized 
crime? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that we would have avoided all that has 
happened, but some of the 151 murders committed between 1994 and 
now in the biker gang war, particularly to control the drug 
market, might have been avoided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the 170 attempted murders, including the recent one 
against reporter Michel Auger, might also have been avoided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a tightened criminal code, as we have before us today, we 
might have avoided some of these attempted murders, 13 
disappearances, 334 violent crimes, 129 cases of arson, 82 
bombings and the murder of one young boy in 1995. Young Daniel 
Desrochers lost his life as a result of a bombing in the 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve area. The bomb was placed by the Hell's 
Angels, who were involved with the Rock Machine, now known as 
the Bandidos, in a war to control the drug traffic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that, if we open the door to these criminal 
gangs, if we provide them with some kind of haven where they can 
grow and prosper, they can only become more arrogant and more 
powerful. With power comes their willingness to commit more 
crime to show their supremacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what happened when two prison guards were killed 
in 1997, if I am not mistaken. 
We might have avoided these tragedies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members might remember that four years ago I talked about 
institutionalized terrorism in Quebec and southeastern Ontario, 
in the countryside. Members of criminal gangs grow marijuana in 
those fields every year. To ensure the growth of their business 
operations, they terrorize farm families. Maybe this is 
something else we could have avoided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased with what I see in this bill. I even support the 
amendment put forward by my Conservative colleague allowing a 
judge to designate a member of a police force who can be 
protected from criminal liability for certain otherwise illegal 
acts committed in the course of an investigation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also a way to protect the solicitor general. We should not 
forget that, when politics interfere with the judiciary, it 
always turns into a disaster, as we have seen in the past. It 
has always put us, willy-nilly, in terrible situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is especially true since the practice of having illegal acts 
committed by police officers applies not only to investigations 
into organized crime. We often asked this question to the 
solicitor general and the justice minister. They have said that 
this practice is not restricted to organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This thing could go quite far. 
The solicitor general could have to make a political decision 
when what we need is a judicial decision. This could lead to 
abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen a lot of abuse in the past. We all know what 
happened in the 1970s. We would not like to see this happen 
again. Two royal commissions investigated police actions during 
the October 1970 events. The powers of were have been 
restricted, and at the same time, the roles of the RCMP and of 
the Canadian Security Intelligence Service were divided so that 
these roles would be clearly defined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did we forget about all these discussions? Did we forget what 
happened a few decades ago, so that we are now about to make 
the same mistakes again today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the introduction of the judicial order, therefore of 
a judge, in the fact that the police are given authority or 
tools to work with, including the ability to commit offences not 
murder or rape, as part of their undercover operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met a lot of policemen during the three months my family had 
24 hour a day protection seven days a week because of death 
threats.  I had reported gangsters who had taken over farmland 
in my riding, elsewhere in Quebec and in southeastern Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore had a taste of that sort of terrorism.  I also 
learned a lot by talking to the police who often came from drug 
raids and who had had to go undercover. 
They are often required to commit offences, because, if they do 
not, they risk their skins.  They risk being killed on the spot. 
So, they need these tools in order to become more effective and 
to protect themselves as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have to be careful.  The job of policemen is not a cushy 
one.  They need these tools.  We support the fact that the 
government is giving them the tools to enable them to 
effectively combat organized crime and do not get discouraged. 
I also met police from the RCMP and the Sûreté du Québec, who, 
in the absence of legal instruments, were back at square one 
after months and months of investigations costing hundreds of 
millions of dollars and unable to lay charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very anxious to see, following the recent operation 
springtime 2001, with its 160 arrests, including the heads of 
biker gangs, how far we will be able to proceed with charges 
under the provisions of the Criminal Code as it now stands, and 
this will need to be discussed with the minister at some point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The weaknesses that have been pointed out since 1997 are still 
there, until the new legislation is enacted.  If they remain, 
this means that charges are not being laid and evidence is not 
being gathered against these 160 bandits who have committed 
criminal offences ranging from drug trafficking to corruption, 
intimidation of judges, politicians, journalists, and even 
murder or attempted murder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the tools available to us at the present time, which have been 
criticized since 1997 by the Bloc Quebecois and by my colleague for 
Berthier—Montcalm, stand in the way of laying any meaningful 
charges against this band of criminals, that will be the fault 
of the Minister of Justice, no more and no less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She had no justification for waiting this long before 
introducing her bill.  She had all the tools, all the analyses, 
at her disposal.  We had provided them.  She had everything she 
needed to make a decision to strengthen the criminal code well 
before today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the committee hearings, the hon. member for 
Berthier—Montcalm told me that, as regards the amendment to 
include journalists in the clause about people to be protected 
against intimidation through sentences of up to 14 years, we had 
to intimidate the Liberals to have them agree to include 
journalists in the list of people to be protected against 
intimidation. This is incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know about Mr. Auger's experience. We know that, like 
politicians, as I learned from personal experience, journalists do a 
risky and dangerous job. They examine issues. They target 
criminals. They report on their activities. It is quite 
normal to include them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However we had to threaten the Liberals with releasing the names of 
those who were opposed to including journalists in the list of 
the people to be protected from intimidation, before they would 
finally agree to this amendment. They got scared that their 
names would be released and that journalists would say “Listen, 
this does not make sense”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, we will support the amendment proposed by 
the Progressive Conservative member. We will also support the 
other group of amendments, which consists in including 
journalists in the new clause on intimidation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin (Windsor—St. Clair, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to speak to the amendments proposed by my 
friend from Pictou—Antigonish from the Progressive Conservative 
Party.  I would like to indicate on behalf of our party that we 
support these amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go to the specific amendments, I would like to 
acknowledge the work that the committee did and the fact that the 
Liberal government saw its way through to add that provision to 
protect journalists.  Work that has been done by journalists 
specifically on organized crime has been exemplary. They do that 
profession proud.  The fact that the government has recognized 
their work and their need for that protection by the expansion of 
the provisions to prevent intimidation is an excellent one.  I 
congratulate them on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The two amendments proposed relate to the necessity of having a 
judicial review of police officers who commit crimes in the 
pursuit of the provisions of these amendments to the code.  I 
believe it is really important to take a bit of an historical 
perspective on the necessity of having this type of protection 
built into the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my friend from the Bloc indicated, no one here has any 
misgivings about what we are doing with the rest of the bill.  We 
recognize the seriousness of organized crime in the country, 
particularly in Ontario and even more so in Quebec over the last 
number of years.  It has become a prominent issue.  No one is 
downplaying the significance of the need for this legislation. 
No one is downplaying the significance of the need to protect 
police officers in their duties, especially in this area.  They 
are at constant risk for their own safety and at times their 
lives.  So there is no issue with regard to that among anyone in 
the House or in the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However that does not say that we ignore the reality of the 
structure that we have built in our legal system over the 
centuries.  There has been any number of times in the past where 
we have gone to excess in dealing with a criminal problem.  I am 
afraid this could be one of those occasions, if we pass this 
these amendments to the code without the provision of a judicial 
review for police officers who commit crimes or breach other 
parts of the criminal code because of the necessity to do their 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had a long history of balancing our responsibility to 
provide protection in a safe environment for our citizens with 
the recognition that there are civil liberties in the country. 
We have to recognize those.  We always hear that we are just 
worried about the criminals.  Police officers are human.  They 
can make errors.  The whole idea behind our system is that we 
provide someone else, in the form of judges, to protect us from 
those errors. 
Again, I am not going to suggest judges are perfect.  I have 
appeared before too many of them in my career to suggest that. 
However it is an additional measure, and a very important one, to 
provide all citizens with that type of protection.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of questions from I think at least three of the four 
opposition parties, we have heard the Solicitor General of Canada 
and the Minister of Justice repeatedly say the that it is just too 
cumbersome, or synonyms of that word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is just plain nonsense.  We have used this system in 
providing warrants, sometimes very complicated warrants, and our 
judges have been able to deal with that.  There is no reason, 
given the skills they bring to their positions, that they cannot 
do the same thing in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know a number of groups appeared before the committee when the 
bill was being reviewed.  The Civil Liberties Association and a 
number of the bar associations made representations.  All pushed 
strongly for this extra protection.  Quite frankly, all indicated 
their understanding of the need for the legislation, but wanted 
the safety net built in to provide all citizens with this 
protection.  It is our responsibility.  We should fulfil our 
responsibility by accepting the amendments of Progressive 
Conservative Party and by supporting them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I will speak very briefly to this since I did not 
touch upon it in my earlier remarks on my own amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would again reiterate that it is not the position of the 
Progressive Conservative Party, and I think I am safe in saying 
it is not the position of any party in the House, to impede or in 
any way hold back the police in their very important duty to 
protect citizens and the country from this growing threat of 
organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment was proposed by the Bloc.  I again wish to 
congratulate the members of the Bloc who contributed a great deal 
to this particular piece of legislation, who brought forward 
amendments, who proposed supply day motions that I would suggest 
very much pushed the government toward the point we see today 
where legislation has been brought forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated, members, particularly the member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, know first hand the means by which 
organized crime can invade a person's life and very much affect 
day to day existence through threats to family.  Often it is very 
much implied.  It is very subtle.  It is very nefarious in its 
means.  This is something that can be most disturbing.  It is a 
cancer, a plague on our justice system, when it occurs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It stands to reason that we would extend this practice of 
protection beyond our own means, beyond the members of parliament 
and the Senate, and extend it to provincial and municipal 
politicians and to journalists as well, because we have seen the 
extremely important role that journalists play in public 
awareness, in the reporting of the activities of organized crime 
and, I would suggest as well, in the disclosure and the pulling 
back of the cloak of secrecy that is very often part of the 
threat that organized crime can pose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many instances revealing who these individuals are strips 
them bare of their ability to intimidate.  If the bright light of 
day shines upon them, they are no longer able to work from the 
shadows and cause fear in the hearts of those who are seeking 
justice.  Whether it be through disclosing information, whether 
it be a journalist, jury members or participants in the justice 
system in any way, intimidation can very clearly take the 
underpinnings and shake the cornerstone of the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To that end is the government adoption of this amendment that 
originated from the Bloc.  I must congratulate the member for 
Berthier—Montcalm as well.  I know that he has worked extremely 
hard and has made significant contributions to the bill as well. 
The government in its wisdom has seen its way clear to including 
journalists in this envelope, in this protection from 
intimidation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Expanding this so that journalists are included means that they 
too can go about their tasks and their reporting without the fear 
of reprisal.  If it does happen, the justice system is now 
mandated to intervene.  We do not have to look any further than a 
very recent example involving Michel Auger in Montreal.  What is 
quite timely is that we are informed that members of the Sûreté 
du Québec and the Montreal city police, I believe, have 
apprehended individuals connected with his shooting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was a very courageous man indeed, Madam Speaker, as you would 
know.  Not only has he recovered, he continues to write on the 
subject of organized crime.  He continues to provide the public 
in the province of Quebec with information about this story of 
organized crime and with other stories he has taken on in his 
passion as a journalist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Progressive Conservative Party are supporting this 
amendment as well.  We encourage other members to do likewise. We 
look forward to seeing the legislation come into being upon 
passing through the other place.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
thank the Progressive Conservative member for his kind words 
with respect to the Bloc Quebecois members, particularly the 
member for Berthier—Montcalm, who led the battle for this 
amendment to the criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to vote in favour of this amendment: first, because 
we feel it is very fair and, second, because it was our 
colleague, the member for Berthier—Montcalm, who suggested it to 
the Standing Committee on Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, it is a bit much that the Liberal 
members must always be practically intimidated before they will 
come around to a point of view or an analysis which has always 
been right.  The Bloc Quebecois has always put its finger on the 
problems and the shortcomings of the criminal code, and the 
tools the police are given to conduct their investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last meeting of the Standing Committee on Justice, 
the Liberal members were completely opposed to journalists being 
protected.  Even in the case of Mr. Auger, it was something they 
would not do.  It took the Bloc Quebecois moving a motion 
calling for a recorded division and threatening to release the 
names of those Liberal members present to convince them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bit much to have to operate in this way to bring about 
improvements. 
This government does not readily understand the importance of 
what it includes in a bill, in terms of actions and wording. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment deals with intimidation. This is a very important 
issue; with money, it is the key element in the war being 
wagered by all criminal groups. If, with the wealth derived from 
drugs, car thefts and prostitution, one is unable to buy another 
person, he will use intimidation. It is the one or the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We welcome this amendment. For about three months, I lived 
through this hell. It was as if I had been in some kind of jail 
24 hours a day, seven days a week, while I could see on 
television criminals clowning around, smiling and acting like 
movie stars; they are incredibly arrogant when they become 
powerful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their arrogance is directly proportional to their power. For an 
honest citizens, particularly a three year old girl, to be deprived 
of their freedom even for an hour, is the most horrible 
experience they can go through. Freedom is important, 
particularly when one has nothing to reproach oneself with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we be shy when comes the time to fight organized 
crime, under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, 
supposedly to respect the rights of these people who have 
absolutely no respect for others? They destroy families, they 
kill, even 11 year old children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we not include clauses such as the one proposed by my 
colleague from Berthier—Montcalm to protect journalists? In a 
democracy, these people have an incredible job to do, that is, 
to dig up the truth and denounce criminals. In this democracy, 
they often complement our work. Without them, democracy would be 
incredibly flawed. 
So it was quite normal that we should include journalists in 
this new clause on intimidation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also pleased with the new provision that will protect the 
general public from certain acts of intimidation. Other 
provisions provide for the prosecution of those who help out 
organized criminals or have close ties with them. I am also very 
happy that, under this bill, the thugs who take over farmland in 
my riding and elsewhere in Quebec will be prosecuted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By linking those two provisions to the crimes they commit, we 
will be able to put them behind bars. First, they use 
intimidation. 
For about four years now, they have been intimidating farm 
families. That is unacceptable. They terrorize them for six 
months every year, from the moment they sow and transplant to 
the moment they harvest. They intimidate farmers, their families 
and their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have the extra tools we need to prosecute them. After 
catching these criminals right there in the fields, and I am 
talking directly to them now, we will have the tools to prosecute 
them for contributing to organized crime, the operations of 
biker gangs in particular, and to ensure they get real tough 
sentences. We will put an end to institutionalized terrorism in 
the rural areas of Quebec and particular in my riding of 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot. 
We will let those farming families alone, undisturbed, to enjoy 
the use of their land and make the economy roll. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am particularly proud of the new provisions. However, we would 
have liked the minister to show even more openness. We will have 
to wait another two, three or maybe four years to find out that 
there are still flaws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what is happening, but on our side, we work, we 
analyse and we plan. We have a problem with a number of things 
in this bill, irrespective of the good in it, and the bill satisfies 
about 80% of our expectations, for example, the whole issue of the 
solicitor general approving of the commission of crimes by 
policemen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is a judge not involved as is the case for search warrants, 
so that the political power does not interfere with the 
judiciary, with all the abuses that this may entail? There will 
be abuses. It is easy to foresee that. Why not also limit police 
immunity with respect to the organized crime? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have asked the Minister of Justice why she was not referring 
to criminal organizations, to organized crime. It is becoming 
disturbing to see that we can extend immunity to the police for 
any reason, basically for any group. It is just like an open 
bar. Once again, we want to give the police all the tools they 
need to fight organized crime and to help them do their work. 
That is obvious. However, we have to put restrictions and we 
need to be very careful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also asked the minister to reverse the burden of proof for 
the proceeds of crime. Let the criminals explain how, when they 
do not have a regular job and do not file income tax returns 
with Revenue Canada or Revenu Québec, they can afford a 
Mercedes, a boat and a mansion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have been nice if the government had avoided a 
situation where it will have to spend thousands and millions of 
dollars investigating the assets of criminals to prove that they 
are the proceeds of crime. We will have to wait once more, maybe 
for three, four or five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would have been so easy to pass this bill before operation 
Spring 2001. It was possible. These problems have been 
pointed out since 1997. I would have liked to see the 160 
criminals who were arrested in Quebec charged under the 
principles of the new bill. It was possible. 
We knew what was missing in the criminal code. We knew how 
difficult it was to prove gangsterism with the so-called rule of 
the three fives: a group of five people having committed in the 
last five years a crime punishable by imprisonment for five 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have to continue our education efforts, and the next 
time around the bill will be better and will give us 100% of 
what we need to fight organized crime effectively.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the 
opinion of this House, the government should develop a 
precise and workable definition of the terms “affordable 
housing”, “poverty' and “homeless” to guide government 
policy and to establish legislative parameters for related 
government spending. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, I wish to thank my colleague from 
Prince George—Peace River for seconding the motion.  I am 
pleased to rise today to speak on my motion, Motion No. 245, and 
I would like to repeat it for the record: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
develop a precise and workable definition of the terms 
“affordable housing”, “poverty”, and “homeless” to guide 
government policy and to establish legislative parameters for 
related government spending. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason for this is very simple, that is, the most basic of 
terms, these three, affordable housing, poverty and homeless, 
have so many different meanings across the country that it makes 
it rather impossible to legislate for the needs of the citizens 
of Canada with so much variety in interpretation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The term homeless, for example, has so many different 
definitions that it has the number of homeless people in Canada 
varying from some three million people at the high end to a low 
end of some three thousand if we are talking about people who 
simply do not have shelter or a home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this in mind, I will first refer to the dictionary 
definition of homeless.  Three dictionaries, <I>American 
Heritage</I>, <I>Canadian Oxford</I> and <I>Webster's</I>, simply 
say it means having no home or lacking a home.  That is very 
simple.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would think it would be very simple for various 
organizations across Canada to be able to use those simple terms, 
but what appears simple is not necessarily so.  Out of 10 
homeless reports I reviewed from across Canada there were 38 
different definitions of homeless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that in mind, and because it is important, I will read into 
the record the different definitions so that we can examine the 
problem to see if we cannot come up with a solution, something 
simple and basic that we are able to legislate and follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start with the different definitions of homeless and 
homelessness.  The definitions describe homeless people as: 
having no housing alternatives; being absolutely homeless; being 
sheltered homeless; living in emergency accommodations; living in 
condemned housing; living in transitional accommodation and ready 
to be discharged but having no permanent residence to go to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The definitions continue, describing homeless people as those 
who:  are expected to be on the street at the end of a stay; are 
expected to be on the street in the immediate future; have an 
extremely low income; have no fixed address; have no permanent 
place to reside; have no housing at all or are staying in a 
temporary form of a situation.  They also include people who: 
sleep on the street; sleep in a stairwell; end up staying with 
friends; live in housing that is extremely expensive; live in 
overcrowded or inadequate housing; live in places not meant for 
human habitation; live in parks and on beaches; live in vehicles; 
squat in vacant buildings; live in hostels; and live in 
substandard hotels and rooming houses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More definitions include:  being absolutely, periodically or 
temporarily without shelter; living in housing not within easy 
reach of employment and costing more than 50% of income; lacking 
privacy, security and tenant document rights; having mental 
health or social disorganization; not being a member of a stable 
group; being in extreme cases of failure to provide the 
conditions needed to ensure quality of life; paying more than 30% 
of income for rent; having no home or haven; lacking a home; 
having no home or permanent place of residence; having the 
quality or state of being homeless; being chronically homeless; 
being cyclically homeless; being temporarily homeless; and 
suffering from the homeless disease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It rather defies belief that in 10 reports we can have 38 
different definitions.  How on earth can we develop policy when 
we have such misunderstandings and misinterpretations across the 
country in 10 simple reports, let alone practically every city 
having its own individual reports? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is not enough of a problem in regard to the definition 
of the term homeless, we follow through with the problem of 
defining poverty.  The problem with poverty, and why it impacts 
and varies so much, is that the largest single group in the 
homeless category across the country is single people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we try to understand what the poverty level is for a single 
person, we will see that it varies from the $450 a month in 
Edmonton, which is provided by social services for a single 
person to live on, to the low income cutoff of $1,757.  It varies 
from social assistance of $450 to $1,750.  Once again, how do we 
rationalize it?  Those numbers are for one city, the city of 
Edmonton.  Let us look at Alberta assisted living wages in 
Edmonton.  That is $855 a month.  Minimum wages are $5.90 an 
hour, which means that full time employment of 170 hours is worth 
$1,000 a month.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely we have to come up with some opinion of what we consider 
to be a rational level for a single person who is living in 
poverty.  In other words, what is the poverty level for a single 
person?  Certainly I do not believe that it should be $1,700 a 
month, which is approximately 80% more than a person living on 
minimum wage.  On the low end, $450 a month does not provide 
sustenance of life either.  Therefore we have a problem defining 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third area we have a problem with is affordable housing. 
What is affordable?  How do we characterize and provide for 
affordable housing across this country when there are such wide 
discrepancies in our understanding of what is affordable?  For 
example, a brand new six-plex row housing unit was built in 
Edmonton at $117,000 per unit.  In the city of Edmonton that is 
simply not affordable.  That is high end housing.  A builder can 
build the same housing for $55 a square foot in Edmonton, for a 
cost of approximately $60,000 to $70,000 a unit.  If the builder 
can build units to code, to regulations, to all standards 
including health standards, and build these units for $55 a 
square foot, why are we considering affordable housing in the 
range of $100 to $110 a square foot? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can that be provided on a national basis if we are looking 
at providing assistance with funding for 1.7 million households 
across the country?  The difference between those two I mentioned 
is a factor of 2 to 1.  Surely we have to come up with some 
legislation and terminology so that we can examine what we mean 
by affordable and what is proper for us to provide.  We need to 
have that before we look at funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, we simply could not afford to provide a six unit 
row house complex at a cost of $117,000 per unit to all those 
across the country who do need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue with affordable housing is how we make it 
affordable.  There are great concerns with that as well, because 
100% of the funding for this same six unit affordable housing 
project in Edmonton came from Alberta lottery funds or from 
taxpayers.  By the same token, now that the complex has been 
opened taxpayers are paying subsidized rents up to market value. 
We have to address not only the problem of affordability but the 
problem of how we appropriate grants and loans for new 
construction.  In this case the taxpayers paid to build the 
building and are also paying to subsidize the rents.  That 
obviously cannot be done across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are various issues that must be addressed and considered. 
We absolutely must have working definitions for the terms 
affordable housing, poverty and homeless in order to be able to 
go on to the other issues, which would be to develop regional 
housing shelter ladders and affordable housing standards and to 
address deinstitutionalization concerns and charter of rights and 
freedoms concerns.  All of these will have to be addressed before 
we can start to look at properly addressing the concerns of the 
homeless and of those across the country who need affordable 
housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask all members to agree that the first step in providing 
affordable housing and addressing shelter needs and concerns is 
to understand the terminology so that we can define it in terms 
of where our needs are before we proceed to other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated, one of the largest concerns in the country, one 
of the largest needs, is that of providing housing for singles. 
Whether we are talking about Toronto or Edmonton, our shelters 
across the country are filled with single people, a large number 
who have the means to pay at least some rent. 
Whether it is in Toronto or Edmonton, one-third of the people in 
the emergency shelters need clean affordable rooming house rooms. 
For example, in Edmonton that would be a rooming house room that 
would rent for $250 a month and in Toronto it would probably be 
$300 to $350 a month.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that we have not built any new rooming house 
rooms in Canada in 20 years.  More than that, we have closed 
two-thirds of the rooming house rooms.  Affordable housing is one 
of the most critical areas that must be defined and defined soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ninety per cent of funding that has been going into RRAP repair 
programs has been going into upscale apartment projects, not into 
the most needed area, rooming house rooms.  Part of the reason 
for that is the explanation and definition of what a rooming 
house room is and what an apartment is.  That underlines the 
concerns and the need to develop national understandings and 
definitions for the terminology that we are using. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the affordable housing definitions and terminology it is 
very important to define whether it is a rooming house room for 
singles or whether it is the shelters themselves, so that we know 
what we will provide for basic shelter and for affordable housing 
units. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is estimated that some 7,000 rooming house rooms in the 
Toronto area have been closed down.  When I visit the shelters in 
Toronto and Edmonton I am told time and again that the men and 
women staying in those shelters want rooming house rooms.  They 
could afford to move into something but they just do not have 
enough money to move into upscale apartments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Due to the importance of my motion and the need for affordable 
housing on a national basis, I ask for unanimous consent to make 
it votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Judi Longfield (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak 
to Motion No. 245.  I will start by addressing the part of the 
motion that asks the government to develop a precise and workable 
definition of the term homeless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What might appear to be a fairly straightforward request is not 
nearly so straightforward.  The member opposite gave a very 
lengthy and accurate accounting of valid definitions used by 
government and agencies throughout our country.  I would argue 
that we should concern ourselves with definitions of the problem. 
I believe it is more appropriate for us to focus our attention on 
meeting the challenges of homelessness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know, for example, there is no single cause of homelessness. 
Therefore we cannot simply assume that any definition we come up 
with will adequately address the situation of Canadians who find 
themselves in need of housing, mental health care, rehabilitation 
or employment training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who are without shelter are on the streets for many 
reasons: some because of alcohol or substance abuse, some because 
of spousal abuse, and others are chronically unemployed or have 
mental health problems.  There are many reasons people are on the 
streets and they should all be defined differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A community worker dealing with a single mother looking for 
shelter, a discharge worker trying to help a psychiatric patient 
reintegrate into the community, or any other type of homeless 
causes that community workers in Canada deal with every day could 
all produce a very different definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly different communities also define the problem in 
different ways.  Finding affordable housing in Toronto is very 
different from finding affordable housing in rural Saskatchewan. 
Living in poverty in Edmonton is different from living in poverty 
in rural New Brunswick.  While these problems may both be equally 
acute, they are different.  I feel that it would be almost 
impossible to develop a definition that would suit these 
situations which are equally unique. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of homelessness is quantitatively different in large 
urban centres than it is in smaller towns and rural areas.  For 
example, when the Minister of Labour and the federal co-ordinator 
for homelessness went across the country to discuss the homeless 
issues with mayors and community workers she heard many different 
definitions of the problem. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1350"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some community groups were concerned with street youth, others 
with women who needed refuge from a difficult family situation. 
Others thought the priority should be unemployed men who needed 
food and temporary accommodation.  These people did not have a 
common definition of homelessness but they did see a common 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were not so much interested in defining the problem as they 
were in solving it.  These community leaders told us that they 
wanted support from the Government of Canada that would meet the 
needs that they saw.  They wanted the flexibility to develop 
local solutions that would meet the needs of the homeless in 
their individual communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Successive federal, provincial, territorial and municipal 
governments have responded by bringing in countless different 
measures over the years that are designed to help those who are 
in need; measures such as the federal government's national 
homelessness initiative, which is attempting to co-ordinate an 
adequate response to this growing crisis on the federal side 
while working together with provincial, territorial and municipal 
governments, as well as community organizations and the private 
sector to address the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The goal of this initiative is to prevent and alleviate 
homelessness.  Its objectives are as follows: to facilitate 
community capacity development to address the local needs of the 
homeless by co-ordinating Government of Canada efforts and 
resources and enhancing the diversity of tools and resources 
available; to foster effective partnerships and investments that 
contribute to addressing the immediate and multifaceted needs of 
the homeless and to reducing homelessness in Canada; and to 
increase the awareness and understanding of homelessness in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the supporting communities partnerships initiative 
that the government introduced last year to support communities 
across Canada in meeting the unique needs of the homeless in 
their communities as they see them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is a partner, often along with 
provincial, territorial and municipal levels of government, 
community organizations and the private sector.  However the 
needs are locally defined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course there are some criteria.  For example, one of the 
federal government's key objectives is to ensure that no 
individual is involuntarily on the street by ensuring that 
sufficient shelters and adequate support systems are available. 
Another is to reduce the number of individuals requiring 
emergency shelters and traditional and supportive housing through 
preventative initiatives, early intervention, health services, 
low cost housing and discharge planning.  These are all based on 
a continuum that leads to independence and self-reliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A wide variety of organizations, including public health and 
educational institutions, not for profit organizations, and even 
individuals, are eligible to receive funding.  The private sector 
also has an important role to play.  We have encouraged them to 
contribute and in some cases participate in joint initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has included the following 10 cities in 
the initiative:  Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Toronto, 
Hamilton, Ottawa, Montreal, Quebec City and Halifax.  They are 
designated as large urban centres where homelessness is most 
acute.  Smaller communities or groups of communities working 
together in a region that can demonstrate a homeless problem are 
also eligible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, for example, the Minister of Justice and the Attorney 
General of Canada, on behalf of the federal co-ordinator for 
homelessness, announced federal funding of $19 million to assist 
the homeless in Edmonton and other parts of north and central 
Alberta as defined by these communities.  Some $17 million will 
go to the Edmonton housing trust fund to work with the city 
agencies and private sector to meet the needs of the homeless in 
that city. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Edmonton mayor, Bill Smith, expressed his support for this 
approach.  He said that his city was pleased to be working with 
the federal and provincial governments to address the issue of 
homelessness in Edmonton.  Similarly, the provincial minister of 
seniors responsible for housing in the government of Alberta is 
also in favour of the partnership approach.  However he reminds 
us that every community has different housing needs and 
circumstances that are best resolved by local planning and 
decision making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the federal government's perspective, we see homelessness 
as an issue that goes right to the heart of the kind of country 
we want to live in.  Do we want a society that is generous and 
fair, that includes everyone and that is willing to provide 
support to those in need?  Clearly, the vast majority of 
Canadians have already answered yes.  They want a society that is 
generous, progressive and inclusive.  Our experience to date 
tells us that our partners in the provincial and municipal 
governments and the community organizations that are working 
directly with the homeless, however they are defined, share this 
perspective.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane Bourgeois (Terrebonne—Blainville, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am very happy to have an opportunity today to try to help 
clarify the terms affordable housing, poverty and homeless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a topic of great interest to me, all the more so as I am 
a woman. When one talks about poverty, the homeless and 
affordable housing, the majority of those affected are women. 
I am also the Bloc Quebecois critic for the status of women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin right away by saying how very disappointed I am in 
the answer given by the member opposite. 
I thought that we were here this afternoon to clarify, as set 
out in the motion, the terms affordable housing, poverty and 
homeless, and not to list off what the government is doing with 
respect to affordable housing, poverty and the homeless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the beginning of this parliamentary session, the Bloc 
Quebecois has repeatedly asked questions on these topics.  We 
have tried in various ways to find out whether the government is 
on the same wavelength as we are, if its understanding of the 
concepts of affordable housing, poverty and homeless is the same 
as ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the House knows, the federal government stopped funding 
social housing in 1994, and perhaps that is why we have been 
asking so many questions. 
It is no longer providing any funding for this. It chose instead 
to put in place an affordable housing program, which is totally 
unacceptable for Quebecers and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is about to invest $680 million in 
housing that does not meet the needs of the poor and the 
homeless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion brought forward today will give me the opportunity to 
explain the difference between social and affordable housing and 
to give a clear definition of the words poverty and homeless, 
and I thank the member for Edmonton Centre East for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Bloc Quebecois critic on the status of women, I will 
cannot claim that I live in what would qualify as poverty. I am 
one of those women who, through their work, were able to make a 
decent living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I went to meet people, to meet groups in Quebec as well 
as in the rest of Canada. I went to see if these groups had a 
definition of social housing. I went to see what they thought of 
affordable housing. I went to see what the words poverty and 
homeless meant to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea of affordable housing is directly related to the issue 
of social housing. Social housing means housing designed 
exclusively for unattached individuals, elderly people, men, 
women, families and households with a very low income. It means 
that these people pay at least 30% of their gross income, and 
maybe more, to have a decent place to live, including heat and 
electricity. 
We are talking about more 1,670,700 households, the majority of 
which are single parent families headed by women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is important to define what social housing is 
because it is not affordable housing.

federal government and the provinces are at a standstill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Promises were made about the construction of housing by 
independent building contractors, with a minimum investment of 
$12,500.  We know that decent housing requires an investment of 
at least $25,000 investment.  I am referring here to four-room 
accommodation. 
This is housing that will then rent for between $600 and $800 a 
month in Quebec.  My colleague from Edmonton Centre East has 
said that the rent would probably be far higher in a certain 
other region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election campaign, the minister responsible for 
social housing stated on a radio program that this type of 
housing would be made available for families.  Thus, the 
affordable housing would be reserved for families able to afford 
this amount of rent.  That is not what social housing is all 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, the Liberal government does not have the same 
definition of poverty as we do, or perhaps it does not even 
realize what poverty is, or it just does not want to acknowledge 
its existence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People need social housing because they poor. When one is 
poor, one cannot pay $600 a month for housing. When one is poor, 
one often depends on food banks or soup kitchens. When one is 
poor, one often faces a dilemma: pay the rent or buy food, pay 
the rent or pay for drugs. A growing minority is no longer able 
to pay the rent and services like electricity or gas at the same 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poverty amplifies another problem, that is the discrimination 
one faces when looking for housing. Owners of rental housing are 
increasingly invoking the presumed insolvency of poor people as 
a reason to reject them as tenants. These people are often 
forced to accept inferior housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the homeless, what I earlier called the problem of 
homelessness, and I would only like to say to my colleague of 
Edmonton Centre East that that it is not an illness, it is only 
the tip of the iceberg when it comes to housing problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was said earlier, more than one million tenant families are 
inadequately housed, a record number of people are condemned to 
live on the street in every big city and people living in the 
street are there for a number of reasons, many of them having to 
do with housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Community groups that have this expertise on homelessness agree 
on the following definition of homeless: people who are of no 
fixed address and who do not have the assurance of a stable and 
safe dwelling for the next 60 days; people with very little 
income who do not belong to any group on a stable basis; and people 
who have mental health problems or problems with alcohol or 
social disorganization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people are often too poor to have access to a dwelling or 
a room, and when they do, it is often in slums. Social housing 
units for the homeless are too rare. We know that there are 
other reasons for homelessness, but we can say that the housing 
problem is one of its structural causes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we can see, the three themes in this motion all relate to 
poverty. 
Based on what we saw, it was obvious that the concept of 
affordable housing did not at all reflect the needs expressed 
by the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my hope that today's debate will develop an awareness 
among members and make them more vigilant regarding the 
affordable housing policy to which this government is committed. 
In our opinion, the government is headed in the wrong direction 
in this area.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
first, I would like to thank the member for Edmonton Centre-East 
for bringing forward this important motion today.  It gives us an 
opportunity to debate the issue of definitions around affordable 
housing, poverty and homelessness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin by saying I represent the riding of Vancouver East 
which includes very low income areas, in particular the downtown 
east side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One constituent I visit fairly frequently lives at Main and 
Hastings in an old building that was probably built 80 years ago. 
She lives in what the member referred to as a single room 
occupancy, the room being barely 8 feet by 10 feet.  She has a 
sink but shares a toilet and a shower with probably 25 other 
people.  It is an eight storey building where the elevator does 
not really function, so people climb up and down the stairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That young woman is only 30 and in very poor health.  She lives 
in poverty and is on social assistance.  Luckily the housing is 
managed by a very good non-profit housing society, but the 
housing conditions she endures are something that no one in this 
room could endure.  It is something I think most Canadians would 
describe as appalling in a country as wealthy as Canada.  To me 
she could be characterized as someone who is homeless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A young man came to see me a few weeks ago.  He had a shopping 
cart that he pushed around on Terminal Avenue.  The cart was 
filled with clothes that he tried to sell.  However it was 
confiscated by the city engineering department because it was 
getting tough on panhandlers and people who lived on the street. 
That man, who lives in poverty, was literally trying to sell the 
clothes off his back in order to make a few bucks so he could buy 
a cup of coffee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met another man a few days later who could not get a 
prescription filled for pain killers.  His teeth were so rotten 
they were falling out and he was in incredible pain. Although he 
was covered by pharmacare, he could not get his prescription 
filled because of the way he looked.  It was a clear example of 
what we call poor bashing, which is discrimination against poor 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he went to the pharmacy and handed in his prescription to 
get some painkillers.  The pharmacists looked at him and said 
they thought he would sell the drugs on the street or do 
something wrong.  Therefore they did not fill the prescription. 
He continued to try to find a pharmacy that would fill his 
prescription, all the while in pain because he was so poor that 
he could not get his teeth fixed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I use these examples because the real issue before us today is 
not so much the definition of poverty and affordable housing and 
homelessness.  It is what the heck we are going to do about it. I 
have met people all across the country, beginning in my own 
community in east Vancouver, who are suffering under the 
oppression of poverty, homelessness and lack of housing every 
single day.  This is as a result of government policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the parliamentary secretary, someone who I respect 
very much.  However it drives me crazy when I hear people ascribe 
homelessness to mental health, alcoholism and somehow being all 
about individual problems.  Never once do we talk about the fact 
that homelessness is as a result of not building housing.  The 
reality is homelessness exists in the country because the 
government abandoned its housing policies in 1993.  It makes me 
feel pretty damn mad when we get into the whole policy speak of 
blaming individual people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a very good friend in Vancouver, Jean Swanson, a leading 
anti-poverty activist in this country.  She just wrote a book 
called “Poor-Bashing:  The Politics of Exclusion”.  She details 
very clearly how government policy, not just from this government 
but over the years, has really been a policy of bashing poor 
people by excluding them and deliberately designing policies that 
keep people where they are in terms of economic disparity and 
economic inequality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could tell the member for Edmonton Centre-East very quickly 
what definitions are used by groups, and indeed the government 
every single day.  Basically, CMHC says that people who are 
paying more than 30% of their income for housing are living in 
housing that is not affordable.  That is the rule that CMHC lives 
by.  It used to be 25% in the 1970s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the definition of homelessness, just to talk to the United 
Nations or to any group in Canada that deals on the frontline in 
trying to cope with an increasing number of people who are facing 
homelessness.  They will tell us that the UN definition of 
homelessness is anyone whose housing is insecure, threatened, 
unsafe or unstable.  In fact all the things the member listed. 
There does not have to be just five words about it.  It really 
describes the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who live in slum housing, or housing that is substandard, 
or where they are paying exorbitant rents of 50% or more of their 
income are homeless because they are threatened.  People who live 
in housing where they face conversion or demolition are homeless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that we understand that there are people 
who are literally on the streets and have no a place to go. There 
are people who rely on shelters.  It is awful to see how that has 
risen and has now become a crisis.  Millions of Canadians are one 
step away from that.  They are so insecure in terms of their 
income or housing support that they are also characterized as 
being homeless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the issue of poverty, if we talk to any 
organization in Canada, whether it is the National Anti-Poverty 
Organization, NAPO, whether it is FRAPRU in Quebec or whether it 
is the Canadian Council on Social Development, they will tell us 
that the standard definition used for poverty is the low income 
cutoffs established by Statistics Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is really worrying is the Liberals are likely poised to 
change that definition to a so-called basket approach.  By the 
very fact of doing that, they will with the stroke of a pen say 
that poverty in Canada is not as bad as they thought, that they 
just changed it and that now a couple of hundred thousand or 
maybe half a million people no longer living below the poverty 
line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come back to the point that the issue here today is not so 
much the definition.  The issue is that there are glaring 
examples of income inequality.  Report after report shows us that 
income inequality in this country is growing.  A recent report 
from Statistics Canada, the so-called wealth study, measured 
income inequality.  We know it exists.  The evidence is there. 
The issue is what will we do about it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with my hon. colleague from the Bloc that one of the 
greatest failings of the government is its lack of responsibility 
to provide the necessary funds and support to the provincial 
governments to create a housing strategy to ensure that social 
housing is built.  It is a crime that the program was ended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada used to have really excellent housing programs.  The 
co-operative housing movement began in Canada.  It was a huge 
success story.  That has been abandoned at the federal level. 
Only two provinces still maintain their commitment provincially 
to social housing, Quebec and British Columbia. Although who 
knows what will happen in British Columbia with the new 
government.  Again, the finger comes back and points to the 
federal government that basically abandoned that responsibility 
in 1993.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democrats welcome the opportunity to talk about 
definitions but we must get down to the important matter here, 
which is to determine the priorities.  What are the priorities 
for members as legislators?  What is the priority of government 
in terms of dealing with an $18 billion surplus and where it will 
go? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we truly want to eliminate poverty and homelessness in the 
country, it could easily be done because we have the resources to 
do it.  It comes down to a matter of political will, leadership 
and what the priorities are.  That is what the debate should be 
about. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
also rise in support of the motion.  I must say that I am a 
little disappointed that members opposite did not see it right 
and proper to support the motion as votable because it is 
certainly one that should receive a lot more strength than an 
hour's homage through the words that we utter and then to be 
forgotten.  This is an extremely important issue all across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three words are highlighted in the motion:  homelessness, 
poverty and affordable housing.  I would suggest that if the 
affordable housing issue were addressed, the other two words 
would not be of such significance.  A lot of the poverty in 
Canada is caused by the fact that people have to spend the little 
money they have on the real necessities of life, and what is more 
important than housing?  Housing is so expensive for many people 
that they are in what we call a state of poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people wander around homeless.  Some admittedly are 
homeless because that is the style of life they want but many of 
them are not.  It is a style of life that is imposed upon them by 
the restrictions of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening in the country when we see people who are 
destitute, homeless, living in a state of poverty and cannot 
afford a place to live?  All of us here in this Chamber are in 
the position to leave here in the evening and go home to a nice, 
comfortable home.  Even if it is an apartment somewhere here in 
the city, at least it is warm and comfortable.  As we walk to our 
homes, we pass people who are without homes.  They cannot always 
afford shelter because we have uncaring governments that do not 
consider it a priority to look after those who need help most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had two experiences that will always remain with me.  The 
first one was because of the impact it made on me and the other 
was because of the red tape and bureaucracy that governments 
create and the walls they put up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first experience I had was when I visited London, England, 
several years ago.  I had just walked past Buckingham Palace and 
everyone was in awe of the tremendous building, the richness of 
the area and the riches displayed.  About five minutes down the 
street from Buckingham Palace is Westminster Station.  As I 
passed through the station to catch the train at about 11 o'clock 
at night, there were a number of homeless people starting to 
gather. It was an open shelter which was just a covered bridge 
operation or a large building with no ends.  The heat from the 
trains underneath apparently warmed the pavement which made it a 
good place to sleep during the cold nights.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>People say that Newfoundland is in a state of poverty.  I 
challenge them to drive around our province.  We might not be 
making a lot of money on average, but it depends on what we do 
with what we have.  We are very fortunate.  Even though incomes 
might not be as high as the national average, many people own 
their own homes, which they built on their own land, and provide 
a lot of their own food and materials.  They are doing very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seeing people lying around on pavement in London was something I 
had never seen before.  What made it more heart rending was the 
fact that some of them were very old.  I will always picture one 
lady who appeared to me to be in her seventies.  That might have 
been because of the hardships she endured.  Maybe she looked 
older than she actually was.  To see a person the age of our 
mothers trying to lie on concrete and pull a newspaper around her 
to keep her warm is a sight I will never ever forget, 
particularly when we were within a stone's throw of Buckingham 
Palace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another experience I had will perhaps show why we have these 
problems.  Some years ago when I was a provincial member serving 
a rural area I was approached by a gentleman who wanted to move 
from an old, dilapidated home in which he lived with a couple of 
daughters to a home that would be much more comfortable and 
reasonable and close to his relatives.  The price of the new 
building was $24,000, which was very reasonable.  It had been 
completely renovated and modernized with new wiring, new plumbing 
and whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We went to the department of housing and arranged for the loan 
program provided to those looking for affordable housing.  The 
gentleman was extremely pleased he was to get this new, 
comfortable home, which would solve a lot of his problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of days later the department said that it could not 
provide funding to buy the home because its inspectors indicated 
that the upstairs ceilings were not eight feet high.  They were 
only six and a half feet high.  Its regulations stated that they 
must be eight feet high to meet its standards, or otherwise it 
could not provide funding.  However, there was another house for 
sale in the community.  It was a very modern bungalow that was 
selling for $50,000.  As its maximum was $55,000, it could buy 
that house for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I approached the gentleman and he asked why he should buy that 
house, even though it was much better, more modern and whatever. 
He was quite satisfied with the other one, but if the department 
would not give him money for that house he was willing to accept 
the bungalow.  The request went in to provide funding for him to 
buy the $50,000 home, which was a very good, modern home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the request was rejected because the appraisers stated 
that the day after he bought the house the resale value would be 
only $30,000 because of its location.  Even though it was selling 
for $50,000 and worth a lot more, they could not provide it 
because the quick sale value would only be $30,000 the next day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department indicated that it could build him a house.  It 
would not be as good as the one for sale, but it would be worth 
around $50,000.  Because it was building the house, it could 
provide the $50,000.  I asked what would be the resale value of 
that house the following day and the answer was $30,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not lose my temper very often but I did on that occasion. 
Within a couple of days the gentleman had his $24,000 original 
house.  It was nothing but red tape and bureaucracy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what we face.  Within a stone's throw of Ottawa, and I 
am sure within the town, a number of housing units could be 
provided for people who are homeless.  There is a base just 
outside Ottawa with all kinds of beautiful houses that are closed 
up because some department or other had to divest of it in a 
certain way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is about time we used some common sense and did what must be 
done for the people who are so much in need. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton Centre-East, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I will reply to the comments of the 
member opposite who said it was not necessary to provide 
definitions for homelessness, poverty and affordable housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I disagree.  The amount of money recently put into the city of 
Edmonton housing trust fund by the ministry for the homeless, $17 
million in federal funding for a total value of some $50 million, 
has not resulted in even one new home.  The funding is going into 
existing shelters, additions on shelters or assisted living.  It 
has not gone into even one designated new private home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The funding going into Edmonton and being transposed across the 
country from coast to coast is a phenomenal amount.  The problem 
is that it is not creating any new housing.  The problem with 
creating no new housing is that it forces people to stay in 
emergency shelters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the city of Edmonton another federal government program, 
RRAP, for persons with disabilities has also been an abysmal 
failure. Ninety-five per cent of the program's funding is not 
going toward the greatest single need in the city of Edmonton: 
the need for rooming houses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The funding for RRAP is going into upscale housing. That is a 
problem because the men and women who live in the Herb Jamieson 
Centre and other shelters in Edmonton are locked into that 
condition on a perpetual basis.  They cannot move to new housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The long and the short of it is that not one new rooming house 
has been built in Edmonton in three to five years.  The result is 
that shelters in Edmonton are as full as they are in Toronto. The 
$17 million that the member opposite mentioned has been put into 
the city of Edmonton will simply build more shelters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to start building homes, not shelters.  That is the 
main direction we should go in.  I feel very strongly that this 
is happening because there is a misunderstanding about where the 
funding is going.  The misunderstanding exists because there is a 
lack of common terminology or definition for the basics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic questions are:  What is affordable housing?  What is 
poverty?  Those terminologies must be defined.  That is why there 
is such a discrepancy and why shelters across the country are 
filled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the Progressive Conservative member that, yes, if 
we had affordable housing the majority of the population in 
shelters would be gone.  They are there simply because they need 
affordable housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The need for affordable housing is strong.  However first and 
foremost we must come up with common identifiable determinations 
on what are the basics.  We must then look at a national plan to 
build affordable housing for the country again.  For too many 
years the federal government has been out of it.  It is time the 
government developed national standards to help builders re-enter 
the affordable housing market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely essential that be done.  It has been far too 
long now.  Simply putting more and more money into more and more 
shelters across the country is not the solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $17 million which has gone to the city of Edmonton, combined 
with the provincial funds and city funds, provides a total fund 
of $50 million.  The identifiable homeless population is 1,000. 
Simple mathematics would indicate that is $50,000 for every 
homeless person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could build them a home and give them a home.  It would be 
far better to spend the money there than to continuously build on 
the shelter system and keep our people locked up in a shelter 
system when what they want and need is affordable housing.
