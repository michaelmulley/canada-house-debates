<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADIAN INSTITUTES OF HEALTH RESEARCH ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK35">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 24 consideration of Bill C-13, 
an act to establish the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, 
to repeal the Medical Research Council Act and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts, as reported (with 
amendment) from the committee, and of the motions in Group No. 1. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to 
speak to Bill C-13. This bill will benefit the whole community in 
terms of our quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are talking about this morning is the establishment of 
health research institutes so that research is better coordinated 
and better organized and that health research can benefit from 
increased funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of these institutes of health research is to replace 
the Medical Research Council and to provide additional funding 
for health research to the tune of $500 million over three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us responds to recommendations made by a 
temporary committee made up of 34 members from the scientific and 
academic community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind hon. members of what the health research 
institutes will be.  They will replace the Medical Research 
Council.  They will have the very broad mandate of carrying out 
research in order to make health research a cutting edge sector, 
as was done with the communications sector in 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Medical Research Council wanted, and what it called 
for, was for medical research to be given a lead role so that 
research could be carried out in response to the new market 
realities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are very much in favour of the creation of the Institutes of 
Health Research, let there be no ambiguity about that.  The Bloc 
Quebecois accepts the legitimate right of these institutes to be 
created.  Various points have been raised by various people, 
leading to the bill we have before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is said that these research institutes will not be 
centralized bricks-and-mortar facilities. They are virtual 
institutes.  This will make it possible for researchers, 
academics, hospitals and various research centres in Canada to 
exchange information.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois agrees with and supports the establishment of 
these virtual research centres.  We know that no decision has yet 
been reached on the type of institutes to be created; the task 
force has listed a number of themes, however.  They are 150 in 
all, and I will mention just a few of them: ageing, genome, 
technology and clinical assessment, heart disease, stroke, 
musculo-skeletal development.  All of these sectors are of daily 
concern to the public, for instance cancer and new diseases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The stakes are very high. 
We also know that people live longer. Consequently, we will have 
to be able to deal with these problems and to ensure this system 
is well implemented, allowing researchers to respond to the 
demand. They will also be able to know what is being done in the 
field of research elsewhere, in Canada and in other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want that there be any ambiguity in the willingness of 
the Bloc Quebecois to support the different high technology 
sectors in the research and development field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in favour of this multidisciplinary approach. We know 
very well how it could promote science. All researchers want 
these virtual institutes to be implemented. The objective is to 
create between 10 and 15 research institutes, and their funding 
will be doubled over the next three years. There is a great 
demand for funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have attended the meetings of the Standing Committee on 
Health. We know that researchers are all looking for funding so 
that more advanced research can be done. Operations are supposed 
to start on April 1, 2000. This is a deadline to which 
researchers and the federal government are hanging on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois are very vigilant. We wish April 1, 
2000 will be the deadline so that things can get under way. 
However, we are very touchy about the wording of this bill, which 
clearly infringes on provincial health jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the support of the budget increase, we commend 
the effort the bill reflects. As for the communication of health 
information, this is where there is a great difference in the 
wording of Bill C-13. What bothers us is the words that are used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We submitted several amendments to ensure that the institutes 
would only communicate information on health and would not get 
involved into the management side of the health sector, because 
this would be going beyond the communication of information, 
which is what Bill C-13 is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its current form, the bill squarely infringes on the 
jurisdiction of the provinces in the health sector. The bill goes 
beyond promoting research. It contains several references to 
health related issues that come exclusively under the 
jurisdiction of the provinces. The bill does not recognize 
responsibilities of the provinces. It makes mere actors of them 
and the organizations and people who are involved in health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gives national mandates to the institutes, without the 
provinces' involvement. This is dangerous because it is the 
provinces that have responsibility over health and its 
management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois cannot support such a measure. I am aware of 
the pressure to make the Bloc Quebecois look like a spoilsport, 
like a troublemaker, but we must look at the long term 
implications of such a bill. In its current wording, it would 
support the federal government's intention to set national 
standards, to apply a certain type of management and to 
prioritize certain processes in health. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1025"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are well aware that research and development fall into the 
federal government's residual powers. The Bloc Quebecois agrees 
with that. It is the federal government's role to help the 
provinces with research and development so that they can thrive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we cannot accept that, through some tricks, the federal 
government would use this legislation to centralize all the 
decisions made in the health sector. Indeed, the bill provides 
many opportunities for direct infringement on the provinces' 
jurisdiction in health, this without any consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the Bloc Quebecois is proposing amendments. 
If the federal government really wants to discuss seriously with 
the provinces, if it agrees to respect the autonomy of the 
provinces, then it will accept these amendments by the Bloc 
Quebecois so that we can come to an understanding and move ahead 
when the April 1 deadline arrives. Our constituents are lobbying 
to have this bill adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we also have to be careful because we know what the 
government has done with the Canada social transfer, deep cuts to 
transfers to the provinces. It had announced $48 billion worth of 
cuts and $30 billion have been cut since 1993. Each time the 
government hands out a paltry $2.4 billion, it tells us that it 
is investing in health. It is not investing in health at all. The 
only thing it is doing is reducing the cuts that were announced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to look at this bill. The government should 
be working with the Bloc Quebecois and all the other opposition 
parties to give full jurisdiction to the provinces in matters of 
health and confine itself to the flow of information and the 
networking of virtual health and research institutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that this is a truly important social issue. The Bloc 
Quebecois has said so on many occasions and I say so again this 
morning. I hope that the government will act in good faith 
because we are. We would not want our communities, our 
researchers and our universities to be penalized. We would not 
want to be considered as not wanting funds to go to health and 
research. This is not at all what we want to achieve by our 
amendments. We only want to further define the role of the 
Canadian government in health.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will 
not be taking my full 10 minutes but I will make a few comments 
about the importance of this act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been approached by many people in the medical community 
in the Ottawa area who, before the government decided to proceed 
with this initiative, have lobbied and written letters to the 
Minister of Health, as well as to government officials and their 
members of parliament, demanding that the government initiate and 
introduce such an initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am delighted to see the government responding to the needs of 
the community and establishing this particular institute.  This 
will set an example for other fields where we could bring 
together institutions, people who are on the front lines, 
different levels of government, agencies and the private sector 
so they can collectively work in the best interests of the 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was quite surprised that we did not have such an institute a 
long time ago.  Given the kind of confederation and the kind of 
arrangement we have in Canada, one would think that this would 
have been the most obvious thing that we would have done 15 or 20 
years ago, where would would have an agency that would look at 
best practices, that would exchange information and that would 
disseminate information across the country, and an agency where 
we would look at what others are doing in different fields around 
North America and, for that matter, all around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say that it is high time.  Finally we have something 
being put in place that will achieve what should have been done 
many years ago. 
To that extent I think the Minister of Health, as well as the 
government, is to be commended for taking this bold initiative 
and finally introducing what will be a step in the right 
direction.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say it is one of the finest initiatives in the area of 
research and development at the national level, particularly in 
the medical community.  All we have to do is look at some of the 
institutes and some of the organizations in our own backyard here 
in the national capital region where we have some of the best 
pioneers in the whole world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The World Heart Corporation is a perfect example of co-operation 
between the public and the private sector.  We have the Heart 
Institute.  We have leading professionals working with the Heart 
Institute in conjunction with the University of Ottawa and the 
private sector.  They put their brain power and their resources 
together collectively and are now in the process of moving ahead 
with some of the finest devices anywhere in the world that will 
change the way we conduct ourselves and will save thousands of 
lives all across the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Initiatives like these would not happen if we did not have the 
kind of co-operation and the kind of cohesive exchanges of 
information and partnership between the public and private 
sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The institute that the government is about to introduce and 
enact will facilitate more things like that, will bring together 
more people who have similar aspirations, similar views, similar 
talent, similar hopes and similar objectives.  It will put them 
together so we can move forward and we can keep Canada on the 
leading edge in those areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say that despite all of the deficiencies that we have in 
our health care system, despite all of the problems that we 
encounter, we still have one of the finest systems anywhere in 
the world.  I want to commend all those who are involved in 
trying to revitalize the health care system by trying to inject 
more blood into it, one might say.  It is my hope that we do not 
lose sight of the fact that we have something that is good.  But 
in thinking it out, what we need to do is bring our resources 
together so we can keep it healthy, so we can move forward with a 
system that continues to be the envy of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not matter where we go, whether we go to Asia-Pacific, 
whether we go to Europe, whether we go to Africa or whether we go 
to the south side of the border, people always use the health 
care system here in Canada as an example of a system that is good 
and as an example of a system that responds to the needs of the 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that we are faced with a challenge, which is to keep the 
health care system for the next 50, 100 and perhaps thousands of 
years, if we want to keep the system responding to the needs of 
Canadians we have to work collectively, but we have to work 
objectively.  We have to work in a positive way, not a negative 
way. We have to find solutions that will respond to the needs of 
the people, rather than moving away and creating a two-tier 
system and start shooting at each other and undermining the 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the extent that this debate is taking place, it is my hope 
that it will be a positive one, that it will be a constructive 
one and that it will be an objective one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend my colleagues on the opposition side for standing to 
support the government initiative on the Canadian Institutes of 
Health Research Act.  It is my hope that we will push it through 
quite fast so it will become a reality as quickly as possible.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise after the speech by the member for Québec and 
speak to Bill C-13 on Canadian Institutes of Health Research at 
report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill presents us with a paradoxical situation and I think 
that the member for Québec has expressed it very well.  The Bloc 
Quebecois agrees with the principle of the bill as drafted, but 
will not be able to support it because it runs counter to certain 
fundamental aspects of the Canadian constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was listening to the comments on the bill by the member from 
the Ottawa area who spoke just before me. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1035"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT7"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT7"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1035

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say that, purposely or otherwise, the government has had 
an incomprehensible memory lapse when it comes to a document that 
I think is fundamental and essential: the Canadian constitution. 
It is the mother of all statutes, the ground rules under which we 
operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal party is approaching the debate as though this basic 
document governing our daily lives did not exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Liberal government, there is one way of 
thinking in this country, the Liberal party way, one way of doing 
things, the Liberal party way, and one way of acting, the Liberal 
party way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a background to Bill C-13 and with all due deference, I am 
going to remind the House of the existence of the document 
written and adopted in 1867, which was reworked and re-adopted 
without Quebec's consent in 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Quebec pointed out, and as the member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve so eloquently explained, we are not 
opposed to the principle of Bill C-13, but to its basic values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is proposing to replace the Medical Research 
Council with Canadian Institutes of Health Research.  We noticed 
that and it is fine with us.  This consensus is based on 
recommendations made by an interim committee composed of 34 
members of the scientific and academic community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure neither our critic nor any Bloc Quebecois member would 
ever want to suggest that we know the conditions that should 
govern the Canadian institutes of health research better than the 
34 leading experts who looked at the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our objections concern the legal and constitutional aspects of 
the bill, not with terms, because these 34 people coming from the 
scientific community and academia have done a tremendous job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois also cannot help but welcome, as my colleague 
from Québec said, the budget increases for research and 
development. We think that this bill is innovative in many 
regards, particularly with regard to ethical discussions that 
promote a multidisciplinary approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The governing council will have enough freedom to adapt easily 
and quickly to the constant changes in the area of research, 
which are occurring at an ever increasing pace, due to 
innovation. The legislation required should not provide a very 
rigid framework but some room for manoeuvre, and we should trust 
the Canadian leading experts who did a tremendous job in that 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At long last, the government is acting to increase its 
investments in research and development, as the OCDE had been 
asking since 1993. However, as I explained earlier, the Liberal 
government is ignoring provincial jurisdictions; it wants to 
intrude in these jurisdictions, not only in Quebec but also in 
all the provinces of Canada. We are simply asking the government 
to comply with section 92 of the Constitution of Canada, which 
deals with power sharing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleagues from Québec and Hochelaga—Maisonneuve said 
earlier, this bill has forgotten provinces by not recognizing 
their authority in their own jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1867, it was easy to leave health to the provinces because it 
was an expensive area which did not bring in any money. Today, 
now that health has become a priority for the public, the federal 
wants to come back. We are only asking that it comply with the 
constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this bill, the role of the provinces is being reduced to 
that of mere actors, like any other stakeholder. The 
provinces—and I repeat it for the Liberals, who unfortunately 
tend to forget it—have a specific jurisdiction in the area of 
health, yet they are treated like any other health organization 
or stakeholder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of health research institutes is not the problem. 
The Bloc supports the increase in funding for research and the 
establishment of health research institutes. However, Canada does 
not invest enough in research and we ought to invest more if we 
want to remain competitive and be leaders in research and 
development.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to underline the excellent performance, both in medicine 
and research, of the University of Sherbrooke, which made a 
clean-sweep of all Canadian first awards in the medical area. It 
must be recognized that, in medicine as well as in research, 
Canada and Quebec are doing pretty well. But we must make sure 
that the necessary financial resources are made available, 
because the human resources necessary to carry on are already 
available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, the problem is the serious risk of direct encroachment on 
provincial jurisdiction in the area of health services to the 
population, without any consultation with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the establishment of the Canadian institutes of health 
research, the federal government is clearly grabbing the power to 
impose its priorities and views in health matters and is going 
well beyond the area of research. It is imperative for the 
government to respect the specific expertise and strengths of the 
research scientists in each region, to allow them to use their 
skills in their area of expertise and to be as successful as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the Bloc Quebecois has moved a series of amendments 
whose purpose is to reaffirm the primacy of the provincial 
jurisdiction in health matters; it also stresses the importance 
of respecting the jurisdictions. Many organizations in Quebec 
applied for grants to the interim council of the Canadian 
institutes of health research, and it is extremely important that 
Quebec get its fair share of research and development funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must be on the leading edge in these areas to move ahead into 
the 21st century and to ensure the growth and economic 
development of Quebec and Canada. The federal government must 
address the problem of the inadequate funding of research, by 
making more funds available to research scientists and academics 
to allow them to complete their work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, in the Bloc Quebecois, have said repeatedly that we support 
the idea of new investments in research and development and we 
want even more such investments. But there is one thing we cannot 
accept, and that is the establishment of Canada-wide standards 
and the infringement on provincial jurisdictions. If the federal 
government wants to interfere in provincial matters, it is 
imperative and necessary that the provinces be fully involved in 
the selection and management of the institutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government claims that it wants to promote the health of 
Canadians, but one must not forget that, in the past, it cut 
transfer payments to provinces for health, education and social 
services, but mostly for health. We agree that investment in 
research is important, but let us not forget that a lot of money 
has been brutally and irresponsibly taken from the provinces. 
That funding must be restored to them immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says it is reinvesting in health services offered 
by the provinces—I do not want to talk about the billions and 
billions of dollars bandied about, because the public has 
difficulty understanding the full scope of the cuts that were 
made. I will put it this way: it is as if $100 worth of cuts were 
made or will be made, but then we were told “We will give you 
back $20 and we will cut only $80”. And we are supposed to be 
happy because we got back $20 on the $100 that were cut without 
our permission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot let the federal government invade provincial 
jurisdictions again, and we cannot continue to ignore the cuts to 
transfer payments that are causing very serious problems in the 
area of health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the House will pass the amendments moved by the Bloc 
Quebecois so that our researchers and scholars will have access 
to the funds they need so much and that, I repeat, in conclusion, 
provincial jurisdictions will be not be invaded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I must inform the House that the Chair made

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to be here, 
even if it interferes with my presence at the Standing Committee 
on Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I basically want to remind the House of the gist of our 
amendments in Group No. 2. The hon. parliamentary secretary and 
member for Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies knows that what we want 
first is that the provinces be closely involved in the 
development and implementation of Canadian Institutes of Health 
Research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois, a responsible opposition party intent on 
continuing to be responsible, is aware that the research 
community needs money, and significant amounts of money at that.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no qualms about acknowledging the injection of an 
additional $500 million, which will be available starting next 
year, for the creation of the Canadian Institutes of Health 
Research, which, as we know, will be virtual institutes. So, the 
money will not be invested in buildings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that the health minister underlines the 
importance of having the researchers connect through a network, 
like the OCDE said it should be, and we agree, but the bill 
provides for an extreme centralization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister talks about institutes of health research, plural, 
but since there is only one governing council, we should speak 
instead of a single Canadian institute of health research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is so centralizing that the president and the 
chairperson of the governing council are one and the same. Just 
imagine if, in Quebec, at the baseball division of the Régie des 
installation olympiques—I take that example because of your 
athletic dispositions and your love of baseball—there were a 
president and a chairperson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We asked the parliamentary secretary and the minister why it had 
to be the same person. In large public organizations, centralized 
or decentralized, the principle of checks and balances is 
considered essential, which means that there is a director 
general and a chairperson of the board who are not one and the 
same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that research is an area that evolves rapidly. We want 
the scientists to be networked, to be linked together in 
networks. But why not involve the provinces in the definition of 
the health research institutes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are proposing an amendment to make this possible both at the 
governing council level and in the various advisory committees. 
We did the same thing when the Canada Labour Code was reviewed, 
and we also have the preliminary version of the code. 
My colleague, the hon. member for Laurentides, will deal with 
the present bill.  But a few years ago, when the government 
chose to amend Part III of the Canada Labour Code, we also 
tabled an amendment in order to enable the Canada Labour 
Relations Board to take inspiration from lists proposed by the 
provinces.  We have done exactly the same thing here.  We 
brought in an amendment asking the minister “Why not take 
inspiration from proposals made by the provinces?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jean Rochon, the minister of scientific development, who 
everyone knows is a great friend of the hon. member for Québec, 
is in the process of bringing in a science policy.  This policy 
establishes directions to be given developmental priority for 
health research in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are these areas of priority?  Genomics and heredity. The 
hon. member for Jonquière, who can at the very least be described 
as a woman of determination, is working hard to get an institute 
facility in her region, because a pool of researchers, with their 
expertise and knowledge, are concentrated there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only must there be recognition of the strengths of Quebec as 
far as genomics and heredity are concerned, but there is also 
much expertise relating to cancer, and AIDS as well.  Quebec is 
home to some of the most highly reputed researchers in the fields 
of AIDs and virology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are saying to this government is “If it is your 
objective to create linkages so that the various researchers can 
interact in the spirit of complementarity and 
multidisciplinarity, you stand to gain by consulting the 
provinces”.  That is the type of amendment we presented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people came to us saying “Please ensure that the 
$500 million to be made available is going to really go to 
research”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result of this bill will be to abolish the Medical Research 
Council of Canada.  I would have liked the parliamentary 
secretary to be here listening—I am sure he will agree with me. 
Once the Medical Research Council of Canada is abolished, we must 
make sure that the administration costs that fall to the Canadian 
institutes of health research under the new structure do not 
exceed 5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think it would be wrong for the administration costs to be 
10%, 15% or 20%.  We would not agree with that.  I hope that this 
amendment will meet with the approval of government members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one problem.  Perhaps the hon. member for Québec would 
give us a little smile.  There is one problem and it is as 
follows.  There are 13 references to the health care system in 
the bill.  We are prepared to admit that research is an area of 
shared jurisdiction.  The federal government has invested in the 
research sector since the early 1990s; in fact, its involvement 
goes back to something like 1910 or 1915 and, with a few notable 
exceptions, there are very few parliamentarians who were around 
back then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health care sector, however, does not come under federal 
jurisdiction.  We have some concerns that the bill as now worded, 
with its references to the health care system, will be a way for 
the federal government to get its foot in the door of 
jurisdictions where it has no business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why, very candidly and in a spirit of clarity, we moved 
an amendment asking the government to specify that the health 
care system does not come under its jurisdiction. The 
government's determination borders on the obsessive and will make 
it look rather narrow minded if it does not support our 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I still have hopes that the parliamentary secretary, who has a 
huge influence within the government, will manage to convince the 
Minister of Health, a future leadership contender, to support our 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a major bone of contention, so much so that the Quebec 
Minister of Health, Mrs. Marois, and her colleague, Mr. Rochon, 
took the time to write to the federal health minister to express 
their concerns. I tabled a copy of that letter in committee. I 
will be pleased to circulate it if some hon. members are 
interested in reading it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I have little time left, let me say that we support health 
research. We believe it is important that researchers be part of 
a network. We also believe that this bill cannot be part of a 
nation building process. It must not be the excuse for the 
federal government to try to get involved in health, particularly 
in the health care system and in the procurement of equipment at 
points of service, two areas which come under provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government—and I will conclude on this note—supports 
our amendments, which are very reasonable and certainly not out 
of line, we would be compelled to rise, at report stage and at 
third reading, to support this bill, which has some merits, but 
which appears to promote federal hegemony somewhat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite hon. members to make sure that the government supports 
the amendments proposed by the Bloc Quebecois. We worked hard in 
committee, we showed up consistently, we heard witnesses and we 
are very qualified to talk about Quebec's interests. We know that 
researchers want this bill passed and we are prepared to support 
it, as long as it respects Quebec's jurisdictions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to address this bill at 
report stage.  Health care is not my area of expertise.  However, 
I have some concerns that I want to raise at this time.  As 
Reformers, we are basically supporting the measures that the 
government is putting forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset, let me state that the devil is in the details. 
Health care research can have tremendous benefits.  It can 
alleviate a lot of suffering.  We do not deny that and that makes 
it absolutely essential that we explore the area of health care 
research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can save a lot of money in health care spending by doing 
research in the proper areas and, therefore, adjusting our health 
care system accordingly.  We need to use public money much more 
efficiently.  However, if there is not a balance in the way the 
money is administered, the effectiveness of that money will be 
diminished.  That must be obvious to all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel that there is a bias in Canada today in the medical 
establishment and in health care research.  We can have all of 
the best intentions in the world, as are outlined in this bill, 
and we can make all of the best amendments, as we have tried to 
put forward, and we agree with a lot of them, but if a bias 
exists in the administration of those funds we do a disservice to 
Canadians.  That is what I mean by the devil is in the details. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, we see in Canada a heavy emphasis on research into 
the effectiveness of drugs and other very intrusive procedures in 
the handling of health care problems when there is a lot of 
evidence to indicate that there are very effective alternatives. 
That is why I feel, when we look at this bill, that we have to 
ensure that all of these concerns which Canadians have are 
addressed.  Research should not exclude the exploration of these 
other areas.  We need protection in this bill to ensure that 
happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our health minister made the statement that our health care 
system needs more than just money to fix it.  I could not agree 
more.  However, he then went on to condemn the provinces which 
explore alternative means of doing just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the concerns I have is with the group of people who will 
be administering these health care research funds.  Who will be 
on the selection committee?  How will we ensure that there is a 
balance, that we do not have just the so-called traditional 
experts, that we have people who represent all parts of society 
and all of the concerns which people have? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the intent of the CIHR is to foster scientific research 
and promote Canadian initiatives, there has been little time to 
consult various scientific communities and other communities 
which have a great interest in this to receive input as to the 
scope and area of research.  For example, will the applicants 
themselves direct the bulk of the research or will the nature of 
research be directed by advisory boards and force applicants to 
apply for funding in areas dictated by the central body?  That is 
what I mean by getting down to the details. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the CIHR will strive to ensure that only 4% to 5% of 
the total budget will be spent on administrative costs, a new 
institute will require a bureaucratic infrastructure to perform 
necessary functions.  Can the CIHR avoid the trend of having a 
huge part of its budget administered for bureaucracy and not have 
sufficient funds to administer the actual research which is 
dictated under its mandate?  Given the wide scope of its mandate, 
and it is very broad, will the initial budgetary expenditures be 
sufficient to carry out its entire mandate?  If not, will 
parliament be required to allocate additional funds for the 
creation of the institute? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president of the CIHR will make recommendations to the 
governor in council as to who should be appointed to the advisory 
council.  The president will make recommendations based on public 
selection processes.  However, will the president follow the 
advice of the public selection process or will he bypass these 
recommendations and appoint members of individual choice?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said, there are many good parts to this bill.  It 
appears to be an excellent model of an institute which will 
remain at arm's length from the federal government and conduct 
research independent of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consultation process for appointments will draw on leading 
experts from every conceivable field of expertise, and I hope 
that remains the case.  That should reduce the influence of high 
ranking government officials.  However, that sometimes is eroded 
over time and we have to ensure that does not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These and all of the above-mentioned details can be addressed 
before the committee when the bill reaches that stage.  There is 
a strong need to consult all of the health care communities and 
all of the people who have an interest in this research.  We need 
their input into this whole area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We basically support the direction of the bill, but we would 
hope that the government would take our concerns into account.  I 
could give examples of some of the areas in which we have made 
huge mistakes by not looking at all areas of health care which 
need to have research.  Sometimes, because of political 
correctness, we exclude some of those areas. 
<P><A NAME="LINK83"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, for the record, we support the establishment of the 
Canadian institutes of health research.  Listening carefully to 
the previous speakers, most parties support this bill, but not 
without reservation.  The reason for this is the cynical use of 
politics which the Prime Minister has displayed in recent years 
with regard to health care.  It makes many of us nervous, 
especially if we look at the budget which was recently brought 
down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I read the budget and listened to the Minister of Finance 
introduce it, the first thing that came to my mind was that it 
was not an election budget.  Why?  Because health care was the 
missing equation in the budget with the paltry $2.5 billion over 
the next three years that was committed, which will be split 
between health care and education.  That will mean that most 
provinces will get enough out of the new budget to run their 
systems for an average of two or three days a year for the next 
three years.  The Liberals just simply paid lip service to health 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to the issue before us, I have some problems with 
the establishment of the institutes.  One of my problems is the 
cynicism which we see in the Prime Minister's approach to health 
care.  He has created a problem and he knows full well that he 
has the capacity to fix it.  He probably will, just slightly 
before the next election, probably on the eve of the next 
election, which is rumoured today to be called for October 16. 
We can expect some recurring announcements in the health care 
field between now and the end of the summer.  The Prime Minister 
has created the crisis and now he is going to employ 
Machiavellian politics to fix that very crisis to make himself 
popular.  I do not think it is going to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a problem with the construction of the institutes.  For 
starters, all of the appointments will be made by the Prime 
Minister.  At page 6 of the bill, line 21 states:  “The 
President of the CIHR shall be appointed by the Governor in 
Council—”.  What does the term governor in council imply?  It 
simply means that the Prime Minister, along with the cabinet, 
will appoint the president. 
What it boils down to is that I do not trust the Prime Minister 
to make these appointments.  I do not think any of the other 
party members on this side of the House do either.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interesting thing is that the governing council, of which 
there will be no more than 20 members, will again be appointed by 
the Prime Minister of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the amendments that we have put forth in this bill 
address that very concern.  We think these changes are necessary 
to the bill and will result in the Prime Minister consulting the 
health community before these very appointments are made.  We 
actually defined in my amendments what we mean by the health 
community.  I think we have to get away from one man determining 
how this institute will be set up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things I mentioned in committee was that this is not 
new in terms of what other countries in the rest of the world 
have done with institutes like this in the past.  In fact, this 
is modelled after the U.S. example.  The biggest difference in 
the U.S. example is that the president of the United States does 
not appoint the president of the institute, nor does he appoint 
the members of the institute, that is the governing council. That 
is a very important point and I am glad the member picked up on 
that.  The United States operates under a different system.  What 
it has effectively done is depoliticize the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see that done in this bill but the government 
will probably just give short heed to the amendments on the floor 
that would actually change the way this committee is structured 
and the way it is set up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing is the fact that once this body is established, 
we have no idea how many institutes there will be.  We do know 
there will be virtual institutes but we have no idea how many 
there will be and what they will be. There is no indication in 
the bill what the government is considering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think what the Canadian people are demanding today is 
transparency in everything.  What we would expect as opposition 
members is to see some openness in the selection process so that 
we in the House can have some input and that the medical 
community can have some input.  There is no evidence of that in 
the bill.  I would say that is the essential flaw in this piece 
of legislation before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do favour the replacement of the Medical Research Council 
with this institute.  However, if we are going to make a change, 
let us make a change that will work to the benefit of the health 
community.  I believe the health community and the health care 
system in this country have suffered greatly under this 
administration, going back some seven years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you were sitting in that chair when the government 
took the biggest cut ever from the health care budget at the 
expense of every single person in Canada.  Now we have a health 
care system that is under siege because of the neglect by the 
government.  Now we will see the use of what I call Machiavellian 
politics in the next short number of months to fix a system that 
the government broke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What it really boils down to is that I do not trust the Prime 
Minister hand-picking who will sit on these institutes and then 
exerting influence on what institutes will be established and how 
the governing council will function. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is open to some debate within the House.  I would 
love to hear some of the other members address those very 
concerns over the next few minutes. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK84"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first, I 
want to say that three words summarize today's debate: 
encroachment, encroachment and encroachment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And the government is encroaching in a particularly iniquitous 
way because we all know the very serious problem cuts to transfer 
payments have created for the provinces.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue has been discussed at length in Quebec. Quebecers did 
not realize that the problem is as acute in other provinces. We 
have seen a whole series of absurdities. Believe it or not, 
people from Saint-Jean have to go to Plattsburgh to get 
treatment, and this costs Canadian taxpayers a bundle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So much so that the hospital in Plattsburgh has just bought very 
sophisticated equipment because of the large number of Quebecers 
who are going for treatment to the United States. All this 
because the government decided, a few years ago, to cut transfers 
to provinces, including Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The shortfall for last year was $1.7 billion, a tidy sum. 
Members can understand why the Government of Quebec found it so 
hard to achieve zero deficit while, at the same time, managing a 
health care system where demand is rising while funding is 
dropping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to see how the government is feathering its nest, 
because that is just what it is doing. The Minister of Finance 
talked about a potential surplus of $95 billion over five years, 
but according to our estimation it will be more like $130 billion 
over the same period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This surplus was accumulated by means of the Canada health and 
social transfer. The government has cut transfers to provinces, 
including Quebec, and by doing so it has created a terrible 
crisis for them. Waiting lists show how people are paying for 
this now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not forget that the government is feathering its nest 
even more with the employment insurance fund. 
It still has ultimate control over the unemployed, limiting 
access to the employment insurance plan. Today, only four out of 
ten workers have access to the plan; before the reform it used to 
be seven out of ten. While the government is paying out less to 
the unemployed, it is still taking in just as much from employees 
and employers. Not only will it not upgrade the plan, it will not 
adjust it so that benefits are equivalent to the period worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is still feathering its nest, putting more money 
aside and, when it sees fit, it uses that money to encroach on 
areas of provincial jurisdiction. I do not know whether the 
premiers of the other provinces are listening to us today, but I 
believe that with the signing of the social union such federal 
encroachments on provincial jurisdiction are going to increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that Quebec did not sign this agreement, 
precisely to protect its jurisdiction over health care. Normally 
in Canada, under the Constitution, everything social is a 
provincial responsibility, but often things are called a 
different name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, with regard to the bill before us today, the name 
used is health research institutes; the government says it is not 
necessarily about health, but really about virtual research, or 
some other kind of research. There has been no consultation with 
the provinces. In fact, the amendments proposed by the Bloc 
Quebecois are aimed at remedying this. We want the provinces and 
Quebec to be consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the health research institutes? In 2001-2002, $500 
million will be invested in these institutes. 
When we look at how research and development are evolving in 
Canada, we see that we have big problems. When it comes to 
research and development in Canada, Quebec is at a disadvantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I often indicate that Quebecers represent 25% of the 
government's tax base. In the Outaouais region, let us not talk 
about institutes of health research but only about research 
centres; they are 43 of them, 42 on the Ottawa side, one of the 
Hull side. And yet, Quebecers foot 25% of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to research, we must also see all the economic 
benefits of a research centre, of an institute of health 
research. This is important. First, these are highly paid jobs; 
second, these research centres award a lot of contracts and 
subcontracts. A lot of people will be supplying the research 
centre, and that creates jobs. This is the new economy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the way the money has been distributed for 
several years, even several decades, Quebec is always on the 
short end of the stick. I have the statistics with me. They prove 
that as far as research and development is concerned, Quebec 
receives only 14% of the money. We are paying 25%, but we are 
receiving only 14%. Is the same thing going to happen with the 
institutes of health research? Are we going to pay 25% of the 
bill and let Ontario reap the benefits? That is more or less how 
things stand, right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it Liberal ridings that are going to benefit from the 
institutes of health research? We know about the scandal at Human 
Resources Development Canada. 
Is the Liberal government not inclined to say “We have done all 
the necessary studies. First, it so happens that, in Quebec, you 
will not get 25% of the institutes. Second, those you will get 
will just happen to be in Liberal ridings”? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might get two or three research institutes in 
Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies. Unfortunately, as usual, Saint-Jean 
will end up empty-handed. These issues are a big concern to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the amendments put forward by the Bloc Quebecois say 
two things: yes to research, because we think it is important, 
and no to interference in a provincial jurisdiction  Quebec is 
proud of. I say hats off to the Government of Quebec. Mr. Landry 
just brought down an excellent budget. Finally, he is able to 
reinject money in health, and this is also due to the economy. If 
we had been in a recession, Mr. Landry would have had a hard time 
reinjecting money in the health system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government did not do it. Mr. Landry just reinjected 
in the health system 14 times more than the federal government; 
in the field of education, Mr. Landry just gave 7 times more than 
the federal government to education in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that Quebecers know these facts. Before the 
Government of Quebec's budget was brought down, I had said that 
the Minister of Finance's budget, here in Ottawa, came up short 
and gave nothing to Quebec, and that Quebecers should now get 
used to the idea that they have to rely on only one government as 
far as health and education are concerned, and that is the 
Government of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has missed an opportunity to redress the 
severe injustices I was talking about earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this boils down to one single thing: encroachment, 
encroachment, encroachment. It is not too late to do the right 
thing. They only have to support the amendments put forward by 
the Bloc Quebecois and say “Yes to research, we think it is 
important. However, we agree that this is under provincial 
jurisdiction, so we will consult the provinces”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is roughly what the Bloc amendments are all about. We do 
not oppose the research aspect of it, for all the reasons I have 
just given. Within the federal system, we know that the 
government is the one that has the money, it collects the money 
from the taxpayers and never gives any of that money back. With 
it, it pays part of the debt, and by going half and half in new 
programs that encroach on provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that this is the best way to manage money. We 
have always been against duplication, overlapping and 
encroachments. It would certainly be more cost effective to 
respect jurisdictions, to stop assigning an army of public 
servants to deal with matters that are already being dealt with 
by the other, to stop treading on each other's toes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge my colleagues to vote in favour of the amendments put 
forward by the Bloc Quebecois. To sum up, as I said earlier, we 
say yes to research, but no to encroachment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great concern that I heard my colleague talk about the 
distribution of funds in Canada. I would like to remind him of 
two things: equality and fairness. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1130"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT18"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT18"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1130

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to look at the way the government spends 
Canadian tax dollars in our society. Those two elements both have 
to be taken into account as a priority every time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of equality suggests that the Canadian government must 
treat all Canadians in the same way. In the case of the research 
institutes in the bill before the House, when the government 
starts hiring people to work in these institutes, it should try 
to find those people who have the most talent and who are best 
able to serve these organizations and Canadian interests, no 
matter where they live in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should not even be mentioned that one candidate is from Nova 
Scotia, another from the Lac Saint-Jean area, another from the 
Ottawa area or another from British Columbia. Each application 
should be judged on its own merit, and the person who is best 
qualified should be hired to do the job. All Canadians are equal 
before the law and they must be treated equally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, my colleague touched on the subject of fairness. Of 
course, we have look at the regions of Canada where people need 
help from the government. For example, in the case of HRDC 
programs, people in certain ridings, such as mine, 
do not benefit from these programs. 
We did not ask the government for the riding of Ottawa Centre to 
get more money from DHRC because assistance was provided to some 
other riding in Quebec or British Columbia. I have no right to 
ask for that as a member of parliament, because I have to take 
into account the issue of equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our region, the unemployment rate is under 10%. Therefore, we 
do not qualify. However, if some of my colleagues' ridings need 
these programs, it is the federal government's responsibility to 
help these ridings and regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague knows very well that most of the ridings in the 
province of Quebec, for example, received much more money from 
Human Resources Development Canada than others in Ontario, 
because this government wants to ensure that every region that 
needs help and qualifies for it receives it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must always look at things objectively, not only in a 
subjective way. That is why I say that my colleague was wrong to 
say that this is how things should always be done, with a 
province that gives 25% of the taxes it collected to the federal 
government getting 25% of benefits. Unfortunately, it does not 
always work like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like it to work. We hope that, someday, in our society, 
every Canadian will have equal opportunities and equal 
responsibilities, which would mean having the same tax rates and 
the same level of service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way our Confederation works, the government takes from those 
who have and gives to those who have not. The federal government 
has a responsibility to act like a reasonable mother or father. 
When a region of Canada is in need, it is our responsibility to 
provide assistance.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a bit annoyed when my colleague said that here, in the 
capital region, there will be a research institute on the 
Ontario side and not on the Quebec side. I want to point out to 
my colleague that there is no discrimination in this region. 
There are often agencies located on either side of the river 
where people go to work, and these people are Canadians from 
Quebec or from Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not make any difference here, in this region. This 
region is a model for the rest of the country. This is the 
national capital region, where all people are equal before the 
law, where all people know full well that we have a model 
capital and a model centre, and that we are proud to be citizens 
of this capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless of where the research institute will be located, 
whether on the other side or this side of the river—I would be 
delighted if it were located in Aylmer or Gatineau—but wherever 
it is located, what matters the most to us is to have such an 
institute and that it does the work we hope and trust it will 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue my colleague raised earlier is the jurisdiction 
issue. I am proud to say that this government is meeting these 
demands and needs to clarify the jurisdiction issue. I am told 
that one of my colleagues will meet this need to really clarify 
the jurisdiction issue. Later, we will dot the <I>i</I>s and cross the 
<I>t</I>s, confirming that the provinces will continue to assume their 
jurisdictional responsibilities and the government should 
continue to do what it has been doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that this government listens and responds. I look forward 
to my colleague, the parliamentary secretary, to meet these needs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK86"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to follow my colleague from the government party. The hon. 
member said that it is not always possible to get back 25% of 
the taxes contributed and he added that, in some cases, it can 
be pretty difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the research centres in the Outaouais region, we 
see that the score is 43-0, that all the research centres are 
located in Ontario, and not one in the Outaouais region, none—the 
last one closed only three months ago. We get far less than 25% 
of what we pay in taxes in different areas under the 
jurisdiction of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not digress too much from today's debate, which deals 
with the virtual research centres that would be created with a 
budget increase of $500 million over three years. 
The Bloc Quebecois is all in favour of this $500 million 
investment and it supports the efforts made by researchers to 
develop a bill providing for the networking of universities, 
researchers and individuals concerned with health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This social issue forces us to satisfy the much more acute needs 
of an ageing population. For instance, because of new diseases, 
research must be at the leading edge in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the problem. Today, the Bloc Quebecois proposed 
amendments to bill that would give the federal government powers 
over health matters. The federal government has a propensity to 
centralize, and to interfere in provincial jurisdictions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has a tendency to reduce the Canada health and 
social transfer to the provinces and to invest in health, 
education and income security. This morning, we are dealing with 
health. All the provinces, Quebec included, have been 
short-changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Government of Quebec, the shortfall since 1993, when the 
government took office, stands at $3.8 billion. This government 
has a tendency to reduce the financial assistance to the 
provinces, and this has put them in a bind in terms of the 
services they provide to the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that we have excellent researchers and research centres 
in Quebec and Canada. 
We are not questioning that. We know we have an international 
reputation. In Quebec, we have a reputation for cancer, mental 
health and genetic research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is essential that the procedures for the designation of the 
institutions take into consideration the strengths and expertise 
in provinces. We represent Quebec. It is essential that the 
provinces be there to assist their researchers and be involved 
in the designation of these institutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill, as worded, leaves a minimal role for the provinces. 
That are on the same standing as other stakeholders in the area 
of health. We have brought forward amendments that I think are 
reasonable and realistic. 
If the government wants to work with us, if it recognizes the 
jurisdiction of the provinces in that area and gives it 
priority, then it should just say so in the bill to show its 
willingness to recognize the provinces, but not with words like 
the ones we find in the preamble to this bill, which reads as 
follows: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas Parliament recognizes the role of the provinces in 
health care and that the Government of Canada collaborates with 
provincial governments to support the health care system and 
health research; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want the federal government to support the health care 
system. This preamble should talk about support for research. If 
we give the federal government responsibility for supporting the 
health care system, we know what that means. 
It means that it will interfere and play a centralizing role by 
imposing nationwide standards that will not take provincial 
priorities into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that some provinces have certain research and 
development priorities. Quebec may want to be a leader in 
certain types of research, and Ontario may want to favour other 
types of research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is always dangerous to want to impose standards that would 
cripple the ability of certain provinces to get grants. The 
wording of certain paragraphs is too diluted and undermines the 
importance of the provinces by putting them on an equal footing 
with other stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government wants to consult with the provinces and with 
persons and organizations, and not to consult in agreement with 
the provinces. 
This bill should fully involve the provinces in all the 
decisions made by the universities and the researchers. We might 
think today that we are doing a fine thing by passing Bill C-13, 
but in the long run, it could very well turn out to be 
detrimental to provincial jurisdiction over health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is being called to order. Certain quotes 
are really based on social union, establishing that only 
provinces would be consulted. The government's will to recognize 
provincial jurisdiction over health has to go further than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the Bloc Quebecois really based its amendments on. 
The Bloc Quebecois is not happy with the provinces' role in 
social services. I am sure that there are other opposition 
parties that are not happy with the wording of the bill either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preamble should have read as follows “Whereas Parliament 
recognizes the full jurisdiction of the provinces over health 
services” and not “recognizes the role of the provinces in 
health care”. Their full jurisdiction has to be recognized and 
this is the purpose of one of the amendments moved by the Bloc 
Quebecois.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government agrees with provincial jurisdictions, 
all it has to do is say so in this bill. It can show that it is 
willing to recognize provincial jurisdictions. We all know that 
the federal government is trying to nibble away at them. This is 
why we have seen the government withdraw huge amounts from the 
employment insurance fund, for example, gaining considerable 
financial leeway while reducing the provinces' financial leeway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is like treating the provinces like children. This will 
prevent them from responding to the urgent needs of the 
population in health, education and income security. These areas 
are much too important to let the government have its way. If we 
let the provinces be weakened, they will not have enough money 
to allow their institutions to provide good service to the 
population, the day the federal government decided to stop 
supporting social measures and compassionate measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is often praised for its vision and for looking after all 
social policies. The leeway the provinces now have is very 
important for them. Our actions of today should not be viewed as 
a refusal to support research institutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The stakes are crucial for the future. 
We know that we are falling behind in health research and 
development funding and we recognize that the federal government 
has a role to play in that funding. We also recognize that the 
federal government wants to establish institutes, to set up 
networks between universities and scientists. However, we do not 
support the management role the federal government wants for 
itself. It is clear it wants to stick its nose in the provinces' 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former President of the Treasury Board said “When Bouchard, 
in Quebec City, has cut everywhere in social programs, health 
and education, we, in the federal government, will show the 
population how we care about the social security net. We will be 
the leaders in those areas”.

contained in the amendments proposed by the Bloc.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
gives me great pleasure to debate Bill C-13.  I am from London 
West.  London is a city that has many medical research centres, 
wonderful researchers and 22,000 people who work directly or 
indirectly in the health community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to go back to basics.  This legislation is about Canada 
in the 21st century, talking and learning about health.  The 
Prime Minister said that we are in a global race where national 
vision is essential, where global thinking is a must.  In a 
changing world where new health challenges are emerging we have 
to do more than just keeping pace.  Canadians must lead in the 
global knowledge economy, in the marketplace of ideas.  This is 
about ideas concerning health and the value for Canadians. Health 
research is an area where Canada can not only do its work but can 
excel at its work, provided the conditions are right to cultivate 
the strengths in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically Canadians have done very well.  They are in the 
forefront of health discoveries and advances throughout the 
world.  I remind the House that Canadian research generates more 
scholarly citations per dollar spent than that of any other 
country in the world.  Canadian research ranks fourth in the 
world in terms of academic publications per capita ahead of both 
the United Kingdom and surprisingly the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have broken new ground, creating the kind of knowledge 
and understanding that has improved the health and well-being of 
people the world over.  In other words, there are no geographic 
boundaries when we discover things and we share them with those 
who need to have this understanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Groundbreaking work has been done by the likes of Nobel laureate 
Dr. Michael Smith in the field of genetics, on the anti-cancer 
drug of Dr. Charles Thomas Beer, and by the new generation of 
geneticists and biotech pioneers.  This is but a few of the 
researchers who have put Canada on the health research map.  They 
are numerous in my riding.  I would like to name them all but 
that would be unfair because I would probably leave out some 
young new researcher whom we are trying to attract and let 
flourish in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada stands in the forefront of the development of new 
research approaches which examine areas of complex less obvious 
factors that determine health.  We are indebted to the pioneers 
like doctors Evans, Hertzman and Stoddart for their work in 
identifying why some populations have a lower incidence of 
disease, regardless of their access to medical care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every day in Canada researchers are at work in our communities, 
universities, hospitals and research labs taking on diverse 
challenges.  Every day we fight disease and help unlock the 
mysteries of health.  Every day we are working to help Canadians 
keep healthy and ensuring that when they need care it is 
delivered in the best possible way thanks to innovative 
methodologies and approaches in health services and research that 
improve our health care system.  The government applauds this as 
I am sure all opposition members do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the creation of the CIHR and the substantial new 
investments in health research we want to ensure that Canadian 
research talent has the necessary tools to be among the top tier 
in the world. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1155"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is impossible to speak about what the CIHR will do and how it 
will do it without acknowledging the stellar work that has been 
done by members of the interim governing council.  In an 
extremely short period of time they have brought together the 
entire health research community across the country to put 
forward the vision that is embodied in the CIHR. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In guiding and shaping this initiative they have ensured that 
the CIHR is an organization in which all health researchers feel 
they have a stake and in which all researchers feel that their 
views have been taken into consideration.  They applied and will 
continue to apply the same standards of excellence to the 
creation of the CIHR as they have toward their own research that 
has always been peer reviewed.  It is a considerable 
accomplishment and one that deserves our appreciation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CIHR will literally change the way we fund and organize 
health research in Canada.  It has virtual institutes and CIHR 
will focus on the critical health issues affecting Canadians. 
CIHR institutes will identify specific research themes or areas 
of focus, attracting the brightest research minds in Canada to 
work together in various communities to address specific health 
research priorities and gain new knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These virtual networks will link our researchers, our research 
funders and research users with their colleagues in different 
institutions, different disciplines and different areas of the 
country.  It is not a parochial vision.  It is one on which we 
are united across the country.  Institutes will be the key 
mechanism by which the CIHR engages some of the most creative 
minds in Canada to address the specific health research 
priorities of Canadians and to improve understanding and 
knowledge.  Each institute will have a separate advisory board, 
giving people an opportunity to help shape the research agenda 
and priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, CIHR will unite the four themes of health research.  I 
would like to review these areas: biomedical research, clinical 
research, research in health systems and services, and research 
into the determinants of health which have for too long operated 
in isolation in their separate spheres, depriving us of the 
benefits that come from collaboration and the shared approach we 
get with common problems and common initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bringing all areas of health research together in this way will 
result in a multi-disciplinary approach to health issues. 
Researchers from each area will work with their colleagues from 
other areas, sharing ideas and insights on a regular basis.  The 
very perspectives to which they are exposed will strengthen the 
work of researchers in all disciplines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CIHR will now break down the old barriers and open up new 
opportunities.  The result will be an accelerated discovery of 
cures and treatments and a deeper understanding of the complex 
factors which influence health.  This integration will help 
ensure that we are receiving the best possible value for health 
care dollars.  More research dollars spent more effectively is 
the pledge of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third difference that the CIHR is about is the breadth of 
its mandate.  One of the objectives of the CIHR sets out 
explicitly in its mandate not only to fund excellent research but 
to ensure that the knowledge gained as a result of this research 
is shared widely, adopted and applied.  Research knowledge will 
be translated more directly into better health care and better 
health products with the ultimate achievement being improved 
better health of Canadians.  Who could argue with that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CIHR will also help to ensure that the health and economic 
benefits of Canadian research are realized right here in Canada. 
In the past Canadian researchers have watched as the world class 
knowledge and insight generated in this country with our brains 
and talent have been taken up and developed into useful products 
and services by companies elsewhere.  When we take the research 
process one step further the rewards will be clear: faster access 
to new treatment and products for Canadians, more jobs, and 
greater economic growth for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Achieving these goals requires significant and sustained 
investment.  This is happening.  The government is nearly 
doubling its contribution to health research over the next two 
years for a total budget of nearly $500 million.  In October the 
Minister of Health announced $65 million for the first year of 
CIHR programs.  This response has been positive but the kind of 
creative collaborative research proposals that are being put 
forward, proposals that would not have been possible before CIHR, 
demonstrate that the capacity exists to do much more.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth reason that CIHR will make such a large difference is 
that it will be a catalyst for change, improving not only the 
funding but also the management of the research process in this 
country.  In simple terms this means better co-ordination and a 
more effective use of research resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given our complexity today, the complexity of those who do the 
research, those who fund it and those who use the results, this 
move toward greater co-ordination and I must emphasize 
co-operation, is fundamental.  It is a major step forward. It 
will facilitate new partnerships and provide greater opportunity 
for the voluntary sector and other health partners to have a say 
in identifying and meeting the health priorities of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CIHR will build on our strength in the knowledge economy and 
contribute to the overall goal of enabling Canadians to succeed 
in the marketplace of ideas.  It will provide a strong ethical 
framework for health research in Canada. Ethics committees will 
help develop the standards and procedures to ensure that the 
interests of the most vulnerable are protected while funded 
research will examine new and emerging ethical considerations and 
issues.  These are important to Canadians and cannot be 
underestimated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next step is getting this legislation going including 
getting through all these amendments.  I know there are other 
members who wish to comment on these amendments and perhaps 
adjust them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that people in my riding and people across Canada will 
benefit.  We need the viewpoints of all stakeholders and members 
of the public.  We need all of their co-operation and hard work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank all members of the House who have worked toward 
this goal. We have all worked very hard to do this. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK90"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too would like to thank the 
members of the House of Commons for their hard work on this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Including the time the standing committee spent reviewing this 
very important bill, we have spent over 50 hours on it. During 
this time we were able to improve the bill in several respects, 
and through the work we are doing now, and the second group of 
amendments, we will improve it even further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a few minutes to talk about the amendments 
in the second group and, in particular, move two amendments, on 
behalf of the government, which are in keeping with the concerns 
expressed by several opposition members, including members from 
the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc members have stressed that the provinces have primary 
responsibility for health care and have insisted that it be made 
clear in the bill. We believe it was already very clear, but 
there are ways to improve on it as suggested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No.4, the amendment before us, will help reinforce the 
bill in terms of respecting or taking into account provincial 
responsibilities over health. 
This motion will amend the preamble to the bill. By virtue of 
being at the beginning of the bill, the amendment encompasses 
the whole bill and we will not have to pass 25 further 
amendments, since it will be made clear right from the 
beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this amendment, we say explicitly that: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—Parliament recognizes that the provinces are responsible for the 
delivery of health care to Canadians— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could not be clearer. Moreover “that the Government of Canada 
collaborates with provincial governments to support the health 
care system and health research”. This explicitly and clearly 
recognizes the role of the provinces in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only are we moving this first amendment, but we are adding a 
second one, to clause 4, which deals with the mission of the 
institutes. This amendment, Motion No. 16, answers the concerns 
of several members. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1205"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT25"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT25"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1205

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying that, to meet their objective of using research 
results to improve health and health services, the institutes 
will have to work in collaboration with the provincial 
governments, which are responsible for the delivery of health 
care to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are adding a new paragraph to make a clear distinction 
between the responsibility of the provinces and the 
collaboration that we will also have to get from voluntary 
organizations and the private sector, since it was an issue of 
concern for our colleagues opposite. They said that voluntary 
organizations and the provinces were all on an equal footing. 
We have rewritten that clause to make it very clear that the 
jurisdiction of the provinces will be recognized, with all that 
entails, and that there will also be some collaboration with the 
private sector and voluntary groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that these two amendments address the concerns we 
heard from the other side of the House. I would also like to 
make a few comments on certain amendments brought forward by the 
opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into that, since it is often said that the 
provinces were not consulted, I would like to mention the fact 
that the interim governing council that made the recommendations 
that led to Bill C-13 included three high calibre provincial 
representatives, namely Jeffrey Lozon, the Ontario deputy 
minister of health, Dr. Matthew Spence, from the Alberta 
Heritage Foundation for Medical Research, and, from Quebec, a 
distinguished researcher who is at the forefront of everything 
that has to do with health research, Dr. Michel Bureau, 
executive director of the Fonds de la recherche en santé du 
Québec. So the provinces' point of view was integrated into the 
whole process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about certain other amendments brought 
forward by the opposition. Some of them tend to restrict the 
scope of the research to be conducted by the institutes. Some 
amendments say that it should be restricted to medical research. 
For this bill, the government's view is that the institutes will 
be involved in health research in general, in all aspects of 
that field, and not be restricted to the medical aspects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also amendments dealing with the appointment processes 
for both the president and the members of the advisory boards. 
These processes were explained many times. There was very broad 
consultation and public notices were posted regarding the 
appointments to be made, whether for the presidents or the 
members of the advisory boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amendments were proposed regarding the president's mandate. We 
feel that a five year mandate is appropriate and we see no 
reason to change that provision. We also think that the 
president must be appointed at pleasure, which allows the 
minister and the government to review the appointment. 
This is standard procedure for governor in council appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other amendments had to do with accountability, either that of 
the president or that of the advisory boards. We think the bill 
is already clear enough regarding the relation between the CEO 
and the department or the Minister of Health. Each year, the 
Minister of Health and the Standing Committee on Health will 
receive a report from the institute, through its president. 
Committee members will be able to ask questions and to recommend 
to the minister and, therefore, to the institute, any change 
that may be important. Consequently, we do not need the proposed 
amendments, because they do not add anything to the substance of 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by proposing an amendment to the motion 
tabled by the hon. member for Mississauga South. 
Our colleague has just moved a motion calling for the act 
establishing the institutes to be reviewed, to be re-examined by 
parliament every five years.  I would like to move that 
parliament review the act once, after five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of 
my colleague's motion was for the review to take place every 
five years, and the intent of the amendment is 
for it to take place only once, at the end of the first five 
year period.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I move: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Motion No. 56 be amended as follows: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By replacing all of the words after the word “reviewed” with 
the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“after five years by Parliament.” 
</UL></UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that, with these amendments, the government is showing 
that it is totally attuned to the key concerns of our colleagues 
in the opposition, and to those of certain colleagues on the 
government side as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that it is appropriate to review this legislation at 
least once, after five years, so that we may be really 
comfortable with the way the research institutes will operate 
subsequently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand that it may take five years for learning and 
working out the kinks, and that a review may be required. 
Thereafter, there will be the annual reports, which may offer an 
opportunity for discussions and exchanges of views with all 
members of this House who are on the Standing Committee on 
Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for our first amendments, I believe they focus attention on a 
very significant effort to honour the provincial governments, to 
appreciate their contribution and collaboration and the research 
efforts carried out in each province, but also to try to 
properly preserve the general co-ordinating role assigned to the 
institutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  So 
that I have this clear, earlier we gave our unanimous consent to 
allow a colleague who was not in the House to move a motion. 
We were told that this motion essentially had to do with a 
review that would done by the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I understand his amendment, the parliamentary secretary wants 
to include both the House of Commons and the Senate, because he 
mentions parliament.  Is that the government's intention—to have 
the amendment moved by a member who was not present and to which 
we gave our consent a few moments ago cover not just the House 
of Commons but the Senate?  Will the parliamentary secretary 
tell me whether my understanding of his amendment is correct? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Just so that 
everybody is certain of what has taken place here, first the 
parliamentary secretary has moved an amendment to the motion 
before the House.  As such it is not required to have the 
unanimous consent of the House to move the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will try to explain the effect of the amendment on Motion No. 
56, as I understand it. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 56 provides that Bill C-13 be amended by adding a new 
clause whereby the act would be reviewed by a committee every 
five years.

the act after five years.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  This is trickery of the worst kind.  The member who moved 
the original motion came into the House on bended knee asking for 
our indulgence to allow him to move this amendment.  Just hear me 
out, Mr. Speaker.  I think other members will agree with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  No.  The point of 
point of order has to relate to the procedural relevance of what 
we have done, not the content.  We are not going to get into 
debate on the content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, you are going to get this 
side of the House in an agitated state simply because the 
procedure that they used was trickery of the worst kind, because 
we consented to the motion not knowing that there was going to be 
an amendment.  They were not honest enough to tell us that they 
were going to put an amendment to the motion.  The members were 
not here.  They have to be present in the House.  That is the 
procedure.  They were not here because the government has them 
out scurrying around doing numerous tasks— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  What has transpired 
has transpired.  If the members did not want to provide the 
opportunity earlier for that amendment to be put, the House had 
the opportunity at that time to deny unanimous consent.

Chair to get involved now.  What has been done has been done.

Without wishing to challenge your ruling, which are generally 
very well reasoned, I simply wish to ensure that we have a clear 
understanding of what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We gave our consent to an amendment moved by a colleague who was 
not here—and we admit that this can happen, we all have many 
obligations—and who wanted the act reviewed every five years by 
the House of Commons, and I repeat by the House of Commons, the 
House in which we are sitting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We gave our consent on that understanding. 
This is important, because the parliamentary secretary wants to 
make an amendment—which he is entitled to do—but he wants to 
change the content. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I understand, but it 
is not the role of the Chair to get involved in these 
negotiations.  If there are to be subsequent negotiations, then 
they need to be done by members behind the curtains.  It is not 
up to the Chair.  All the Chair can do is present motions.  It is 
up to the House to accept them or not to accept them.  The House 
accepted them.  What has been done has been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if I might help to clarify 
things, the only reason I seconded the motion was to get the 
mechanism to get to the amendment put just now by the 
government.

not get into debate on this.  I will hear one more point of order 
from the hon. member for Ottawa Centre.

New Brunswick did not mean to say what he said in the House 
earlier.  He used unparliamentary language, which he knows as an

pleasure of addressing Bill C-13 before and my friend, the hon.

even though the riding of Chambly, which I represent here, does 
not have research institutes as such, it may have some one day.

care about scientific research are pleased, in a way, to see 
that, at last, the federal government— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. An 
event has just happened in the House so serious I dare not 
describe it, but which I would like to bring to your attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament works marvelously well when members, House leaders, 
and politicians on all sides of the House come to an agreement 
behind the curtain so that things run as smoothly as possible in 
the House. This always involves giving our words as individuals 
and parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier today, the member for Mississauga South—after we refused 
to give consent to table a motion—came to my office to discuss 
the problem. I told him we could not give consent unless the 
motion provided that only the House of Commons could be on the 
reviewing committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He agreed, we struck a deal and he gave me his word he would 
amend his motion so that it would be acceptable to us. We came 
to the House and we gave our consent to a motion amended as per 
the member's word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only minutes after we gave consent, the member amended his 
motion back to the original motion. This, Mr. Speaker, is a very 
serious breach of parliamentary usage. An agreement between two 
members, two men, to obtain consent under false pretence is not 
only contrary to the rules, it shows contempt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely serious and I hope that, if the member does not 
amend his motion, we can withdraw our consent. One should not 
mislead a political party by asking for unanimous consent and 
then amending the motion later. 
This is just not done, it never was, and we cannot accept it. I 
call on your judgement, and the government's fair play. The 
House cannot operate that way. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

upset because what they are upset about has not in fact happened.

that we are concerned about something that is real. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order.  I want to apologize to the members of 
the Bloc Quebecois.  I have made a serious mistake this day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, backbenchers have an opportunity through report 
stage motions to try to influence legislation.  Motion No. 56 in 
my name basically calls for a five year review of this 
legislation so parliament could be involved.  That is in fact the 
original motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning when Group 2 was called, I was not in the House.  I 
was at finance committee and unfortunately I made the mistake of 
not asking one of my colleagues to move my Motion No. 56 as it 
was on the order paper.  I was contacted and immediately came to 
the House.  I was told that to get my motion properly on the 
floor, I would have to seek unanimous consent of all parties of 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an attempt to speak with all parties, I met with the House 
leader of the Bloc Quebecois with my request. The party members 
came back with a request that I would agree to amend Motion No. 
56.  I agreed to do this and I came back to the House.  But I am 
also advised that I cannot amend my own motion.  All I can do is 
table Motion No. 56 and the Bloc accept it in accordance with our 
understanding that it would get unanimous consent to be put on 
the table, subject to and as I said in my comments, amendments 
that would be tabled by another member and be in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I discussed this and I made these arrangements and provided the 
information to the parliamentary secretary to pose such 
amendments which I could not make myself.  I came to the House 
and I made the motion. The Bloc and other members gave me their 
consent to move Motion No. 56 as it is on the order paper. In 
between this time what happened—and I have no control over 
it—the government refused to support the amendment I had agreed 
upon with the Bloc and I could not deliver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc members who have spoken on this and the member from the 
Conservative Party are quite correct.  This is not the proper way 
for business to be handled in the House.  I apologize sincerely 
for upsetting the House with this matter.  I would ask now for 
the unanimous consent of the House to withdraw Motion No. 56. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  What is before the 
House is the amendment.  There would first have to be a request 
to remove the amendment before the motion could be removed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read from <I>Beauchesne's</I> 6th edition, pages 177 to 
178: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A member, having proposed an amendment, and subsequently desiring 
to amend the same can do so only if the House allows the original 
amendment to be withdrawn, at which time the member may then 
propose a new amendment.  It has been long accepted that 
government motions may be moved by any member of the Ministry. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Preceding this, I want to get into <I>Beauchesne's</I> again 
regarding the form and content of amendments and subamendments 
because this does get pretty ticklish in terms of what the 
government attempted to do.  The subamendment is where I think 
the government got derailed in terms of its abuse of the rules. 
It says that a subamendment cannot be moved if it proposes to 
leave out all the words of the proposed amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is up to the House, or the Chair, to decide.  They are 
referring to <I>Journals</I> March 8, 1937, page 208; 
<I>Journals</I> November 29, 1944, page 934; <I>Journals</I> March 
14, 1947, page 198. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, a subamendment must be relevant to the amendment it 
purports to amend, and not to the main motion, referring to 
<I>Journals</I> January 18, 1973, page 49. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, further on it points out that a subamendment which 
proposes an alternative to the original amendment is in order 
provided it is relevant to the question, which I believe this is 
not, referring to <I>Journals</I> June 23 and 24, 1926, pages 465, 
468. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, when the House has negatived a subamendment to strike 
out certain other words in a proposed amendment, it is in order 
to move another subamendment to insert other words than those 
used in the original subamendment, referring to <I>Debates</I> 
June 19, 1925, page 4554. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And on and on we go.  I will now go back to page 178 in the 6th 
edition of <I>Beauchesne's</I>, regarding withdrawal of motions 
and amendments.  I will go through this step by step, clause by 
clause.  I think we have a case for this one.  Just bear with me. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member who has proposed a motion may withdraw it only with 
the unanimous consent of the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We touched on that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I realize that the 
hon. member is in full flight but the Chair is privileged to have 
the advice of the best parliamentary minds our country has to 
offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having made use of that advice, I am going to suggest that in 
this particular case that Motion No. 56 was properly introduced, 
properly presented and properly accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  In good faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am not talking 
about anything other than the fact of whether it was done 
properly procedurally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The subsequent amendment was properly moved.  If it is the 
desire of the House that Motion No. 56 should be withdrawn, and 
the amendment, then it would be in order for someone to make that 
motion.  It is not possible for the Chair to move it.  It has to 
come from the House itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am always willing to do the will of the House if that can be 
discerned.  If it is the will of the House, I would move in fact 
that you seek unanimous consent that both the motion and the 
amendment be withdrawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. the 
parliamentary secretary to the government House leader has sought 
the unanimous consent of the House to withdraw Motion No. 56 and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel:</B> Mr. Speaker, one can easily get lost in this 
kind of debate. I do not know exactly where I was when you 
interrupted me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Hochelaga—Maisonneuve tells me that I was 
talking about the fact that there is pharmaceutical research 
being done in Chambly. There is also the space centre in 
Saint-Hubert, just a few kilometres from the beautiful riding of 
Chambly. Some people who work there live in my riding. At this 
time of year, with the Richelieu River thawing out and the 
Canadian geese flying across the area, Chambly is probably the 
most beautiful riding in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> After Rivière-des-Mille-Îles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel:</B> After the riding of Rivière-des-Mille-Îles 
represented by my colleague to my right, and maybe also after 
the riding of my friend from Châteauguay. In any event, it is 
one of the most beautiful ridings in Canada and I take this 
opportunity to salute all those who live there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B> There is also Acadie—Bathurst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel:</B> I hear the member for Acadie—Bathurst who 
would like me to mention his riding, which I have visited and 
which is indeed very beautiful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about scientific research. We are talking about 
clarity and about good faith among parliamentarians just after 
an intervention where the leaders of all parties recognized that 
keeping one's word is sacred, including in parliamentary law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, who never 
stops talking about good faith, kindness, friendship and 
compassion like the constitutional good guy that he is. On this 
side, we cannot adhere totally and without reservation to what 
is in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is good for scientific research, but what worries the 
opposition is that, once again, the very same thing that 
happened with Atomic Energy of Canada, where development was 
done in Ontario, could very well happen again. Atomic Energy of 
Canada represents a $12 billion investment over the years. When 
it was noticed that there was a small head office in Montreal, 
it was quickly moved to Ontario a few years ago, because it was 
no longer appropriate to leave it where it was. The head office 
was in Montreal, but the activities of Atomic Energy of Canada 
were conducted exclusively in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has happened time and time again. For instance, Ontario got 
the lion's share of the automobile industry among others. We 
understandably have concerns about Bill C-13. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you are frowning at me. I hope there is nothing 
unparliamentary in saying that we are concerned that once again 
the spinoffs of the act will benefit Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> He just said it makes sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel:</B> I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for listening to 
me with interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what worries parliamentarians. We know no modern country 
can make progress without helping scientific research. 
The member for Chicoutimi, whom I salute, is nodding in 
agreement; he knows that, in his riding as in ours, there are 
bright minds. But the private sector cannot always be there for 
them, because it takes equipment, infrastructures and money. “No 
money, no candy”, as our friends in Ontario say, and “no fun”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are welcoming this initiative to spread scientific research 
across the country instead of building a huge structure at some 
street corner, in Hamilton or Toronto, where scientific research 
would be concentrated.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to modern means of communication such as Internet, 
scientific research in a given field could be done by someone in 
Chicoutimi who would be connected to colleagues in Calgary, 
Mississauga or, of course, Chambly. Scientists could work and 
collaborate from their homes or their offices in the regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strength of this bill, if it is implemented properly, is in 
networking. But if everything is in Toronto, if all the lines 
and wires are converging on Toronto, the bill will have a 
negative impact on the other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Research is important. We can focus our economic development 
according to our skills and expertise. 
That is the problem for all regions, except Ontario. In Canada, 
and this is a major mistake that was repeated thousands of 
times, economic development is invariably based on technical 
knowledge and expertise. If that expertise is concentrated in 
one area, the resulting economic development will benefit that 
specific area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why, in the past, research on the seabed, marine species 
or fishery resources was conducted in the maritime provinces. 
Regional economy was based on the skills and knowledge that 
existed in a given region. The same research could not have been 
conducted in the central provinces, where agriculture is 
predominant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When research is not based on raw materials, but on technical 
knowledge such as the breaking of the atom— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> The breaking of the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel:</B> Or the breaking of the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that case, economic development can be promoted on the basis 
of that research. This is what concerns me, and rightly so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I learned a long time ago that, on the Liberal side, everything 
that shines is not gold. For the Liberals, chairs do not always 
have four identical legs. When they tell me about a chair, I 
have learned to be suspicious, because it does not mean there is 
an horizontal seat and a vertical back. In the Liberals' mind, a 
chair is not at all what you are sitting on, Mr. Speaker, so be 
careful. The Prime Minister has spent his life, his entire 
career, playing with words, concepts, and principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we are pleased about Bill C-13. But, for heavens sake, do 
not use it as an opportunity to once again fool about 80% of 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
today we are dealing with Bill C-13, an act to establish the 
Canadian institutes of health research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the health committee, I listened intently to the 
witnesses and to their observations and recommendations.  I am 
pleased to report to the House that the overwhelming consensus 
was in support of establishing the Canadian institutes of health 
research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were many witnesses with regard to lobbying, as it were, 
for hopefully consideration to become one of these institutes, 
which is the responsibility of the executive body of the new 
institute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were, however, other concerns raised.  I know that all 
members were aware that accountability was a very significant 
issue with regard to the new Canadian institutes of health 
research. 
The Canadian Nurses Association and the Canadian Medical 
Association suggested that parliament was establishing these 
Canadian institutes for health research and not providing, within 
the legislation, any mechanism for review other than a review of 
the public accounts and the overall report of the auditor 
general.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new Canadian institutes for health research will ultimately 
involve the appropriation and spending of some $500 million each 
and every year compared to about $250 million currently 
appropriated to the Medical Research Council, which currently 
discharges these responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view, the representations made by the CMA, the CNA and 
many other groups were that transparency and accountability were 
issues that this place should take very seriously.  Their 
recommendations were that this legislation and, more importantly, 
the administration of this new body called the Canadian 
institutes for health research, should be subject to a five year 
review by parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I proposed report stage Motion No. 56.  It was to reflect the 
testimony of witnesses who were dealing with the issues of 
accountability and transparency with regard to this piece of 
legislation and particularly the administration of $500 million 
of taxpayer money with regard to a most important area of health 
research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through my own error, for which I have apologized to the House, 
Motion No. 56 is no longer on the table.  However, I believe that 
the House would agree that the principles of transparency and 
accountability are paramount for parliamentarians and that a five 
year review, after the enactment of this particular bill, would 
be appropriate so that we could see how we did in crafting a new 
agency, a new organization and then to determine whether there 
were any modifications necessary. With guidance from 
parliamentarians, from the witnesses that we would call and with 
input from Canadians, we would be able to determine whether it 
was doing the job that we wanted it to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to propose an amendment to Group No. 2, Motion No. 55 
which concerns clause 31 of the bill.  The motion I propose is 
that at the end of existing clause 31 of Bill C-13, the following 
sentence be added:  That parliament shall also conduct a review 
of the administration of the act after five years and submit a 
report to parliament thereon, including a statement of any 
changes parliament would recommend.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I would judge that the amendment put forward 
by the member for Mississauga South to Motion No. 55, as stated 
here, is not in order because it changes what this motion was set 
up for.  I reject the amendment.  The member still has three 
minutes for debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I certainly do understand 
the ruling of the Chair but I will be seeking support from the 
House to find a way in which we can incorporate into this bill a 
review by parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the House concurs with the importance of transparency 
and accountability.  When the expenditure of $500 million of 
funds is involved, it is important that parliament have an 
opportunity, at least after the first five years, to see whether 
or not the legislation and the institution we are establishing 
are achieving the objectives that parliament intended.  It is our 
only opportunity to check and to influence whether or not a brand 
new agency is doing what parliament had intended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not have this mechanism, parliament is seconding to 
third parties, just like it did with the Medical Research 
Council, the full authority to spend $500 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would therefore ask for the unanimous consent of the House, 
for the second time today, to move that my original report stage Motion 
No. 56 which asks for a parliamentary review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member is asking for unanimous 
consent of the House.  Does the hon. member have permission to 
put the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  In relation to the member's request and in reading from 
Beauchesne's, there will be an opportunity, based on the rules of 
the House, to put an amendment at third reading.  I hope the 
member considers that.  I guess I do not have to quote from 
Beauchesne's in this regard, but I think on page 214 he will find the 
solution to his problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  No doubt the hon. member will thank the 
member for New Brunswick Southwest if indeed the information is 
helpful to him.  At this point, I have not been asked to make any 
ruling on that. Therefore, as far as I am concerned, we are still 
in debate and we are still on Group No. 2.  If there is no 
further debate, is the House ready for the question?

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CITIZENSHIP OF CANADA ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK111">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 18 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-16, an act respecting Canadian citizenship, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK112"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the last time I 
rose in the House to speak to Bill C-16, it was a rather short 
intervention. I barely had the time to outline the main elements 
of my speech; I was supposed to have some 40 minutes but had a 
mere two minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with great pleasure that I take part today in this debate 
on Bill C-16, the Citizenship of Canada Act, which all the 
members have had the opportunity to look at. It is about 40 
pages long and is designed to replace the existing Citizenship 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will recall that the House studied this bill once 
before, as it is a carbon copy, so to speak, of earlier Bill 
C-63. That bill had been tabled in the House and had gone to 
committee. 
This morning, we had the opportunity to discuss that at the 
Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration. It was 
mentioned that, when the earlier bill was considered, more than 
thirty individuals, organizations and experts had testified 
before the committee to express their concerns with regard to 
the Citizenship Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That earlier bill having died on the order paper, the government 
has now introduced a new bill, Bill C-16, to replace the existing 
Citizenship Act. I will describe this bill as simply and as 
succinctly as possible, giving a brief historical overview of 
citizenship in Canada, and then moving to the changes proposed 
in Bill C-16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later, I will explain the Bloc Quebecois vision with regard to 
the concept of citizenship, which can be both legal and civic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will then talk about a number of amendments, one in particular 
from my colleague from Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, who was the 
citizenship and immigration critic at the time Bill C-63 was 
being studied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, my colleague presented a constructive amendment 
at report stage, which made it possible to improve Bill C-63 on 
citizenship.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those amendments had the support of a number of individuals and 
organizations.  I will address the amendments made by my 
colleague from Hochelaga—Maisonneuve shortly.  It is my intention 
to do so because they are of interest and of considerable 
importance to a number of different groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concept of citizenship may have a connotation and a 
definition that are purely legalistic.  Naturally, the legal 
concept of citizenship confers certain rights and 
responsibilities.  These responsibilities and rights are civic 
in nature, but they are also political and to some extent 
social. 
There is also the aspect of responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-16 replaces Bill C-63, which died on the order paper. It 
has a lot of history attached to it.  Hon. members must keep in 
mind that, prior to 1947, not just anyone could become a 
Canadian citizen.  One had to be a British subject.  That is 
hard to imagine now, but I think that some of my colleagues who 
will be taking part in this debate will address this aspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before 1947, a person could be Canadian provided he were a 
British subject.  We had to wait until 1977 for the Citizenship 
Act as we now know it to come into effect.  The 1977 statute, 
which still applies, was aimed at encouraging this citizenship, 
at making it more accessible in a number of ways.  There are 
three or four elements characterizing the 1977 legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first one was that it reduced from five to three the number 
of years of residency. This is an important element. It 
eliminated the discrimination between men and women when 
adopting a child born abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act introduced a new concept: dual citizenship. From then 
on, people could have dual citizenship. The 1977 act was aimed 
at making it easier to become a Canadian citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us today—for all intents and purposes and as 
surprising as it may seem—is the first review of the Citizenship 
Act we, as parliamentarians, have the opportunity to vote on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1977, apart from a few statements from subsequent 
ministers—in particular the member for Westmount, who, during her 
previous mandate, made various statements—it is the first time 
parliamentarians are called upon to vote on an in-depth review of 
the Citizenship Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to highlight a few of the changes to the existing 
legislation. One clause of Bill C-16 deals with the issue of 
birth in Canada. Technically, a child born in Canada is a 
Canadian citizen. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT40"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT40"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1320
<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few exceptions apply. If a parent of the child is a diplomat, 
there are a number of exceptions. These exceptions are 
maintained in the bill before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the whole question of the physical presence with 
regard to residency. It boils down to the fact that a person who 
has been physically present in Canada for three years is a 
Canadian citizen. On should remember that today's reality, both 
in Canada and across the world, is that, with globalization and 
other trends, an increasing number of citizens are travelling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years, we have seen the large number of foreign 
immigrants and investors who invest in several countries and who 
must take into consideration the provisions of the Citizenship 
Act. This bill takes into account these two aspects, including 
the globalization aspect, the fact that people, particularly 
business people, have to travel more and more frequently to 
other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect of Bill C-16 is foreign adoption. I think all 
parliamentarians know that, right now, a child adopted abroad 
must go through the permanent residence process before being 
granted Canadian citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, under the existing Citizenship Act, medical 
examinations are mandatory at the time when an application is 
made. The whole process is often lengthy, and more than anything 
else, it gets in the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us will speed up the process for granting 
citizenship to children adopted abroad. As we often hear, it is 
like motherhood and apple pie. It is certainly in our best 
interest to facilitate the acquisition of citizenship for 
adopted children. However, one thing must be clear. Everybody 
knows it, but I think it is important to remind the hon. 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, the whole issue of adoption comes under the Civil 
Code. In this regard, I would say that the changes made pose a certain 
number of problems for us with respect not to content but to 
form of course.  We firmly believe that, on this issue, it is 
important to define the mechanisms of co-operation between the 
provincial government and the federal government in order to 
comply with the Civil Code of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members, and I will take the trouble to read the part 
of the bill dealing with adoption, that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>8. The Minister shall, on application, grant citizenship to a 
person who, after February 14, 1977, was adopted by a citizen 
while the person was a minor child and whose adoption: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>a</I>) was in the best interests of the child; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>b</I>) created a genuine relationship of parent and child;— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>d</I>) was not intended to circumvent the requirements under any 
enactment for admission to Canada or citizenship. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I pointed out, we are not against the underlying principle of 
the bill, but we firmly believe that there should be mechanisms 
for co-operation between the two governments in order to 
facilitate its enforcement in compliance with the Civil Code of 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Quebec is asking for in this regard is that a bilateral 
approach be taken to ensure consultation at all stages of the 
process before the federal government grants citizenship. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1325"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that this work should be done in co-operation with the 
provincial government. When Bill C-63, which has now become Bill 
C-16, was reviewed, a number of stakeholders, including the 
Fédération des parents du Québec, told us “We support the 
principle, but we are asking the federal government to put in 
place a mechanism that will respect Quebec's requests”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue is the oath of citizenship. I want to read the 
oath of citizenship. The bill provides that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A person acquires citizenship on being granted citizenship by 
the Minister and taking the oath of citizenship. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current oath reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her 
Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Canada, Her Heirs 
and Successors, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of 
Canada and fulfil my duties as a Canadian citizen. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-16 provides that, from now on, newcomers will have to 
express their loyalty to Canada. The oath will be replaced by 
the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From this day forward, I pledge my loyalty and allegiance to 
Canada and Her Majesty Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Canada... 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that the member for Bourassa has a deep respect 
for Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second, because in his 
numerous missions abroad he had the opportunity to meet her many 
times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Denis Coderre:</B> Not yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> I continue reading the new oath of 
citizenship: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I promise to respect our country's rights and freedoms, to 
uphold our democratic values, to faithfully observe our laws and 
fulfil my duties and obligations as a Canadian citizen. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We admit that there must be an oath of allegiance.  However, in 
our opinion, and the amendments by my colleague for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve to Bill C-63 in connection with this oath of 
allegiance, to the Queen of course, but also to Canada, provide 
that a certain number of documents clearly setting out the 
democratic values of Quebec ought to be provided.  These 
documents were adopted, often unanimously, by the Quebec 
National Assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What my colleague for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve proposed was the 
following: Would it be possible, at the time of the oath of 
allegiance, to provide people with the Quebec elections act, in 
order to provide Canadian citizens who are members of Quebec's 
political community with the most accurate information possible 
concerning the democratic reality of Quebec, so that they may 
exercise their democratic duty in as transparent a manner as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also wanted new citizens to be presented at the time of their 
swearing in with the Government of Quebec's declaration on 
interethnic and inter-racial relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a document that was adopted by the National Assembly on 
December 10, 1986.  I would remind hon. members that this was 
not a declaration presented by a sovereignist Parti Quebecois 
government.  No.  It was a legitimately elected Government of 
Quebec, a Liberal government no less.  It was passed by the 
National Assembly.  We believe all new Canadian citizens should 
be made aware of this declaration, which is based on a statement 
adopted and proclaimed by the United Nations in November 1983.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The third element we would like to see communicated to new 
Canadian citizens when they take the citizenship oath contained 
in Bill C-16 is the charter of the French language, passed in 
1977. This charter states that French is the language of common 
use and the working language in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, through the years this charter has been slashed by 
judgments of the supreme court, but we still see it as the 
fundamental expression of the political community of Quebec and 
a clear demonstration that business, work and teaching are done 
in French in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that in Quebec and in particular in Montreal, where I 
live, there is linguistic duality, but that Montreal is and 
hopefully will remain a French language city in America. It is 
our belief that the charter of the French language, if it were 
given to new citizens when they take the oath of allegiance 
contained in Bill C-16, could send a clear message to those new 
Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another document we believe should be given to new Canadian 
citizens is the Quebec charter of rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Communication of these documents is not only the Bloc Quebecois' 
idea. This idea did not come out of the blue. It also had the 
support of numerous organisations in Quebec and among them, of 
course, the Société Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Montréal. 
I see the hon. member for Bourassa smiling and saying to himself 
“Indeed, the sovereignist family sticks together more then 
ever.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, contrary to what the hon. member may believe, the 
Société Saint-Jean-Baptiste was not the only supporter of the 
amendment proposed by the hon. member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve. Mr. Dorsaint, of the Office of the 
Haitian Christian Community of Montreal also gave his support to 
the amendment. The member for Bourassa, who was smiling at what 
I said a moment ago, probably  knows Mr. Dorsaint pretty well 
because he goes visits his riding on a regular basis and knows 
that there is an sizeable Haitian community in his riding. The 
president of the Haitian Christian Community supported the 
amendments proposed by the Bloc Quebecois. So did Mr. Corbo, 
chancellor of the Université du Québec, and many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe these requests are certainly legitimate and would 
help improve this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, I asked that there be at least one day of public 
hearings on Bill C-16. I did it because we basically think, and I 
personally think, that even though it is, for all intents and 
purposes, a carbon copy of Bill C-63, the committee must study 
this bill. We cannot consider a bill in committee and report it 
without giving people a chance to be heard. That would be a 
serious breach of democracy that penalizes a certain number of 
groups that want to improve this bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that the committee finally yielded to my arguments. 
I see my colleague from the Conservative Party, who did not 
quite agree with what I was saying in committee this morning, as 
well as the member from the NDP. However, the committee finally 
yielded to my arguments. Why? Because the committee is the place 
where we can do an in depth study of the bills before us, and we 
must study this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we must not take too long to study this bill. Why? Now 
I am the one who is yielding to the arguments presented by my 
colleagues this morning, because we are still waiting for the 
complete reform of the Citizenship Act that the government has 
been promising us for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, the committee chair officially tabled the report of 
the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration on the 
refugee status determination system.  I think that this rather 
eloquent report, the majority of whose recommendations the Bloc 
Quebecois supports, shows that there was a problem with the 
legislation, that it needed to be improved, that there was an 
important problem in terms of resources.  Although the Bloc 
Quebecois agrees with the bulk of the recommendations, I would 
remind members that, if they take the trouble to read the 
standing committee's report, they will see that it includes an 
opinion that is described as “dissenting” but that could more 
properly be called “complementary”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I took out of this—I am the new citizenship and immigration 
critic—is that there was an important problem in the study of the 
process for determining refugee status. 
This also pointed up the fact that a new act was required as 
soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, for example, over 160,000 asylum seekers have been 
taken in since the mid-80s.  This is quite a number.  These are 
people who, for political reasons, feel that they have a right, 
under the United Nations Refugee Convention—which was adopted in 
1951—to apply as political refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada's lax approach to 
processing claims is cause for grave concern. 
When it can take more than a year for the commission to rule on 
the refugee status of an individual, we can imagine the human 
tragedy these people have to go through. We can imagine the 
tragedy their families have to go through? Why does this happen? 
Because our system is vague, weak and inadequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that we have to be very careful because Bill C-16 on 
citizenship and immigration has to be amended. We believe it 
does. However, we also believe that we have to pay particular 
attention to the refugee status determination process. Bill C-16 
is an important bill. I have already said that the government 
can count on our support on the principle of the bill. However, 
we strongly wish for the support of the government regarding the 
commitments and the amendments that will be put forward by the 
Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois raised another point on the refugee status 
determination process in its minority report.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a whole section on detention in the committee report. 
Surprisingly enough, it is considered in that section that up to 
now, the federal government was justified in detaining a certain 
number of individuals who had illegally crossed our borders in 
boats or even in containers, as odd as that may seem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members of the immigration department's guidelines. We 
can detain a person who does not have proper identification or a 
person who represents a threat to the public security. I totally 
agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we were hoping the committee report would deal with a 
new reality, the illegal immigration of minors. Over the last 
few months, particularly in the Port of Vancouver, we have seen 
a number of individuals coming through our borders by boat, by 
air and sometimes by container. We have seen children arriving 
by boat, particularly young Chinese under 18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen Romanian children arriving by container in the Port 
of Montreal. The federal government ordered that these minors be 
incarcerated in Immigration Canada detention centres. That is 
unacceptable. I think these minors, these children, should be 
granted special status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my dissenting report, I based my argument on UNICEF's 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, and I quote article 37 of 
thet convention, which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No child shall be deprived of his or her liberty unlawfully or 
arbitrarily. The arrest, detention or imprisonment of a child 
shall be in conformity with the law and shall be used only as a 
measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period 
of time. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe all the laws dealing with immigration in Canada should 
exempt minors from detention. I think, for example, of the many 
young Chinese who came into Canada, illegally perhaps, but who 
were incarcerated in the Immigration Canada detention centre in 
Laval. I think we have a basic human rights problem here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada must act and change its laws in accordance with UNICEF's 
Convention on the Rights of the Child. I am sure that the hon. 
member for Bourassa is in total agreement on such a legislative 
change, and I would like the minister to take it under 
advisement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another major element is the position developed in the last 
months, even in the last weeks, by three governments. The Quebec 
government, of course, including those Quebecers I represent in 
this House, but the governments of Ontario and British Columbia 
also pointed out the laxapproach of the Immigration and Refugee 
Board to processing claims. There is a 12 to 13 month waiting 
period before refugee status is granted, while the target should 
be six months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be possible that the costs for services provided to 
those people waiting for a federal decision be paid for by the 
federal government instead of provincial governments? In some 
respects, because of the federal government laxapproach, the 
processing time of claims is unacceptable, which results in 
increased service costs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the hon. members that this represents $80 million each 
year for Quebec. I think the federal government should accept 
the view of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another major element is the issue of the board, but with regard 
to Bill C-16, the issue is the oath commissioners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some concerns about the definition of the 
responsibilities and mandate given to these oath commissioners, 
who will have increasingly a rather special role to play. When I 
read the bill, I have a number of reserves and concerns about 
the impartiality of these commissioners, who should play their 
role as fairly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Probably because it is not specified in the bill, we fear that 
the commissioners might play the role of propagandists. We 
believe the wording of the bill might result in the commissioners 
playing a very dangerous role and, to a certain extent, a 
political role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might have the opportunity to come back to this later, but I 
ask the government to take into consideration these concerns the 
opposition parties have. We fear the commissioners might have to 
promote the values that symbolize Canadian citizenship. We agree 
with the values of civicism, respect for the law and 
understanding among individuals. However, we fear that with the 
measures being promoted by the Canada Information Office and the 
Council for Canadian Unity, the government might try to use the 
commissioners for political purposes. This is a concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concept of citizenship has a meaning for us, and in keeping 
with our plan to become sovereign, we are working on developing a 
Quebec citizenship. Over the last few months, the Bloc Quebecois 
has launched several projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> I see the member for Bourassa is reacting 
once again. He travels abroad more and more frequently, and he is 
catching up on what the opposition parties have to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think our citizenship is evolving in such a way that it is now 
part of Quebec political community. With all due respect to the 
member for Bourassa, in Quebec, we share one language, one public 
history and one public culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe Quebec is unique and this uniqueness is expressed 
through a Quebec citizenship which is increasingly part of a 
political community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now conclude this speech of close to 40 minutes and I 
especially want to thank the member for Bourassa for listening to 
me for these 40 minutes.

are doubly blessed and feel even more strongly than some in that

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians, first and foremost, do value their Canadian 
citizenship and their right to belong to this great country. 
Coming with that privilege also comes obligations and 
responsibilities, both of which we also welcome and value as part 
of our Canadian citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously most Canadians hold this issue very dear and very 
close to them by virtue of the fact that we had 37 groups and 
organizations make representations to the committee as it studied 
Bill C-63, which was the immediate predecessor of Bill C-16. 
Thirty-seven groups from all across the country felt strongly 
enough and genuinely motivated enough about this issue, which 
really only amends the Citizenship Act in quite minor ways, to 
give of their time to share their ideas with our committee.  We 
took their representations very seriously and I believe crafted 
the better part of their recommendations into what we have before 
us today as Bill C-16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to say that our caucus too is fiercely proud of its 
Canadian citizenship.  We consider ourselves fiercely proud 
Canadian nationalists.  We consider ourselves champions of this 
country.  Our citizenship is the vehicle by which we are given 
the licence to advocate on behalf of our country and speak loudly 
and proudly about it wherever we can here and elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I lament the fact that somehow being a fiercely proud Canadian 
citizen has somehow fallen out of fashion.  It is not nearly as 
common or as typical in this place to hear even what was heard 20 
or 30 years ago when members of the Liberal Party at that time 
occupied themselves to a great degree on the issue of Canadian 
nationalism, foreign ownership and concentration of foreign 
ownership.  There were people such as Walter Gordon in the old 
days who would stand up in the House and speak passionately about 
keeping Canada Canadian, not losing our economic sovereignty and 
not selling out to foreign ownership.  It is now creeping higher 
and higher to the point where Canadians really have to question 
who is running the show and if we really do have economic 
sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about citizenship we cannot help but think of those 
things and that thrust we feel sometimes.  It is time and maybe 
this bill gives us the opportunity to review the whole subject of 
taking back our country with our pride in our Canadian 
citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citizenship is not only how we define ourselves as part of the 
nation-state, another threatened concept frankly in today's 
globalized economy.  The whole idea of the nation-state in its 
very best light is at very grievous risk of surviving this new 
globalization in the economy.  It is also how we view ourselves 
as a part of a community.  As a citizen it makes us part of a 
community and it is by virtue of that fact that we can build 
community.  We feel very strongly that this is also at risk in an 
age where there is a growing importance attached to the 
individual and not to the collective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being a citizen means that one is part of a broader community 
that is greater than the sum of its parts and that is a very 
healthy thing.  It is one of the reasons why so many Canadians 
were motivated to come out to share their ideas with us.  They 
feel passionately about this too and they also feel threatened by 
these very things that I have raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole globalization of capital and global trade agreements, 
such as the MAI, WTO or NAFTA, threaten three things which we 
hold as very dear and precious to us.  First, they do threaten 
the whole concept of citizenship.  Second, they threaten the 
concept of democracy.  Third, they certainly threaten the concept 
of the nation-state as we know it today and as we view Canada in 
such a proud way as a strong, healthy national government.  I put 
it to the House that all those things are at risk and that is why 
we saw such a high level of interest in this bill, a 
disproportionate level of interest given the fact that the bill 
really only amends the citizenship practices in a very modest 
way.  It gives people a forum to raise this much larger picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look at examples such as what happened in Seattle as growing 
evidence that young people are very seized of this issue.  Young 
people are very concerned that globalization is in fact chipping 
away at the concepts of citizenship, democracy and the 
nation-state. 
People asked me how I could make this quantum leap from talking 
about citizenship to talking about the globalization of capital. 
Frankly, it is self-evident that as we confer more and more 
powers on unelected bodies, corporations, if you will, and grant 
them nation-state status, they then have primacy over the freely 
elected officials, such as the ones in this room, and our ability 
to govern our own economic sovereignty.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are perfect examples, recent examples, that we could point 
to where our own country is feeling this pinch.  The Ethyl 
Corporation lawsuit is a classic example where we, as 
democratically elected officials who have chosen that we do not 
want a certain product circulated in our system because we feel 
it is a hazard to the common good, get our wrists slapped by this 
senior power, this higher power, this corporate power that says 
we cannot do that because we are interfering with its opportunity 
to make a profit and it will sue us for lost opportunity.  That 
is a classic example of the threat to democracy, the threat to 
the nation-state and the threat to citizenship as we know it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we take power away from the freely elected politicians and 
give it to this other third party, another power, we are 
gradually eroding our ability to conduct our own affairs and be 
masters of our own domestic economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians I know across this country want the bill dealt with 
expeditiously.  In fact most of us, certainly in our caucus, 
would like to see it dealt with today and finished with in the 
House so it can go back to committee, follow through the process 
and ultimately become law for the simple reason that Canadians 
want to talk about more important aspects of immigration and 
refugee issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The actual citizenship bill, as I pointed out, makes quite minor 
changes to the way that we deal with the citizenship issue.  The 
larger issue, the issue that Canadians are really seized with I 
believe, is the bigger picture of immigration as a whole and what 
immigration means in terms of growing our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want basic questions dealt with.  The first question 
they want to deal with when it comes to immigration is how big 
should Canada be.  Has anybody ever really had that debate in the 
House?  How big should Canada be as a country?  Until we have 
that debate, how can we possibly make good rules regarding how 
much immigration we should have and how many people we should let 
in every year?  We need to know what our goals are and then make 
meaningful rules to help us achieve those goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the cart well before the horse in this case because here 
we are dealing with issues regarding immigration without ever 
having had that basic, fundamental debate.  We can take guidance 
as we enter that debate about how big Canada should be from our 
predecessors in the House.  Wilfrid Laurier stood up in this 
place and said “By the year 2000 Canada should be a country of 
100 million people”.  That was the goal.  Pierre Trudeau said 
and the Economic Council of Canada in the late 1960s said “By 
the year 2000 Canada should be a country of 50 million”. We are 
still way off.  We have failed to achieve those goals, even 
although they are modified somewhat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the current rate of immigration and growth we are just about 
right to remain stagnant, which means in 50 years we will still 
be a country of whatever we are today, 30 million people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Actually you are not out of time.  You have

to stay with a great uncle who has a history of child abuse and 
drunk driving.

“Working to Your Full Potential” is a new and unique program

mandate of this project is to provide one-on-one counselling, 
support, referral and case management for persons who, in

interfering with job finding and job maintenance.  This program 
is offered free of charge to unemployed individuals in my riding 
and throughout Peel Region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since its inception just six months ago the program has assisted 
over 125 people and is continuing its work to address the health

people recognize and strive toward their potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate and thank Family Services of Peel and HRDC for

the allowance to Corporal Knibbs, who then promptly filed an 
objection.  Revenue Canada replied by saying that its final 
decision would be based on an upcoming ruling, but in the

went by before Revenue Canada ruled against the corporal, who 
promptly paid his tax bill.

the hard earned money taxpayers send into the government is not 
going to subsidize deals between oil giants and friends of the

question is for the health minister.  The last time the federal

Alberta's plan for health privatization.  Let us make no mistake 
about it.  This secret deal paves the way for full blown, two

helps thousands of Canadian companies on the markets.

the Minister of Human Resources Development talks about openness

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party currently has 30 important access to

pages of information to the House for the use of each and every 
one of the members of parliament. We are working hard to be 
transparent and open and we will continue to be. I would note 
that since the beginning of the year, we have received well over 
300 access to information requests.  We will deliver to the best

these requests are not very complicated.  They are simple audits

</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the minister not learned from her mistakes?  Many of these

the ways to bring new entrants into the fishery is through a

exactly what we are doing. Through a voluntary retirement program 
we are buying up licences to make sure that we follow the law and 
follow the supreme court ruling which recognized the treaty that

</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time the Speaker made this ruling: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since there is a clear line of administerial responsibility, grievances 
of this type are not points of privileges but should be brought before 
the House and laid before the minister for the minister to answer 
because this was in the best public interest and both members of 
parliament and the public had the right to be informed of them. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that there is a clear line of ministerial 
responsibility when we feel that a law has been broken or 
compromised that we bring it forward in a question before the 
minister and have the minister answer that question in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I agree that you should be able to bring 
forth whatever issues you want.  All colleagues will know that 
many times in question period it is not only the words but it is 
the tone of the voice, the reaction and the accusation. That is 
what I have to base my decision on in the heat of battle. 
Therefore, today I made this decision that stands for today.  Mr. 
Jerome made another decision in his time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said many times in that there are no words which of 
themselves are unparliamentary.  I told you we can use the word 
liar, for example, if you say “I was called a liar”.  But there 
is no need to explain it.  I have to have a little room in order 
to keep the question period so that we can hear the questions and 
the answers and so that the question period moves along.  Did I 
make mistakes?  Yes, like anyone else.  Was I too quick? 
Perhaps, but it is the decision I have made and I stay with it, 
with respect.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-16, an 
act respecting Canadian Citizenship, be now read a second time 
and referred to a committee. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1510"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT62"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT62"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1510

<P><A NAME="LINK263"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to begin by summarizing somewhat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did start my remarks with a statement that in my belief there 
is no higher honour one can have than that of being a citizen in 
a democracy.  I mean that quite sincerely.  I believe that all 
Canadians value that in their lives as indicated by the fact that 
we had an overwhelming outpouring of representations by Canadians 
to the citizenship committee on this bill.  Thirty-seven 
presenters brought forward their points of view and many of those 
points made it into the actual bill and now form what we know as 
Bill C-16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did make the connection between the concept of citizenship and 
the building of community.  There are really three things: the 
idea that a citizen is part of something larger, the sense of 
community, and how we in the New Democratic Party view that sense 
as being at risk somewhat in a day that champions the individual, 
it seems, more than the collective.  Operating as a collective is 
much more a Canadian point of view.  Canadians make that 
connection and value citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill that we are looking at today started life as Bill C-63. 
Most of Bill C-63 is still contained in Bill C-16.  We brought 
recommendations forward at the various stages of Bill C-63 hoping 
to improve the bill because many of the groups that came to see 
us on Bill C-63 were not entirely enamoured with the bill as it 
stood.  They had serious reservations about aspects of the bill 
and as is proper, they brought those concerns to the committee. 
We listened carefully.  We tried to make meaningful amendments to 
try to satisfy some of their concerns.  As it stands, we believe 
that Bill C-16 is an improved version of Bill C-63. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real point that has been made today by other speakers as 
well is that we would like to get on with this bill.  We would 
like to finish with debate on the bill and get it back to 
committee.  We would get through the final stages and put it to 
bed because most Canadians are quite anxious to address other 
immigration and refugee matters, issues other than Bill C-16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citizenship as such deals with people who have already landed in 
the country, who have already made it to our shores and have 
settled in for a number of years and are now at that final stage 
of becoming a new Canadian and going through the act of getting 
their citizenship papers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real concern that most Canadians are bringing to my 
attention as the critic for the NDP is the much broader issue of 
immigration to Canada.  How do we attract the right new Canadians 
to this country to help us grow the economy and help the country 
grow?  How do we seek out and find these people?  How do we 
convince them that Canada is the country they should come to? 
There is growing competition around the world for the skilled 
workers of the world and certainly we need to do more outreach 
than we have done in the past in terms of reaching out to people 
and offering what we have to offer in a very public way.  We have 
to advertise and promote ourselves if we are to attract more 
people to these shores. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I made the point earlier that we in the New Democratic Party 
believe that immigration is an engine of economic growth.  We 
would like to see more immigration to this country and we are 
very critical of those in the country and some in the House of 
Commons who would argue that we should close the doors now on 
immigration.  This is an attitude that has been largely driven by 
fear or ignorance, I would say, and fear generated by some of the 
recent events of this summer which saw migrant boat people 
drifting up on our shore on the west coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I could take one moment just to talk about that one subject. 
It has been a source of great frustration to me as this whole 
issue got blown so badly out of proportion.  There were 500 or 
600 desperate Chinese migrants who landed on our shores looking 
for safe refuge, looking for sanctuary, looking for a better 
life.  The reaction of certain Canadians was “Oh my goodness, 
our borders are a sieve, it is a threat to national security in 
some way, we have to slam the door shut and lock these people up 
and send them back”.  In fact, the Reform Party had a public 
press conference when the first boat landed and said that we 
should send them back without even a hearing, that we should just 
simply put them on another boat and send them back where they 
came from without any knowledge of what their circumstances were 
or if there could have been legitimate refugee claims.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thankfully, this country has better policies than that and our 
policy is that everyone deserves the right to a full hearing, the 
right to counsel and the right to have their case heard.  Some 
will be eligible and some will not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the New Democratic Party went a bit further.  We wanted to 
understand a little bit more about this idea of the migration of 
people throughout the world.  It is getting to be very common for 
people to seek better economic situations and to move around the 
globe.  We did a bit of research on the Fujian province, from 
where these people originated.  We learned that the Fujian 
province is one of the first places in China that had what we 
call free economic trade zones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke earlier in my speech about the globalization of capital 
threatening the concepts of citizenship, the nation-state and 
democracy.  Here is a graphic illustration in these free economic 
trade zones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ILO did some research to say that one should be making about 
85 cents an hour in these trade zones to have a standard of 
living comparable to a working class Chinese person in that area. 
These trade zones, where all kinds of western goods, such as 
clothing and toys, are manufactured, pay on the average 18 cents 
an hour.  Here are these people making western products for you 
and I and our children to enjoy who are making one-fifth of what 
it takes to have the standard of living of a Chinese peasant in a 
fenced compound in China and having some knowledge of the western 
world, that there is a better world out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their motivation, I suppose, was to elevate their standard of 
wages and working conditions by getting out of there, but there 
was no legitimate way to get to some place like Canada, to get to 
the west.  There is only one place to go to get papers to apply 
for a Canadian visa or a permit to come to Canada and that is in 
Beijing.  It is a heck of a long way from the Fujian province. 
They cannot get here from there.  There is no legitimate way for 
them to apply to come to Canada and, under the current rules, 
they probably would not qualify anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we know a little bit more about the people who wound up on 
the shores of B.C., we are a little less threatened by them.  The 
fear and the ignorance will hopefully dissipate as the story 
really gets out on who these people are and how we should really 
be dealing with them.  I wanted to speak to that a little bit as 
we do get calls.  Even as recently as today, we got faxes from 
Canadians who are not as open-minded about this issue.  I hope 
the truth is finally getting out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been dealing with the estimates, the spending of the 
government and various aspects of government.  I would hope that 
as we get through the estimates regarding the immigration 
department that more money is put toward the promotion of 
immigration than it is toward the enforcement of immigration 
rules, which are really designed to keep people out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has always been of great frustration to our caucus that much 
of the energies and resources of the immigration officials and 
bureaucracy are dedicated to keeping people out of the country 
and not to welcoming them in.  It sends absolutely the wrong 
message.  The more barriers, obstacles and roadblocks we put in 
the way of people who are coming or who seek to make Canada their 
home, the more the message spreads out around the world that it 
is a difficult place to come to, that they will be frustrated and 
that it will not be easy.  They will then go someplace else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are serious about building this country, we had better 
change that perception.  That means some resources will need to 
be spent in specifically targeted parts of the world where we 
know workers with the skills we need reside.  We can invite and 
attract them and promote this country so that they choose to come 
here and make Canada their home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the citizenship bill, in the last minute or two 
that I have I will deal with some of the specifics and some of 
the reservations we have about Bill C-16.  We are eager to see it 
go back to the committee so that we can deal with it in further 
depth and we can hear a few more groups make representation to us 
to see what they think about its current form as opposed to its 
format under the former Bill C-63. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things raised at length by the member of the Bloc 
Quebecois was that there was some objection to having the Queen 
referenced in the citizenship oath.  Frankly, I think that is a 
matter so minor and insignificant that it does not even warrant 
comment in the House of Commons.  Surely we have better things to 
dwell on than an issue such as that, but we did hear quite a bit 
of debate on that subject from other speakers. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1520"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was some really serious concern that the abolition of the 
citizenship judges would be a step backward if they were replaced 
with citizenship commissioners in terms of getting a fair 
adjudication.  This work would now be done by bureaucrats who may 
not have the same abilities to weigh the variables in a 
complicated citizenship case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also believe that the citizenship tests should be available 
in either official language and, if translation is needed, it 
should be available.  I believe that has been addressed and we 
are happy to see it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one remaining point that I need to comment on.  We 
believe that the rules regarding the actual physical presence of 
a person in this country are too stringent.  Under the current 
rules, one has to be physically present for three of the last six 
years before citizenship papers are granted.  We believe that 
places an undue burden on those who may have interests outside 
the country and who may often need to travel outside the country 
to take care of their business interests elsewhere.  We would 
like to see that addressed at the committee stage and we will 
soon have an opportunity to do so. 
<P><A NAME="LINK264"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak today to Bill C-16, the citizenship act, and 
my comments will be multifaceted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak first on some of my experiences in Africa a couple 
of weeks ago, then address the timing of the bill and then 
highlight a few of the many issues that the department has 
ignored for far too long.  I will also, of course, speak to the 
bill itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I proceed on those topics, I want to affirm that my party 
is a proponent of immigration and citizenship.  We support 
individuals receiving citizenship and enjoying the many 
privileges of being Canadian.  We have always valued and 
cherished the contributions that newcomers make to our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four hundred years ago Europeans joined aboriginals already 
living here to begin building this country we call Canada today. 
Since that time, persons from every corner of the globe have 
moved to Canada and have enriched our society with their 
knowledge, talents and culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do believe in balancing the welcoming of refugees and 
immigrants with ensuring a fair system.  Related to that, I wish 
to provide some clarifications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Aboriginals aside, we were all immigrants or refugees.  All 
refugees are immigrants but not all immigrants are refugees. This 
is not clearing things up very well is it?  I will try to clarify 
it a bit more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legal definition of refugee in Canada follows the convention 
refugee of the United Nations, which states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Convention refugee” means any person who 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons 
of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social 
group or political opinion, 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An immigrant is legally defined as a person who seeks landing. 
In other words, an immigrant is someone who leaves his or her 
country with the intention of living in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that I have furnished the House with these definitions, I 
wish to provide some context for the definitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, I was recently on a trip to Africa and I had a chance 
to sit in on some interviews with potential Canadian citizens. I 
will talk about one in particular, which was a rather 
heart-rending story.  It involves a young lady, around 18 years 
old, who came from Sudan.  She lived in a city where her father 
was killed by rebels when she was 11 years old.  She lived with 
her mother and two brothers. The city was being bombed.  Rebels 
were on the outside.  This family was told they had to leave the 
city.  In leaving the city, she was separated from her mother and 
brothers and has never seen them since.  She was able to find 
someone at a church who put her up for a while and then found her 
a foster home in Nairobi.  At that home she was sexually abused. 
She finally got away from that and laid claim for refugee status 
at the United Nations. 
That was how she came to the Canadian immigration office to make 
application as a refugee. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1525"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT65"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT65"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1525

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When she came into the office her dossier said that she spoke 
English.  However, in questioning her, we had a hard time getting 
her to say anything.  It was basically yeses and noes.  At that 
point, the immigration officer asked her to write down something. 
She took a piece of paper and a pencil and easily wrote a 
beautiful, one paragraph account.  After that, the immigration 
officer asked her to do a couple of math questions and she had no 
problem at all.  Then she started to open up a little bit and we 
found that she did speak English very well.  She spoke, read and 
wrote English. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We then found out that she had only about five years of 
schooling; about two and a half years in primary school and about 
the same in secondary school.  During that time her mother tongue 
was Arabic.  She spoke, wrote and read Arabic.  We know she 
spoke, wrote and read English.  She also spoke two other 
languages fluently, with only five years of education.  As 
members can see, this person, with the few opportunities she has 
had in life, was able to develop.  This is the type of person 
would would probably be an excellent Canadian citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I was in Nairobi, I had the chance to visit the 
orientation training school for the refugees who were coming to 
Canada.  I have to say that I was a little nervous with these 
people because I felt most of them knew more about Canada than I 
did.  Refugees from that area who are trying to come Canada 
usually spend from two to three months getting a little training 
about what Canada is all about and what they can expect when they 
get here.  I have to say that from what I saw they were doing an 
excellent job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also had a chance to sit in on an immigrant interview.  This 
was a young man and his wife learning a lesson about how 
difficult it was to come to Canada as an immigrant.  We do have 
some major problems in that system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This young gentleman was an aeronautics engineer with five years 
of university but his profession was not recognized in Canada, 
even though we have a need for aeronautics engineers in Canada 
and our point system indicates they would get preference.  In 
order for this young gentleman to get in he was applying as an 
aircraft mechanic.  With our point system, there is not a large 
need for aircraft mechanics and, unfortunately, this gentleman 
will be refused.  It is too bad because this is a young family 
with good possibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our point system needs to be updated.  We do not move fast 
enough as the changes come about in the workforce to do what is 
needed in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a final point about the trip, I want to recognize that the 
high commissioners and immigration staff face many mental and 
physical challenges in foreign lands.  They do the very best they 
can in the conditions they work in.  For that I applaud them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now wish to turn to the timing of this bill.  The bill is 
important but at this point in our history there are far more 
serious problems to deal with in the Department of Citizenship 
and Immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last summer 599 illegal immigrants arrived on the west coast by 
boat.  Six hundred arrivals at once places an enormous strain on 
Canadian taxpayers who must support these migrants, provide legal 
aid, shelter and health care.  Such an arrival also infuriates 
those who have tried to enter Canada the conventional way, such 
as those I have just described. 
They encounter far too many delays in the immigration process.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just last month the provinces of Ontario, Quebec and British 
Columbia called on the federal government to reduce the backlogs 
in immigration inventories.  Refugees and immigrants alike need 
to wait unnecessarily long for their claims to be processed, 
while it is the provinces which must pay for social assistance, 
legal aid, health care and housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's response to this common front was that Ontario 
should reduce its taxes.  Reducing taxes will not ease the 
strains of the Immigration and Refugee Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the month of January a container ship with stowaways 
arrived in British Columbia.  Almost every week in January 
illegal immigrants were found somewhere in the province of 
Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point I would like to speak to is our foreign students 
and the missed opportunities because of the stringent rules on 
those students.  We look for students.  We bring in roughly 
30,000 a year to attend our different universities.  These 
students pay double the tuition that our students pay.  They 
learn the language when they are here, if they do not know it 
before they arrive.  They are immersed in our culture.  Most of 
them stay four years, some five, and then they are allowed to 
work in the country for one year.  They then have to leave if 
they want to apply to get back into the country.  We do not 
actively go after them, and that is unfortunate, because the 
Americans go after them and the Australians go after them.  We 
end up losing these people.  Indirectly, we have a chance for a 
brain gain, but we are suffering again from brain drain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This winter has seen heartsick worry in cancer wards in Ontario. 
The province has been suffering from a shortage of radiation 
therapists.  The provincial government has been recruiting 
foreign therapists, but this initiative has become snagged in 
immigration red tape.  The processing times for these therapists 
takes far too long.  Waiting times for cancer patients are 
dangerous.  Delays allow this fatal illness to spread to other 
parts of the body.  These are just a few of the issues which CIC 
has had before it over the last eight months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, there are a few issues which CIC has ineffectively 
dealt with.  As a matter of fact, last year the minister and the 
Prime Minister said that the winter months would discourage 
migration from overseas countries.  Of course, that was absurd 
and cowardly, and it meant to defend the integrity of our 
Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians, the provinces and this party want attention focused 
on the serious issues.  We are speaking of our borders, entities 
which we have the responsibility, indeed the right, to defend. 
We are a sovereign nation and we should be able to decide who is 
admitted to Canada and how they are admitted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new citizenship bill would not solve our border problems, 
would not speed up our processing time for radiation therapists 
and could not provide us with a new way of dealing fairly with 
non-status migrants arriving on our shores.  A new citizenship 
act would not provide additional resources for customs agents who 
are required to safeguard our borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own riding I have seven border crossings.  It is a problem 
we deal with every day.  We do not have enough immigration 
officials.  We understand that the first line at our borders is 
our customs officers.  Our customs officers are not equipped, 
quite frankly.  They have just been given a certain amount of 
power.  They have been given the right of arrest, but they have 
no arms and no special training.  They are taking some test 
cases, but I think our criminals will quite easily find which 
border crossings are covered and which are not, and we know what 
will happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point the minister has advanced no solutions and, most 
important, she has not tabled the new immigration bill to begin 
the process of dealing with these problems and concerns.  I 
understand, due to departmental leaks, that a new bill is on its 
way.  I just do not understand why it is taking so long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former minister was all set to forge ahead with a new act 
last year, but a cabinet shuffle seemed to postpone the 
legislation, and I cannot grasp why. 
I know it would take some time to study the bill, but in 1998-99 
citizenship and immigration launched reviews and consultations 
costing $1.76 million.  These studies have been done.  Why have 
we not seen the results?  Why has it taken the department so long 
to release this new bill?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am disappointed that it has taken so much money and time for a 
new piece of immigration legislation, but I will not press this 
point further.  There are parts of Bill C-16 which I wish to 
address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-16 demands that permanent residents spend three years out 
of six in Canada.  That is 1095 days.  It assures that permanent 
residents need to display and prove their legitimacy in becoming 
Canadians, but how would this be enforced with any authority? 
How would permanent residents prove with any credibility that 
they have spent the required time in the country?  How could 
Canadians be sure that this clause of Bill C-16 was respected? 
Exit controls do not exist in Canada for non-residents.  However, 
we do not know when non-residents are in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A pilot project was launched in southern Ontario this winter, 
whereby all refugee claimants were given identification cards. 
The whole issue of these identification cards has been shrouded 
in a veil of secrecy.  Why did the minister not discuss this with 
parliament?  Perhaps it would be a good idea to use these cards 
as exit controls for refugee claimants.  Neither the standing 
committee nor the House had any input in the present usage of 
cards or any potential usage such as exit controls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We praise the move that would make it easier for children 
adopted from other countries to become citizens.  At present they 
must go through the immigration process and require permanent 
residency. First and foremost, this modification would hopefully 
have the effect of helping children abroad who are living in 
poverty or unacceptable conditions.  It would also hopefully free 
up resources at CIC.  Our only concern in this regard is that 
adequate health checks would be completed on new arrivals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand why it has taken the government so long to 
allow these provisions for children abroad.  The PC Party has 
been demanding these changes to overseas adoption for a long 
time.  The minister should have acted much sooner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next topic I wish to cover in relation to Bill C-16 is its 
coming into force.  The bill would apply to every man, woman and 
child in the queue for the citizenship ceremony.  Bill C-16 is 
not retroactive, with only one exception, for cases sent to the 
citizenship judge.  For the most part, when it comes into effect 
all applicants will fall under the new law.  Why is this?  What 
kind of overlap and additional paperwork would this cause?  Would 
the minister please explain the thinking behind this part of the 
bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a final point related to the Citizenship Act, I wish to 
comment on the appointment process of proposed citizenship 
commissioners who will replace citizenship judges.  These 
citizenship commissioners will be appointed by orders in council. 
We wish to see this method of appointment changed to guarantee 
that confident, experienced individuals are chosen for the 
position of commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Various witnesses appearing before the standing committee 
expressed concern about partisan appointments at CIC.  Professor 
François Crépeau and France Houle proposed four recommendations 
for ensuring competent individuals to fill jobs at CIC.  It is 
worth my time to highlight some of these recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first recommendation was that candidates should be hired for 
eight years with a one year probation period.  Candidates must 
not be renewable and candidates must be staggered.  This would 
ensure constant new blood in a stressful field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second recommendation was that candidates must have a 
knowledge of refugee law, a knowledge of the politics of the 
country of origin and psychological capabilities to deal with 
refugees and their situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third recommendation was that a selection committee should 
be put in place to ensure that competent employees would be hired 
to the IRB.  This committee would be composed of individuals from 
the immigration, refugee and law fields. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth recommendation was that candidatures must be open to 
all and must be made public.  The selection committee would have 
to follow strict guidelines, such as being familiar with the 
candidates' portfolios and a majority must agree on a candidate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party has been calling for a more transparent hiring process 
for a long time.  One needs only to glance at our platform from 
the 1997 election to see that. 
Today, as I have in the House before, I call on the minister to 
take the high road and ensure that competent and not necessarily 
partisan individuals are appointed to positions within CIC.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Professor Crépeau happens to be a professor in Montreal.  The 
government should look to the province of Quebec more often for 
its immigration policies.  I am speaking in particular about the 
Quebec investor program.  Quebec is the only province in Canada 
to run its own program.  The federal government administers 
provisions for business immigrants for the rest of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal program has failed miserably.  Why does the minister 
not look at Quebec's quasi-guarantees and financing options for 
business immigrants?  Quebec also has the lowest corporate taxes 
in North America.  Is it any wonder that the province's plan has 
worked so well? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citizenship is of prime importance.  It identifies us as 
belonging to a certain group of individuals, to a society, to a 
country.  Citizenship is perennial in providing a sense of 
community.  This is not a novel concept.  Citizenship was a 
prized entity among ancient Greeks and Romans.  I do not often 
agree with the minister, but she is correct in asserting that 
citizenship is at the heart of what it means to be Canadian.  Our 
party only hopes that she protects the integrity and worth of our 
citizenship.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have had the opportunity 
to be in the House today to listen to my critic, the member for 
Compton—Stanstead, as well as the member for Winnipeg Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I would say that I do not agree with everything they had 
to say, and I know they are not surprised to hear that, I wanted 
to take a moment to thank the member for Compton—Stanstead for 
acknowledging the hard work of the high commission and 
immigration officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also acknowledge the fact that I too had a chance to sit 
in on interviews in our posts abroad and I know the dedication of 
the staff.  I think it was very important for that to be 
acknowledged in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member made one point that I would like to comment on, 
and that is the fact that he has been waiting for a new 
immigration and refugee protection bill.  He said that the 
Citizenship Act was not as important as the other and wondered 
why he had not yet seen an immigration bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out to him that the government has said that a new 
immigration act is a priority.  A white paper was issued in 
January 1999.  More than that, as a member of the Standing 
Committee on Citizenship and Immigration, he would know that the 
committee tabled its report yesterday.  I want to point out to 
him that I have been anxiously awaiting that report, because the 
committee's work in this area has been extremely important in 
helping to define the policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that the member opposite made important and 
valuable contributions during the work of the committee on that 
report, and I want to assure him and all members of the House 
that I will be taking into consideration the recommendations of 
the committee in the development of a new bill, which I hope to 
see tabled in the House as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that citizenship is at the heart of what it means to be 
a Canadian, and Bill C-16 is a very important bill to Canadians 
and to future Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to comment on the members' speeches and to 
acknowledge the expertise and interest which they have had in 
this very important issue concerning citizenship and immigration 
and refugee policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Winnipeg Centre, the member for 
Compton—Stanstead, the member for Rosemont and even my critic 
from the Reform Party play a very important role on the 
committee, as does my parliamentary secretary and the other 
members.  I appreciate their advice and I look forward to being 
at committee to defend Bill C-16 in the very near future, as soon 
as the House sees fit to send it to committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been listening very carefully to the debate.  We will 
take into consideration the representations made by all of those 
who have taken the opportunity to speak to the bill and we will 
look very carefully at the representations of others when we are 
at committee.  I expect the committee will hear witnesses.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been a long road for Bill C-16 and its predecessor Bill 
C-63.  It is very important that this bill proceed.  I am pleased 
to stand in my place today to acknowledge the important work that 
has been done on this bill.  I hope to see it become a reality 
soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for 
her comments.  I guess I would have to say, though, that last 
October the former minister promised us that a bill would be on 
the table.  Had the bill come forward at that time naturally it 
would have gone into committee.  Then we would have been able to 
work on it and get some of the amendments in that we wanted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have heard recently, the critic from the Reform Party had 
a press conference and released a supposed draft bill.  We have 
seen what was in that bill, so it will be easy to compare now to 
ensure the work we have done in committee gets into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a couple of interesting amendments which I was able to get 
in, such as asking for photos and prints on first contact, for 
which a lot of our witnesses had asked.  Something that will come 
back to the House is the fact that we have had in the immigration 
law for quite a while now what we call a safe third country.  Not 
very much has been done in the negotiations with other countries 
in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment I put in asked that this be reported back to the 
House on a yearly basis so we could see if there were advancement 
in the file.  To that point a lot of people did not even realize 
it was in the law and not much was being done about it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK266"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to encourage the 
government to adopt amendments to Bill C-16, an act respecting 
Canadian citizenship.  The legislation proposes to make several 
changes to the current act, with the intention of providing more 
clearly defined guidelines, upgrading sections and replacing 
current procedures with a new administrative structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some more clearly defined parts in the bill.  I like 
to give credit where credit is due, even if it is a little.  The 
bill reached report stage and third reading before the end of the 
first session but it has yet to be passed.  There are only four 
changes to the bill, despite committee hearings and a debate in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration mentioned in her 
speech on February 3 that during public consultations on 
legislative review the main focus of the people with whom she met 
was immigration.  Why has the minister chosen to do nothing on 
the present inefficient immigration legislation?  Instead she has 
chosen to fiddle with the citizenship act, which reminds us of 
the typical Liberal way of doing things, merely tinkering with 
the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She also mentioned in her speech on Bill C-63, the act 
respecting Canadian citizenship, that the primary mission in her 
department was to contribute to building a stronger Canada.  I am 
wondering if by bungling a billion dollars in HRDC the government 
makes Canada stronger or weaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arrogant Liberal government uses departments for slush funds 
to give away grants and contributions like CIDA, CIDA Inc., 
western economic diversification, ACOA, Indian and northern 
affairs, heritage and many others.  I will not go into that but I 
wanted to make the point.  With its political interference, poor 
accountability and mismanagement, this weak Liberal government is 
weakening Canada and certainly not making it stronger. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By increasing taxes to death, does the government make or break 
families?  By being given broad based tax relief families can be 
strengthened.  Strong families make strong communities and strong 
communities make a strong nation.  Having said that, I would like 
to go into the nitty-gritty of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The four changes made in this legislation by the Liberals 
between the first and second sessions of this parliament are as 
follows.  The first is physical presence.  According to clause 6, 
the time requirement for physical presence in Canada as 
pertaining to applications for citizenship has been changed from 
three years out of five to three years out of six.  This is a 
positive change.  It will allow people who travel on business a 
greater opportunity and incentive to make Canada their home, and 
we appreciate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second is presence in terms of spousal considerations in 
subclause 19(2).  This clause has been removed from Bill C-16. It 
would have allowed spouses of those employed by the federal or 
provincial governments outside Canada, for example the military, 
diplomats, et cetera, to collect time toward citizenship.  In 
effect, when posted outside Canada they would be considered to be 
residing in Canada if living with a spouse while he or she, as 
the case may be, was working outside our country, maybe for the 
government in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a negative change because the clause presented an 
equality problem.  The spouses of those employed by private 
businesses were not given the same opportunity.  This is valid 
only for government employees.  What about those who are employed 
by companies that have their head offices in Canada but have to 
spend time outside the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third is the definition of spouse.  The clause allowing the 
minister to determine the definition of a spouse has been removed 
from Bill C-16.  This is another positive change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth is a response to the Mennonites in clause 57.  In 
response to lobbying by the Mennonites clause 57 has been added 
to Bill C-16.  This clause will allow three generations of 
descendants of a Canadian citizen who have never lived in Canada 
to apply for citizenship for a period of three years from the 
time the legislation is passed.  Is this not amazing?  It goes to 
show that no one is treated equally by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those four items are the limit of the changes the Liberals have 
made to the bill.  The government is weak.  The minister received 
the recommendations of the government dominated Standing 
Committee on Citizenship and Immigration in 1994.  The government 
has taken over five years to prepare this legislation which still 
does not address the committee's key recommendations.  The 
Liberals do not listen to anyone.  They do as they please and 
still there are many problems with the bill.  Let me go over some 
of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citizenship at birth is in subclauses 4(1) to 4(4).  Bill C-16 
states in effect that all children born in Canada, except of 
course the children of foreign diplomats, will continue to 
automatically acquire Canadian citizenship regardless of the 
immigration or citizenship status in Canada of their parents. 
This is contrary to what the standing committee heard.  This is 
contrary to what the departmental officials stated and this is 
contrary to the position of the official opposition and many 
other Canadians who support it. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition supports an immigration and citizenship 
policy that requires children born in Canada to take the 
citizenship of their parents.  Only children born in Canada to 
landed immigrants would assume Canadian citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem is the conditions for granting citizenship. 
First, subclause 6(1)(b) deals with presence in Canada.  Bill 
C-16 defines the term permanent resident more concisely than does 
the current act.  The existing legislation may be loosely 
interpreted.  Some individuals have been found to be residing in 
Canada because they had a bank account here or they owned 
property in Canada without having actually resided on Canadian 
soil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could someone be a resident when not residing in Canada? 
Bill C-16 calls for 1,095 days of physical presence in Canada in 
the six years preceding application for citizenship.  Bill C-16 
does not provide any mechanism for determining when applicants 
arrive in Canada or when they leave.  That is the root cause of 
the problem when we do not know when and how someone left the 
country or through what channels someone came to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next one is penalties for bureaucratic delays in subclause 
6(1)(b).  The current act allows individuals whose claim for 
refugee status is approved to count each full day of residency in 
Canada from the date of application as a half day toward the 
total needed for their citizenship application requirement.  Bill 
C-16 removes this provision so that applicants will now be 
penalized for the system's bureaucratic delays even when the 
delays are no fault of the applicant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another one is redefining the family in clause 43.  Bill C-16 
grants the minister the power for what constitutes a relationship 
between parent and child.  That is wrong.  The next one is the 
famous one, blatant patronage in clauses 31 and 32.  Bill C-16 
maintains the tradition of patronage appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are famous for patronage appointments.  Probably 
they have broken all records in history.  Here again they do 
that.  All citizenship judges will have all their duties taken 
over by departmental officials except for ceremonial duties. 
There is room for appointing someone for doing some favour for 
the Liberal Party, the governing party in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another one is language requirements to gain citizenship in 
clause 6.  This is a very important one.  I have had many calls 
on this point in my office because my constituency of Surrey 
Central has more of an immigrant population than any other 
constituency in Canada.  It is the largest constituency in Canada 
in terms of population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-16 states that the applicant must have an adequate 
knowledge of one of the official languages of Canada.  No 
provisions are included on how this is to be judged or by whom it 
will be judged.  Being a good citizen has nothing to do with 
language skills or how many languages one can speak.  Being a 
citizen means one obeys the laws and makes a positive 
contribution to society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about those who are unfortunate, who are mute, deaf or 
blind?  How will they pass that test?  I understand it is 
important that someone should be able to effectively communicate, 
but I have seen examples of people in this country who could not 
speak a word of English or French but are now fluent, excellent 
in business and have made tremendous contributions to Canadian 
society and to our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another one is the citizenship oath in clause 34 of the bill. 
There was little public input on the content of the new oath in 
Bill C-16.  The minister prepared this oath on her own.  She did 
not consult anyone in Canada on what the wording of the oath 
should be. She ignored listening to Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's first legislation should have been aimed at 
fixing a failed immigration system rather than tinkering with the 
citizenship act at this time. More than five years after the 
Liberal controlled and dominated standing committee made its 
recommendation on citizenship, the minister retabled the 
legislation.  It delivers little of what was recommended by the 
committee.  She chose not to listen to Canadians.  She chose to 
ignore the official opposition and other parties in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With globalization and advancement in technology, transport and 
telecommunications, in an ideal world the boundaries of countries 
could disappear for the purpose of mobility of the people.  There 
should be peace, prosperity and harmony but this wonderful dream 
has not yet been fulfilled.  I believe it will be fulfilled 
sometime down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biggest curse the world has is our inability to see humanity 
in all of us.  Among us are those who do not respect law and 
order, those who know only their rights and not their 
responsibilities.  There are criminals and terrorists 
unfortunately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to take appropriate measures to protect our citizens and 
secure their safety and future.  We have to make Canada a better 
place.  It should not be a sieve where terrorists and criminals 
pass through and jeopardize the safety and security of our 
citizens and the future of this great country. Therefore our 
legislation should be carefully crafted and drafted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new changes to the Immigration Act the government will 
propose have been leaked to the official opposition immigration 
critic.  The Canadian public is already very concerned about how 
badly the Liberals are going to fail in giving us what we want 
which is to fix the flawed and broken immigration and refugee 
system in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure members and all Canadians are concerned about refugees 
coming here in boats but Ottawa is missing the boat on refugees. 
The proposed changes to the Immigration Act will not do anything 
to fix the many faults with Canada's refugee adjudication 
process.  The new rules will erode public support for real 
refugees.  Who will suffer?  The genuine refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changes to the Immigration Act contemplated by the immigration 
minister will not streamline the refugee adjudication process. 
They will not do anything to fix that.  They will not stop bogus 
claimants from clogging the system.  The pipeline is clogged. 
Genuine refugees are already suffering.  The cost of processing 
applicants should be reduced but it will go up because more 
people, bogus refugees, criminals and terrorists are involved. We 
have to do more work to scrutinize them.  They will not 
discourage human smuggling.  Erosion of public support for 
genuine refugees is the likely outcome of Bill C-16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Nations convention on refugees states that countries 
should accept those who have “a valid founded fear of being 
persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership 
in a particular social group, or political opinion”.  The 
Minister of Citizen and Immigration proposes to expand the 
definition of refugees to include a new category five, “people 
in need of protection”.  This extended definition could lead to 
more dubious refugee claims.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A 1998 government report called for an end to patronage 
appointments to the Immigration and Refugee Board.  It urged 
Ottawa to appoint experienced bureaucrats to adjudicate refugee 
hearings despite the fact that immigration department officials 
could do a more effective job than inexperienced political 
appointees.  Again the minister chose to ignore this 
recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another level of appeal has been added that will clog the system 
even more.  According to the act, unsuccessful claimants will not 
be removed from the country.  Also no deterrent is in place for 
human smugglers.  Between 1995 and 1998 only 14 smuggling charges 
were laid.  The maximum fine was $4,000 and no one served a 
single day in jail.  That is surprising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is supposed to define the criteria for 
obtaining the world's most respected citizenship, Canadian 
citizenship.  Our citizenship is the very foundation of the 
Canadian identity which unites us from coast to coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To summarize, let me go over some of the points because they are 
interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another level of appeal has been added to the system and it will 
clog the system.  The existing system along with its several 
rounds of appeal has already created a backlog of 30,000 refugee 
claimants.  Rather than streamline the appeal process, this bill 
adds another level of appeal.  There are already many layers.  It 
is like an onion; we peel off one layer and there is another 
layer.  We have to stop this onion effect.  We have to be focused 
and have a clear-cut judicial process which should be keen on 
helping genuine refugees and not bogus refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the Federal Court of Appeal ruled that Canada's 
obligation to protect its citizens outweighs its obligation to 
keep suspected foreign terrorists from torture.  Under the new 
legislation which we are debating, if there is a chance of 
mismanagement upon their return, unsuccessful refugee claimants 
will not be sent home.  They will not be sent back to countries 
which are deemed unacceptable by the minister.  Migrant smugglers 
are sure to exploit this loophole.  We have to plug the loophole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current legislation, penalties for smuggling range 
from $5,000 to $100,000 as well as prison terms from five to ten 
years.  The bill proposes to strengthen the penalty for smuggling 
10 or more illegal immigrants to a maximum fine of $1 million or 
life imprisonment.  What about when there are batches of nine 
illegal immigrants?  Then the penalties are different and less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of protestations to the contrary, by drafting the bill 
before the all-party committee on illegal immigration has made 
its recommendations, and by planning to introduce the bill on 
March 30, the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration is sending 
a signal that it is a done deal. 
That is the Liberal style.

</I></B></P><P align=left>To safeguard genuine refugees and the public interest, the 
minister should scrap the bill. She should hear what the 
committee has to say and re-write this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned that Canadian citizenship is one of the most 
respected citizenships in the world. We are proud of this fact. 
We have to maintain respect for Canadian citizenship. Canadian 
citizenship is based on equality. One criteria for Canadian 
citizenship is understanding the equality of all Canadian 
citizens, but that is not the case with the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, I tabled some petitions from concerned Canadians, 
many of which were signed by my constituents but were also signed 
by people from all across Canada.  I received many petitions on 
this issue. The petitioners, our respected senior citizens in 
this case, asked the weak Liberal government to treat all seniors 
equally in the allocation of old age security benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand that there is a difference between immigrants 
and citizens.  To some extent we can probably understand the 
extent to which the difference exists.  But for senior citizens 
the allocation of old age security benefits depends on the 
country of origin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once a person is a Canadian citizen what does where the person 
came from or his or her race and ethnicity matter?  Why are 
citizens treated differently based on their country of origin and 
placed under arbitrary restrictions?  These are the questions the 
petitioners asked of the government. Why does the government 
treat some citizens as second class citizens?  The government 
through its programs has designated some citizens as hyphenated 
Canadians based on their race, ethnicity and country of origin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are debating the amendments to the citizenship act and it is 
not clear whether it is the government's intention to dilute 
Canadian citizenship or create different tiers of Canadians. A 
Canadian citizen is a Canadian citizen.  No Canadian citizen is 
superior or inferior to another Canadian citizen. This is what 
equality is all about.  All Canadian citizens are Canadian 
citizens, period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should we not integrate new citizens rather than segregate them? 
The government sponsors the multiculturalism policy, the 
immigration policy and many other policies.  It is bent on 
segregating Canadians rather than integrating them into Canadian 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is appalling that the Secretary of State for Multiculturalism 
says she is proud to call herself a Trinidad-Canadian. When will 
a Canadian federal minister be proud to call herself or himself a 
proud Canadian? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all proud of our religion, culture, race, ethnicity and 
our country of origin.  When we have adopted and embraced Canada 
as our new home, we cannot get mail by writing part of the old 
address on the envelope.  A Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian 
period, both in French and English and in any other language in 
the world.  A Canadian is a Canadian.

even-handed speech. He mentioned not only those aspects of the 
bill with which he disagrees but also those parts of the bill 
which he feels strengthens the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things I did not hear him mention is a problem that I 
run into frequently in my duties as a member of parliament. 
We have the so-called brain drain which has certainly affected 
our country with large numbers of professionals, doctors, nurses, 
teachers, engineers, chemists, having gone to greener pastures, 
having left the difficulties created by this government and the 
previous Tory government for them to practise their professions 
in this country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have dealt with a number of instances where doctors have 
applied to come to Canada at the invitation of certain medical 
facilities that are having a great deal of difficulty.  In my 
rural constituency, many hospitals and many communities have lost 
doctors that they simply cannot replace and there are citizens 
who do not have the medical service that they require. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is frustrating is that a hospital or a medical clinic may 
recruit a doctor from South Africa, England, Ireland or wherever, 
eminently qualified to perform the services that are needed. 
However, there is no give in Immigration Canada to provide a way 
for these people to come without going through sometimes years of 
application, reapplication and the cost involved with that.  The 
consequence is that doctors in my experience have thrown up their 
hands and said “This application has gone on long enough”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask my esteemed colleague if he and the committee have 
given any thought in this legislation as to how Canada might seek 
to improve itself by reversing the brain drain by modifying the 
immigration policies to accommodate this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
thoughtfulness of the question from my hon. colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with him that our health care system, which I call 
sickness care system, is in a continuous declining state.  There 
are reasons, and of course the immigration policy could be one of 
them, but there are other policies of this government as well. 
The government is responsible for the deteriorating situation of 
our health care system because it cut $35 billion from the health 
care system, even though it tried to put some money back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the cause for the deteriorating health care system.  I am 
sure this weak, arrogant Liberal government owes an apology to 
Canadians.  Not only is it the government's moral responsibility 
to fix it but it owes an apology to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the billion dollar boondoggle in HRDC and then 
see in the new budget that more money has gone, $1.5 billion, to 
HRDC rather than to health care, it reminds me that this 
government is in the habit of not putting the money where its 
mouth is, but putting the money where its back pocket is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming back to immigration, yes, the government can do a lot. 
The government can bring the respect of Canadian citizenship to 
its highest level by being fair, by respecting the principles of 
equality and by respecting the new immigrants, those who come to 
this country, to help them get into the system, to make them 
realize that this is their home, this is the future of their 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The doctors, engineers and professionals are leaving this 
country because of high taxes, the boondoggles, the misuse of 
taxpayers' money, the killing of taxpayers through high taxes and 
the immigration policies which are not fair.  All these factors 
are compounding the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they are debating about who their leader is or that their 
leader should go, I think this is not only the time for the 
Leader of the Liberal Party to go, it is time for the Liberals to 
go.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-16 contains many provisions which are identical or very 
similar to the current ones. If I may, I will highlight some 
nuances and differences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start with a provision in this part of the bill, which is 
quite interesting. Paragraph 2(2)(<I>c</I>) states that a person 
resides in Canada if the person is physically present in Canada 
and is not subject to a probation order, on parole or in jail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More specifically on the issue of birth in Canada, the bill 
would maintain the current rule that children born in Canada are 
Canadian citizens, as stated in paragraph 4(1)(<I>a</I>). 
The only exceptions, as is the case now, concern children of 
foreign diplomats and their employees. That is paragraph 4(2). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to derivative citizenship, any person born abroad of 
Canadian parents is automatically a Canadian citizen. This is 
often referred to as “citizenship by transmission”. Second and 
subsequent generation children born abroad are also granted 
citizenship automatically, but they lose on attaining 28 years 
of age, unless they registered and have either resided in Canada 
for a period of at least one year immediately before applying 
for citizenship or established a substantial connection with 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would restrict the automatic transmission of 
citizenship to second generation children born abroad and 
toughen the requirements for these second generation citizens 
who want to retain citizenship after the age of 28. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 14 provides that, to retain citizenship after the age of 
28, a person would have to apply to the minister and would have 
to have resided in Canada for at least 1,095 days during the six 
years before so applying. As we will see later on, physical 
presence in Canada would be required during a period of three 
years. This is the same residency requirement that would have to 
be met by all permanent residents seeking citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for third and subsequent generations, they would not be able 
to acquire Canadian citizenship unless they meet the usual 
immigration and citizenship requirements, just like any other 
individual who chooses Canada as his or her country of adoption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To avoid the risk of statelessness for third generation children 
born outside of Canada, clause 11 provides the granting of 
citizenship, on application, to a person who is less than 
28 years of age and who has never acquired, or had the right to 
acquire, citizenship of any country, but has a birth parent who 
is a Canadian citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To qualify, this person must have resided in Canada for at least 
three years during the six previous years, and must not have 
been convicted of an offence against national security. The 
nature of the offence is not stipulated, and this specific 
category of offence is not stipulated in either the Canadian 
Security Intelligence Service Act or the Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-16 modifies the requirements for acquiring citizenship 
other than at birth. One of the major changes clarifies the 
residence requirements. 
This important change concerns the definition of residence as 
physical presence in Canada, under subparagraph 2(2)(<I>c</I>). The 
proposed objective requirement of residence, specifically to be 
physically present for three years, or 1,095 days, during the 
prescribed period, would do away with the huge uncertainties 
caused by the present legislation.

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the current legislation requires three years of 
residence, the word residence is not defined. Consequently, 
judicial decisions with radically opposed interpretations have 
greatly complicated enforcement of the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The year following the coming into force, in 1977, of the 
present legislation, the Federal Court held in a case that 
physical presence in Canada was not necessary to meet the 
requirements. The judge found that applicants had to demonstrate 
that they had established a significant connection with Canada 
throughout the period, whether or not they had been physically 
present in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To demonstrate this connection, one might produce evidence of 
maintenance of residence, even though this was not absolutely 
necessary, of accounts in Canadian banks, investments, 
membership in clubs, provincial driving permits, and so on.  In 
extreme cases, some applicants were granted citizenship even if 
they had actually been present in Canada only a few months, and 
even a few days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, other federal court judges strongly disagreed with this 
approach and refused to excuse prolonged absences.  So an 
inconsistent jurisprudence evolved, which made the enforcement 
of the legislation unforeseeable and uncertain; some say it even 
compromised the residence requirement and therefore the value of 
the whole granting of Canadian citizenship process. 
In its 1994 report, the standing committee recommended that the 
legal definition of residence call for a substantial period of 
physical presence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of language, Bill C-16 maintains the obligation to 
show an adequate knowledge of one of the official languages. 
Unfortunately, French is not the language chosen in most cases. 
Also, the applicants are still required to demonstrate an 
adequate knowledge of Canada and of the responsibilities and 
privileges of citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some new provisions govern the granting of citizenship to 
children adopted by Canadian citizens abroad. The present 
legislation states that children adopted abroad must become 
permanent residents before granting them citizenship can even be 
considered, and there are loads of consequences to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, children must undergo the same medical examination as any 
other person who applies for landed resident status or else have 
obtained a special exemption. Second, this means that children 
adopted by Canadian parents who live abroad and want to stay 
abroad cannot become landed residents and consequently Canadian 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation provides that minor children adopted abroad in 
accordance with the laws of the country of residence of the 
children or parents may be granted citizenship on application. 
The adoption must also meet the following criteria: the adoption 
must be in the best interest of the child; it must have created 
a genuine relationship of parent and child; and it must not have 
been intended to circumvent the requirements under any enactment 
for admission to Canada or citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 10 of Bill C-16 is a new provision specifically enabling 
the Minister “for the purposes of this Act”—that is to grant 
citizenship—to deem a person who has resided in Canada for at 
least 10 years to be or have become a permanent resident. This 
clause is for persons who thought they were Canadian citizens 
while they were not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for renunciation and revocation, Bill C-16, as the existing 
legislation, sets out the circumstances where citizens may 
renounce their Canadian citizenship. The criteria are very 
similar. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1630"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT78"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT78"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1630
<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under clause 16, the renunciation of citizenship may be revoked, 
just like the citizenship itself and the restoration of 
citizenship could be, if the minister is satisfied that there 
has been false representations, fraud or concealment of material 
circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The procedure being used now to challenge the revocation order 
remains essentially unchanged. It is set out at clause 17. When 
a person is notified that the minister intends to revoke his or 
her citizenship, this person can request the minister to refer 
the matter to the federal court trial division. A new element is 
that the court will make its determination on a balance of 
probabilities, under clause 17(1)(<I>b</I>). 
This would solve the problem of certain decisions of the trial 
division as to the criteria that should apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To sum up, Bill C-16 would, with a few exceptions, maintain the 
present provisions on the revocation of citizenship. At present, 
people who lose their citizenship must first be admitted for 
permanent residence and may apply for citizenship after having 
resided in Canada for one year immediately before applying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill requires people in this situation to have resided in 
Canada for at least 365 days during the two years immediately 
before applying for citizenship. This is provided under clause 
19. Here again, the important change is that the new definition 
of residence would require actual presence in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-16 gives a new power to the Governor in Council, who, on 
the recommendation of the minister, may deny citizenship if 
“there are reasonable grounds to believe that it is not in the 
public interest for a person to become a citizen”. Not only is 
this power new, it would also constitute a substantive change to 
the current legislation according to which citizenship is a 
right and not a privilege, provided that certain objective 
criteria are met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there is no definition of public interest, the new clause 
would, for example, make it possible not to grant citizenship to 
a person who distributes hate literature but who otherwise meets 
the criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-16 would maintain, with some changes, existing procedures 
relating to the denial of citizenship for reasons of national 
security. 
As it is the case now, the process would begin with a report by 
the minister to the Security Intelligence Review Committee 
saying that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the 
person has engaged or will engage in an activity that 
constitutes a threat to the security of Canada or an activity 
that is part of a pattern of criminal activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill states that, within ten days after the report is made, 
the person who is the subject of a report shall be notified that 
the report has been made and made aware of possible 
consequences. The committee would then investigate using the 
procedure set out in the Canadian Security Intelligence Service 
Act and, as soon as practicable, send to the person who is the 
subject of the report a statement summarizing the information 
available to the review committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new provision would have the review committee consider whether 
the information may be disclosed without injury to national 
security or to the safety of persons. That is covered in 
paragraph 25(3). On completion of its investigation, the review 
committee would report to the Governor in Council and provide 
the report's conclusions to the person who is the subject of the 
report, but not necessarily at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, Bill C-16 adds somewhat to the list of things preventing an 
individual from obtaining Canadian citizenship.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Crimes committed in foreign countries would be taken into 
account as well as those committed in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill prohibits granting citizenship to any person who is 
under a removal order or subject to an inquiry under the 
Immigration Act that may lead to removal from Canada or the loss 
of permanent resident status. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also brings important changes in the way citizenship 
applications are processed. Citizenship judges, who are working 
under the direction of a chief judge, would be replaced and 
their basic duties fulfilled by officials acting under the 
delegated authority of the minister. This is under section 44. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ceremonial duties would be assigned to citizenship 
commissioners, appointed by the governor in council to serve 
full-time or part-time, during pleasure, for a term of not more 
than five years. That is under section 31 of the bill. Each 
commissioner would receive a remuneration. A chief commissioner 
could be appointed to supervise and co-ordinate the work of the 
commissioners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to focus on the role of the commissioners. 
According to the bill: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>31(6) To be eligible for appointment as, and to serve as, a 
Citizenship Commissioner, a person must be a citizen, have 
demonstrated an understanding of the values of good citizenship 
and be recognized for their valuable civic contribution. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The duties of a citizenship commissioner would be the following: 
to preside at citizenship ceremonies; to promote active 
citizenship in the community; to provide, on the minister's 
request, advise and recommendation about citizenship, the 
exercise of the minister's discretion, appropriate methods to 
evaluate citizenship applicants knowledge of Canada, the 
responsibilities and rights of citizenship and official 
languages. It is therefore of the utmost importance that 
commissioners be chosen very carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to speak briefly about the 
citizenship oath. Personally, and I am not speaking for my 
party, there is something I do not like in this oath. It is an 
allegiance oath, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—to Her Majesty Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, and to her heirs 
and successors. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was raised as a Republican. Not an American style Republican, 
but an anti-monarchist nonetheless. I do not agree with the fact 
that Canada, an independent country, still has a foreigner as 
its head of state. This is why I dislike the oath as it is 
written. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I had to take the oath as a member of parliament, I tried 
to skip certain parts, because I do not believe that we in 
Canada should swear allegiance to the Queen of England. I would 
agree if Canada had a leader from this country as its head of 
state. The governor general could bear the title of president, 
something with which I would agree more.

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak today to Bill C-16, the 
citizenship act.  I will be sharing my time with the member for 
Halifax West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a relatively new member of parliament.  I was elected in a 
byelection last November.  I am especially pleased to get up and, 
for the first time, talk about a subject that is near and dear to 
my heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have very strong feelings about immigrants and refugees.  Like 
many people in the House, my grandparents were immigrants to this 
country; on the one side from Germany and on the other from the 
Ukraine.  My family members were farmers and settlers.  As I was 
growing up, we did have a multicultural society for the time, a 
patchwork quilt in Saskatchewan of a variety of people, mostly 
from central Europe, in addition to the aboriginal people of 
course who had lived here for thousands of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My wife's family were Mennonite farmers who similarly had a long 
and interesting history of moving from place to place to place 
and always making great contributions in whatever place they 
lived.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the strongest experiences I have had with immigrant and 
refugee people was during the 1973 disaster in Chile when people 
had to leave their country.  Interestingly, many of them at that 
time were branded as criminals by a regime that was actually 
criminal.  I will have more to say about criminality and 
immigrants and refugees in a moment.  It was clear and remains 
clear what a great contribution the Chilean community made to 
Canada.  I am very pleased to say, in a personal sense, that some 
of these Chileans, who I met in the mid-seventies, remain my 
closest and dearest friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1979, 1980 and 1981 I worked with the Catholic Archdiocese of 
Regina.  One of the very busy but pleasant jobs that we had was 
to welcome the Vietnamese boat people who were adrift in the 
South China Sea and ended up, in some cases, in our country.  We 
co-operated with the immigration department in setting up 
umbrella agreements so that communities could accept these 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to mention that perhaps 10 to 15 years after these 
people came here destitute, and, in some cases, not even the 
clothes on their backs when they got off the ships, a significant 
academic study was completed showing that the Vietnamese refugees 
in Canada had made a very significant economic and social 
contribution to our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both my wife and I have been involved in refugee work from 
almost the beginning of our marriage, which goes back many years. 
We have, in successive times and places, welcomed Central 
Americans, Iraqis, Iranians, eastern Europeans, Somalis, 
Eritreans, Bosnians, Africans, particularly from Sudan, and the 
most recent family we have worked with is an Afghani family who 
had spent years in refugee camps in Pakistan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do believe I have some knowledge on which to speak, although 
not as much as my wife, but I can tell the House that it is often 
very worthwhile and interesting to work with people before making 
pronouncements about what one fears may be their negative 
contribution to our country.  That has been far from our 
experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a more philosophical vein, I did spend a number of years 
working for the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops who often 
had things to say about immigration policy and the whole question 
of immigrants and refugees.  I will only mention one point and it 
is of a theological nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I learned, from things that the bishop said about the biblical 
code of people in countries at the time of Christ and before, how 
to welcome a stranger.  When the stranger came, they opened their 
tent; they killed the fatted calf; they literally rolled out the 
carpet.  One of the statements the bishops issued while I was 
working with them on the immigration policy was called “Welcome 
the Stranger”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into more specifics of the bill, I want to mention 
my political experience, brief as it may be.  During the 
byelection in November 1999, I was pleasantly surprised by the 
number of immigrant peoples in the riding of 
Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, particularly on the west side of 
Saskatoon where I was doing my door knocking.  When I knocked on 
the doors of Filipino people, Vietnamese people and people from 
other countries, I was often welcomed in a way that I was 
sometimes not at other doors.  These people were extremely 
pleased to be taking some part in the democratic process.   I 
remember various episodes where people told me that it was not 
only their duty but their pleasure to vote and become involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can remember a Filipino man in particular.  When I went to his 
house in the dark one evening, he invited me in and asked if I 
was alone.  When I said that I was alone, he said “Well, what a 
wonderful country when you can campaign politically without 
having to take your bodyguards along with you”.  That was the 
experience that he was bringing to this and that was his view of 
our country and now his country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will summarize by saying that I have great respect, admiration 
and compassion for immigrant and refugee peoples. This arises out 
of my family background, my life experiences and my philosophical 
orientation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that often there is a backlash toward immigrants and 
refugees.  For all the reasons I have mentioned, I certainly do 
not share that.  I try at every opportunity to talk to people 
about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say as well, as my colleague from Winnipeg Centre said 
earlier today, that there is an element of self-interest in our 
welcoming immigrant and refugee people.  He talked about how 
Canada should think about and decide how many people it wants and 
what sort of population it wants, and cast its policies in that 
way.  If we look at our past, and he mentioned the time of Sifton 
when the great west was settled, there was a great openness for 
people from other countries because we knew that we needed them. 
I would say that we still need them today and will continue to 
need them in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we have any doubt of that, there was an interesting story in 
the newspaper within the past week about Japan and Korea and how 
they will have to have fairly massive immigration.  Otherwise 
they will see a loss in population and a shortage of workers, and 
I would say a shortage of prosperity.  That is something which 
Canada has to look at as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not mean that it should be completely open ended.  We 
have to have due process.  We have to ensure that we do not have 
queue jumping.  We have to do checks to ensure that we are not 
accepting people with a criminal past into our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may, I would like to make several specific references to 
the bill.  I have talked about due process.  A good number of 
groups appeared, on a previous incarnation of this bill, to talk 
about things they thought important, and they made some very good 
points.  I will refer to a few of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a possibility, the way the legislation is structured, 
of giving the minister new powers to annul citizenship and 
broadening measures to revoke it.  This means that citizens born 
outside Canada could lose citizenship, even after many years 
here, without due process, and in some cases without the right to 
a hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are lengthened residency requirements for citizenship.  We 
are concerned about some of these. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are increased language requirements, imposing more 
rigorous requirements on applicants for citizenship.  This would 
penalize people who have difficulty learning a new language, and 
elderly people, often women, survivors of torture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could tell the House of the experiences I have had since being 
elected of immigrants who have come to me who have had great 
problems one way or another with the language, which creates 
great problems with the immigration officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be a certain loss of discretion in citizenship 
making.  Citizenship judges will no longer be the people who make 
decisions.  Frequently it will be civil servants working within 
specific guidelines.  This concerns our caucus as well.  We 
believe that cabinet powers to refuse citizenship are too broad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned that business people may find the requirement 
to live in Canada for three of six years such a difficulty that 
many may not immigrate to Canada and may take their business 
elsewhere as a result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, I and my colleagues in the New Democratic Party feel 
that it is time this bill be brought to bear and that we have new 
regulations for immigration, but at the same time we have certain 
concerns with the bill, some of which I have outlined very 
briefly and others which my colleague from Winnipeg Centre talked 
about in more detail earlier today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would hope to see in committee some changes which would 
improve this bill and make it more possible for us, perhaps, to 
support it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to have the opportunity to rise today to speak, 
along with my colleagues from Winnipeg Centre and 
Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, to this very important topic of 
citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been mentioned that citizenship is something which all 
Canadians hold very dear to their hearts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of problems come through my constituency office around 
immigration issues and the difficulties people have in coming to 
Canada.  Quite often there are a lot of bureaucratic 
entanglements before they can get here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of one situation in particular of a young man who had 
married a young lady from his home of Lebanon. 
He had been separated from his bride for almost a year and was 
still encountering difficulties in bringing her to Canada.  I was 
able to get involved in that case and help move it along to the 
point where she eventually was admitted to Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shortly after that, he and his wife and their family invited me 
and my wife to a party they were having to celebrate this 
occasion.  It was a wonderful experience to be in the midst of 
the party with so many relatives, young children and older 
people, all having a wonderful time.  They were enjoying the 
hospitality and friendship of each other.  My wife and I looked 
at each other and thought it was a shame that people have to go 
through such difficulty before they can come together to enjoy 
each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why it is important that the whole issue of immigration 
and citizenship be looked upon very seriously and dealt with in a 
way that will show respect for our fellow human beings and enable 
us to enjoy each other's company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the bill, some of our concerns have already been 
mentioned.  I want to touch upon a couple of issues concerning 
citizenship which I think are very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 21 of Bill C-16 would introduce a new power to permit the 
governor in council, upon a report from the minister, to deny a 
person's citizenship “where there are reasonable grounds to 
believe that it is not in the public interest for the person to 
become a citizen”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some concerns about that.  That power would not only be 
new, it would also represent somewhat of a conceptual change from 
the present law.  Under the present law citizenship is seen 
pretty much as a right more so than a privilege.  It is a right 
which all people should have, provided that the objective criteria 
have been fulfilled.  The new provision would put the whole 
question of citizenship into the area of a privilege which would 
be conferred upon people.  The question of the definition of 
public interest is not really clarified in the legislation.  We 
do not know what is meant by public interest and what will be 
used to deny citizenship to an individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to trigger this section of the bill the minister would 
be required to provide the person concerned with a summary of the 
contents of the proposed report to the governor in council.  The 
person would then have 30 days in which to respond, in writing, 
to the minister.  If the minister proceeded with the report and 
the governor in council agreed, the latter would order 
citizenship to be denied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision of cabinet—and this is the part we want to look at 
very carefully—would not be subject to appeal or review by any 
court and would be valid for five years.  This order would be 
conclusive proof of the matters that were stated in the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a situation where cabinet could decide, for various 
reasons which are not clearly amplified in the bill, that in the 
public interest someone is not fit to be granted Canadian 
citizenship and there would be no appeal.  That gives a very big 
power to refuse citizenship on the basis of a public interest 
which could be defined in any way, shape or form.  We have a lot 
of concern about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also concerned about the citizenship commissioners.  The 
new bill would introduce a major change in the way citizenship 
applications are dealt with.  Many citizenship judges are doing 
an excellent job and I commend them for their dedication to their 
task. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had the opportunity to attend in my riding many of the 
citizenship courts and to witness firsthand the excellent job 
which these citizenship judges do in imparting to the new 
citizens the joy, responsibilities and obligations involved in 
being a Canadian citizen.  I want to commend the many citizenship 
judges throughout our country for the fine work they do. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1655"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-16 we find that these judges would be replaced by 
citizenship commissioners.  Their duties would be full time or 
part time and they would be appointed by the governor in council 
during pleasure.  Again, the words “during pleasure” cause us a 
bit of concern.  That is something which should be looked at very 
closely.  We really should not make change for the sake of making 
change if there is no rationale behind changing the citizenship 
judges and the fine job they do to a new system.  I am not sure 
we would be moving forward in a very positive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also not clear how the advisory side of the commissioner's 
mandate would be accomplished under the bill, nor why the 
commissioners would be particularly well suited to provide such 
advice.  Again, this is something that causes us concern and we 
feel it should be looked at very closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of things upon which I could elaborate, but I 
would conclude by emphasizing that from my experience the whole 
process of a person coming to our country, having the right to 
citizenship and going through the process which moves them into 
that status is very, very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have seen many new citizens who exude a sense of pride and a 
sense of happiness when they are declared Canadian citizens.  I 
have been at the ceremonies where tears fall from the eyes of 
many of these people as they are welcomed into Canadian society. 
As we do that, we are certainly saying something about our 
society, about the openness of our society, about how we feel 
that people have an obligation to share one with the other and 
about how we have an obligation to support these people.  That is 
an aspect I would want to emphasize as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at citizenship we cannot just dwell on the 
responsibility of those who are receiving citizenship, we must 
dwell upon our own responsibility to provide the kind of support 
mechanisms that are necessary to new Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I come to Ottawa and I get in a taxi to drive to the House 
of Commons, many times I am being chauffeured by someone who is a 
new Canadian, someone from another country.  When they tell me 
about their background, their experience and their qualifications 
in their home country, I ask myself why they are driving a taxi. 
Why are they not working as an engineer, a lawyer or a doctor? 
We have to look at that aspect of citizenship as well, as to how 
we treat our new citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day I had a young man, who was originally from Africa, 
talk to me about the difficulty he is having getting a job in 
Nova Scotia.  As we talked it became very clear that this young 
man had a university degree from one of our own institutions, yet 
he was having difficulty getting a job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at some of the barriers that we place in the way 
of our new citizens who have obtained the desired status of 
Canadian citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all have an obligation and a responsibility to work on this 
matter in the best interests of each and every one of the new 
citizens and to do the best we can to make them truly welcome and 
truly proud to be Canadian citizens. 
<P><A NAME="LINK271"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, there were a couple of incidents in my riding concerning 
immigration which the hon. member might wish to comment on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first incident happened in the last two weeks.  A medical 
doctor was returning to Canada.  He was not yet a citizen.  The 
immigration department, for some reason, was unable to quickly 
process his entry visa to allow him to continue working.  He had 
been working in Canada for three years.  As a result, the town 
went for over a week without the services of that doctor.  It 
finally took the intervention of outside sources, including MPs 
like myself, to move it along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know if the hon. member has a comment with 
respect to how the system is working when it comes to work visas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing is that in our riding we have quite a few dairy 
farms.  It is difficult to find people who will work all day, 
from 5.30 in the morning, or who will work a broken shift.  I 
know of one big dairy farm which requires labourers.  The owner 
happens to know of people in Switzerland, persons experienced in 
dairy, who would come to Manitoba to work.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are having many problems within the immigration department 
to get him moved along to allow him to immigrate and work.  There 
does not seem to be anybody in our area to fill that particular 
job.  Does the member have any comments with regard to how the 
immigration system is working? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I have found as well that there have been many bureaucratic 
problems with respect to assisting people to come to Canada.  The 
example the member spoke of with the doctor is one example.  I 
could cite many others as well.  Part of the problem seems to be 
that we have a bit of a separation between the Canadian 
authorities and the visa officers in the country of origin.  Far 
too often it is almost like never the two shall meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We allow a certain amount of independence to the party in the 
country of origin to make his or her decision and sometimes the 
accountability aspect of why the decision is made and how it is 
made is not always there.  It is like “We have no control over 
that decision, that is made by this person here”.  If that 
person gets up on a bad day and does not like the look of the 
person who is applying for the visa or whatever, the applicant 
may never get here.  Those are issues that we have to work on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to getting people here to work in various jobs, as 
the member mentioned with regard to the farm industry, we have to 
be mindful of the cultural differences as well because it may be 
that a person coming from another country needs a cultural 
adjustment before working in a given type of operation.  As I 
mentioned, quite often people coming from another country will 
have training for a certain profession and ideally it would be 
nice if work could be obtained in that profession.  Those are 
areas we have to work on. 
<P><A NAME="LINK272"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me 
commend my colleagues from Halifax West and 
Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar.  They both made very eloquent 
presentations on the issue of what it means to be a Canadian 
citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe my friend from Halifax West identified a very 
important point when he talked about people not being recognized 
for the qualifications they have.  In my community, the Waterloo 
region, we have a doctor shortage, yet we have enough doctors who 
were foreign trained who are not allowed to practice. One of the 
problems is that licensing of physicians is a provincial 
responsibility.  As much as we talk about the brain drain in this 
country, we also very much have what is known as the brain waste 
in this country.  It is very unfortunate.  I agree, I have shared 
many of the same experiences.  In Canada we probably have the 
most highly educated taxi drivers of any place in the world 
because of the barriers that are put in place for people trying 
to gain recognition for their training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member to maybe further expand on his experience 
and give us his suggestions for what we must do, recognizing for 
the most part this is under provincial jurisdiction.  I ask the 
hon. member to try to address this very tragic situation for the 
people involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to 
address that issue because it is a very real issue right across 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have to do is not what was recommended by a statement 
read earlier in the House by a member of the official opposition 
who was decrying affirmative action programs and saying that we 
ought not to have those kinds of programs.  We do need programs 
that will facilitate people being able to fulfil their potential 
in a meaningful way and that sometimes means giving people a leg 
up, removing the barriers and enabling people to move into the 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as we have a preconceived idea that being equal and 
having equal opportunity means everybody has to be treated the 
same, then we will never have people fulfilling their potential. 
The situation is such that people do have to be treated 
differently because of different backgrounds, different 
experiences and different situations where they have not had 
equal opportunity for advancement.  We have to change our mindset 
if we want to see this happen and that comes from within for each 
individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as people in positions of power, people in positions of 
authority do not have that change of mindset then we will never, 
ever see the kind of thing happen that the member has indicated 
should happen, and which I would agree should happen, so that we 
would use the brain power that we have here.  Canada is a 
beautiful country.  There are all kinds of opportunities and all 
kinds of people to fulfil those opportunities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to inform the House that I will be splitting my time 
with the hon. member for Calgary Northeast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am here to tell the House today that I am a proud Canadian, 
just like many other members of the House of Commons.  I am a 
proud Canadian because I have had the experience of being able to 
travel throughout the world as early as when I was 17 years old 
and joined the Canadian Armed Forces.  I was able to travel 
around the world and the Canadian flag was held with deep respect 
everywhere I travelled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a few years ago I was fortunate enough to travel on the 
50th anniversary of the end of the second world war to Holland. 
That was the most exciting time of my life, seeing the Canadian 
flags up and down the streets of Holland in commemoration of 
Canada's liberation of Holland in the second world war.  It was 
very moving.  It was an experience that I do not think I will 
ever forget.  As I said, I am a very proud Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important in this debate today to realize that Canada's 
most valuable asset is not our natural resources or many of the 
other things people would think.  It is actually the people of 
Canada.  It is the people who make this country what it is.  It 
is a democracy and we should be very proud of that fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise on behalf of the people of Okanagan—Coquihalla to speak 
on Bill C-16, an act respecting Canadian citizenship.  The 
purpose of Bill C-16 is to repeal and replace the current 
Citizenship Act which many Canadians know is severely flawed. 
While this is an important goal, I have two serious reservations 
with this proposed legislation.  First, specific clauses in the 
bill need to be amended before Bill C-16 will function as 
intended.  Second, the timing of this bill is all wrong.  Changes 
to the Immigration Act need to be dealt with before this bill is 
passed and no bill dealing with immigration has been tabled in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government claims that Bill C-16 is the first major 
reform with respect to citizenship in 20 years.  The intent of 
this bill is to provide more clearly defined guidelines, replace 
current procedures with a new administrative structure and 
increase the minister's power to deny citizenship.  Unfortunately 
what the Liberals intend and what the Liberals actually do are 
two separate things.  Bill C-16 is no exception.  While the 
Liberals claim that Bill C-16 is a major modern reform of the 
Citizenship Act, those of us who look closely at the bill see a 
number of areas that have been totally neglected and others that 
have been actually impacted in a negative manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration 
made a number of important recommendations with respect to 
citizenship which the government has totally ignored.  Given that 
the government has had five years to develop this bill, it is 
inexcusable that it is full of serious omissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like most Canadians, I attach a great deal of importance to my 
citizenship as a Canadian.  Therefore, I would like to focus my 
comments on the conditions for granting citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current legislation governing citizenship is lax in this 
regard.  Currently individuals who are deemed to be permanent 
residents of Canada have been found to have nothing more than a 
bank account or property in Canada.  It seems as though having a 
physical presence is not important.  Canadians believe it is. 
Bill C-16 takes a half measure to deal with this issue.  It 
correctly defines a permanent resident as an individual who must 
have a physical presence here in Canada for at least 1,095 days 
during a six year period preceding their application for 
citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this makes good sense, Bill C-16 does not provide any 
mechanism for determining when applicants arrive in Canada or 
when they leave, nor does the Liberal government intend to 
develop one. 
This was a serious concern for the Standing Committee on 
Citizenship and Immigration and the committee members recommended 
that measures be introduced to monitor periods of time permanent 
residents are out of the country.  Without a viable means of 
determining time spent in Canada, requiring that a permanent 
resident spend 1,095 days in Canada is as meaningless as a judge 
sentencing a convicted murderer to life in prison.  We all know 
the time will not be served.

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of other problems with this bill.  The bill 
specifies that an applicant must have an adequate knowledge of 
one of the official languages in Canada but no specific 
provisions are made for how this is to be judged or by whom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another serious problem is that the number one recommendation of 
the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration was that 
the declaration of Canadian citizenship express the vision 
Canadians share for their future and the importance they attach 
to their citizenship. This should have been an opportunity for 
all Canadians to express what they wanted to see in the Canadian 
citizenship oath.  It would have been a great opportunity for a 
nation-wide patriotic debate.  Instead, the minister hobbled 
together an oath on her own.  We can almost picture the minister 
huddled together with her staff just before a question period 
briefing and trying to put together a citizenship oath. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course with all things Liberal, there is an issue of 
patronage.  Despite the importance Canadians place on their 
citizenship the Liberals have maintained the tradition, Mr. 
Speaker, of patronage appointees.  I know the Speaker is shocked 
by that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citizenship judges have been renamed citizenship commissioners 
in the proposed legislation but most of their duties will be 
taken over by departmental officials.  It is just one more plum 
post for friends of the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation also discriminates against refugees.  Current 
refugees get to count each full day of residency in Canada from 
the date of application as a half day toward the total needed for 
their citizenship application, but Bill C-16 removes this 
provision, penalizing applicants for all the bureaucratic delays 
that are already in the system. This is blatantly unfair for true 
refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real problem with Bill C-16 though is that the Liberals have 
their priorities all wrong.  Last year the people of British 
Columbia watched as boatload after boatload of illegal immigrants 
entered this country with no action from the government at all. 
Our immigration system is in a desperate situation, pandering to 
people traffickers and others who abuse our immigration system 
and our compassion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to know why the Liberals have made citizenship a 
priority when the immigration system is in such dire straits.  It 
is like putting new windows on a house when the roof is 
collapsing.  It appears as though the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration has no intention of fixing the multitude of problems 
facing Canada's immigration system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an advanced copy of her new immigration and refugee 
protection act, not yet tabled in the House, it is apparent that 
the Liberals will not close the door to bogus asylum seekers and 
people traffickers.  Instead the Liberals are throwing the door 
wide open. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The definition of refugee is slated to be expanded and 
entrenched in the law with an entirely new category called 
“people in need of protection”. This definition goes well 
beyond that required by the United Nations' definition.  The new 
immigration and refugee protection act does outline increased 
fines and penalties for the crime of people smuggling but these 
mean nothing without credible sentencing.  Sentencing in Canada 
is anything but credible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent statistics from the Canadian Centre for Justice 
Statistics indicate that between 1995 and 1998 only 14 charges 
have ever been made under section 94.1 of the Immigration Act. 
Section 94.1 states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—every person who knowingly organizes, includes, aids or 
abets...the coming into Canada of a person without valid 
documents required by the law is guilty of an offence and liable: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>on conviction to a fine not over $100,000 or to imprisonment for 
not more than five years, or both 
</I></B></P><P align=left>and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>on summary conviction, to a fine not over $10,000 or to 
imprisonment of not more than one year. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last five years nobody charged under section 94.1 of 
the Immigration Act for people smuggling has served one day in 
jail. 
According to the Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics, the 
toughest penalty handed down for an individual convicted was a 
$4,000 fine and one year probation.  No wonder our immigration 
system is the laughing stock of the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada needs to be recruiting the world's best and brightest 
while allowing legitimate refugees to enter Canada and acquire 
citizenship in a timely and fair manner.  While the citizenship 
act is in need of review, our immigration system is in dire 
straits and needs immediate attention. The government must focus 
its attention on priority areas like immigration.  Let us get our 
immigration system up and running effectively. Then we can deal 
with citizenship. 
<P><A NAME="LINK274"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I compliment my colleague and friend on his speech.  I 
agree entirely that Canada should be seeking the best and the 
brightest and opening its doors to those refugees genuinely in 
need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that particular point I found this debate and some of the 
questions coming out of it rather frustrating and disappointing. 
We talked about the needs of Canadians.  Canadian communities, 
such as many of those in my own constituency, have a need for 
doctors to replace those who have left because of the disastrous 
effects of the government's intervention in the medicare system. 
Replacing them with doctors who are qualified and willing to come 
is difficult because of the bureaucratic logjam in Immigration 
Canada and its unwillingness to do anything to move the process 
along at anything more than the slowest speed possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also listened to people talk about justifying the 
admission of illegal refugees on the basis that Canada does not 
have enough offices to process them overseas.  I find that 
ridiculous.  Legislation should once in a while be geared to the 
needs of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my colleague have any comments on how this legislation 
might focus on the economic and social needs of Canadians and not 
simply pander to the needs, legitimate and otherwise, of those 
who are not Canadians and who only wish that they were? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart:</B>  Mr. Speaker, Canadians in general as I said 
earlier, do believe that Canada's most valuable asset is its 
people.  It is a legitimate requirement that Canada in its desire 
to grow and become the most competitive nation in the world seek 
out the brightest and best qualified people to come to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, there is a legitimate need to recognize that 
some people do come to Canada as legitimate refugees.  The UN has 
a declaration on refugee status and it is very explicit.  This 
bill has gone one step further in stating that Canada would also 
take in people who, I guess by some declaration, say that they 
are people in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have been able to travel around the world, there are many 
people in other countries who would love to live in Canada and 
have the opportunities that we have here.  The fact is that those 
people are citizens of other countries and they cannot simply 
come to Canada just to improve their own economic status.  There 
is a responsibility that goes along with being a Canadian citizen 
and Canadians understand that.  The legislation should focus on 
dealing with the responsibility of being a Canadian, what it 
means and include in it the aspirations that people want to have 
down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing that should be done is we should deal with the 
immigration system itself.  We should address the problems that 
we saw last year in British Columbia.  We should deal with the 
boatloads of people who are not legitimate refugees.  They just 
said, “Canada sounds like a nice place to go to, let us go to 
Canada”. 
They paid an exorbitant amount of money to come here.  It was 
through illegal means that they arrived in Canada.  Those people 
are still being held up by the process that this country has 
developed.

viewpoint, are all proud Canadians.  We have a responsibility to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
yes, the long suffering Immigration Act and Citizenship Act. 
Even though Bill C-16 is designated as the Citizenship Act and 
amendments to it, it reflects quite frequently on the Immigration 
Act itself.  If we are intending on fixing the Citizenship Act, 
the matter that precedes it is the Immigration Act and all of its 
faults. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Reform first came to the House in 1994, immigration was on 
the plate.  It was an issue that was debated at length by the 
Reform Party.  We dared to bring up this topic.  We dared to 
introduce some different ideas in spite of all the criticism that 
was hurled our way.  Much of that criticism was an attempt not 
only by the government side but by special interests in the 
community that had a direct ear to the Minister of Citizenship 
and Immigration at that time and still do— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield:</B>  Immigration lawyers and consultants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Yes, the lawyers and consultants had a 
vested interest in keeping the situation the way it was.  It was 
a moneymaker for so many.  Unfortunately things have not improved 
all that much.  The consultants still exist and are making piles 
of money from it.  The lawyers are still making piles of money 
from it.  For what and to whose advantage?  Is it for the 
advantage of the Canadian people?  No, it has never been to their 
advantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people in this country have never had input into any 
discussion on the Immigration Act. They have never had any input 
into any provision or amendment.  Why? Because there has been a 
vested interest on the part of the Liberal government since 1993, 
the time that we have been in the House, to lean toward those who 
have that very special consideration: the consultants, the 
lawyers and anyone else who is part of that industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things have not changed.  The amendments in Bill C-16 do not 
deal with that problem.  The changes that are coming up in the 
new Immigration Act do not deal with the problem of interference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I took office as a member of parliament in 1993 I was 
somewhat shocked to find that 70% to 80% of my work related to 
immigration matters.  Immigration has become a political 
football.  If we oppose it, we are criticized severely and called 
every name in the book. If we say there is something wrong with 
the act, our opponents say we are criticizing immigrants or that 
we are being discriminatory. That is the accusation made. 
Unfortunately that is a smokescreen. It is an abuse of a position 
to hurl those kinds of insults at someone who is just trying to 
straighten out a problem that most people in the country know 
exists but are not quite sure how it all comes together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When dealing with issues on immigration, the quickest way to 
come up with an act that is suitable for people is to include 
them. New immigrants, those who have been here for 20 years and 
those who were born here should be included. 
The government would be very surprised in what it found out.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the biggest complaints about the Immigration Act, even 
relating to the Citizenship Act and certainly dealing with the 
refugee system, is that many immigrants who do come here would 
like to bring their relatives over to visit from time to time. 
That is a fair request.  They would like to bring their relatives 
over but time and time again they have been denied that 
privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would they be denied bringing their relatives to visit them 
here in Canada?  It is because of an interpretation in one court 
case by a supreme court justice which has never been challenged. 
If a person comes here and claims refugee status, no one can send 
him back.  That is a fact. No one can send him back.  Even though 
he may have come on a visitors visa and decided to stay, he 
cannot be turned back or refused if he says, “I am a refugee”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately that very specific court ruling has never been 
challenged.  It is high time that it was because the immigrants 
in my riding, and I have many, would like their friends and 
relatives to visit them even if it is in the case of sickness. 
But because of that very foolish interpretation many of them are 
denied that very special privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When talking about a family, that is a provision that could 
change to allow a stronger family and certainly a much better 
position on strengthening the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What else is wrong which this act does not address?  We could 
cross-reference this act to the Immigration Act because they go 
hand in glove. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is high time that we changed the visitors visas and 
introduced a system where cash bonds could be placed. Anyone who 
refused to return would have to forfeit the bond. It would pay 
for any court case that came along.  This would address a major 
concern in my riding at least and would make a lot of people much 
more comfortable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to go back to the refugee system. I think it is the 
most flawed area in immigration. There are so many queue jumpers 
who use the refugee system to enter this country.  The issue is 
not being addressed in a very effective way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a battle in 1993, in 1994, and in fact it has even 
existed much longer than that. It was one that we took up when we 
came into office in 1994.  We fought diligently to have some 
reasonable changes made to the Immigration Act to deal with the 
refugee determination system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lo and behold very little has changed.  Bill C-16 talks about 
patronage appointments through the citizenship process.  That 
permeates the whole immigration system.  Not only does it deal 
with the citizenship process, the judges and those doing the 
evaluations, but it also deals with the Immigration and Refugee 
Board.  Nothing has changed.  I believe it has even gotten worse 
and and has been pushed down out of sight because no one wants to 
talk about it much any more.  Needless to say, when we do not 
talk about it on this side, the government refuses to clean up 
any of the problems that exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the immigration and refugee act.  If that hole is 
plugged, I believe that a lot of immigrants who are in the 
process of trying to immigrate to this country through the normal 
legal channels will feel a lot better about the process. They 
look at others who have jumped the queue, who have come in 
through the back door via the refugee system.  They become very 
irritated and as a result they too begin to look for other ways 
of entering the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now talk about the issue of sovereignty.  We on the west 
coast of this country have experienced boatloads of people 
arriving on our shores.  These people are not refugees but 
illegals who have come in through this whole process of smuggling 
people, which has severely tarnished the immigration process in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People smugglers have not been dealt with in a severe manner in 
any way, shape or form.  They should be taught that this is not 
acceptable.  Unfortunately, the government of the day refuses to 
tighten up the laws in this area.  Enforcement and court action 
are the keys to this problem.  I can only call on the government 
to examine those processes before it deals in any substantive way 
with the citizenship issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Kilger:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the spirit of co-operation, I have consulted with members of all 
parties and wonder if there might be unanimous consent, if you were 
to seek it, Mr. Speaker, that we would extend, by no more than five 
minutes, to complete the question and comment period for the member for 
Calgary Northeast. It is my understanding that we would then put the 
question and the matter would be deferred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there agreement to proceed for 
another five minutes, at the end of which we will put the 
question on the bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK276"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the member for Calgary Northeast as he was talking 
about the Chinese migrant boat people.  I also dealt with that in 
my remarks.  As a member of the citizenship and immigration 
committee, we certainly heard about it over and over again, 
mostly from the members of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that when the first boatload of people landed on the 
shores of the west coast, the Reform Party members had a press 
conference demanding that the boat be turned around and sent back 
in its present state.  They did not even want to give them a new 
boat.  They just wanted to send them back where they came from, 
obviously not recognizing the 1985 supreme court ruling that once 
people have laid their feet on this soil they do have a right to 
a hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the Reform Party members wanted to be judge and jury 
both.  They wanted to take one look at these people and claim 
they were not refugees because they did not deem them to be 
refugees as they did not look like us and send them back to where 
they came from without even a hearing.  This is absolutely absurd 
because everybody has a right to due process and a hearing, and 
that is exactly what is going on right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not expect the member for Calgary Northeast, who has not 
sat on that committee for a long time, to be fully up to speed on 
what people are doing to deal with this issue.  However, for the 
member for Calgary Northeast to say that nothing is being done 
about people smuggling and nothing is being done to deal with the 
backlog of these desperate migrants who have washed up on the 
west coast, is absolute baloney. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people have been locked up and are awaiting hearings. They 
are being dealt with one by one.  In the hearings so far it has 
been found that most of them do not fit the category of refugee 
and they are being sent back to where they came from, to the 
Fujian province.  Five or six have been found to be genuine 
refugees and they are being welcomed into our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the hon. member to stand up and help fan the flames of 
hatred in this country with misinformation like that is 
inexcusable.  I personally will not sit here and listen to it. I 
hear it too much on the immigration committee as it is. These 
members are the architects of the misinformation that is actually 
turning into an anti-immigration movement in this country built 
around 500 or 600 desperate people who are seeking a better life 
on our shores. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice there is an organization now called the Canada First 
Immigration Reform Committee.  I am just wondering if there is 
any connection with the Reform Party because these hate-mongers 
are saying exactly the same thing as this political party, and 
there is also the commonality with the names.  I am just 
wondering if they are not more constitutionally connected or 
associated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That will be my question.  Is there a direct connection between 
the Reform Party and the Canada First Immigration Reform 
Committee, which is the purveyor of hate in this country when it 
comes to anti-immigration? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know of any 
specific comment that I made during my presentation that involved 
hate.

do we have any ties to any other organization that espouses hate. 
I am surprised at the member's comments.  I feel ashamed for him 
as a member of parliament trying to impugn that kind of response 
to this party.  None has been placed on his party over any other 
issue such as this.  I do not think it deserves the dignity of an 
answer when he puts it in that form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will put it in a way that all in the House will recognize. The 
Reform Party wants to see a good, honest, fair immigration 
process.  That is what we are asking for.  We have never said 
anything about not having a good, honest, fair immigration 
process or a refugee process.  We want to see refugees come from 
those areas in the world where they are truly refugees as defined 
by the U.N., not gate-crashers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is what this member from the NDP party is trying to 
portray, I say “absolutely not”.  We have set ourselves apart. 
Sure, we have dared to talk about the immigration policy in this 
country because it needed to be talked about.  It should involve 
the people in this country and not just fan the flames of anger. 
There is a party that just did.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to speak to the amendment to 
the motion proposed by my colleague from Acadie—Bathurst with 
respect to workers in seasonal industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The nature of this amendment, which seeks to substitute the 
immediate action component of Motion No. 222, helps all of us 
understand exactly what the government is trying to do.  It is 
trying to delay further and this delay is dangerous.  This 
amendment to review employment insurance benefits for seasonal 
workers is yet another cheap stalling tactic by the Liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion proposes immediate action.  We have been asking for 
that for a very long time as have seasonal workers.  Even the 
delegates to the Liberal convention know it is right.  They 
introduced a resolution calling on the government to remove 
intensity provisions which claw back benefits for seasonal 
workers who repeatedly draw employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board of referees of employment insurance in Sydney also 
know it, especially when they are forced to deny appeals by 
workers even though they “feel the claimant and many more like 
her are being penalized by section 15 of the EI Act and would 
like the powers that be to have a serious look at the act and 
some kind of restructuring in the near future”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is pretty clear to me and everybody except the government to 
understand that many seasonal workers are seasonal workers not by 
choice but because the very nature of their work is seasonal.  In 
other words, the cycle which causes seasonal workers to apply 
numerous times for EI benefits is not the choice of the workers. 
It is a part of their working conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seasonal workers, their families and their children cannot wait 
for the government to figure out that it is only their work that 
is seasonal.  Their needs for housing, food and clothing is not 
seasonal.  The need to get by, day by day, with dignity is not 
seasonal.  It is a basic right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my part of the country, looking at the most recent stats 
available from Statistics Canada, we can see that seasonal 
employment causes huge changes in the monthly unemployment rate 
where it has been as high as 20.6% in January 1999 down to 14.1% 
in August.  By December 1999 the unemployment rate in Cape Breton 
had climbed back to over 20%.  In our region where many workers 
depend on seasonal industries, even our lowest monthly 
unemployment rate is still much higher than the national average. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By cutting benefits to seasonal workers, the government is 
directly reducing the quality of life for the hundreds of 
thousands of people who are employed in seasonal industries in 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, there are many people 
who depend on seasonal employment.  Any Liberal who crosses the 
Canso tells anybody who will listen that it will be tourism that 
will save the economy of the island, that it will be tourism that 
will provide employment for all.  Tourism is a seasonal industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my colleagues and I in the NDP who recognize that although 
tourism might provide a much needed push to the economy, if EI 
benefits for seasonal workers are not restored immediately the 
net gain will not be as big as the Liberals would like Cape 
Bretoners to believe.  On one hand, it pushes for an industry 
that will provide seasonal work, but with the other it takes away 
the dignity that those workers deserve.  The government should be 
ashamed of its attempts to sneak out the back door of its 
responsibility to encourage and promote economic development in 
Cape Breton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seasonal workers are not some marginal part of the workforce. 
They are an integral part of the workforce and they deserve to be 
treated with dignity.  Most of the seasonal workers who have been 
affected by the cuts live in rural regions of the country. It is 
the rural regions that have really been suffering under the 
Liberal government's slash and burn tactics over the last few 
years and they are certainly not the beneficiaries of last 
month's budget tax cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must stop the marginalization of seasonal workers and we must 
stop it now.  We should not need a lengthy review before benefits 
are restored to seasonal workers.  I know I do not need that.  We 
need to restore those benefits now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we need to have a debate about the problems that seasonal 
workers face?  Yes.  Do we need to examine these problems indepth 
and create long term plans to reduce the recurring cycle of 
unemployment that seasonal workers face?  Yes.  Do we need to 
delay restoring Employment Insurance benefits by reviewing 
benefits?  No.  We need to restore benefits now. 
We need to commit ourselves to an extended debate here in the 
House and across the country in communities where people depend 
on seasonal employment.  I would not disagree with the principle 
that the amendment in Motion No. 222 proposes, that is that we 
need to review EI benefits to seasonal workers, but first we need 
to restore benefits.

their lot at the polls.

amendment to the amendment in order.

<P><A NAME="LINK285"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank you 
for the opportunity to speak on this motion, the amendment and 
the subamendment which calls on the government to restore 
employment insurance benefits to seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should say from the outset that while I do not agree with the 
motion as it is currently worded, I would support it should it be 
amended as proposed by the member for Miramichi. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also cannot support the subamendment just proposed because I 
can think of nothing that would slow down more the kinds of 
changes that the mover of the original motion is looking for than 
the requirement for cross-country hearings.  All that testimony 
would have to be collected, all that testimony would have to be 
analyzed.  It would cost the government a lot of money and the 
main thing is it would cost parliament a lot of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I share the concern of the member for Acadie—Bathurst for the 
well-being of Canadian seasonal workers.  I must disagree with 
the phrasing of his motion as it now reads.  The fact is that 
seasonal workers in Canada do have access to employment insurance 
benefits.  Why then should we adopt a motion calling on such 
benefits to be restored? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a few minutes to share some ideas and 
insights on how EI might do an even better job of helping 
unemployed workers, including seasonal workers, to improve their 
employability, to return to work and to prepare for the 
challenges of our new economy.  As members know, these have been 
key priorities for the government since our very first day in 
office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, we have worked hard to spur economic growth and to 
promote job creation.  Canada's strong economic and job growth 
statistics suggest that we have made considerable progress in 
this area.  Last year alone 400,000 jobs were created, 85% of 
which were full time.  Moreover, the national unemployment rate 
has dropped to 6.8%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During 1998 jobs for young workers increased 5.3%, the strongest 
showing on record, while jobs for women increased over 3.2%, the 
biggest rise in a decade. We are also focusing our efforts on 
helping those workers who are out of work.  In some cases this 
has meant setting up new programs.  In other cases it has meant 
making sure existing programs really help unemployed workers. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1750"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we looked at the old unemployment system, we realized 
something had to be done since the rising cost was not 
sustainable over time.  It was not keeping pace with the new 
labour market and its demands.  It sometimes discouraged people 
from working and encouraged them to become dependent on benefits, 
and it treated some workers unfairly, like part time and seasonal 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result we introduced the new employment insurance system 
which is designed to do five things.  First, to be sustainable. 
Second, to be fairer by opening up access to many workers, 
including seasonal and part time workers who were not previously 
protected.  Third, to encourage work and discourage reliance on 
benefits.  Fourth, to target those most in need and, fifth, to 
help workers get back to work faster and stay employed longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While EI seeks to help all unemployed workers, we also recognize 
that some groups such as seasonal workers have special 
circumstances that must be addressed.  EI therefore contains 
features that particularly benefit seasonal workers.  For 
example, the hours based system takes into account the special 
nature of seasonal work which often involves long hours of work 
per week.  As a result many seasonal workers find it easier to 
qualify, receive higher benefits, and collect benefits longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our small weeks pilot projects make it possible for many 
seasonal workers to take all the work that is available and 
provide them with higher weekly benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Family supplements help low income families with children, many 
of whom depend on seasonal work or the fishery.  By topping up 
benefits and exempting them from the intensity rule, over 200,000 
Canadian families benefited from this supplement last year. 
Reflecting its importance, our expenditures in this area 
increased from about $105 million to nearly $150 million.  In 
addition, EI's active employment measures help many seasonal 
workers upgrade their skills so they can get back to work 
quickly, or go into another line of work.  This was underlined by 
the recently released third annual EI monitoring and assessment 
report which found that frequent users, of which seasonal workers 
form a significant share, have in fact benefited from features 
introduced since 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frequent claimants received about 43% of all regular and fishing 
benefits, up from 41% the year before.  Benefits paid to 
unemployed workers in most seasonal industries increased 
substantially with the highest increases taking place in fishing 
and trapping.  Those benefits were up 70%, and in mining, oil and 
gas they were up 52%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Weekly benefits for frequent claimants, which were already 
higher than the average, increased again from $303 to $305, in 
contrast to the declines in weekly benefits seen in the two 
previous years.  While the entitlement of frequent and seasonal 
claimants declined from 33.4 weeks to 32.8 weeks, this was still 
three weeks more than in 1995-96, thus indicating the positive 
impact of the switch to an hours based system.  In addition, our 
eligibility system is reducing the impact of the intensity rule 
for many workers.  They are finding the extra hours of work 
needed to qualify for EI and are receiving higher benefits than 
before, 8% higher than the average for regular benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members to work with us to ensure that EI does the 
best possible job of helping unemployed workers return to work 
quickly, including seasonal benefits. 
<P><A NAME="LINK286"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in 
listening to the parliamentary secretary, one would think that 
the government did not have any money when it comes down to the 
high rate that is charged to businesses and workers for these 
much reduced benefits.  The government is pleading poverty where 
it need not.  It could use some of that extra money it is taking 
to study the thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad to have this opportunity to speak on this important 
issue.  Although we may not agree on the solution to ensuring 
that seasonal workers have incomes adequate to meet their needs 
and aspirations, I do appreciate the concerns that motivated my 
colleague for Acadie—Bathurst to make this motion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member stated in his speech that his motion was meant 
to achieve two objectives.  The first is to reform employment 
insurance and the second is to stimulate proposals to diversify 
Canada's seasonal economy.  Both objectives are laudable in and 
of themselves, but the text of his motion calls for the immediate 
restoration of employment insurance benefits to seasonal workers. 
I believe that the effect of his motion, if adopted, would be to 
stifle any efforts to find solutions to the structural problems 
currently forcing many workers into the seasonal economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Neither workers nor the companies that have benefited from easy 
access to EI would have the will to make any effort to search for 
constructive solutions to the problem.  There would be neither 
any pressure nor any incentive to make the changes he wants to 
see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member rightly points out that most seasonal workers 
are not in favour of the seasonal nature of their jobs. 
Nevertheless saying it does not address the problem.  There are 
businesses that by their very nature are seasonal.  The obvious 
ones are in forestry, agriculture, tourism, fishing and 
construction.  Some of these sectors pay their workers very well 
and those who choose to work in them are able to bridge the gaps 
in their employment.  I have personally spoken to some people in 
that category.  Other sectors are not able to pay enough to 
enable workers to make ends meet when there is a break in their 
employment and I have also spoken to many people in that 
category.  The problem is not simple, but in fact extremely 
complex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many factors that contribute to the seasonal economy. 
An abundance of seasonal jobs could be an indicator of a sector 
of the economy in decline or it could equally indicate an 
emerging sector of the economy.  Take for instance just two 
examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A local economic development authority may decide it wants to 
focus on tourism which is actually an emerging sector in my 
hometown.  At first the emphasis was on the things it knew. Sport 
fishing, for instance, is a summer activity that the community 
has built on over a number of years and guided hunting is a fall 
activity in the same way.  These were sufficient to maintain a 
small hospitality sector that was subject to seasonal employment 
variations.  In recent years, through the development of 
cross-country skiing and snowmobile trails, the sector has 
expanded its infrastructure and extended the seasons in which 
work is available.  This has had a positive effect on the local 
economy and of course the employment picture.  These innovations, 
while possible, would not have been driven by business or 
employment considerations in an environment that failed to reward 
creative solutions to the problems facing businesses in the 
region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Returning employment insurance to its previous function in the 
seasonal economy would act as a reverse incentive to the search 
for ways to build and diversify local economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many factors that are considered by businesses when 
they decide where to locate or when to expand.  Among them are 
location, transportation, amenities, infrastructure, educational 
and cultural opportunities, recreation and housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other factors businesses consider are the incentives such as 
government subsidies and grants.  Employment insurance for many 
years has been a tool of government to subsidize businesses, 
allowing them to reduce their workforces in times of reduced 
economic activities and to recall them when prospects improve. 
This has enabled businesses to avoid making long term commitments 
to their workers and encouraged workers to stay in depressed 
areas of Canada and in uneconomic sectors of the economy that are 
dependent on government for their survival. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my previous life I was a businessman and I have firsthand 
knowledge of these matters.  A part time worker of mine who was, 
by the way, one of the best workers I ever had, finally left to 
take full time employment in another part of Canada and in a 
different sector of the economy.  He is happy with the change 
even though it meant major changes in his life.  He is one of 
those people who wanted full time work but could not get it where 
he was geographically located, nor in a sector in which he wanted 
to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons this loyal employee and friend left was due 
to changes in the EI program.  One of these changes relates to 
the rule that differentiates between frequent and infrequent 
recipients of benefits under the EI program.  Sometimes this 
works, but frequently it fails to produce the intended results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As HRDC's 1998 EI Monitoring and Assessment Report stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Communities with high levels of seasonal employment were more 
likely to have industries that showed declining benefits levels.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This report was published three years after implementation of 
the changes.  The data used in its production would have been 
collected well before that.  Before considering any other changes 
to the program it would be wise for the government to initiate 
further studies to see if there have been significant shifts in 
behaviour and attitude since then.  It is a well known fact that 
there is always considerable resistance to change and that 
consistent monitoring and explanation of programs is vital to the 
success of any initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, with respect to what I have just said, a 1999 
assessment of the program tabled in the House yesterday has 
confirmed that EI clients in Atlantic Canada and other parts of 
Canada are continuing to use EI benefits to supplement their 
incomes on a regular basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other than what I just stated, there are other good reasons for 
not making the changes proposed by the hon. member for 
Acadie—Bathurst.  The most dramatic, and I would argue the most 
unwarranted, change would be to make EI into a wage subsidy 
program again rather than maintaining it as an insurance program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employment insurance should have as its primary goal protection 
against involuntary temporary job loss.  Any other purpose 
militates against the program acting in accordance with insurance 
principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the hon. member from Wanuskewin, has identified 
many of the problems and has suggested some solutions to the 
problems facing workers and government in implementing changes to 
the system.  I want to restate and emphasize one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some industries have a pattern of laying off workers at the same 
time each year.  This takes advantage of EI as surely as a worker 
who manages his work time in order to take maximum advantage of 
the program.  He suggests that differential premiums imposed on 
such companies would be one method of motivating companies to 
change their work patterns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To lay the entire burden of the changes solely on the workforce 
is to address only half of the problem.  I do not know whether 
such a scheme would be advisable or if it would work, but it 
certainly deserves a look. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One other change the government could and should make is to 
reduce the unconscionably high rates of employment insurance 
premiums charged that really bear no relation to the benefits to 
either workers or businesses.  This tax on business chokes off 
the entrepreneurial spirit that creates the good jobs which will 
withstand seasonal variations and have a strong demand throughout 
the year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the evidence points to the need to do a thorough 
review of aspects of employment insurance, with particular 
emphasis on the intensity rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be supporting the motion as amended, although it would 
have been far preferable to have the matter referred to the 
appropriate standing committee for study and recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would rather have seen included in the NDP amendment a call 
for immediate action so that it would not depend on the leisure 
time that the minister might decide to devote to it at some point 
in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It needs to be dealt with, and I thank the House for the 
opportunity to address this very important issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak to the motion brought 
forward by my friend, the hon. member for Acadie—Bathurst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very serious and very important issue, particularly for 
maritime communities, such as the Gaspé Peninsula, where I come 
from. The Gaspé Peninsula is a resource region where forestry 
and fishing are important sectors. These two resources alone 
indicate that we very much have to follow the seasons. It is not 
our fault. We are trying to diversify our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to have what it takes to diversify our economy, but 
even if 5,000 or 10,000 jobs were created tomorrow in the Gaspé 
Peninsula—and I am talking about manna from heaven that would 
give us 10,000 permanent jobs, 52 weeks a year—that would not 
change the fact that it is not easy to fish for lobster when the 
ice is three feet thick on the bay in front of my home. There 
are differences that people must understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read the speeches of those who spoke previously. They talked 
about dignity. When we are reduced to asking the members 
opposite to recognize there is dignity in doing what the people 
we represent do as an occupation, something is very wrong.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every normal person should understand that fishing and logging 
have their place. Fishing is about feeding people. Logging is 
about providing people with building materials. So, by 
definition, these are noble trades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand why it is these seasonal trades that have 
suffered the most from this reform. I can understand that it is 
frustrating for certain people who have the opportunity of 
working all year round and who, on top of that, live in a 
province that is a little richer, Ontario, not to mention any 
names. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will try to illustrate my point briefly because time flies. 
Let us take the same technique used for fishermen, for example, 
and apply it to the members of the House. Let us say that the 
government decides, in Cabinet, to pay us weekly wages instead 
of monthly or annual salaries as it does now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as parliament is sitting, there is no problem, we would 
get paid. But if, after passing such legislation—because there 
are many stages in amending the Employment Insurance Act—the 
government decided to reduce the number of months during which 
we are now working—10 months at present—by two months the first 
year, and by two other months every year thereafter, until we 
ended up working no more than two months a year—I know this is an 
exaggeration, but it is exactly what happened to the fishermen; 
their pay was cut—what would the members opposite say if their 
salary was taken from them in that way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They would say that it is unfair. They would say “We have been 
elected as members of parliament. We cannot accept another job. 
It is illegal. All we have left is the two months the government 
lets us sit”.  When I left the House of Commons, I would not be 
allowed to sell my services to help the fishers or the other 
persons in my community; it would be illegal because I am a 
member of parliament. So I have an occupational impediment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can people understand that when one is, let us say, a lobster 
fisher, one must follow the rules set by the government 
according to biological data. It is said that the lobster 
fishing cycle cannot exceed 10 weeks and that is a verifiable 
fact. But the government sets the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear members saying “let them go catch something else”. That 
is impossible, because the same government imposed a moratorium 
on groundfish. “Well, then, let them catch something else, 
herring”. Fine, but for that, one has to have the right 
license. So, the government that creates impediments is the one 
telling us to go do something else. Unfortunately, that is 
impossible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we prepared to outlaw eating lobster in Canada and to say 
that from now on there will be no more lobster fishery? Are 
Canadians prepared to do that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some will say that I am exaggerating, but I am not, really. When 
we look at the fishing industry, of course, it takes a fisher 
and his helper in a boat. That is one thing. 
People will say “They are going to work for 10 weeks”. But the 
fisher who leaves at 3 a.m. and comes back in the afternoon is 
looking forward to taking his boots off, as we say back home. He 
needs a rest. So, somebody else handles and unloads his lobster. 
Somebody else will process the lobsters in the plant before it 
ends up on your plate, in your favourite restaurant or in your 
nice comfortable home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these people move to the city in search of work, who will 
process the lobsters for your consumption? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a chance workers might not get the number of hours 
needed to qualify for employment insurance.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I just showed is that the ten week rule is too restrictive. 
In some fisheries, people manage to get by. I will name another 
fishery, the crab fishery, which is even more dicey in terms of 
the moulting cycle of the species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some years, the fishing season does not even last six weeks. 
When the fishermen go out to sea in the spring, how are they do 
know whether mother nature will cause the waters to warm up fast 
and the great white to moult sooner. Therefore, in areas with an 
unemployment rate over 13%, plant workers need 420 hours if they 
have already qualified. 
It can be difficult to work 420 hours in six weeks. If one works 
40 hours a week, that is a total of 240 hours. That is not 
enough to meet the 420 hour requirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When she gave an explanation a few moments ago, the 
parliamentary secretary said that the number of hours can be a 
good thing. Let us not forget that it always depends on the 
unemployment rate in a particular region. If the unemployment 
rate in my region exceeds 13%, I will have to work 420 hours; if 
it is 12%, I will have to work 455 hours, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the example of someone working as a crab fisher near 
an urban centre like Rimouski. Members will say that that person 
has an occupation and should get the same thing as the others. 
But no. 
If the unemployment rate in the Rimouski area is around 10%, it 
may take 680 hours for that person to become eligible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means that we could see certain categories of occupations 
disappear in certain regions. That is why I made that proposal, 
to give people food for thought. If we no longer want this to be 
covered by the employment insurance program, why not define what 
a seasonal occupation is and then try to find an appropriate 
program? Otherwise, we will have to say that we are willing to 
see those occupations disappear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will make another proposal. While we determine which jobs are 
seasonal ones, we should consider which tools we can offer to 
these fishers who will have to learn to live on six weeks of 
work with no employment insurance if they no longer qualify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the government consider prohibiting any imports of 
crustaceans or of goods now produced in Canada? No one would be 
allowed to import these products and Canadians would have to pay 
big money to get these products from our fishers, because we 
have not supported them. This is conceivable. Is the government 
prepared to do that? But it says “No, this is free trade, this 
is globalization”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Canadian government saying that, because of 
globalization, fishers in the Gaspe Peninsula will be paid the 
same as Filipino fishermen, who live in a warm, sunny country 
and who can get by on little food because they do not have to 
contend with a northern climate? They are paid $15 a week. Do 
members know how much it costs to shop for groceries now? A 
litre of milk costs the same in Hull as it does in Gaspé. In 
that sense, why would people in the Gaspe not be entitled to the 
same amount? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, I urge the House to take a serious look at the hon. 
member's proposal, and I invite members opposite, particularly 
those from Ontario, to accept to share the wealth with those who 
helped build this country, at least as long as we are still part 
of it.

pleased to take part in the debate on a motion by a colleague 
from New Brunswick who represents a riding with a very high rate 
of unemployment. We all know which former MP and former minister 
used to represent that riding. I think that everyone remembers 
him when the subject of employment insurance reform comes up. He 
is none other than Doug Young.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last election campaign, Doug Young found out what 
people in the very high unemployment areas thought about his 
reform.  We have seen the impact of that reform on individuals 
and families in those areas.  I would like to congratulate my 
colleague for Acadie—Bathurst for his motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I first came to this House in 1997, as one of the MPs from 
my party on the Standing Committee on Human Resources, I 
presented a motion at its first meeting.  I asked the committee 
to carry out an immediate assessment of employment insurance 
reform.  My colleague over the way, the parliamentary secretary, 
was also on that committee.  She surely remembers that motion by 
a newly arrived young MP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the motion was defeated.  Today, here we are 
still at the study and assessment stage, when we could have made 
real changes. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Years have gone by since this reform, and I have to say that 
people have lost their homes.  People have seen their families 
divided.  In many cases it was because of the stresses that were 
brought on them.  Monetary stress and lack of employment 
certainly were contributors. In these regions the government is 
responsible for this because the reform has hurt Canadians and 
has hurt seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are regions of Canada that have economies that are 
different from the others.  My region of New Brunswick has many 
seasonal workers. There are people who work in the forest 
industry.  We have difficult winters.  These are realities. There 
are not all types of industries popping up every day.  When the 
government brought in the reform it did not pay attention to 
these very seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from South Shore, Nova Scotia is here.  He has 
brought to my attention many, many files of people who are 
looking for work, people who are running out of employment 
insurance, people who have nowhere else to go and have no choice 
but to go on income assistance and wait until that industry 
re-opens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is pretty sad when the surplus in employment insurance is 
pegged at about $25 billion. Last year and recently too, the 
Minister of Finance bragged in the House about the balanced 
budget.  That budget without the $25 billion employment insurance 
account would not be balanced at all.  Certainly there is an 
imbalance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read the report that was tabled in the House yesterday by the 
minister.  It is frustrating to read these things.  One of the 
civil servants who worked on the reform to employment insurance 
was in my office at the very beginning.  He told me that people 
from Atlantic Canada should get a job like he did, just to give 
hon. members the idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a minister over there from P.E.I.  We all know who he 
is. 
He has in his own riding people who are suffering from this 
reform and he has the gall to stand here and laugh at what we are 
saying.  It is unbelievable.  He should be standing and defending 
those very people.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I read a report which said that many people may be faking 
illness when they quit their jobs.  Imagine.  It is typical 
though.  I am not surprised.  They are faking their illness. 
Nurses across the country have been cut back, slashed and have to 
do the work that two nurses used to do.  They are burnt out and 
yes, some must call in sick.  However the report says people are 
faking. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the employment insurance assessment report, the statement is 
made that “overall, we can say that there are indications that 
some elements of the reform are working relatively well”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must tell you that, when I see people in my riding office, 
people who have lost their homes, families that have been split 
up, and when I look at the comments in the evaluation, I wonder 
if these are the government's indications that the reform is 
working well.  It is absolutely incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report also says “That is why the Government of Canada made 
a legislative commitment to monitor and assess the impacts of 
the reform for five years”.  It says “monitor and assess”.  What 
the member for Acadie—Bathurst is asking for is this: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should take 
immediate action to restore Employment Insurance benefits to 
seasonal workers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion says immediate. 
Here is a typical amendment by a member of the government that 
introduced the reform.  Note the difference.  It goes like this: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the government should...review the issue of employment 
insurance benefits for seasonal workers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here, we have the word review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With people suffering since the reform, the government still 
wants to “review” what happened.  I can tell the House that we 
have been hearing what the Liberal government wants to do with 
an election in the offing; it wants to review the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can also tell the House that Canadians have not forgotten what 
happened.  The government thinks that the Atlantic provinces 
have forgotten as well, but it is mistaken.  The people of these 
provinces have not forgotten Doug Young; they have not forgotten 
EI reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member, I will make it my business to see that they 
remember what the government did to them.  That is my intention. 
We must protect Canadians throughout this country.  There must 
be a balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Balance seems to be lacking in this reform.  We have a great 
country.  We are trying to build a strong country.  We are 
trying to keep the country together.  There are many 
differences, various cultures, and different regions with 
differing resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to succeed as a country, we must focus on balance. 
What the government has done is unacceptable, and I once again 
congratulate the member for Acadie—Bathurst on his motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
1996 Liberal government changes to UIC did three things.  They 
made it harder to qualify for benefits, they reduced benefits so 
there was less money per week, and they shortened the period of 
time that benefits could be collected.  The predictable result of 
all this is now the EI fund shows a surplus of $600 million a 
month, not per year, per month.  Some $7.2 billion per year is 
being taken out of the employment insurance fund and being denied 
as benefits to the people who need it most, the most vulnerable, 
to be used for whatever the Liberal government likes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that mean in my riding of Winnipeg Centre, the third 
poorest riding in the country?  It takes $20.8 million a year out 
of my riding.  It is sucked right out of there down to Ottawa. 
Money that used to be transferred to Winnipeg for the use of 
income maintenance for desperately unemployed and poor people no 
longer comes to my riding.  Imagine the impact that has on a 
relatively small community like my riding.  Imagine what we would 
do if we could attract a business that had a payroll of $20.8 
million.  We could pave the streets with gold to attract them to 
our riding.  The inverse is also true. The impact is the same in 
reverse when it gets pulled out.  And that is just Winnipeg 
Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In St. John's, Newfoundland, $75 million a year is pulled out 
just by the 1996 changes.  I wish my colleague from Montreal were 
still here.  There is $512 million a year less in income 
maintenance for the unemployed in the city of Montreal alone. 
This was by design of the Liberal government so that it could use 
the employment insurance fund as a cash cow, as a revenue 
generator, so that it could use the money for whatever it wanted 
to and certainly for anything but income maintenance for 
unemployed people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes have left some staggering statistics.  Less than 
40% of unemployed workers now qualify for any EI benefits.  What 
kind of insurance fund is that if people have a less than 40% 
chance of ever collecting?  Less than 25% of women, as verified 
in a recent report, qualify for any benefits.  Less than 11% of 
young women qualify for any benefits.  What kind of a program 
could possibly survive such a failure to achieve its mandate for 
what it was set out to do?  Less than 15% of youth qualify for 
any benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am trying to make is this system is broken.  It is 
busted.  The wheels have fallen off it and Canadians know that. 
Therefore the motion of the member for Acadie—Bathurst is 
absolutely appropriate, timely, practical and necessary. Every 
member in the House should enthusiastically support it so we can 
all take a look at the employment insurance system and see what 
is wrong with it and hopefully put it back on track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said in the past, if money is taken off a person's 
paycheque for a specific purpose and then is used for something 
completely different, at best it is a breach of trust.  In the 
worst case scenario it is out and out fraud to tell workers that 
money will be deducted from their cheques so that if they happen 
to become unemployed they will qualify for a benefit and when 
that worst case scenario happens and they find themselves 
unemployed, we say “Sorry, the rules have changed.  There is no 
money, no income maintenance.  Your family does without”.  I 
believe it is a breach of trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To add insult to injury, to take that money off workers' 
paycheques, deny the benefits to the unemployed and then use the 
money out of general revenues to give the wealthy a tax cut is 
some perverted form of Robin Hood that robs from the poor and 
gives to the rich.  It is fundamentally wrong and Canadians will 
not tolerate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are the changes we would like to see when the review comes 
forward.  At least 70% of all unemployed workers should be 
receiving EI, at least 70%.  Then we would know the program works 
somewhat.  Weekly benefits should be maintained at 60% of a 
claimant's weekly pay.  That is a basic.  The divisor rule, the 
intensity rule and the benefit clawbacks all have to be 
eliminated.  Those are the changes that were made which suck the 
level of benefits down to such a ridiculously low level. 
The EI fund must be separated from general revenues.  It should 
be its own independent, stand alone fund that is there for a 
specific and dedicated purpose, which is to provide income 
maintenance and possibly training for unemployed workers to help 
get them back into the workforce.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>EI must not be used as a federal debt reduction instrument.  It 
must not be used for tax cuts.  It must not be used for spending 
on government programs. It is a dedicated insurance fund, nothing 
more, nothing less.  To use it for anything else is fraudulent 
and a breach of trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment insurance system is in an emergency situation 
right now.  It does not work.  It is broken and the wheels have 
fallen off.  Canadian workers know this.  This is the second and 
third year now that seasonal workers have had to deal with this 
inadequate system.  This is the second or third year in a row 
that they have had to deal with reduced benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I used to run the carpenters union and I know the people in that 
union very well.  There are examples of guys who entered the 
system this year who are getting $120 a week as their benefit, 
whereas two or three years ago they were receiving $425 a week. 
That is the difference the intensity rule, the divisor rule and 
the clawback rule make to seasonal construction workers who pay 
into the fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember when I was a carpenter we would be paying $45 or $50 
from every paycheque into the fund which was matched by our 
employer so we would receive benefits when we happened to find 
ourselves seasonally unemployed.  That does not happen anymore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the most cynical thing the government did when it came 
to the building trades was to no longer fund the apprenticeship 
programs through EI.  The government used to buy blocks of seats 
at the community college so the apprentices could go to school 
without having to pay tuition because they and their employers 
were already paying every hour that they worked in the industry. 
The government stopped that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today a first year carpenter's apprentice has to pay a $600 to 
$800 tuition fee.  He does not get his first two week waiting 
period paid for anymore.  There are no allowances for travel or 
child care.  All those have been eliminated. The government now 
says that we need a national training strategy.  Well it just 
gutted a damn good national apprenticeship training strategy by 
pulling the rug out from under it when it made these changes to 
UIC in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these things combined add up to gross failure and all the 
more reason why this motion is entirely appropriate, timely and 
necessary. 
<P><A NAME="LINK290"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Sgro (York West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let me 
begin by saying that I am confident that members of all parties 
will support the amendment proposed by the hon. member for 
Miramichi which asks that the government take immediate action to 
review the employment insurance benefits for seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's economy is such that we have always had and always will 
have seasonal industries.  These industries are vital to our 
economic well-being.  However, these industries by definition 
employ people for only part of the year.  We must always remain 
watchful to ensure that our economic and social programs do not 
exclude those workers from the rewards and benefits of living and 
working in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind the House that the Government of Canada introduced 
employment insurance after long consultation and much 
deliberation.  Even then, we built in a monitoring and review 
process that would report back each year for five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new employment insurance package was aimed precisely at 
ensuring fair and equitable treatment of all Canadian workers, 
whether their work was seasonal, year round, part time or full 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget the very good reasons why an extensive 
redesign of the EI program was carried out.  The old unemployment 
insurance system was questioned for its sustainability.  It was 
not responsive to the new labour market that prevails in Canada. 
It tended to discourage attachment to the labour force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is most pertinent to Motion No. 222 is the fact that the 
system was unfair in its treatment of some workers, most notably 
part time and seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The resulting employment insurance system is designed 
specifically to be sustainable and fair, while encouraging work 
and ensuring benefits are provided for those in the greatest 
need.  Of course the ultimate goal is to help workers get back to 
work faster and stay employed longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>EI also recognizes the reality of Canada's labour market where 
seasonal workers are prevalent in certain industries. Seasonal 
workers have particular needs and the program does indeed have 
special features built in to assist seasonal workers. Is it 
enough?  Possibly not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hours based system takes into account the fact that seasonal 
work often involves long hours of work per week.  As a result, 
many seasonal workers therefore find it easier to qualify and 
receive higher benefits for longer periods. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1835"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT102"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is the introduction of small weeks pilot 
projects.  These would allow seasonal workers to take all work 
that is available, even a few hours a week, without it resulting 
in a lower benefit rate at their next claim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the family supplement targets low income families with 
children by topping up their benefits each year.  Those families 
are also exempt from the application of the intensity rule which 
normally reduces benefits for claimants who make repeated use of 
employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there are the active employment measures under the EI 
program which are helping many seasonal workers upgrade their 
skills, enabling them to get back into the workforce more 
quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effects of the EI program are being monitored continuously. 
There is a requirement for monitoring and assessment reports for 
the five years following its introduction.  Yesterday the 
Minister of Human Resources Development tabled in the House the 
third annual report, which showed that EI has affected frequent 
claimants less than claimants overall and that benefits paid to 
unemployed workers in most seasonal industries have increased 
substantially.  While the entitlement of frequent and seasonal 
claimants declined from 33 weeks to 32 weeks, this was still 
three weeks more than in 1995 when the EI regime was introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, frequent and seasonal claimants appear to benefit from 
the switch to an hours based eligibility system, even though 
frequent and seasonal claimants often have fewer insured hours 
during the year than other claimants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the EI regime provides better coverage for 
seasonal workers compared to the system it replaced.  Is it 
perfect?  No, it is not.  Is there room for improvement and 
change?  I hope so.  As for providing for the well-being of all 
Canadians, without doubt the government can stand on its record. 
More than 427,000 were created last year alone and 85% of them 
were full time jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to make changes in the employment program, especially 
for seasonal workers and those men and women in Atlantic Canada 
who work in the fisheries.  We need to find some improvements.  I 
look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that 
happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  When the bill next 
comes to the House, the hon. member will have, if she desires, 
about six minutes remaining in debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time provided for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business has now expired and the order is dropped to the bottom 
of the order of precedence on the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 6.38 p.m., this House stands adjourned until tomorrow 
at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
