</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians now see this Liberal government as the enforcer of a 
policy that continues to discriminate against families where one 
parent chooses to stay at home and raise the children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than reward parents for such a noble sacrifice, the 
Liberals have entrenched a policy of systemic discrimination 
against and declared a tax war on single income families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Adding insult to injury, Liberal MPs could have voted yesterday 
to do something about the problem which they and the Progressive 
Conservatives created.  Instead of supporting Reform's motion to 
end this unfair discrimination, the Prime Minister waved his 
magic wand and the the backbench flock of mindless Liberal MPs 
obeyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So single income families will continue to be cheated. 
Meanwhile, Liberal MPs continue to obey their master instead of 
focusing on families which are under an intense tax burden and 
having difficulty making ends meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At election time, families will not forget this Liberal 
injustice.

individual taxation.  We do not believe, for instance, that when 
a lower income spouse joins the workforce he or she should be 
taxed at the rate of the family or the higher income.  We believe 
in progressive taxation.  That is our position.  At the same time

cares about tax fairness for families.  He has brought in six 
budgets that discriminate against them.  He ordered his 
backbenchers last night to vote against tax fairness for 
families.  Today he has his lawyers at the United Nations arguing 
in favour of tax discrimination.  Why does the Prime Minister not 
just admit that his policy is to discriminate against single

<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

needs that.  We do not want a system that penalizes those who are 
obliged to go to work.  We do not want the family member who

</I></B></P><P align=left>Her decision is especially upsetting because Quebec and Canada 
concur on many points in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister considers cultural diversity so important and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there are international rules to be followed.  This is an 
international conference, not one on the Francophonie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The French minister did not honour the agreements between France

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
was the case last year in Ottawa, when the government denied 
Quebec the right to express its culture, does this attitude on 
the part of the Prime Minister not show that the resolution on 
the distinct society was nothing but words, an empty resolution 
not even worth the paper it was written on? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of culture, Quebec has something to say.  Culture 
is within Quebec's jurisdiction and not that of the heritage

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the country we live in has two official languages, one of which

which is unique in North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the tantrum thrown by the Minister of Heritage against France 
not evidence of a limited and narrow-minded view of Canadian 
cultural diversity, if there is no place for Quebec on the 
international scene? 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
that was a government decision. We communicated with the French 
government.  We spoke with the office of the President of 
France, and the decision was not necessarily an invitation with 
the approval of the Government of France. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the circumstances, it was Canada's duty to ensure that the 
international rules were adhered to by everyone, France 
included.  We do not invite Corsica to cultural discussions here 
in Canada.

yesterday the finance minister said that our banking sector is

ago the minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board told 
the House that organizers of the farm rally in Regina last 
Saturday had insisted that only the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food or himself would be acceptable to represent the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 24 rally organizer Sharon Nicholson had written to 
the deputy minister of agriculture saying to please accept the 
letter as an invitation to attend in the minister's absence.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and 
Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the organizers of the rally had indicated that ministers 
were their preference to attend the meeting. Unfortunately, 
neither the minister of agriculture nor myself was available on 
the particular day that they had chosen.  In fact both of us were 
working on other fronts to defend the interests of farmers, the 
minister of agriculture on his way to Japan and myself in 
Washington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that on other occasions the organizers had 
indicated that deputies were acceptable replacements, but in fact 
I was referring to the elected part of the government.

we were told that only elected officials would have been 
acceptable, then today we are told that in fact deputy ministers 
would have been acceptable. One of those two statements is 
incorrect, so I would simply ask the minister responsible for the 
Canadian Wheat Board whether his statement on Monday is the 
correct one or if the statement of today is the correct one?

occasions they had also indicated that deputy ministers might be 
suitable substitutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is not really to argue about the substance of any 
particular meeting.  The point is to develop a program that will

the Speaker. Members allegedly quoted from their notes. During 
question period those quotes were attributed to members opposite. 
Are we saying that as long as we have something in a note form we 
can say anything we want about anybody in the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  No, we are not saying that at all.  What we 
are saying is that if there is an official document that a member 
is quoting from then we are entitled to see this document.  We 
are saying that on a document if there were notes made we are not 
entitled to the notes made on the document.  We are entitled to 
the document.  That is the ruling I made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I understand there is no document from the hon. minister.

Where persons engaging in emergency services such as police

would enable medical practitioners by order of the courts to take 
a blood sample from persons who are injured to test for the 
hepatitis B and C viruses and the human immunodeficiency virus 
because these are potentially lethal and infectious diseases. 
Those practitioners would inform the emergency personnel who were

</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK219">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from March 9 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-65, an act to amend the Federal-Provincial Fiscal 
Arrangements Act, be read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to resume debate on this important topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I began last day by talking about the government's approach to 
governing, its way of dealing with the Canadian public and with 
the provinces.  I reiterate that today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way the government deals with Canadian taxpayers, with 
provinces and with all individuals in the country is 
reprehensible.  It is an arrogant approach.  It sees itself as 
the one that has the only answers and it does not give credit to 
those individuals who are doing the hard work in the country, the 
taxpayers of Canada, the governments of the provinces and the 
local governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to some of the comments made by the government member 
for Broadview—Greenwood last day when he stated that he was an 
interventionist and stood proudly in this place to claim so.  He 
said his government's approach to intervening in the lives of 
Canadian individuals and provinces was the way to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the Liberal government believes.  I reiterate what 
he said, that the sectors of the western economic fabric were 
reinforced and embellished because of Government of Canada 
intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the member of the government is saying is that the 
development of western regions of the country was a result of the 
Liberal government, that it did it.  That is unbelievable.  I 
will list the provinces because I am not even sure the member 
knows those are the areas he is talking about: British Columbia, 
Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  The alienation committee can find it now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Yes, perhaps the alienation committee 
can find out on a road map where western Canada is.  It is no 
wonder the government has to send a crew out to do some kind of 
damage control when there are members of the government standing 
in this place making these kinds of comments, saying that the 
central Government of Canada, the Liberal Party of Canada, has 
been the creators of economic development in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us just talk about one example of that interventionist 
approach called the national energy program.  I am sure members 
of the government remember that.  It sucked billions of dollars 
out of Alberta to fund all kinds of other programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  $100 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  It was $100 billion, my hon. colleague 
reminds me, that it sucked out of the province of Alberta in the 
name of interventionism, in the name of “we have all the answers 
for you”.  That approach simply has not worked.  That is why 
there is Liberal alienation in western Canada.  That alienation 
is growing in all regions of the country with the kinds of things 
we are seeing the government do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw reference to that yesterday in the House.  We saw it 
today in question period talking about the government's continued 
discrimination against families, against families that have made 
the decision to have one of the parents stay home to look after 
the kids.  We heard discriminatory and inflammatory comments 
being made by the Secretary of State for the Status of Women, the 
finance minister and other key members of the government. That is 
their approach to governing and it is shameful.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill which would seek to establish equalization payments was 
done in the same fashion.  There was three days of notice that 
the bill was coming, after having five years to deal with the 
issue.  The government has had five or six budgets to deal with 
the issue of single income families and remedy the tax 
discrimination that it continues to enforce penalizing families 
in Canada and it did nothing about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government pays lip service to the things Canadians are most 
concerned about yet it fails to take action.  The bill is another 
example of the way of doing business with the Liberal government. 
The people of Canada are growing very tired of this approach. 
That is why there is western alienation and alienation in other 
parts of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I used an analogy last day of a famous Charlie Brown comic strip 
of which we are all aware.  There is character named Lucy who 
continues to pull the ball away from Charlie Brown just before he 
kick it.  That is how the Liberal government deals with the 
people of Canada.  It is holding the football, pulling it away 
every time and punishing taxpayers and other individuals as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Shame on him for repeating my 
remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  I hear harping from the member 
opposite, the member for Broadview-Greenwood, who made those 
comments.  He referred to interventionist ideas and that big 
government has the solution to all problems, which is truly not 
the case, as has been played out in history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to end on that note.  The government is out of touch. The 
bill proves it.  We offer a fresh vision and a new approach to 
dealing with the governance of the country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to respond to the member's 
remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would like to correct the record.  The member stated 
that I was an interventionist.  The reality is, and I say this to 
all members of the Reform Party, I am a passionate 
interventionist.  Let us make sure we get that right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The essence of why we are in the Chamber at the national 
government level is to intervene.  We are not here to sit back 
and watch those who do not have a voice or regions of the country 
that need help and sort of let it go, let it happen, let the 
municipal politicians do it, let the provincial politicians do 
it.  No.  This is what a national government is all about.  This 
is what the bill is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to correct another reference that the member made in 
terms of my remarks yesterday.  He suggested that I was not clear 
about the Government of Canada intervention and where or how it 
related to western Canada.  I believe the member made that 
statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be very specific.  By the way, I include my own 
province of Ontario, but seeing as the member referred to the 
west I want to be specific.  Every western province, whether it 
is British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan or Manitoba, has 
benefited immensely by Government of Canada intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time the Reform Party realized that is how we build a 
nation, by the national government intervening from time to time 
to embellish and improve the economy.  For the life of me I 
cannot understand why the Reform Party wants to walk away from 
interventionism.  To me, it is part and parcel of our daily 
responsibility in the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the national energy program.  It is another 
example of where the Government of Canada intervened in terms of 
security of supply in energy, the Canadianization of our energy 
system and the conservation content of the NEP.  Yet these Reform 
Party members were knocking it yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on, but I want to make sure that when members of the 
Reform Party are quoting my remarks they understand exactly where 
I stand.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I understand exactly 
where the member stands.  I was quoting directly from 
<I>Hansard</I>, from his comments.  He reinforced them again 
today. He is saying that he is a passionate interventionist and 
asking why it is that we cannot see that is the right way to go. 
It is very clear why we do not see that it is the right way to 
go.  It is because we fundamentally disagree with that 
philosophical approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is saying “Don't worry, Canadians, don't worry, 
provinces of Canada, we have all the answers.  We are the federal 
government.  We are the big daddy”.  That is the kind of thought 
he is putting behind his comment that the federal government is 
the one with the answers, that it has the answers and it has the 
resources.  He fails to point out that the resources he refers to 
are the tax dollars of Canadians, their hard earned money.  That 
is what those dollars are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member brags about the national energy program.  It 
sucked $100 billion out of Alberta to fund all kinds of other 
things that in many instances, not all, were wasteful programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member and his government do not understand their approach 
and how it has alienated individual Canadians from coast to coast 
to coast, particularly in western Canada, in British Columbia, 
Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.  Government members just do 
not get it.  They think that sending out this rescue team from 
Ottawa, this western alienation team, will somehow solve the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will solve the problem is when we have the opportunity to 
implement the policies which reflect the positive direction we 
have for the country, or when the government starts to listen.  I 
do not think the latter will happen because government members 
have had so much time here and continue to be deaf on issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are willing to make a positive change for the future.  I am 
hoping that members opposite will also be willing to do that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased today to say a few words on a very important bill 
not only for the province of Newfoundland and Labrador but for 
all provinces that receive equalization payments.  I believe 
there are seven provinces in Canada that receive them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces are very highly dependent on equalization to 
better their economic situation within the country.  It is very 
important to have the bill fully debated today by all members, if 
for no other reason than to make the federal government fully 
aware of the impact of equalization payments on the seven 
provinces of Canada that are recipients of the equalization 
formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was told that before the bill came before the House of Commons 
the province of Newfoundland requested some significant changes 
to the way the formula treats offshore resources, especially 
offshore oil and gas.  The government, I am told, rejected that 
request by Premier Tobin and the Government of Newfoundland and 
Labrador.  There really will not be any substantive changes made 
in the bill, probably a few minor housekeeping changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again the poorest province in Canada, the province of 
Newfoundland, will be penalized by the current equalization 
formula before it is given the chance to actually catch up to the 
rest of the country and to become equal to other Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what we are talking about today.  We are talking about 
the opportunity that should be given to the have not provinces to 
catch up to other Canadian provinces that consider themselves to 
be have provinces.  There cannot be any chance of a catch-up for 
Atlantic Canadians or for that matter western Canadians in 
provinces like Manitoba and Saskatchewan that also receive 
equalization payments as.  There cannot be any opportunity given 
to these provinces to catch up.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There cannot be a chance for equality in the provinces unless 
there is some recognition given to the fact that the pool of 
money that will keep a province from starving is the same pool of 
money that will keep it permanently poor. Newfoundland has been 
in Confederation for approximately 50 years.  In a couple of 
weeks Newfoundland will have been in this great country for 50 
years and there is still no recognition of the one basic fact 
that the pool of money that will keep a province from starving is 
the same pool of money that will keep it permanently poor. That 
is the unfairness and the injustice associated with the way the 
equalization formula is written. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will never be an opportunity for the provinces that 
receive equalization payments to be brought up to the same 
quality of life and the same standard of living that other 
Canadians enjoy. They will never have the opportunity under the 
current formula to reduce the horrendous unemployment problem in 
Newfoundland, which has an official unemployment rate of about 
19.7%.  That is a very serious situation indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that we should change the formula forever and a 
day.  I am saying there should be some kind of arrangement worked 
out with the have not provinces which will see resource revenues 
clawed back on a more gradual basis.  It is not to have the 
federal government take up all of the problems but to have these 
resource revenues clawed back on a more gradual basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now there is a 100% clawback on resource revenues produced 
by any given province.  That is the basic unfairness for the 
poorer provinces. If the federal government wanted, it could 
change that to make it a bit easier for those provinces, 
especially in the Atlantic area, to become equal to the rest of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, a Voisey's Bay development in Newfoundland could 
have its resource revenues clawed back on a 50% basis.  The Sable 
Island gas field in Nova Scotia could be clawed back on a 50% 
basis to give Nova Scotia the opportunity to become a little 
affluent and raise its standard and quality of life. The federal 
government has within its power the ability to do that, but I do 
not believe that is going to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that way there would be an opportunity to bring some fairness 
to the current equalization formula and to bring the unemployment 
rate and quality of life to the receiving provinces up to 
acceptable standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few months ago my private member's bill on Newfoundland's 
unemployment problem was selected and debated here in the House 
of Commons.  The point was made by someone speaking in that 
debate that if we had a fairer equalization formula applied to 
Newfoundland as it relates to our offshore revenues, not only 
would the province of Newfoundland be better off but Canada as a 
country would be better off as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to consider the fact that we are members of this nation. 
Any province that becomes better off is a net contributor to our 
country.  It makes it a bit easier to live within this country 
and makes it easier on the taxpayers within this country who 
would not have to continually be injecting funds into the have 
not provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the long run there is every reason for the federal government 
to want the provinces that receive equalization payments to be 
brought up to an acceptable standard.  The federal government 
could rest a bit easier and would not have that kind of burden 
placed upon it.

payments. This year she is going to receive approximately $925 
million in equalization payments. It will be a reduction.

equalization payments this year is the population factor, the 
fact that so many people are leaving our province on an annual 
basis. It is of great concern to the province of Newfoundland 
that we have a tremendous out-migration every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that determines the rate of equalization payments to a 
province is the population factor.  The population of 
Newfoundland has gone down significantly over the last number of 
years.  Over the past six or seven years we have been losing 
people at the rate of between 7,000 and 10,000 per year.  That is 
quite a decrease in population for a small province like 
Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that kind of population decrease occurred in Ontario or B.C., 
it would not be a great big deal but it is devastating for a 
province like Newfoundland with a population of half a million to 
lose anywhere between 7,000 and 10,000 people a year.  It is 
devastating not only in terms of losing some very good young 
educated people but because of that out-migration the province is 
losing equalization payments as well. That is a very big and 
important factor for the province of Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one overriding concern is that the federal government will 
deduct dollar for dollar the resource revenues that a province 
receives.  This will have the devastating effect of keeping that 
province permanently poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I neglected to inform the House at 
the outset of the hon. member's remarks that we are now into 10 
minute speeches without questions or comments.  The five hours of 
debate have expired. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was very 
interested in some of the comments made with regard to Bill C-65. 
I would like to read from the Constitution, section 36(2) which 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament and the Government of Canada are committed to the 
principle of making equalization payments to ensure that 
provincial governments have sufficient revenues to provide 
reasonably comparable levels of public services at reasonably 
comparable levels of taxation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle of helping each other through difficult times is 
an integral aspect of being Canadian.  It is something to be 
proud of.  That is the way in which the country was built. 
Neighbour helped neighbour.  We are now at the point where 
provinces help provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I return to a comment made by the hon. member for 
Broadview—Greenwood with regard to his passion about the federal 
government intervening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a rule book when it comes to relationships between the 
federal and provincial governments. That rule book is called the 
Constitution of Canada.  It is wrong to intervene and violate the 
provisions of sections 91 or 92. That is where intervention ought 
to halt.  It has not halted there. The government, through the 
use of its spending power, has intervened into the jurisdictions 
of the provinces of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our job as members of parliament above all else is to protect 
the Constitution of this country, the constitutional rights of 
every citizen and the constitutional rights of the federal and 
provincial governments as set out in sections 91 and 92.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the appeal court of Alberta rendered a decision on the 
federal government's Bill C-68.  Four of the five judges admitted 
that that federal piece of legislation encroached upon the 
provincial jurisdiction.  Three out of the five said it was all 
right.  What was their rationale to come to that conclusion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we read the judgment, they have accepted the doctrine that is 
enunciated by people like the renowned Mr. Peter Hogg who is a 
constitutional lawyer.  What does he say that justifies that the 
only institution of this country that can protect the 
constitutional rights of anyone, including the provinces, is the 
courts? He said that if the federal government introduces a 
scheme under one of its authority heads such as peace, order and 
good government, and if it should overlap and encroach upon the 
provincial governments, it is okay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the greatest of respect to Mr. Hogg and to those who 
support that ideology, I completely disagree, particularly when 
the provinces do not give their consent for that type of 
encroachment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the interventionist attitude of members on the 
other side, we ask where in the world did it come from.  What 
they are saying, and I believe this is my understanding of what 
the member for Broadview—Greenwood was implying, is that if the 
federal government feels that a provincial government is not 
doing the best thing for its people in an area of pure provincial 
jurisdiction as provided for under section 92 of the Constitution 
of this country, it can intervene without the consent of the 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national energy program that practically destroyed the 
energy sector in Alberta was an encroachment upon the provincial 
jurisdiction of that province. The member is saying that that is 
all right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems in this country is this thing called unity. 
We have problems because when the premiers and the federal 
authorities come together, they throw the rule book, the 
Constitution of this country, out the window.  When we begin to 
accept and when our premiers begin to accept the encroachment of 
the federal government into the jurisdiction of the provinces 
without their consent, it creates tensions which develop feelings 
of alienation which lead to feelings and expressions of 
separation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of parliament should be standing in this place to defend 
the constitutional rights of all citizens in this country and the 
components of Confederation, which are the federal government as 
well as the provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government sticks its nose into provincial areas 
unrequested. Yet it ignores those areas that fall under section 
91, which is its jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about interprovincial trade barriers?  What about the fact 
that it costs the consumers of this country, our children and 
their moms and dads, $5 billion to $6 billion a year because the 
government allows interprovincial trade barriers to be set up and 
maintained.  Under section 91 it is the federal government's 
jurisdiction to deal with that and it allows that kind of thing 
to go on.  Why does the government not stay in its area of 
authority and let the provinces look after their areas?  If this 
would happen, then the tensions that lead to disunity across this 
country would be eased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we want to set standards, let us do it in a co-operative 
way.  Let the federal government negotiate and use the power of 
persuasion and common sense to say to the provinces that it is in 
everyone's best interests if we have a standardized health care 
system, or a standardized measuring system, or a standardized 
criminal justice system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill opens the door for that kind of debate and 
intervention.  I say to the government, to the people of this 
country and certainly to members of parliament that it is our 
duty and responsibility to ensure that we are not led down the 
garden path by ideologies put forward by extremely passionate 
interventionists, if I can use the term used by the member for 
Broadview—Greenwood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government can intervene in provincial jurisdiction 
with the authority of the provinces.  However, we have had four 
provinces and two territories oppose Bill C-68 and other bills 
and the only institutions of government that can protect the 
constitutional rights of our provinces are the courts of this 
land.  We, as members of parliament, cannot do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was evident when Bill C-68 was debated and the aboriginal 
rights of the James Bay Cree and the Yukon Indians were being 
violated.  The evidence was very clear that their constitutional 
rights were being violated and members of this House could not 
protect them.  The only protection they had was from the courts 
of this land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the greatest respect to the Alberta court of appeal, we now 
have members on that appeal sitting on the bench saying “Yes, 
Bill C-68 intervenes into provincial jurisdiction, but that is 
all right”.  If the government introduces a scheme under one of 
its authority heads and it overlaps into provincial jurisdiction 
that is too bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am suggesting is that when that begins to occur without 
the consent of the provinces and the other partners in 
Confederation then we are contributing to the disunity of this 
country.  We are also contributing to the feelings of alienation 
that are all too high in some parts of the country.  We feel it 
every time we hold a public meeting in western Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, before I address Bill C-65 today I would like to thank 
the hon. member for Crowfoot for putting forward his grave 
concerns about how far this federal government is intruding into 
provincial jurisdiction.  I think my colleague from Crowfoot did 
that very adequately, especially in regard to Bill C-68, but it 
goes further, as the member is well aware. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interprovincial trade barriers are another strong case in point. 
The government refuses to look at the issue or even to address 
it.  However, it is not only this government.  We have become 
mired in this mess through not only this government, but through 
previous Progressive Conservative and Liberal governments from 
times long past, hopefully never to be repeated again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us have a look at this bill.  One of the things I find very 
contentious in regard to this bill is that equalization happens 
every five years.  The government has had five years to study 
this bill.  It is a large bill and it amounts to a large amount 
of money, yet the government decided that we would only receive 
three days' notice.  There was no draft legislation.  We were not 
allowed academic input.  What bothers me most is that there was 
no public consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have news for government members.  The people who pay the 
bills are the people who pay their wages.  I know they do not 
believe this, although I have said it time and again, but the 
government has no money.  It has exactly what it can gouge from 
the taxpayers of Canada.  That is the only money it has and that 
is the money it uses.  When it starts letting out hundreds of 
millions of dollars government members should be well aware of 
exactly what they are doing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one in this House is against helping those who need help, but 
most of us would agree that we should do it under a fair system, 
one that treats everything and everyone in this country equally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what we are talking about cost-wise.  This 
program will cost an additional $48 million in the first year 
which will rise to $242 million by the fifth year, once the 
changes are fully implemented.  Funding for the equalization 
program will increase by an estimated $700 million by year five. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about small amounts of money, no matter what 
some members opposite have said.  To me $700 million is a large 
amount of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might add that I am from the province of British Columbia, 
which is a have province.  I really have to wonder about that. 
Right now we have the highest unemployment we have had in many 
years in the province of British Columbia.  The logging industry 
is in dire straits with massive layoffs.  The mining industry is 
packing up and running, not only due to federal legislation but 
also greatly due to the provincial government that is in power in 
British Columbia today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of the government that is in power there today, I want 
people in the House to know that it is an NDP government, the 
so-called caring and sharing government of the working people, 
which brings me to another concern I have with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bills states that casino funds will be put into the mix.  I 
want everyone here to fully understand what happened in British 
Columbia with regard to charities, with regard to bingo and with 
regard to gaming by an NDP provincial government.  That 
government ripped that right out of those charities and now we 
are saying that we will go ahead and introduce it in this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a great concern that things might not all be on the up 
and up with some provincial governments with regard to where 
these funds will really go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member from Newfoundland said that Newfoundland has a 
rate of 19% unemployment.  That is high.  I had the opportunity 
to travel to Newfoundland last year.  I travelled across 
Newfoundland extensively.  I know they are having tough times. 
British Columbia as well is having tough times.  I cannot say 
that it is all the provincial government's fault.  I would have 
to say that a great portion of it falls right here on the 
shoulders of members sitting across the way because of high 
taxation.  We know that is what kills jobs.  What kills 
entrepreneurship and what keeps businesses from staying in the 
country is the high level of taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not hard to see where this government comes from.  It is 
called tax and spend.  I am not saying that the government has to 
go this route at all.  However, if it would look at the simple 
facts, which countries around the world have tried and tested, 
and if it were to cut taxation, the level of government revenues 
would actually increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to members across the way, believe it or not.  People 
start to create jobs then.  They have a few dollars in their 
pockets to spend and it does not go into the government's pocket. 
I know Liberal members do not like to hear that.  When it goes 
into the government's pocket that means the taxpayer no longer 
has it in theirs.  That upsets government members terribly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sort of like going back to the old days and knowing that 
if we could put something away for our retirement we would live 
far better in our elderly years.  This government only thinks of 
one thing.  The more it taxes, the better its members can live in 
their elderly years, not the taxpayer.  I really have to wonder 
about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the unfairness of some of this. 
Let us look at what the auditor general gave the government in 
1997 to address.  What has it done to date?  Absolutely zip. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1610"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general said with regard to the equalization 
payments that property taxes vary from province to province. 
Property assessment methods vary between municipalities, let 
alone provinces.  Property assessments are infrequent and done in 
different years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is lumping this all in as one, but it varies. 
Bring it in under the provincial GDP.  Let us open it up, have a 
look at it and discuss it.  Do not give it to us for three days, 
after the government has had five years to study it, especially 
when it has done zip.  Government members say “Here it is. 
Let's get at it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know members on the other side of the House understand that 
this is the way Liberals have done business for years and years 
and years.  However, on this side of the House the times are 
changing.  Whether they like it or not they are coming into a new 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sooner or later, you will have to take off your shades and 
address these problems with your eyes wide open for a change. 
The people of Canada are waiting for you people to finally do 
that. They have been waiting and waiting and waiting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully it will happen before all of you over there are in 
line for your old age pensions.  Then maybe you will not find out 
exactly what a large portion of Canadians have to live with, high 
taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say again that there is nobody in this House from any party 
who I know of who is against helping those who need honest help. 
Absolutely nothing.  However, let us look at this so that it is 
proper help and we do not keep ripping off the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say a prayer tonight in the hopes that the government 
will finally wake up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before we go on to 
the next dissertation, I remind all hon. members to address each 
other through the Chair. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, while my colleague from Okanagan—Shuswap was speaking I 
heard voices opposite saying “Where is the solution?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give those members some solutions which are a little 
different.  I have to speak slowly because, first, I certainly do 
not want them to miss this.  Second, it will be short and 
succinct.  It is a new idea.  It is my idea.  This is not the 
party speaking, this is me as an individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, staying with party general philosophy, we believe, as 
many Canadians do, that the federal government has its nose in so 
many things that it cannot do any of them, not even one of them, 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government interferes in areas of provincial jurisdiction. 
It gets involved in the daily lives of people from one end of 
this country to the other in an obtrusive manner.  What is the 
solution to that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it is to recognize that government only functions for one 
reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Can you not just say thank you? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member totally, 
non-stop, throughout the speech of my colleague who spoke before 
me kept saying “Let's have the solution”.  “Let's have the 
solution”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I stand poised to try to give that to him, but his mouth is 
going so fast that he cannot get his ears into gear.  That is 
probably why they cannot get these solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is only one justification for any government.  That 
justification is to do for people those things that they cannot 
or will not do for themselves.  That is the fundamental purpose 
of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go with that premise, then we start at the federal level 
and say that some things can best be done and need to be done at 
the federal level.  There are also a lot of things that are 
currently being done at the federal level, sometimes exclusive of 
provincial government, but sometimes inclusive of provincial 
governments where there are overlaps. 
All governments need to reduce themselves to doing only those 
things which the people cannot or will not do for themselves. 
Then those items need to be brought back as close to the people 
they serve as possible, because after all we keep suggesting we 
live in a democracy.  If we do live in a democracy, then we 
should also recognize that we as elected officials are not the 
rulers of people, we are the representatives of people. We are 
supposed to represent the will of those people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How better to do that than make sure the services we provide 
them are provided at the closest level of representation possible 
so that people have the most input into that process. If the 
federal government would do that, reduce to doing about 20 things 
and make sure that it does them well and gets out of all the 
other things, it could reduce the size of federal government, 
transferring those responsibilities and duties to closer levels 
of government to the people.  If it did that successfully then we 
could reach a point where we could return to the way this country 
used to be run where there was no federal taxation whatsoever. 
Taxation was at the provincial level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the way this country started out.  We had provincial 
taxation.  The federal government of the day back during a world 
war said we need taxation to pay for the war effort. The 
government does not seem to realize the war is long over. Even 
with all that taxation revenue coming in and the war over, it has 
run up this incredible debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments are starting to recognize the folly of deficit 
finance.  Governments at the provincial and federal levels are 
starting to recognize that.  Let us keep it going.  Let us get 
back to the point where we say that there are only certain things 
the federal government should be doing.  Stop doing all the other 
things and give the responsibility back where it belongs to the 
provinces and possibly even closer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government does that successfully then we can have 
taxation at the provincial level alone.  Where then does the 
federal government get its money?  It gets its money by billing 
the provinces a fee for services rendered.  It bills them on the 
basis of the provincial GDP.  There is the equalization, 
notwithstanding the truthful comments that my colleague from 
Okanagan—Shuswap made about what a disastrous job the current 
government in British Columbia is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbia is still potentially a very wealthy province. I 
suspect there will soon be a change of government in British 
Columbia.  We can get ourselves back on our feet again. That 
means British Columbia, my province, will pay a little more for 
those services than some other provinces that do not have as high 
a GDP.  As a B.C. taxpayer, I do not have a problem with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking in the wrong direction in terms of these 
equalization payments of taking money away from everybody and 
divvying it up.  Look at the taxation system.  An individual 
making $8,000 or $9,000 a year pays income tax.  They cannot live 
on the gross amount but they still pay income tax.  The 
government says it recognizes that they cannot live on that. That 
is why we have different types of support type payments to help 
these people out.  Then on what little money they have left the 
government charges them GST.  Again it says that it recognizes 
that people with that low an income cannot afford to pay GST, so 
it created a GST rebate program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can people not see the folly of creating a bureaucracy that 
takes people's money away on one hand and then creating another 
bureaucracy to give them some of that money back, using most of 
it up in the collection and distribution process?  It obviously 
makes much more sense to stop taking it in the first place if we 
know we will have to give it back.  We can do that and solve the 
equalization problem, solve a lot of the taxation problems and 
solve a lot of the overlap problems by reducing federal 
government to only those things that need to be done that can 
best be done at the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill the provincial governments a fee for services rendered on a 
provincial GDP basis.  That will be the equalization.  We will 
have a lot more control in our province.  In the province of 
Alberta, it would give a lot more control. Alberta is another 
very responsible province that seems to be running well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others can take a page from that.  If they cannot run well in 
the province, the people have the closest access to do something 
about it.  It seems when people come to Ottawa they forget they 
are here to represent people and take on a life of their own.

possible alternative to maybe a kernel of a new idea.  I know 
they will not change their entire line of thinking now on the 
basis of this but I hope it does plant a seed in the minds of 
some of those people and maybe in the minds of people who are 
watching this today to think there are alternatives.

have something they can better work with that is fairer for all 
Canadians.

legislation like this but all we see from this side of the House 
is a government frightened of making mistakes and, like a deer 
caught in headlights, it freezes and does nothing instead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House certainly have no problem with the 
concept of equalization.  Equalization grants have been held up 
as representing Canadian values and as the essence of Canada, 
supposedly the very stuff that makes us a country.  Like many 
government myths, this one is so thick with rhetoric and 
misconceptions that average Canadians, the ones paying for and 
supposedly benefiting the most from this redistribution, are 
probably unclear what we are arguing about.  Canadians are not 
sure how this affects them one way or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To them we can add just about every expert in this country and 
of course the bureaucrats in the finance department responsible 
for this complex, convoluted scheme.  I believe they have 
forgotten what the object of equalization really is and are so 
busy inventing new calculations to hand out taxpayer money that 
they do not look at what they have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that section 36 of the Constitution calls for promotion 
of equal opportunities and a reasonable level of public services 
to all Canadians across the country.  These are noble ideals. The 
Constitution does not define these terms or set out how these 
imaginary levels are to be reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years the Liberals have applied this peculiar formula 
to the question. If it is simple, make it complex.  If it is not 
working, it has to be a lack of program funding so add taxpayer 
money here.  It will all get better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The announcements made by the Prime Minister and the finance 
minister concerning the social union and equalization fit into 
this category of fiscal policy.  If there are strains in 
Confederation it is because they have not layered enough 
bureaucracy on it.  Is somebody still complaining?  Throw some 
more money at them and they will shut up for a little while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There does not seem to be any recognition that the money comes 
from the same taxpayer who is already paying into these 
provincial coffers or increasingly now paying user fees for all 
sorts of public services. There is no federal money versus 
provincial money, only taxpayer money.  Everyone across the 
country can agree that governments are getting too darn much of 
it these days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an established principle that whenever a government 
involves itself in an economic activity there will be 
distortions.  We have to accept some of this no matter what we 
do.  Even if we cut taxes, and I mean really cut taxes, not the 
shell game we see bandied about here, we know this will affect 
the behaviour of our citizens in different ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no such thing as no effect, only good or bad effect. It 
is sometimes difficult to predict what the outcome might be. 
Lower taxes tend to increase investment, savings and debt 
repayment, which are all good effects.  It is also possible that 
people may go on a buying spree with that extra cash and fuel 
inflation or increase imports over exports, which is not 
necessarily good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important consideration is that lower taxes put the 
freedom of choice back into the hands of Canadian taxpayers and 
that is a great effect in itself.  The key to minimizing the 
distortions we see and the political manipulations in this 
program, making sure that what we are really trying to accomplish 
is actually happening in the real world, is to keep programs 
transparent and accountable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone should be able to understand how and why the program is 
set up and be able to make adjustments to changing conditions or 
to new information as they gather it.  What does this government 
do instead? It adds layers of complexity and rushes a flawed 
package through parliament before anybody can really get a good 
look at it.  Government members typically protest that they have 
consulted and studied but they conveniently ignore that there is 
a big difference between public debate and publicly available 
information. The public is not informed about the shortcomings of 
the equalization program and is instead flooded with empty 
rhetoric like the price of being Canadian, who we are as a 
nation, and helping the have nots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When critics rise up to say the program is not doing what it is 
supposed to do, they are accused of not wanting to help the poor 
or of trying to split up Confederation or some other such 
nonsense as we have heard here lately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government were really interested in helping Canadians 
make the best possible lives for themselves it would many things. 
The first thing it has to do is make sure it is not engineering 
an outcome it claims it does not want.  All Canadians want their 
fellow citizens to have good and sustainable jobs, access to 
education and health care, to enjoy the benefits of living in one 
of the world's greatest countries. Make no mistake, they know it 
is only fair that their fellow citizens work just as hard as they 
do to get these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are famous for our obsession with helping the less fortunate 
and I hope we never lose that impulse. I fear that if Canadians 
are constantly confronted with the fact that government programs 
are often counterproductive or so badly designed that money 
intended for the poor ends up in the hands of lawyers, 
bureaucrats, lobbyists and so on, anywhere but where it will do 
the most good, they will become cynical and lose faith in what 
government tries to sell them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we consider the size of the underground economy and the 
rate of brain drain out of this country, we can see this effect 
is already settling in.  We all know what happens to some people 
who are given something for nothing.  Most self-respecting people 
want to get off welfare but some take it as a subsidy for a 
lifestyle choice and remain in that rut for years.  If you are 
being given money to continue to do what you are already doing, 
naturally you will continue doing it.  Why not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should we think provincial politicians will be any 
different?  We know many of them have worked hard to investigate 
options for employment and new wealth.  We also know they have 
clung to old industries or methods because it has been 
politically dangerous for them to make the tough decisions and 
because taxpayers from somewhere else are backstopping the 
expenditure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not mean to point fingers anywhere in particular or at 
anybody.  All provinces and all politicians have good and bad 
examples.  I do not mean to simplify the historical reasons why 
one province or region developed the way it did.  There can be 
many factors contributing positively or negatively at various 
times.  We are discussing only equalization here, and there is no 
question that getting billions of dollars from somebody else's 
budget affects the decision making process, political 
manipulation if you will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-65 adds complexity by roping in more revenue sources than 
were originally included.  It tries to calculate gross values of 
resources without taking into account what it cost to generate 
those revenues in each province or region.  It includes side 
deals to let Nova Scotia and Newfoundland play catch-up with 
resource wealth but squeezes mineral wealth into one category. It 
does nothing to address the fact that property taxes, one of the 
single largest sources of provincial revenue, are calculated 
differently not only from province to province but often within 
those provinces as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last item is of extreme importance.  Property taxes have the 
ability to kill investment as fast as any other factor.  We have 
heard recently how our NHL teams are paying relatively high 
amounts and are suffering from this.  Ontario has recently gone 
through a revision process and many businesses have found their 
property tax bills going up by hundreds of percentages.  We saw 
that a short time ago in Saskatchewan.  It really cut deep.  This 
can kill a small business or a farm.  High property taxes damage 
the construction industry and discourage development of 
manufacturing infrastructure.   We see industry moving to the 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does Bill C-65 do?  It actually rewards the provinces for 
high property taxes.  When a government raises this tax it lowers 
its value but raises the entitlement of the government to more 
equalization money.  It is counterproductive.  Nobody raises 
taxes on the expectation of suffering a loss but we see 
governments doing this anyway and being rewarded for their 
counterproductive behaviour by the federal level of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already highlighted how the net effect of equalization 
is to hold tax rates higher than desired in the contributing 
provinces and allows receiving provinces to shift their tax bills 
in artificial ways to maximize those entitlements.  In effect 
this means that lower income people in the so-called have 
provinces are paying extra so higher income people in the have 
not provinces can escape the real cost of subsidized programs. 
This is not really helping anyone.  It is just a transfer of 
funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some provinces can offer social programs whose costs are carried 
by other Canadians who have no access to those very programs. 
This is not equalizing anything for any Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals seem to twist this into some kind of cruel 
conspiracy, but they are wrong.  I am sure they are more 
frightened that they will lose the ability to micro manage the 
economy and therefore lose their purpose as a governing party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see why they come up with complex bills such as Bill 
C-65.  The thing they fail to realize is that Canadians already 
vote with their feet on this.  Brain drain is an excellent 
example.  Industry moving to the States is another excellent 
example.  My province of Saskatchewan is another great example. 
Our single greatest export is our bright-eyed youth marching off 
to Alberta and the States.  After all, if we are one big happy 
country, why is it considered failed policy if Canadians decide 
to go where the jobs are?  It is their right.  They have to make 
a living.  They have to go there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How should equalization work?  It must be transparent.  All 
Canadians should be able to look at the mechanism and understand 
it.  There is no way they will support it anyway.  My party 
suggests the macro formula.  It is very simplified.  We would 
look at the province's GDP per capita, not at hundreds of little 
variables, and focus the transfers to the provinces where they 
are truly needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it difficult that my home province of Saskatchewan is a 
have not province.  We are rich with agriculture, high tech 
manufacturing, resources and biotechnology.  It has a very 
educated population.  We export them and they head up companies 
all over the world.  We have a long history of superdevelopment. 
When will that province take responsibility for its misdirected 
economic policies?  Clearly not as long as someone else is paying 
the bills from somewhere else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other federal systems around the world.  Germany has a 
system where the wealthier regions contribute to a pool of funds 
that can be drawn on by the less wealthy regions.  We have to see 
more flexibility in the way we work in this country.  We do not 
see anything in Bill C-65 through the fog of rhetoric and 
complexity that is piled up here. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
remind colleagues what the legislation is about.  It is intended 
to renew the current five year equalization agreement which 
expires on March 31 of this year.  It is a typical example of the 
government trying to rush things through at the last minute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically the bill makes technical amendments to the formula 
that determines equalization payments.  It also maintains 
provincial income tax revenue guarantee payments for provinces 
that have tax collection agreements with the federal government. 
The legislation will allow those payments to be continued beyond 
the end of this month until March 31, 2004. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There would not be any need for equalization payments if the 
government took a position of encouraging the free market 
principle, that people will go where the work is, and started to 
enact policies which reorganized how people function within the 
country to build a secure future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had people in my own riding say to me it probably would 
be doing the country a major benefit as a whole if we worked 
through the House to try to entirely remove the need for 
equalization payments over a decade or so.  The present system 
that has been in place for 40 years has done absolutely nothing 
to solve the problems of inequality.  It just keeps topping up 
the money and perpetuates a cycle of dependency, never, ever 
making things better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Common sense tells us that if the money were left in the pockets 
of workers and companies in the provinces of Ontario, Alberta and 
B.C., which are the have provinces that contribute to everybody 
else, they would produce much greater economic benefits offering 
even more jobs and needing even more support services from the 
have not provinces that presently provide things like dairy 
products from Quebec and telephone centre services from the 
maritimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the same principle as the one which says that a dollar 
in the hands of an entrepreneur, a parent or somebody who gets to 
spend it in the private sector will be much more productive for 
the economy than the same dollar given to government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments unfortunately always waste a portion of the money. 
They simply shuffle it around in the paperwork and it gets lost. 
It is quite obvious that maybe they collect a dollar in taxes but 
that dollar never reaches the recipient it is supposed to get to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be obvious even to the most cerebrally challenged 
Liberal that some of the money collected in the taxes for the 
purpose of equalization will be lost.  I do not know how much 
that is, but I would be surprised if it were less than 15%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wasting money is the government's special skill.  I have an 
example that was sent to me by one of my constituents, a Mr. Jim 
Galozo, last week.  He came to my office and gave me copies of 
advertisements that were placed by the federal government in the 
<I>North Shore News</I> on February 19, 24 and 26. 
They were full page advertisements that must have cost $10,000 to 
$12,000 each.  There were only a few words on the page: “$11.5 
billion more is a real shot in the arm for our health care 
system” and then “the Government of Canada”.  This is a 
terrible waste of money as identified by my constituent.  It is 
the type of waste of money that we see throughout the government. 
It is certainly there in the transfer of payments.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my constituent, Mr. Galozo, and all my other constituents 
do not really believe that the waiting lists a year from now will 
be any shorter than they are today.  The problems will still be 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No wonder B.C. voters get angry over these programs of 
equalization.  All they see is waste and more waste.  Frankly it 
perturbs them and puzzles them how we can be sending money to 
provinces when they have travelled there and do not see them as 
have not provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague mentioned Saskatchewan and the richness of what it 
can do for the economy.  B.C. farmers are very disturbed by the 
fact that they are forced to take butter, cheese and dairy 
products from Quebec.  The B.C. dairy farmers are not allowed to 
make butter or cheese.  There is something wrong with that 
scenario.  Nobody really believes that Quebec is a have not 
province.  These are real problems that need to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration sitting here 
on one of those rare occasions.  She comes in for a lot of 
criticism in B.C. as well.  She shows so little concern for the 
criminal refugee problem in the province that most people think 
she might as well be a cardboard cut-out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member from Coquitlam has said he has the ear of the Prime 
Minister, although I wonder when he has it whether it is attached 
to the Prime Minister.  That seems to be a problem as well. While 
the minister of immigration is here, I hope she will take a 
serious look at the problems in B.C. which she could address if 
she really put her mind to it.  I can see by the expression on 
her face that she does not have the slightest intention of doing 
so.  Since we will get absolutely nowhere with the cardboard 
cut-out, I will continue with the bill that is in hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned the have not provinces are listed as Quebec, Nova 
Scotia, Newfoundland, Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, P.E.I. and 
Manitoba.  Manitoba will loose about $37 million by the end of 
the five year term.  Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia do not 
qualify at all as have not provinces, so we are picking up the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the government really understand how the people in B.C. 
feel?  I am a member from B.C. and I know that there are other 
concerns from the other have provinces.  Speaking for B.C., does 
the government really understand how B.C. voters feel when they 
have to pay enormous amounts of money, billions of dollars to the 
federal government, only to see it transfer to these other 
provinces that do not appear to be have not provinces? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbians do not have any problem with assisting 
provinces that obviously need help to get out of a depressed 
economic situation.  Reform has proposed in the past that the way 
to correct these economic problems is not to throw money at it 
the way the Liberals do and have done for 40 years under the 
equalization program, but to do things that actually stimulate 
the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in the last parliament the Reform Party proposed 
that one way this money should be spent is on developing 
meaningful infrastructure, not on the boondoggle giveaway 
patronage laden infrastructure the government runs.  It would be 
the type of infrastructure that would, for example, build a 
freeway from the eastern part of Canada down to Boston.  This 
would start to assist north-south trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week on one of my flights here I was sitting beside a lady 
from Halifax.  She was telling me how important the amount of 
tourism from the United States is to her small craft store.  I 
asked her if it would be helpful if there was a decent highway 
system that ran north-south to encourage tourism. She thought 
that it would be a great idea to put in a major freeway running 
through to Boston to get more tourism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned earlier about how B.C. farmers are forced to take 
cheese and butter from Quebec when they are quite capable of 
making it in their province.

</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last provincial election in Quebec, the leader of the 
PDQ was on a radio show in Vancouver.  The talk show host, Rafe 
Mair, asked him about his knowledge of transfers to Quebec.  That 
leader of a political party in Quebec, the PDQ, said that Quebec 
did not get transfers.  He had no knowledge of it at all.  He did 
not even know there were equalization payments that came from 
B.C. and were transferred to Quebec.  He seemed to be quite 
muddled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of basing equalization payments on the ability of a 
province to tax, Alberta should get a transfer payment if that is 
the logic.  I wonder what would happen if Alberta tried to 
introduce a provincial sales tax.  Since there is no chance of 
Alberta ever managing to introduce a provincial sales tax its 
ability to tax is reduced.  Maybe it should be a have not 
province.  The government should add the ability to add a PST to 
the other criteria on the list for equalization payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to repeat that instead of constantly renewing these 
arrangements where we transfer huge amounts of money from one 
part of the country to another, we should be looking at ways of 
breaking the welfare dependency cycle that gets created by these 
payments.  We should look at ways of tough love. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe there should be a 10 year phase-out period where the 
provinces get their full transfer payments for 10 years but they 
have to be working on programs that get them off equalization 
payments.  The federal government should do its best to assist 
them in making that happen.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia—Lambton, Lib.)</B>  moved that 
Bill C-393, an act to amend the Competition Act, 1998 (negative 
option marketing) be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am sure that those who are milling 
about will want to hear that next week marks the beginning of 
consumers week in Canada.  It is my pleasure to start the debate 
on Bill C-393 which is a law proposed to change the Competition 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill has several themes of fairness. These revolve around 
fairness where there is no protection of consumers, fairness in a 
marketplace where there is little or no competition, and fairness 
for consumers against large business interests.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-393 deals with the business practice known as negative 
option sales and marketing.  It involves receiving a product 
because a consumer failed to say no to the offering of it and 
then the consumer is asked to pay for it.  This practice known as 
negative option marketing or sales is a perversion, a twisting of 
what is generally accepted as being the normal rules of contract 
or sales, which is that an offer is made, acceptance is given in 
the affirmative and the delivery of the service and payment for 
that service are reasonably simultaneous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who use negative option sales reverse that method.  An 
offer is sometimes made, sometimes it is hidden, and sometimes 
there is no apparent choice at all. Instead of accepting the 
offer, the consumer is expected to say no, that he or she does 
not want the service.  If a consumer fails to say no, then the 
service is provided, the consumer is billed for it and is 
expected to pay for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are certainly one of the few countries in the world which 
allows federally regulated businesses, or undertakings, as the 
Competition Act calls businesses, to engage in this type of 
scurrilous behaviour.  It is a sleight of hand type sale of a 
service. It is often a straightforward case of taking advantage 
of consumers who have little means to protect themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negative option sales occur under many guises or disguises.  I 
will give some examples of this technique. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One is in the realm of banking.  About a year ago the National 
Bank in a brochure enclosed in monthly bank statements and sent 
to people in a certain area of Montreal was advertising health 
care coverage for those travelling outside Canada.  Hidden or 
buried inside the brochure was an invitation, in fact a 
requirement, that recipients say no to the offering, failing 
which their accounts were debited $9.95 a month.  Thousands of 
people did not know they were being charged $9.95 a month for an 
offer they in fact did not want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The end result according to the Consumers Association of Canada 
was that following the start of the debiting of accounts, 
individual bank branches were receiving between 40 and 50 
complaints on any given day. The bank would reverse the offering 
but there was no way of quantifying how many seniors and other 
people who did not take the opportunity to check their bank 
statements were paying for a service which they did not know they 
were receiving, for which they did not know they were paying 
$9.95 a month and more important for many of them, for which 
there was no use or benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may think this is preposterous and some may doubt that it 
happened, yet the Consumers Association of Canada had hundreds of 
complaints involving this one specific case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second example is a couple who applied for a bank mortgage to 
purchase their first home.  Once again, in the mass of paper they 
were required to sign, there was an offering, a suggestion—and I 
use that term very loosely—that they would buy through the bank, 
term life insurance equal to the mortgage amount. When the first 
mortgage payment was made, the couple realized that they were 
paying an insurance premium in addition to the principal and 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their omission was their failure to say no to the offering, no 
that they did not want the term life insurance.  There was no 
requirement to say yes.  In brief, failure to say no was by the 
negative option formula an affirmative, a yes to the insurance 
policy.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third example concerns university students at the University 
of Ottawa moving into town in September.  The first thing they do 
is call Bell Canada to have a phone installed.  The phone is 
installed and they are simultaneously told they will receive two 
months of call waiting free of charge.  Their problem is that at 
the end of two months the bill starts ticking.  At the end of 
month three, there is an additional charge of $2.70 tacked on to 
their bill when they had purchased a service they did not know 
they were buying, they did not know they were paying for it and 
they never once said “Yes, I know what I am getting.  I want it 
and I know what I am paying for it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth example is even more insidious.  In the summer of 
1997 the Toronto Dominion Bank enclosed an eight page brochure in 
the bank statements it sent to hundreds of thousands of Ontario 
residents, including residents of the city of Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The flyer was called “You and Your Privacy”.  In its eight 
pages the flyer purported to state that the Toronto Dominion Bank 
was very concerned about its clients and how it protected and 
stored information about its clients.  And let us face it.  Who 
knows more about an individual than a banker?  When people build 
a relationship with a bank over a period of many years, the bank 
has all kinds of information about them, their assets and their 
spending habits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Page seven of the brochure contained a negative option 
suggestion.  It said that the Toronto Dominion Bank was going to 
share all this information that it had collected. In the 
relationship as banker and client, it was going to share that 
information with its related corporations such as TD Mortgage, TD 
Green Line and Toronto Dominion Insurance.  Unless the clients 
called the bank and said no, that they did not want the bank to 
do this, on October 31, 1997 the Toronto Dominion Bank took all 
of the information it had amassed from hundreds of thousands of 
people over many years and downloaded it by computer to its 
subsidiary companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did this happen?  Because it required the consumers to say 
no, they do not want this to happen. There is an interesting 
twist on this.  A gentleman reported to my office that he had 
called and said that he did not want this to happen.  It was 
pointed out to him that because he had a joint bank account, his 
wife in addition must say no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see from this that large federally regulated corporations are 
imposing an onerous and unreasonable burden on people to escape 
from a situation or to escape a product they do not want and 
which they are being asked to pay for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth and final example I will use involved cable companies 
in this country.  If we were to ask any of the eight million 
cable subscribers who the masters of negative option marketing 
are, the answer would be very clear.  It is the cable companies 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can and should ask why we need this bill.  The answer is 
very specific.  This bill is designed to apply to federally 
regulated undertakings or businesses which operate in a 
marketplace that has little or no competition.  This bill is 
about giving consumers a fair shake in the face of limited or no 
competition.  After all, banking, telecommunications and 
broadcasting are all areas of business in which there is at best 
limited competition, if any at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote from a February 2 editorial in the Hamilton 
<I>Spectator</I> concerning this very bill:  “This bill would 
change the Competition Act to force federally regulated companies 
to get the express permission of customers for any new service”. 
It is not a very revolutionary idea to have the customers say 
“I know what I am buying.  I know what the cost is and what the 
implications of it might be and yes, I want it”.  What could 
possibly be wrong that?  To have federally regulated companies 
obtain a positive express response of yes before supplying and 
charging for a service is the way business is done in this 
country and in most countries of this world. 
I have to ask why anyone in this place would want to allow it to 
be otherwise.

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill constructs a firewall between the consumer and the 
industry and the consumer and the regulator.  This bill 
recognizes that regulators such as the CRTC have failed to 
protect consumers from companies which would provide TV services 
and telephone services which are unwanted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would not allow the sale of health insurance policies 
to unsuspecting bank clients.  Why would anyone in this place 
want to be part of a scheme that would allow this to happen?  I 
suggest even further that those who would want this to happen 
should come forward and say so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know there will be those who oppose it on the grounds of the 
Constitution, that is to say the federal government does not have 
the power to prohibit this.  To those people I would simply note 
this bill deals only with federally regulated undertakings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By way of comparison, Bill C-20, currently before parliament, 
regulates the sale of goods or the questionable sale of goods by 
telephone.  It is certainly difficult to recognize that Bill 
C-20, a government telemarketing bill, is intra vires while Bill 
C-393 would be ultra vires because they both deal with federally 
regulated undertakings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, there are provincial laws which note the federal 
powers at the level of telecommunications.  For example, the law 
concerning consumer protection in the province of Quebec, a law 
which is above all provincial, was written several years ago.  In 
it the rights of consumers are enunciated and it makes very clear 
that the law of Quebec regarding the protection of consumers does 
not apply to broadcasting.  Why?  There is no question that 
broadcasting is clearly a matter for us in this Chamber to deal 
with. Banking is also clearly a matter for us in this Chamber to 
deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is sadly an area of growth according to an Industry Canada 
study undertaken recently.  After all, what could be easier than 
to sell a product where there is no need to market it, advertise 
it or persuade consumers they really want it or need it.  Most 
businesses, in launching a service or product, need to determine 
there is indeed a want for the product or a public desire for the 
service and that the consumer is willing to put out the money for 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does all this mean in terms of removal of consumer dollars 
in a situation where choice is eliminated?  Let us consider the 
case of the cable industry in 1996 where cable rates, through 
negative option techniques, rose about $4 per month per 
household. The end result was about $400 million being siphoned 
from the Canadian economy into one sector, cable companies and 
their program providers, under circumstances where consumers 
could not say yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In return what did we receive?  We saw services which were never 
ordered and quite simply were often not even wanted.  This was 
$400 million of discretionary, after tax dollars, about $50 per 
household from the eight million cable subscribers in this 
country.  This is $50 of which they no longer had any control; 
hundreds of millions of dollars to an industry where there is no 
competition and in which four corporations control more than 90% 
of the Canadian marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us also consider the situation of the unknown purchase of a 
life insurance policy to pay off a mortgage in case of death, a 
mortgage policy which the consumer has acquired unknowingly but

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is good and prudent to buy this insurance.  If a purchase is 
made by negative option that consumer was never given a fair 
chance to shop the marketplace and get the best possible price. 
It is a matter of working the marketplace for the best possible 
deal in terms of service and price.  Negative option marketing 
and sales cuts the legs out from under this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The office of consumer affairs at Industry Canada in a study of 
negative option sales and marketing observes: “In general, 
profits or convenience would appear to be the motivation behind 
negative option marketing and/or bundling”.  Industry Canada, 
the department responsible for the Competition Act, has 
recognized the thrust of this business practice.  It is all about 
profits, money and the ease of obtaining it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the September 21, 1996 edition of the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> 
columnist Tony Atherton asked: “How on earth does a country of 
barely 30 million souls find itself on the brink of underwriting 
a total of 51 specialty channels when it can't seem to support 
one national public broadcaster?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a fair question.  The answer which Mr. Atherton supplied 
himself was: “By now it should be obvious that the usual rules 
of economics don't apply to the cable industry.  Canadian book 
publishers fold, Canadian magazines tiptoe on the edge of 
bankruptcy, yet many Canadian cable TV services make money hand 
over fist”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He made the insightful observation: “Lack of demand is not an 
issue because cable channels are not in business to meet demand. 
They are in business to create it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is negative option marketing is selling where there is 
no market.  Negative option techniques allow sales where there is 
no demand.  It is a phenomenon which creates both market and 
demand where neither exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Industry Canada has noted in its discussion paper on this topic: 
“Government does need to examine its role in influencing and 
promoting this type of market behaviour in view of users' or 
taxpayers' expectations”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an appropriate time to raise the spectre of Canadian 
expectations in terms of marketplace. In a real marketplace where 
there is demand and open and free competition, consumers can shop 
for quality, price and choice.  When consumers shop for virtually 
any product they expect an array or a continuum of choices and 
prices.  In the realm of banking, telecommunications and cable 
there is little to none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to refer to a story published last week, March 
6, in the <I>National Post</I> which reported a dispute over 
market share between Shaw Cable and Look Communications.  Look 
has 6,000 subscribers and Shaw has 1.6 million, a real David and 
Goliath story.  It appears that Shaw is trying to win back those 
6,000 subscribers by offering free cable to those who have been 
given a choice in the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is even more interesting to note that Look has now gone to 
the CRTC to ask it to step in to mediate the dispute.  What could 
be more ironic, the CRTC mediating a dispute between two 
corporations when in the past it has talked about this being a 
market matter, a matter of competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want choice but they also realize that in a large 
country with a relatively small population choice in certain 
industries is not always absolute.  Having said that, they do 
want to control the circumstances of exercising that choice. 
Negative option techniques remove any suggestion of choice.  That 
is why we in this place must move to give consumers that right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the verge of consumers week I quote a press release issued 
today by the Consumers Association of Canada about this bill: 
“It is timely that private member's Bill C-393 is being debated 
in parliament this week prior to world consumers rights day. 
World consumers rights day celebrates eight fundamental consumer 
rights, of which the right of choice is paramount.  A piece of 
legislation that bans abusive negative option marketing is a 
positive step in the promotion of consumers' right to choice”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-393, an act to amend the 
Competition Act with respect to prohibition of negative option 
billing.  I recognize the work of my colleague from 
Sarnia—Lambton on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know he has worked tirelessly in the interest of consumers and 
I respect any member who is prepared to champion an issue despite 
pressures from within their own caucus to be dutiful 
backbenchers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is designed to prohibit the practice by federally 
regulated businesses such as banks, cable and telephone companies 
of implied consent billing.  It would restore the traditional 
buyer-seller relationship that relies on the consumer's explicit 
consent before they can be billed for a product or service and 
would prohibit default billing of consumers who do not expressly 
decline a product or service. In other words, it would put an end 
to what is being called negative option billing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before making a decision about supporting this legislation, I 
had spoken to many Canadians about this billing practice.  It is 
clear that this bill has broad support among consumers frustrated 
by negative option billing. In particular, there is frustration 
with cable providers that bill for new programs automatically 
unless the consumer expressly rejects the service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumer groups have cited senior citizens as an example of a 
group often unaware that they have the choice of opting out of a 
new service and are consequently billed for programs they do not 
want or sometimes cannot afford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this is just one example let us take a minute to examine 
our own lives.  How many of us are aware of our own dinner plans 
this evening, never mind the intricate details of our cable 
bills?  The only time we are typically aware of these details is 
when we expressly order the products or services.  We are often 
just to busy to be careful consumers. This is a source of 
frustration not simply because of financial costs but because it 
is deemed to be a violation of an age old relationship between 
buyers and sellers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that consumers are looking for protection from 
negative option billing. The question is simply how do we provide 
this protection.  Should it come in the form of Bill C-393 or can 
it be achieved through market based reforms?  I think a balance 
must be struck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-393 has its origins as Bill C-288 which would have 
amended the Broadcasting Act to restrict negative option billing 
by cable companies.  These companies can currently act with 
relative impunity as they are federally regulated regional 
monopolies that are free from the normal constraints of a 
competitive market. This new version of the bill is broader and 
instead amends competition laws that apply to all federally 
regulated industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decision by the hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton to use the 
Competition Act as a means by which to prohibit negative option 
billing instead of making changes to the legislation that deals 
directly with the perpetrators of this practice is troubling for 
me.  Competition laws can profoundly restrict economic freedom 
and market efficiency, and the general move toward strengthening 
these laws should be approached with caution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill should not be seen as a mechanism by which to restrict 
attempts made by companies wishing to expand their market share. 
We must not allow our competition laws to grow steadily more 
intrusive.  We must act vigilantly to create competition through 
deregulation of our industries in the interest of every Canadian 
consumer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original purpose of this draft legislation in the form of 
Bill C-288 was to amend the Broadcasting Act.  This dealt much 
more directly with the source of the problem and would be the 
preferable course by which to protect consumers against negative 
option billing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Negative option billing is a practice common to federally 
regulated industries that enjoy market protection such that they 
restrict or limit the consumer's ability to seek out alternative 
providers of a product or a service.  Therefore the deregulation 
of federally legislated industries should be the first step to 
eliminating negative option billing and other practices that do 
not properly serve consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would much rather have been more supportive of an initiative 
that worked to limit government in increased consumer choice 
rather than an initiative that extends the scope of government 
further into the private sector.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports limited government and free 
enterprise, but recognizes the important role of government in 
creating an economic environment, with fair and transparent 
rules, that protects both consumers and businesses.  However, we 
differ from the governing party in that we believe that markets 
serve consumers well as long as competition is permitted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-393 is a band-aid solution made necessary by the Liberal 
resolve to maintain protectionist policies and regional 
monopolies in federally regulated industries such as cable, 
telecommunications and banking, despite the fact that these 
policies hurt consumers.  However, sometimes a band-aid solution 
is needed until the disinfectant can be found. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I conclude, I want to provide an example that illustrates 
the power of competition to end negative option billing, in case 
my colleagues in the House have their doubts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure we are all familiar with Columbia House Records.  This 
is a company that made its money through negative option billing. 
After signing up with the bulk music distributor, consumers are 
sent cassettes and CDs on a monthly basis.  If they do not send 
the selections back to the company, they are billed for the 
merchandise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a pure example of negative option billing because 
the customer agreed to these billing terms by signing up with the 
company.  However, the point that is relevant is that consumers 
were so hostile to this form of billing that the Columbia House 
sales began to decline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Soon a competitor entered the market and advertised that it 
would not engage in negative option billing at all.  When faced 
with this competition, Columbia House very quickly revised its 
negative option billing practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the drive for profits in a competitive and 
deregulated industry will give more power to consumers to seek 
favourable terms.  It is the invisible hand of capitalism at 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, it is clear that the Liberal mismanagement of 
federally regulated industries has created an economic 
environment in which consumers suffer the ill effects of limited 
competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this bill regrettably increases the power and scope of the 
Competition Act and restricts private sector decision making, it 
should receive the qualified support of the Reform caucus until 
such time as these industries can be deregulated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After this deregulation, competition will ferret out those 
businesses that conduct their affairs in a manner inconsistent 
with consumer interests.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf of 
the Bloc Quebecois, I wish to be very clear.  We have a great 
deal of sympathy for the intent of the member for 
Sarnia—Lambton's bill, which is to ensure that consumers have 
control over what services businesses supply them with.   The 
Bloc Quebecois will not, however, be in favour of Bill C-393 any 
more than it was of Bills C-216 and C-288, for the reasons I will 
now give. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton has expanded his bill. 
Once again, incidentally, I would like to point out that we have 
considerable sympathy for him in particular, since he was great 
friends with a woman I considered my friend here in this House. 
But the Quebec consumer protection legislation, Loi sur la 
protection des consommateurs or consumer protection act, is 
clear, and already bans the practice he wishes to ban with his 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The relevant section of the act reads as follows  “No merchant, 
manufacturer or advertiser can demand any money for goods or 
services provided to a consumer, when the consumer has not 
agreed to receive such goods or services”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our stand is that this legislation does not apply merely to 
businesses classified as coming under provincial jurisdiction. 
There was, for instance, the case of the supreme court decision 
on Irwin Toy's appeal of the ban in the consumer protection act 
on advertising aimed at children.  The supreme court agreed that 
Irwin Toy was not entitled to run ads that went against the 
consumer protection act.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Commenting on this decision and talking about telecommunications 
businesses lawyer Pierre Trudel wrote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—provincial measures that are not as such intended to apply to 
federal businesses so as to govern their operation may have a 
certain impact on them.  It may therefore legitimately be 
concluded that provincial legislation will not be <I>ultra vires</I> 
simply because it may affect business decisions to be taken by 
those who develop or disseminate advertising— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left> 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—provided that these provisions do not result in these 
laws undermining what rightly constitutes their federal 
specificity. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left> 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mention in passing that, having the industry critic as the 
Competition Act was amended,  I was on several occasions told 
that the Competition Act was not consumer protection legislation 
and that it simply concerned relations between competing 
businesses.  I have a transcription in which Mr. Flaherty 
himself said: “It is not consumer protection legislation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our second argument, the stronger, which will bring us back to 
the heart of the argument, is that, for the Bloc Quebecois and I 
hope for many others in this House, this bill will conflict—if 
not more—with the CRTC's authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out here that the CRTC has a job to do, a mission, 
including in section 3, that “French language and English 
language broadcasters, despite a certain communality, differ in 
terms of operating conditions and in the long run in terms of 
their needs”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Need I point out that the operating conditions of broadcasters 
are not the same in North America and in Canada in English and 
French.  That is why the chair of the CRTC argued before the 
Senate that it had the power to prevent the use of negative 
option marketing, which it had not used for consumer protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representatives of the Association des consommateurs québécois 
told the committee that, although the intention was certainly 
good, although the grounds for introducing the bill might be 
noble, and although there would be advantages in English Canada, 
in French Canada and in Quebec, it was another matter. One of 
them said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are sure that the authors of the bill never examined or 
understood the disastrous impact of the bill on Canada's 
francophones.  They would surely have wished to take them into 
account had they understood.  In the final analysis, we are 
relying on their good faith, and we therefore hope that they 
will see the validity of our position. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The speaker goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Need it be repeated that, for consumers in Quebec, choice of 
programming means not just in English, but obviously in their 
own language as well? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that the CRTC has long understood this fact and that 
this is why it has refused to impose a single set of regulations 
across the country ... instead taking an approach that recognizes 
that the francophone market has different needs. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on at length.  This was Ms. Drolet's testimony. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentarians must take this extremely important dimension 
into account.  I know that they did not do so when they voted on 
Bill C-288, but I repeat that, now more than ever, francophone 
viewers need the continued protection of the CRTC.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, when to our dismay Bill C-216 and then Bill C-288 were 
passed, Quebec's then Minister of Communications, Mrs. Beaudoin, 
said how extremely sorry she was that this had happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said “Although the specific purpose of the bill is to 
prohibit negative option marketing, it has a much greater impact 
because it prohibits every other marketing method except pay per 
view television and particularly because it involves such 
limited distribution that no new French language service will 
every get off the ground”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Minister Beaudoin spoke of her concerns about the negative 
effects this may have on the supply of French-language television 
services.  She said “The French language specialty channels, of 
vital importance in the current context of open availability, 
need a critical mass of viewers if they are to be created and to 
survive. The federal bill will, in fact, deprive any French 
channels, including the four new ones, of that critical mass”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the first hour of debate.  The bill will be debated 
further, and we would ask the hon. members of other parties, and 
of the other language in particular, to consider the market 
conditions in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would conclude by saying that the CRTC did not act on its own 
authority in deciding on this approach to competition; it was 
the government's approach, and the French-language media must be 
allowed to live, not just to merely survive, within that 
context.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as the New Democratic Party spokesperson for consumer 
affairs I am pleased to speak to Bill C-393 which was proposed by 
the member for Sarnia—Lambton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last parliament the NDP caucus supported the member's 
earlier effort to ban negative option billing through Bill C-216, 
a private member's bill that was seeking to do the same thing at 
the federal level as had already been done by the NDP government 
of British Columbia which amended its consumer legislation to ban 
negative option billing in that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current bill proposes to amend not the Broadcasting Act, but 
rather the Competition Act to ensure that negative option billing 
or negative option selling and marketing is prohibited in all 
sectors under federal jurisdiction, including telephone services, 
cable television services, financial services and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Banning negative option billing is a way of telling the 
providers of those federally regulated services that, where their 
customers are concerned, yes means yes and no means no.  There is 
no implied consent in silence.  If they want to charge customers 
for a new service, they have to be asked first.  Ask them nicely 
and make the sale by convincing them that they need it or want 
it.  The service has to be sold, not forced down people's 
throats, who are then charged for it.  The rules cannot be 
changed in the middle of the game without their permission.  It 
is just not fair from the consumer's perspective.  That is a 
principle with which I agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some members who are concerned that this bill will 
defeat the licence that was recently approved by the CRTC for the 
Aboriginal Peoples Television Network.  This approval was the 
creation of the network, APTN, and it requires the cable 
companies to carry this channel on their basic package.  I am 
assured by members, and in particular the sponsor of this bill, 
that Bill C-393 will not impact on the CRTC's order to include 
APTN on cable companies' basic services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a most significant and sad day in the last parliament to 
see the earlier version of this private member's bill, which 
achieved the extraordinary step of being approved by the House of 
Commons, effectively killed by the unaccountable, unelected 
Senate which made a somewhat pointless amendment and sent the 
bill back to the House where it died on the order paper when the 
election was called in April of 1997 for June.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a member of the House at that time and I well remember the 
public outrage in the winter of 1995 when the cable companies 
introduced new specialty channels and restructured their cable 
package lineups.  Let us face it.  Winter is cold in Canada 
sometimes, except in Saskatchewan where I come from, and people 
like TV. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cable companies removed some channels from their basic cable 
lineups and were expecting their customers to pay extra for them 
unless they read the fine print and cancelled the services, all 
this with the approval of the CRTC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New channels were also introduced into what was a much more 
hostile environment than the channel originators probably 
deserved simply because people were so appalled at the negative 
option billing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard a lot of negative comments about that in my constituency 
office.  No wonder the bill enjoyed support on both sides of the 
House.  Since senators do not have constituency offices, or even 
constituents to whom they are accountable, it is also no wonder 
they did not respond to the outrage but responded instead to 
their friends, the giant cable companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the town of Lumsden, after receiving numerous phone calls 
from very angry cable subscribers, I personally met with Image 
Cable Systems and persuaded it to hold public meetings with its 
customers in Lumsden.  Subscribers who attended the meeting said 
overwhelmingly that they did not support the proposed changes to 
the cable lineup and Image Cable Systems retracted its initial 
billing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What made the customers most angry was simply the fact that they 
were never asked in the first place what they wanted.  I am 
pleased to see the measure before us in parliament and pleased 
that the member has seen fit to include other federally regulated 
industries in its scope.  I agree with him that we are also 
seeing the phone companies and some banks testing the waters with 
these kinds of marketing schemes.  It needs to stop now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us remember that most federally regulated industries are 
granted certain privileges to conduct business in a protected way 
for they provide essential services to the economy and the people 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In return for this privilege, which often means they are 
guaranteed certain levels of profit as well, they have a higher 
duty to conduct their business in an ethical way.  Because the 
bill proposes to change the Competition Act, we should have 
disposed of any concerns that the legislation somehow intrudes 
into the jurisdiction of the provinces.  It is very clear that 
the federal government is responsible for competition policy and 
federally regulated industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps it is time for parliament to take some time and 
undertake a more comprehensive review of competition policy and 
the Competition Act.  Private member's Bill C-384 sponsored by 
the member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, which proposes another 
change to the Competition Act, ought to be before committee for 
study in the next few months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had longstanding criticisms of the ability of the 
Competition Act to deal with pricing in the retail gasoline 
market, for example.  With the changing nature of the 
international economy, the simultaneous trends of increased 
mergers and acquisitions, and the growing number of small 
businesses in our economy we need a much more active competition 
policy to ensure that the marketplace works well for consumers 
and for small business owners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have raised the concerns of independent gas retailers in 
Saskatchewan with the Competition Bureau, concerns that affect 
consumers in my province in particular.  The number of 
independent gas retailers has declined dramatically.  I would 
argue, not coincidentally, that we now have the highest gas 
prices of any jurisdiction in Canada even though our tax regime 
is identical to those of British Columbia, Manitoba and Ontario. 
I understand the Competition Bureau is investigating for the 
criminal investigations branch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also this week the leader of the New Democratic Party, my 
leader, the member for Halifax, raised very grave concerns about 
the impact of Sobey's assuming control of 75% of the food 
wholesale market on the east coast.  The takeover of Oshawa Group 
by Sobey's controlled Empire Ltd. would mean that small family 
restaurants and corner stores will become price takers from one 
food wholesaler.  That hurts them and it will hurt consumers 
dramatically.  It is a competition issue and it is a consumer 
issue.  It is time we made a comprehensive re-examination of the 
whole policy area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the government to stand up and fight for ordinary 
Canadians by establishing a comprehensive consumers protection 
act.  We are the only country that does not have one to protect 
consumers.  Instead we have an act that protects giant 
multinationals and huge corporations from the people and 
guarantees them huge profits.  That is unacceptable in this day 
and age.

the United States has.  I am not saying that more is better but 
what we have now is not, as I am told every day, working for 
anybody but the large corporations and the very wealthy families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, I support the principle of the member's bill.  I 
hope it receives wide support from the House once again and is 
not stalled in the unelected, unaccountable, unacceptable Senate 
of Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
speak tonight to second reading of Bill C-393, an act to amend 
the Competition Act as it deals specifically with negative option 
billing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I congratulate the member for Sarnia—Lambton for 
sponsoring the bill.  Whether one agrees or disagrees with the 
member's views on matters as diverse as the Senate, child custody 
or other topics of debate tonight, in negative option billing one 
cannot help but admire his determination in pursuing these 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need more members like the member for Sarnia—Lambton in the 
Liberal caucus.  We need more members who challenge the status 
quo, defy the establishment when need be and stand up for the 
interests of their constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As others have attested, Bill C-393 had a previous life in the 
35th parliament.  In that parliament, the member for 
Sarnia—Lambton introduced Bill C-216 which would have amended the 
Broadcasting Act.  The legislation was sparked by public outrage 
at the cable companies imposing negative option billing through 
the addition of specialty channels at the beginning of 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As such, Bill C-216 dealt solely with cable television.  Despite 
opposition from many powerful interests, the member for 
Sarnia—Lambton persevered, managing to guide the bill through 
first and second reading as well as committee and report stage 
before it passed the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately for the member's efforts Bill C-216 was still 
under review by the Senate when the prime minister called the 
1997 federal election.  Bill C-216 was effectively killed by the 
member's own government which was not under any pressure to go to 
the polls only 3.5 years into its first mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may be some, perhaps even the member himself, who would 
blame the Senate for the death of Bill C-216.  This is a 
misguided view because the Senate was playing its 
constitutionally mandated role to review legislation from the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been too many occasions in the past several years 
when the Senate has undeniably improved legislation, correcting 
errors not addressed on the House side.  The Liberal government's 
so-called Pearson airport legislation and more recent amendments 
to the Judges Act are but two recent examples.  Until the Senate 
is either reformed or abolished, we should stop attacking its 
members for trying to the job to which they were named. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-216 is history.  We are now debating Bill C-393.  As 
previously mentioned, the bill would amend the Competition Act to 
ban negative option billing in a whole host of sectors: certain 
financial institutions, broadcasting undertakings, 
telecommunication firms and insurance companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, Bill C-393 protects a basic consumer right, the 
right to express consent before purchasing a new product or 
service.  What this means in plain language is that consumers 
cannot be billed for a product or service without their clear 
consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Sarnia—Lambton and organizations such as the 
Consumers' Association of Canada make a compelling case against 
negative option marketing practices.  I think many of us would 
agree that this type of marketing reverses the traditional 
buyer-seller relationship.  With negative option billing 
customers are offered new products or services and are required 
to opt out or expressly decline these new offerings to avoid 
being charged for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From a legal standpoint negative option billing relies on the 
concept of implied consent.  By not responding to the 
solicitation the consumer is deemed to have given his or her 
consent.  It is fair to say that negative option schemes rely on 
market inertia to sell new products or services to an existing 
client base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore a justifiable claim that negative option billing 
further concentrates market share with the dominant industry 
players instead of fostering competition in an open marketplace.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-393 applies to federally regulated businesses such as 
banks, cable and telephone companies.  Under the law select 
financial, insurance and broadcasting companies would not be 
allowed to use a lack of consumer response to negative option 
billing inquiries as consent to buy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill wisely allows provincial governments to prohibit 
negative option marketing within their jurisdictions.  Provinces 
such as Quebec have already taken steps in this direction, a 
point that was highlighted by the Bloc in the last parliament and 
also tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While provincial governments have progressed somewhat in 
addressing these dubious marketing efforts, there is a noticeable 
lack of such consumer protection at the federal level.  Cable 
providers are still using negative option billing in regional 
markets despite previous assurances to the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Industry Canada's office of consumer affairs has warned that 
negative option marketing has the potential to be an important 
tool in the financial services sector.  The department's August 
1996 discussion paper on this subject stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Examples include the sending of unsolicited credit cards and 
changes in account structure made without consumers' 
consent....  The new technologies could allow industry to profit by 
slipping new charges and services past unsuspecting customers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the Toronto-Dominion Bank employed a negative option 
technique to deprive bank customers of their privacy.  The 
National Bank reportedly used a similar scheme to sell travellers 
health insurance to existing customers by debiting their accounts 
for $9.95 per month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased that Bill C-393 recognizes that there are 
situations in which a consumer benefits from a negative option 
billing arrangement.  However, for this to be the case, consumers 
must be able to make informed decisions and give express consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-393 proposes certain steps to be taken for a negative 
option scheme to be legal.  The bill proposes fines for those who 
contravene the act.  Bill C-393 has received the support of the 
Consumers' Association of Canada, the Public Interest Advocacy 
Centre and the Insurance Brokers Association of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although Bill C-393 is strong on consumer protection I would 
like to know the views of such organizations as the Canadian 
Chamber of Commerce, the Alliance of Manufacturers and Exporters 
Canada, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business and the 
Canadian Bankers Association, among others.  We must always be 
prudent as parliamentarians not to impose an excessive amount of 
laws and regulations on the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We already have the sad example of the federal cost recovery 
program which was introduced by the Liberal government.  While 
the move to user fees for the private sector was initially 
welcomed by businesses of all shapes and sizes, the government's 
chosen structure has proven to be ineffective, disparate, 
incompatible and costly.  As a result this program cost the 
Canadian economy over $1.3 billion from our GDP and 23,000 jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us always be careful in bringing in government intervention 
no matter how well intentioned it seems at the time. Furthermore, 
I would like to know how the bill would impact upon the provision 
of French language broadcasting services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chairwoman of the CRTC, Françoise Bertrand, warned the 
Senate transportation and communications committee that Bill 
C-216 could result in a lack of marketing flexibility that would 
hurt the financial sustainability of French language services in 
Quebec and across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that all members of the House, especially 
bilingualism's newest friends in the Reform Party, would want to 
ensure that Bill C-393 does not similarly threaten French 
language broadcasting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada I 
offer qualified support to Bill C-393 at second reading.  The 
overall intent is extremely positive.  The legislation would 
significantly increase the level of consumer protection.  I urge 
all members of the House to put aside partisan interests and 
support moving the bill along to the industry committee where it 
would be given closer scrutiny on issues such as the one I have 
raised this evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I applaud the member for Sarnia—Lambton.  We need more 
initiatives from Liberal caucus backbenchers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron—Bruce, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise this evening to address the matter currently before the 
House.  I would like to extend my sincere appreciation to the 
member for Sarnia—Lambton for his continuing work and long term 
interest with respect to this matter.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-393 embodies a very simple premise.  That premise is that 
the consumer should have the right to say no.  In short, only I 
have the right to accept goods and services and only I have the 
right to share my personal information with others.  No one else 
should presume to have that authority without my express 
permission.  Negative option marketing endangers this.  In plain 
language, self-protection is what we are debating here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems simple enough.  If I wish to sell a person a product or 
a service I must first convince them that they require the item 
and then get their delivery approval and eventually their 
payment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This simple formula has been the basis of our capitalist system 
for centuries.  With this in mind it might surprise many of my 
constituents and indeed Canadians in general to discover that 
although this formula is used frequently, it is no longer used 
universally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I continue it should be noted that first British and now 
Canadian common law in simple terms states that anything that is 
not specifically prohibited is permitted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to clarify the current legislative regime with respect 
to this matter to account for this.  Some of our provinces have 
already taken appropriate steps to rectify this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly feel that it is time for the federal government to 
standardize this protection right across Canada and Bill C-393 
would do exactly that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also a popular misconception that a signature is required 
to validate an agreement.  This concept is brought into question 
when one applies the notion of the negative option billing or 
approval process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should all be familiar with the mail order tape and video 
clubs.  One of my staff members is involved with one of the more 
popular Canadian compact disc clubs.  He tells me that every 
month he is issued a card that names a specific music selection 
referred to by the club as the selection of the month.  He is 
given approximately 20 days in which to respond to the mailing. 
Should he fail to reply, the item and the bill is shipped to him. 
In short, the said company considers his lack of response to be a 
purchase agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a glance this does not seem to be a bad arrangement. 
However, suppose the mailing was delivered to the wrong address 
or even lost.  My employee would receive the compact disc and the 
invoice without ever having the option to refuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another such example would be the cable TV package.  As we will 
all remember, not too long ago some of the major cable providers 
utilized the negative option billing concept to sell unsuspecting 
viewers a new programming package.  As I recall, public outcry 
was so substantial in this instance that the cable providers had 
to backtrack on this plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has become clear that the public is demanding change.  Again, 
I would suggest that this bill advocates that type of change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list of examples seems to go on endlessly.  I was recently 
reading a publication released by the Toronto Dominion Bank 
entitled <I>Your Information and Your Privacy:  See How TD 
Protects Your Privacy</I>.  This document assured me as a consumer 
that the protection of my personal information was of paramount 
concern for the bank.  The document even went so far as to say 
that the bank would never sell customer lists or my information 
to other groups or individuals.  I cannot tell hon. members how 
pleased I was to read this.  I cannot stress enough how upsetting 
it can be to discover that personal and confidential information 
had been released by an individual, group or institution that I 
trusted to sources that I would not have invested with that 
trust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can all name many examples of this type of information 
pillaging.  Many Ontarians will remember how, in the not too 
distant past, the Ontario Ministry of Finance sold a list 
compiled from information contained on private tax rolls to 
outside interests.  I remember the angry callers who approached 
both my constituency office and myself asking if I could do 
anything to help them.  Today, by supporting this bill, I am 
attempting to ensure that this never happens again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to the TD publication, after assuring me that the 
bank would not violate my trust, the document went on to say 
“For your convenience, if we do not hear from you by October 31, 
1997, we will proceed with sharing your information within the TD 
group and may contact you occasionally with offers of products 
and services we believe will be of interest to you”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence, this brochure tells me that the bank will throw 
itself on the tracks to protect my confidence, but it also tells 
me that it intends to release my information to others for 
alternative marketing purposes.  That is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it clear that I am not suggesting that consumers 
should not be given a full range of options.  I simply believe 
that they should be required to provide express consent before 
incurring the expense or before the personal information is used 
for purposes other than the one that it was originally secured 
for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would respectfully encourage my colleagues to add their 
support for this bill to that of groups such as the Insurance 
Bureau of Canada, the Public Interest and Advocacy Centre and the 
Consumers Association of Canada.  It is the right thing to do and 
as legislators the negative option is not available to us.  No 
response when this vote is called will mean no sale for Bill 
C-393.

<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise on behalf of my constituents in Halifax West to 
raise with this government the issue of the future of the port of 
Halifax.  In response to my question in the House of Commons on 
November 19, 1998, the Minister of Transport said “We are 
certainly open to suggestions”.  I do have a number of 
suggestions and a number of questions that I know many people in 
Halifax would want this government to answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Late last month the intergovernmental affairs minister claimed 
there would be federal cash available for Halifax if it won part 
of the super port pie.  I am concerned about the impact on 
Halifax's ability to win part of the super port contracts if this 
federal government is unwilling to show to the industries 
concerned in more detail the depth of its commitment to this 
economic development opportunity for Halifax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This could be a half billion dollar investment in the economic 
future of Halifax.  Estimates suggest that already the port of 
Halifax supports 7,000 jobs directly and indirectly and generates 
almost a third of a billion dollars in economic activity 
annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Upgrading the port to handle post-Panamax super ships would do 
much to help with the economic development of the region.  These 
super ships are too wide to navigate the Panama Canal.  One 
encouraging fact is that Halifax has natural harbours deep enough 
to accommodate the 50-foot depth that the Maersk and Sealand 
container companies suggest is needed to handle their super 
ships.  At 45 feet New York hits bedrock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in my riding have already raised the issue of the 
environmental impact of a super port.  I want this government to 
be clear that it will support a complete, fair and thorough 
environmental impact assessment before it moves one teaspoon of 
earth should this project go forward.  While I join others in 
looking forward to a major economic boost for the region, it must 
be done in such a way that protects long term environmental 
interests.  The assessment must be fully open to public 
participation and the public must easily have all the relevant 
information available to it.  No corner cutting can be allowed if 
we are to properly ensure that long term economic planning walks 
abreast of long term environmental planning.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address some 
of the concerns that have been with raised with respect to the 
port advisory committee process in Halifax.  These comments are 
directly related to the comments made by the member from the 
opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of the port advisory committee was to develop a user 
nomination process in response to the requirement in the Canada 
Marine Act to consult with users on certain board appointments. 
This nomination process has been reflected in the letters patent. 
The purpose of this process was to solicit names for user 
representatives to Canada port authority boards and to forward 
nominations to the Minister of Transport for consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Port advisory committee members will not be appointing directors 
to the Halifax port authority.  The authority is an agent of the 
crown and the majority of directors are appointed by governor in 
council.  In addition, the province and the municipality each 
appoint a board member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure the process was inclusive, port managers were asked to 
contact users and invite them to attend a nomination meeting.  In 
addition, an advertisement was placed in the local newspaper 
advising of the port advisory committee nomination meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the composition of the port advisory committee, 
a broad cross-section of port users was represented, including 
members of the Halifax Chamber of Commerce and the Halifax 
Shipping Association.  The list provided by the port advisory 
committee was used by the minister in making his recommendations 
to the governor in council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As with the provincial and municipal appointees to the Halifax 
port authority board, each user representative will serve the 
board with a view to the needs of the Halifax port authority as a 
whole.  I am sure that at no time will these competent 
individuals lose sight of some of the concerns mentioned by the 
hon. member from the opposition.

<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
follow up on a question I asked on December 7, 1998.  It was in 
relation to the fact that the United Nations committee had made 
it clear the Friday before that the Canadian government did not 
take good care of the disadvantaged members of its society, and 
recommended a reform of employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time I asked the federal government to reform employment 
insurance.  We are in March now and still waiting for the 
Minister of Human Resources Development to show us some light at 
the end of the tunnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One cannot be satisfied with the response I was given at the 
time by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, particularly when he spoke of relief for low income 
families, that is 400,000 taxpayers, when there are 800,000 
people who do not qualify for employment insurance. He mentioned 
the youth employment strategy, but these are short term, not 
long term jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, I asked the Minister of Human Resources Development what 
he intends to do about gappers, and the black hole. He answered 
this question by saying that only 2,000 workers were affected. 
Does the minister know what is going on in his department? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding alone, there are 3,100 people who could be called 
gappers, not to mention those in the riding of my colleague, the 
hon. member for Beauséjour—Petitcodiac. Does the minister know 
what is going on? The only reason there are only 2,000 gappers 
left is that they are being eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Camille Thériault, the premier of New Brunswick, said that 
newcomers will not be eligible. This is what is happening in New 
Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking the Minister of Human Resources Development to look 
at this issue and wake up. There are people who are suffering. 
These are individuals who contributed to the employment 
insurance fund. The minister must realize that seasonal workers 
are suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a problem in Atlantic Canada. There is a problem in 
Saskatchewan, with only 19% of the unemployed qualifying for 
employment insurance. 
There is a problem in Ontario, where only 23% qualify for 
employment insurance. How can the minister rise in this House 
and say such terrible things? Why is he not able to look after 
human resources and employment insurance issues, instead of 
trying to defend himself by saying “There is no problem. We are 
creating jobs. We are creating this. We are creating that”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He should come and see the hardship the Liberal Government of 
Canada has caused. Now, the provincial government is making 
matters worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will end on that note. I hope the minister will wake up and 
take a serious look at this issue.

<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
government understands that some families who are unemployed or 
living on EI live in difficult situations. We have tried to be 
sensitive to their circumstances.  That is why for example we 
introduced the family income supplement which tops up the EI 
benefits of about 220,000 low income claimants with children, 
two-thirds of whom are women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must ask the member opposite to recognize that the overall 
objective of the EI program is more than just giving the 
unemployed EI benefits for as long as possible. Instead, it means 
ensuring that people can have the skills and opportunity to work 
and can feed their own families. Merely giving people income 
support and keeping them on the economic sidelines year after 
year will not improve their lives or enable them to benefit from 
new opportunities in our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are trying to help those people get the skills needed to earn 
a full income because we believe this is the truly compassionate 
thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While EI is an essential part of our social safety net, it is 
not the only solution.  Our net is strong and fair because 
different programs exist to meet different needs.

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>EI is supported by a number of other programs to help unemployed 
Canadians get a job.  For example, there is the $7 billion the 
government puts in for low income families through the Canadian 
child tax benefit.  For youth we invest $155 million every year 
to help young Canadians get on the job experience.  For people 
with disabilities we invest, along with the provinces, $430 
million to help them find and keep a job.  For those trying to 
adjust to the new working conditions of the new economy we have 
set aside $2.1 billion for active measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how we are showing compassion, by ensuring a 
comprehensive set of measures exists to meet different needs. 
The fact that unemployment is at its lowest level in over eight 
years tells us that our approach is working and we hope the trend 
will continue.

Canada.  Members from all political parties attended this 
important event.  The guest speakers were Dr. Donna Mergler, a 
nervous system disorder specialist at the University of Quebec in 
Montreal, and Dr. Herbert Needleman, professor of child 
psychiatry and pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh's 
school of medicine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. Mergler is an expert on the effects of manganese on the 
human population.  Dr. Needleman is recognized internationally as 
a key figure behind the removal of lead from gasoline in the 
1970s to protect the world's children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These distinguished speakers drew upon their respective 
histories and expertise to call on this country to act with 
precaution and to conduct intensive studies in relation to MMT 
fuel additives.  They outlined the potential similarities of 
lead's adverse health effects on humans that MMT may pose.  They 
urged Canada's leaders not to repeat the mistakes that the 
repeated delays with lead fuel additives created.  Millions of 
children were unnecessarily exposed and suffered a variety of 
neurological and physical effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health minister has demonstrated this government's refusal 
to act proactively or to in any way show leadership, political 
will or vision.  When the need to protect Canada's children 
requires a precautionary approach this government disappears. 
For example, the issue of metals and chemicals in children's toys 
was ignored for a year by the minister until independent lab 
tests proved the danger and the government was forced to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has also resumed toxic PCB shipments to Swan 
Hills contrary to a company official confirming that there will 
always be fugitive emissions, dioxins and furans spewing 
throughout the countryside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government continues to ignore reality.  Sick children are 
not relocated from beside this country's infamous toxic waste 
site, the coke ovens and Sydney tar ponds.  At a time when the 
government tells the Canadian public that precautionary principle 
is policy, we know by its inaction and delay that this is not 
correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several weeks ago the EPA in the United States initiated a new 
series of studies into MMT.  The majority of European countries 
and the United States do not use this product.  We are guinea 
pigs for a corporation and a government that have lost direction 
in the face of trade and profit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After four months of further government delay to protect 
Canadian children, what studies have been reviewed by Health 
Canada, if any?  Has the health minister drawn any conclusions 
from the recent reports from Denmark on the potential health 
effects to workers from manganese operations?  Has the minister 
looked at the study from British Columbia that may show a marked 
increase in manganese concentrations in soil collected along 
thoroughfares since MMT became a fuel additive replacement for 
lead? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the minister bother to read the peer review in the infamous 
Toronto study relating to MMT that raised serious questions about 
the report's validity?  Will the minister or any other minister 
in the government today take precautions on MMT for the sake of 
Canada's children?  The government's track record states no.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I start by stating very clearly 
that the health of Canadians, particularly the health of Canadian 
children, is a priority for Health Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's decision to delist MMT was in response to a 
ruling by a panel established under the agreement on internal 
trade.  In acting on the panel's recommendations the government 
also moved to resolve Ethyl's NAFTA claim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada conducted a thorough review of the health effects 
of manganese that could be attributed to the use of the gasoline 
additive MMT and published those findings in December 1994. The 
review considered all age groups, including children and the 
elderly, and concluded that the vast majority of Canadians are 
exposed to levels of manganese that are well below a level of 
concern as determined by Health Canada and the World Health 
Organization. I remind the member that the report is an 
assessment of the health impact of MMT and not an endorsement of 
its use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In developing the conclusions reached in the report, Health 
Canada reviewed the science contained in over 200 published 
research papers.  Departmental scientists were satisfied that the 
database was sufficient to achieve and reach valid conclusions on 
the subject of MMT.  As with all scientific issues, gaps exist in 
our knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department is also aware of other studies being planned or 
already in progress which might provide new information on this 
subject.  We are aware of the studies and of the learned 
scientists the member referred to in his opening remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure the member and all those watching this interesting 
debate that Health Canada will continue to examine all available 
studies as an ongoing effort to reassess the 1994 risk 
assessment.  We believe that is appropriate.  I assure the House 
that any health developments will be reflected in the 
government's policy toward fuel additives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said at the beginning of my remarks, the health and safety 
of Canadians are always a priority with Health Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
March 2, I put a question in the House to the Minister of Human 
Resources Development on employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pointed out to him that his government had given 
responsibility for the programs to the province, but without 
attaching conditions when it transferred the money, which 
resulted in a great muddle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on the response my colleague from Acadie—Bathurst was 
given earlier, it is clear that the government understands 
nothing at all. 
They might understand something if they came to New Brunswick to 
see the situation, but we know the minister is afraid of coming. 
We might ask why he is afraid.  He says there are only 2,000 
gappers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we ought to define the word “gapper”.  Gappers are 
people whose EI benefits are cut before they start working 
again.  The unfortunate part is that, when the minister called 
his officials today, they forgot to tell him what a gapper was. 
I am explaining it to him, and I hope his parliamentary 
secretary will pass on the definition of gapper, because we have 
a serious problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said there are 2,000 gappers in the province.  I know that in 
the Moncton and Beauséjour—Petitcodiac ridings there are 12,000, 
or 11,954 to be exact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I got these figures from department officials. 
These are not statistics, they are active files.  They do not 
include maternity leave or sick leave.  They are applications 
for benefits, active applications from people who will run out 
of benefits before their job starts.  It is not hard to 
understand.  There are not just 2,000 in New Brunswick.  The 
minister has to come and see.  We know he is afraid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, I presented two petitions.  There were 2,700 names of 
people from my riding, people who are concerned about cuts to 
employment insurance, people from rural regions that have been 
included in urban areas.  Still the minister refuses to make 
changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the department, they talk about investment in the regions. 
They neglected to say how much they had taken out of our regions 
following the cuts to the employment insurance program.  New 
Brunswick loses $275 million a year. 
My riding is out $35.8 million a year, and they would have us 
believe no one is going hungry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two weeks ago, I visited a number of food banks.  Demand was up 
sharply in seven out of eight.  And what was the major reason 
for this increase?  EI cuts.  So, when the minister says there 
are 2,000 gappers, the other 10,000, or 15,000, or 16,000, or 
20,000 are getting their meals from food banks.

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also learned from my visits that, when people turn to the 
welfare department of Camille Thériault's government for 
financial assistance, they are given a chit for the food bank. 
It is truly disgraceful that a provincial government treats 
people this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is taking these people's last penny away, 
then the provincial government does the same thing.  Both are 
Liberal governments; one would sometimes think they were in 
cahoots.  Camille says not to worry, that these people should be 
sent his way because food bank workers are very generous 
nowadays. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must congratulate the volunteers and all the families that 
give food to food banks because, without their support, many 
people would suffer from hunger, since neither the province nor 
the federal government is looking after them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says that many women are covered. The fact is 
they contribute, but they do not qualify for benefits. I am not 
making that up, I can see what is going on. Women hold part time 
jobs. Therefore, how can they work the 910 hours required? The 
minister must come to see the reality in New Brunswick, because 
he will never understand what is going on until he comes and 
sees it for himself.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Government of Canada is sensitive to the needs of seasonal 
workers.  Their needs are one of the reasons we changed the 
employment insurance system to an hours based system in the first 
place.  Today seasonal workers can benefit from having all their 
long hours of work count under employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason we implemented reforms to the EI act was to 
reduce dependency on EI as a regular income support program and 
instead give people the tools they need to get back to work. That 
is why we invested $2.1 billion in active employment measures to 
help people find jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that the labour market development agreement with New 
Brunswick has been signed, we are providing that province with 
almost $240 million over three years to help people get back to 
work.  The province is now responsible for the delivery of these 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year the Department of Human Resources Development made 
available up to $5 million in transitional assistance to the New 
Brunswick government to help workers affected by the gap, the 
so-called gappers of whom the member speaks. In addition, the 
Government of New Brunswick has announced its own $5 million 
seasonal workers adjustment initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 about 7,500 seasonal workers were affected by the gap. 
Since then this number has been on the decline.  Based on the 
number of participants in the program last year, it is estimated 
that about 2,000 people were affected by the gap in New 
Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can understand why the member opposite is disputing this 
figure because according to her definition a gapper is a person 
who does not get EI before his or her job starts.  I assure the 
House that no Canadian gets EI before his or her job starts. 
They get EI when their job ends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our general strategy seems to be working because over 35,000 New 
Brunswickers have been added to the labour force since October 
1993.  We feel this is a fact to be celebrated. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The motion to adjourn the 
House is now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 7.13 p.m.)
