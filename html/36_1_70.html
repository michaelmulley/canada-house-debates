</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe you would find unanimous 
consent for the following that I would now put to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know we are immediately dealing with the motion of the member 
for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough and I understand that after the 
Hon. Leader of the Opposition has spoken and one representative 
from the Bloc Quebecois that the following order would take 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I move: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>1.  That the business taken up this day under government orders 
be consideration of the budget; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>2.  That immediately after the aforementioned business, all 
questions necessary for the disposal of the motion of the member 
for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough for a reference to the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs shall be put without 
further debate or amendment; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>3.  Immediately thereafter there shall be no proceedings pursuant 
to standing order 38, but a motion to adjourn shall be deemed to 
have been proposed and shall be debated no more than three hours, 
during which time members may speak on economic affairs for no 
more than ten minutes each, provided that no quorum calls, 
dilatory motions or requests for consent to propose any other 
motion may be received, provided that at the end of three hours 
or when no member rises to speak, whichever is earlier, the 
motion shall be deemed to have been adopted. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes from two hours to three hours is a small amendment 
to the draft I circulated to colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to further elaborate, this would mean that the vote on the 
motion proposed by the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, would be taken at 6.30 p.m. this 
evening, prior to the adjournment debate, that I mentioned would 
actually take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe you would find consent for that, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Does the hon. minister have permission to put 
the motion?

have the honour to present a petition signed by a number of 
Canadians, including in my own riding of Mississauga South. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that police officers and firefighters are required to place their 
lives at risk on a daily basis and that when one of them loses 
their life in the line of duty, employment benefits do not often 
provide sufficient compensation to their families and also that 
the public mourn that loss of police officers and firefighters 
killed in the line of duty and wish to support in a tangible way 
the surviving families in their time of need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners, therefore, call upon Parliament to establish a 
public safety officers compensation fund for the benefit of 
families of public safety officers who are killed in the line of 
duty.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Question 
No. 60 will be answered today. 
.[Text] 
<Question No. 60—<B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the sale of Dunhill cigarettes been prohibited under section 
27 of the Tobacco Act and if not, why? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> 
Section 27 of the Tobacco Act prohibits the furnishing or 
promotion of a tobacco product if any of its brand elements is 
displayed on a non-tobacco product that is youth or lifestyle 
oriented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. has been advised by Health Canada 
that the link between Alfred Dunhill non-tobacco products and 
Dunhill cigarettes is under review.  The department has also 
informed the company that it may continue to distribute Dunhill 
tobacco products during this review.  This approach follows the 
tobacco compliance policy which is consistent with compliance 
policies for other acts that are the responsibility of the 
Minister of Health. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

<A NAME="LINK22">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from March 9 consideration of the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to speak against the motion before the House, 
against the very idea that an MP should be censured in any way 
for proposing that the Speaker resign, and against the spirit of 
partisan pettiness that would even inspire such a motion as the 
one before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am at it, I also rise to speak against any ruling that 
would curtail the use of the Canadian flag or the singing of O 
Canada in this House and against the spirit of timidity and 
fearfulness that would even contemplate such a ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put it more positively, I rise to speak in favour of freedom 
of expression as guaranteed by section 2(b) of the Canadian 
charter which includes freedom to fly the Canadian flag, freedom 
to sing the Canadian national anthem and freedom of speech for 
members of Parliament inside and outside this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me briefly recount the series of incidents that brought us 
to the point of this ridiculous motion.  A member of the Bloc 
Quebecois, a party dedicated to the break-up of Canada, travelled 
to the Olympic Games in Japan at Canadian taxpayers' expense. 
While there she publicly complained that there were too many 
Canadian flags on display. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Presumably, had these games been held in a separated Quebec, 
there would have been flag police to prevent such an exaggerated 
expression of patriotism, but fortunately these games wherein 
flag police exist are neither in Japan nor Canada.  In any event, 
the member returned to this House of Commons and, exercising her 
right to freedom of expression as guaranteed by the Constitution 
of Canada, which the Bloc does not recognize, she rose to ask a 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member had been rising in the French National 
Assembly after insulting the French flag on foreign soil, she 
would have been booed and hissed out of the chamber. But this is 
Canada, the land of extreme moderation, the land of extreme 
tolerance, the land where we are all irrevocably, irredeemably 
nice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the member is greeted not with boos and hisses but by a 
positive greeting from MPs waving Canadian flags and singing the 
national anthem, on key and in both official languages, so as not 
to be accused of being either musically or politically incorrect.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member and her Bloc colleagues should have taken it all in 
stride, perhaps laughing it off and moving on.  But no.  Besides 
being devoid of any sense of Canadian patriotism or Canadian 
nationalism, the separatists, like the socialists, are also 
devoid of a sense of humour.  Instead of tolerating, even 
celebrating, such an expression of freedom of expression, the 
Bloc House leader demanded that the Speaker of the House rule 
against the displaying of Canadian flags on the desks of Canadian 
members of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally the vast majority of members of the House were enraged 
at even the prospect of such a ruling.  They find the very idea 
that a House, which imposes no limits on the Bloc's freedom to 
advocate the destruction of the country, would impose a limit on 
the freedom of Canadian federalists to express their commitment 
to Canada by flying the flag and singing the anthem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Elk Island, as all members know, is one of 
the most affable and friendly members of the House.  There is not 
a mean bone in his body.  He is a nice man, in the best sense of 
the word nice.  The member for Elk Island is also a Canadian 
patriot.  He expressed the view, as members are free to do, that 
any Speaker who ruled to curtail the singing of O Canada or the 
displaying of the flag in the Canadian House of Commons could 
very well find himself unsupported by a majority of the members 
of the House, of whom he is the servant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc House leader, whose very party represents a threat to 
the integrity of Canada, professes to see in these remarks a 
threat to the integrity of the House.  Who would believe that 
someone who cares nothing about threatening the integrity of a 
country really cares at all about threats, real or imagined, to 
the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, to top it off, the House leader of the fifth party, the 
ragtag remnant of the once great Progressive Conservative Party, 
the same party that voted with the Bloc against application of 
the rule of law to the issue of secession, moved not a motion in 
support of freedom of expression in the House, not a motion in 
support of singing the national anthem, not a motion in support 
of the flag, but a motion that would send the words of other more 
patriotic and forthright members to a committee for censure or 
discipline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have asked before, and we ask it again because it is 
relevant, why it is that some members of the House are 
embarrassed and offended for the wrong reasons.  Why are some 
members embarrassed or offended about things over which there 
should be no embarrassment and not embarrassed or offended by 
things which should cause them to blush?  In other words, why 
does the House blush when it ought not to blush and fail to blush 
when it should? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last parliament the government was embarrassed about the 
pressure put on the Speaker with respect to his ruling on the 
official opposition status of the Bloc, yet it was not 
embarrassed about having a separatist party as the official 
opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members were embarrassed when Reform Party members 
wore buttons in the House regarding MP pensions but were not 
embarrassed about the exorbitant pension they gave themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were offended when the Reform Party questioned the 
appointment of His Excellency the Governor General but were not 
offended by the patronage appointments made by their government 
every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are embarrassed when the Reform Party questions the 
legitimacy of the Senate, but they are not embarrassed when they 
continue to appoint unelected, unaccountable senators who are 
capable of voting down any decision of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker does not feel that we should be offended when the 
government continues to mock parliament by implementing 
legislation before that legislation is passed by the House.  Yet 
he is embarrassed to recognize members with a Canadian flag on 
their desks because it might offend the separatists in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not expected to be concerned over the erosion of our 
influence in the supply process.  We are not supposed to be 
offended when the House becomes a rubber stamp to an unelected 
Senate.  Backbench members should just get over the degradation 
of the treatment given their private members' bills.  Yet the 
Speaker is deeply troubled when the House engages in a brief and 
orderly demonstration in defence of the Canadian flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are again today considering whether we should be 
embarrassed about certain members of the House voicing a strong 
opinion in support of displaying the Canadian flag in the 
Canadian Parliament.  Yet in the last parliament the majority of 
Liberal members was not embarrassed by a letter written by a Bloc 
member to encourage military personnel to join an independent 
Quebec military.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask why it is that the House blushes when it ought not to 
blush and fails to blush when it should.  What are we to think of 
all this?  More important, what are Canadians to think of all 
this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell the House what Canadians think.  They think it is 
high time we stopped being so confoundedly nice, that we not take 
our instructions on when and where to display the Canadian flag 
or sing the national anthem from separatists dedicated to 
breaking up the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians think it is time the Speaker and the traditional 
parties stop falling over backward to accommodate separatists who 
want to break up our country and show some patriotic backbone. 
They think it is time, in the words of the national anthem which 
we sing so glibly after an enormous amount of pressure from this 
party to even get it sung in the House, “to stand on guard”: to 
stand on guard for freedom of expression, not to bend over 
backward for its violation; to stand on guard for the freedom to 
fly the flag; to stand on guard for the freedom to sing the 
national anthem; to stand on guard for these freedoms everywhere 
in the country including Quebec; and especially to stand on guard 
for those freedoms in the Canadian House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore advise that this motion be defeated; that the 
Speaker's ruling affirm, not restrict the freedoms of expression 
that I have mentioned; and that we then get on with the business 
of making the country so strong, so united, so prosperous and so 
great that no one in his or her right mind, including the hon. 
member, would want to leave.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>STANDING COMMITTEE ON PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
</H4><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK29">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to 
stand here today as a northerner, as a Canadian and as a member 
of the government to speak to what I consider to be a truly 
balanced budget.  After a week— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We are on the question of privilege by the 
hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  Is that what 
you are on? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have notes on 
both.  As a member of the House I do not 
believe I have risen on a question of privilege in almost 10 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it quite disturbing when I think that Canadians are 
watching us as members of Parliament.  We all have a certain 
responsibility to uphold the decorum that my colleagues spoke 
about. When they came to the House of Commons they said they 
would change decorum in the House because we who preceded them 
were apparently quite objectionable in our behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what I see being demonstrated here is something that is 
adding fuel to the fire.  It is adding to a sense of intolerance. 
I am quite disturbed by the fact that a sensitive area is drawing 
me into this discussion.  Members opposite seem to have the— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The understanding I had of the deal that was 
made was that we were going to hear from the Leader of the 
Opposition and one other speaker.  Now I am faced with a dilemma. 
If the deal has been made then we will go with the deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know all the understandings in the House.  Would you 
please sort this out among yourselves for a couple of minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I think it has gone beyond sorting it out among 
ourselves.  The House has passed a motion that the Leader of the 
Opposition and a member from the Bloc would be speaking next.  We 
would then revert to Government Orders which is the budget 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is not really the opinion of me or you or anybody 
else in the House.  A motion has been passed and we should now be 
listening to the Bloc member speak to the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree with what the whip 
of the Reform Party said.  I regret any error that has been made 
on this side.  As was agreed, we will listen to the Bloc and then 
revert to the budget debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  That is the understanding.  We have heard 
from the Leader of the Opposition and now we will hear from the 
member for Berthier—Montcalm. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier—Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to speak following the leader of the Reform Party. 
After hearing what I have to say, I think Reformers will regret 
having fought to allow me to speak because there were things 
mentioned in the Reform leader's speech that need to be 
clarified. Having done that, I will very specifically address the 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole argument put forward by the leader of the Reform Party 
on how parliamentarians should behave in this place rests on his 
statement that the House ought not to blush over the incident 
that took place on February 26, when the Canadian flag was waved 
about and the national anthem was sung in this House. There are 
rules I will remind him of in a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps I should start by saying that, if there is one man in 
this House who ought to blush at his own behaviour, it is 
certainly the leader of the Reform Party, with the political 
flip-flops he has being doing since becoming the Leader of the 
Opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We remember the limousine incident in 1993. In front of the 
media, he gave the keys back. But what did he do the very next 
day? He got his party to buy him the limousine, with money raised 
by his party, which is funded to the tune of 75% by the federal 
government. He also had his suits paid for by his party.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently, he described Stornoway as a bingo hall, and now he is 
living there and renovating it to the tune of thousands of 
dollars.  If there is anyone in the House who should be 
embarrassed today, it is the leader of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this topic, I have one last point.  He mentioned pensions, and 
said that Bloc Quebecois members had revolted in the House 
because Reform members wore buttons protesting fat government 
pensions.  I look forward to hearing what Reform members have to 
say in the upcoming re-examination of the pension system, and to 
seeing how many of them change their minds and want to opt back 
into the federal MPs' pension system. 
I look forward to seeing if these political flip-flops will 
embarrass Reform Party members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the matter raised by a member of the Progressive Conservative 
Party regarding the events that occurred in the House on February 
26, 1998 is much more serious.  I think that the House can 
tolerate politics of all sorts.  I think that we can have 
opposing views on the future of the country, budgets, ways of 
approaching things, or whatever, but I think that all 
parliamentarians have one thing in common and that is our 
democratic system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> And I urge the Reform members to listen. 
Perhaps— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
the members paid attention, they might commit fewer blunders in 
this House.  I would like them to pay attention because, if 
there is one thing that all parliamentarians have in common—be 
they Reform, Conservative, Bloc Quebecois or NDP members—it is the 
democratic system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw this in Quebec, when this vital element, democracy, was 
raised in connection with the reference to the Supreme Court. 
There was a huge consensus in Quebec on that democratic right. 
They criticize, they protest, but nevertheless there is a link 
between what is going on in the Supreme Court with respect to 
democracy and what happened here on February 26, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What were the hon. members trying to accomplish with their 
actions that day?  They were trying to intimidate an MP who had 
been democratically elected by the people in her riding.  Some 
Reform MPs even mocked us, saying we looked like deer caught in 
the headlights. They figured they had pulled a good stunt. 
But what they had done was something extremely significant, an 
antidemocratic act.  They wanted to intimidate and frighten an 
MP, make her sit down, prevent her from asking the minister a 
question, and prevent the minister from answering her question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more, when you stood up, Mr. Speaker, they started to 
sing the Canadian national anthem in order to prevent you from 
speaking.  Two separate acts of collusion between Liberal and 
Reform members to prevent the Canadian democratic system from 
operating properly.  That is extremely important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we see them acting outraged by what is going on in this 
House, yet they are the ones responsible for it.  It is not the 
Bloc's fault if we have lost two days in discussion.  It is the 
fault of Liberal and Reform members, as the Jacob affair was as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must talk about the Jacob case.  I expended a great deal of 
energy and time, both in committee and in this House, 
participating in debates and examining the legislation and 
precedents applicable to the situation, because once again an 
important principle was involved.  Reform and Liberal members 
wanted to put the brakes on a Bloc Quebecois member, to stop him 
from doing his work, from acting democratically and fulfilling 
the democratic mandate he had been given.  There is a common 
denominator in all of this. It is always the same.  The hon. 
members today— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> It is hard to hear the truth so early in 
the morning.  Yet— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Yes, there you are.  They are speaking of 
sedition, of high treason.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, what did the hon. member for Charlesbourg, Mr. Jacob—we 
can name him since he is no longer a member of this House—say? 
He simply said that, following a victory by the yes side, and 
after holding negotiations, members of the Canadian forces who 
are from Quebec would be allowed to join the Quebec army should 
they wish to do so. Because a sovereign Quebec would have an 
army. It might not be like the Canadian army with big tanks, 
state-of-the-art helicopters and nuclear submarines like those it 
wants to buy, but Quebec would have its own army. Reform members 
felt this was high treason, sedition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Jacob was exonerated in that case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> After weeks of proceedings, of hearings, 
of listening to experts. It cost hundreds of thousands of dollars 
to find out that Mr. Jacob had the right to say what he said. 
He was totally exonerated from the false accusations made by 
Reformers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, these same Reformers are outraged by what is going on in 
this House. What are they saying? What did they say? What did 
some Liberal members tell the media? They directly challenged the 
decision-making authority of the Speaker of the House of Commons. 
This is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers would greatly benefit from reading <I>Beauchesne's</I> sixth 
edition. Let me read article 167, on pages 48: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker as Presiding Officer of the House of Commons 
</I></B></P><P align=left>167. The essential ingredient of the speakership is found in the 
status of the Speaker as a servant of the House. 
The Presiding Officer, while but a servant of the House, is 
entitled on all occasions to be treated with the greatest 
attention and respect by the individual Members because the 
office embodies the power, dignity, and honour of the House 
itself. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members made statements to the media; no one denies this. 
Yesterday, I was here during the debate and those who had been 
accused of making such comments to the media rose one after the 
other to repeat and expand on what they had said. They went even 
further. Look at their desks. Reformers still have Canadian flags 
on their desks. I understand Liberal members were given the word 
last night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B> Yes, you bet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Reformers never cease to amaze me, Mr. 
Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals understood overnight.  They slept on it.  They put 
away the Canadian flags.  However, the Reform Party, just to 
provoke the House a bit more and contrary to your ruling, 
because you did make a ruling—.  Until you rule on the merits, we 
agreed that no members would have a Canadian flag on their desks 
or, at least, that you would not recognize them.  However, 
yesterday, some members with Canadian flags on their desks rose 
in their places and spoke without a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you can see, Mr. Speaker, in addition to failing to recognize 
what you represent, they are continuing their provocation today. 
More importantly, Mr. Speaker, paragraph 168 on page 49 of the 
sixth edition of <I>Beauchesne's</I> provides, and I invite the 
Reformers to listen attentively: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>168. —No member may rise when the Speaker is standing. 
Reflections upon the character or actions of the Speaker may be 
punished as breaches of privilege. 
The actions of the Speaker cannot be criticized incidentally in 
debate or upon any form of proceeding except by way of a 
substantive motion. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are rules in this House.  We do not always agree with 
rulings, but we do honour the rules of this House.  We have 
always obeyed them, and I do not think anyone in this House can 
accuse the members of the Bloc Quebecois of not doing responsible 
work, of not obeying the rules in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is like in the courts.  It is like two lawyers arguing a case. 
Good arguments are used.  We present arguments to express our 
point of view. 
I think the Liberals do so too.  As do the Conservatives.

</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is one party that has not done so since 1993, for all 
kinds of reasons: the Reform Party.  Today, they are scandalized 
because we want to apply the rules governing how this House 
operates.  I think there is something abnormal in all of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We introduced an amendment to the main motion, stating that the 
matter must be dealt with as promptly as possible.  When I began 
to speak this morning, I said that this was an extremely 
important question. I think it is the most important matter you 
will have to decide on since becoming the Chair of the 36th 
Parliament. It is a matter directly related to your powers. 
Your ruling will set a precedent for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Precedents are often cited in this House in support of a 
position.  I would not like to have to cite you in the future as 
ruling in support of the right to do just about anything here. 
I do not believe that is the objective.  I do not think I need 
argue any further about proper procedure in this House.  I think 
that the rulings you have brought down have been fair and have 
always advanced the cause of parliamentarism.  Naturally, your 
vision of Canada and mine cannot be the same, but you have 
nevertheless brought down rulings based on the Standing Orders of 
this House, and they have never been disputed.  We have taken 
note of your decisions and I hope that this House will do the 
same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> There they go again, the people who want 
to be Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II's opposition.  They wanted 
to be the official opposition and they have been patting 
themselves on the back since June 1997, but they are not even 
capable of respecting the most basic rule of order in the House, 
which is to listen when a member is speaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Luckily we have a Speaker who ensures 
that order is observed in the House and that each member's right 
to speak is respected.  I was very upset and hurt on February 26, 
1998 when all members waved Canada's flag around like 
five-year-olds during a royal visit and sang the national anthem in 
the House.  I think the Canadian flag was used for propaganda 
purposes.  I think the flag and the national anthem were used to 
provoke and I find that unacceptable in our democratic system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether members are federalists, or sovereigntists like the Bloc 
Quebecois, I think they must show respect for the flag and the 
national anthem as we have.  We are not saying we like this 
national anthem, but we respect it, as we respect the American 
national anthem.  We respect the Canadian flag, as we respect 
flags of other countries.  I think that is what tolerance is all 
about.  I think that the Reform Party and certain Liberal members 
do not have the word in their daily vocabulary.  I hope that your 
ruling on this matter will provide a bit of enlightenment for 
parliamentarians because, as you know, the 36th Parliament is 
still very young. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the coming weeks and months, some extremely important meetings 
will take place in Quebec. I hope that Reform and Liberal members 
will adopt a slightly different attitude to Quebec, put aside 
their arrogance and vengefulness, and eventually be able to sit 
down with Quebec and work out problems that it would be timely 
and very useful to resolve as quickly as possible for the good 
of Canada and particularly for the good of Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I 
want to congratulate the hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm for 
making such an eloquent speech in support of democracy and 
respect for parliamentary institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I am not mistaken, today, March 10, is the birthday of his 
father, Gilles Bellehumeur from Berthierville, whom we salute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the hon. member if he was listening when the 
Reform Party leader said, and I quote: “It is time we stop 
falling over backwards to accommodate separatists”. 
They would have had to have been nice to us in the first place, 
which is far from obvious. In any case, we never asked these 
people to be nice to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member for Berthier—Montcalm could elaborate 
on the comment made by the leader of the official opposition. 
Did he mean that, from now on, the Reform Party will no longer 
show respect—lack of respect and intolerance being common traits 
of Reformers—in this House the voice of 44 duly and 
democratically elected members from Quebec, who represent a vast 
majority of Quebeckers? Is this what the Reform Party leader 
meant? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this intolerant and, frankly, paternalistic comment mean 
that, in the future, whenever any of the 44 duly elected Bloc 
Quebecois members will rise in this House, Reform Party members 
will neither recognize nor show respect that member? Will 
Reformers see to it that our right to speak is constantly 
interfered with? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this what was implied? If so, is such attitude not 
reminiscent of what used to be called fascism? It is something 
totally unacceptable that could be associated with the Reform 
Party. If we look at some action and comments made in the past, 
including some intolerance shown toward the Chair, we see a 
behaviour reminiscent of a group from the far right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member elaborate on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, in response to the question 
from the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, we need only think 
back to the last election campaign to answer the question as to 
whether Reformers have always been nice, or ever were, to Bloc 
members or to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need only remember that in the last election campaign, at 
least half of the time, they ran their campaign on the back of 
Quebec. Think of the slogans they were chanting during the last 
campaign. To win votes in western Canada, they did it on the 
backs of Quebeckers. They did not want a Quebec leader. They did 
not want the big bad separatists to sit in this House, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They ran at least half of their campaign on the backs of 
Quebeckers. We must bear this in mind, as I answer the hon. 
member's question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for not being nice to separatists any more, I think they 
never were, especially since they formed a coalition with the 
government, in particular on plan B, the hard line plan against 
Quebec, and sided with the Liberals over the reference to the 
supreme court to try to change the rules of the game and scare 
Quebeckers. I think the leader of the Reform Party is an ally of 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, on the whole reference issue, the Reformers are just 
about the Liberals' only allies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, I think the hon. member is justified in wondering 
how far the Reformers' intolerance will go. Where will this all 
stop? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very concerned—it all depends on how you will rule, Mr. 
Speaker, to put an end to this nonsense—that members of the 
Reform Party, along with some government backbenchers, may indeed 
attempt repeatedly in the future to interfere with our freedom of 
speech, interrupt our remarks and prevent the 44 members of the 
Bloc Quebecois, who were democratically elected in their 
respective ridings, from doing their job. I think this is but the 
beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an incident on February 26, but unless a momentous 
ruling is made by the Chair, I think worse may be yet to come, 
with harsher attacks on the Canadian democratic system, hence the 
important role you play in this matter, Mr. Speaker. 
The ruling you will be making is extremely important for the 
future of the Canadian parliamentary system.

listened to the comments of the Bloc member with interest.  He 
said that they respect the Canadian flag, yet they oppose even 
the waving of the flag in this House.  They oppose the waving of 
the Canadian flag in other countries of the world where Canada is 
represented. I find that to be reprehensible. I assume from the 
comments of the member that they want the fleur-de-lis to fly 
instead of the Canadian flag. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since they have so much respect for this country, for its 
institutions and its flag, I will ask the member if he will be 
singing O Canada tomorrow when it is sung in this House. Will he 
be here to sing O Canada tomorrow? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think this indicates very 
clearly that the members of the Reform Party have understood 
absolutely nothing and have no comprehension of the Quebec fact, 
of Quebec's claims or anything at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, on the subject of the flags at Nagano, or abroad, we were 
upset by the arrogance of the Canadian organizers in plastering 
the buildings with flags.  There were too many.  It was arrogant 
and provocative in terms of the other countries that were 
competing at the Olympic Games too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was arrogant and provocative behaviour on February 26 on the 
part of the Liberals and the Reformers, when the member of the 
Bloc Quebecois rose to put her question in this House.  How did 
they interrupt her?  With the Canadian flag.  On top of that, 
how did they interrupt you, Mr. Speaker?  With the national 
anthem.  That was provocation and arrogance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to his wondering whether I will sing O Canada here in 
this House, I tell him no—not because I have no respect for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> It is in fact because we do respect it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> It is because I respect it and because I 
am told I sing off key, but I simply will not do it, because I 
have no feeling for it.  I feel no call when it is sung.  I am 
not drawn by deeper roots; it is Quebec that calls me.  However, 
I do not come because I have no respect for the national anthem. 
I do not come because it is not what I am looking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I have great respect for the Canadian flag.  No member 
of the Bloc Quebecois has behaved disrespectfully toward Canada's 
flag. 
We have never shown disrespect nor said anything against the 
national anthem.  On the contrary, we hold it in respect, and it 
is not the focus of today's debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close on this.  I would add that the national anthem was 
written by a Quebecker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> Perhaps the members of the Reform Party 
did not know that, as they do not know a lot of things.  I will 
close by quoting the remarks our leader made in the House 
yesterday.  I think they summarize the debate very well, and 
perhaps the Reformers should pay attention to what I am going to 
say.  The Bloc leader said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of this House must not make the Speaker feel that, should 
he rule in favour of the separatists and against the flag, he 
would have to resign or be replaced. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also said, Mr. Speaker, that you must not rule in favour of 
the flag over the separatists but rather in favour of compliance 
with the Standing Orders over failure to comply with them.  That 
is the issue, and I dare to hope that your ruling on the matter 
will be enlightened.

</H3><P align=left>
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF MINISTER OF FINANCE 
</H4><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK36">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from March 9 consideration of the motion  that 
this House approves in general the budgetary policy of the 
Government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
have this opportunity to comment on the budget brought down by 
the Minister of Finance on February 24.  The budget sets out the 
federal government's priorities for the coming years. 
Unfortunately, this government's priorities are far from being 
Canadians' priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget does not address the concerns of Canadians.  It says 
nothing about job creation, nothing about our crumbling health 
system, and contains but a few crumbs when it comes to the 
serious problem of poverty and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by looking at job creation.  The Liberals 
were elected in 1993.  During their campaign, they spoke about 
job creation.  Now we hear in the House that it is not the 
government's responsibility to create jobs, but it was a 
different story before they got elected:  “We are going to create 
jobs.  Elect us and we will create jobs”.  Once in office, it was 
no longer their responsibility.  That was what the Liberals said 
in 1993, and now they are saying it is no longer their 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, five years later, 9% of Canadian workers are receiving EI 
benefits, not to mention how many are on welfare. 
Yesterday, it was pointed out that 730,000 people who used to 
qualify for EI had had to turn to welfare.  This is a national 
disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today they rise in their places and tell us how wonderful they 
are.  It is unbelievable, completely unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the government's responsibility to build infrastructures 
that will lead to job creation.  Take the natural gas line in 
New Brunswick.  Why have it go from Nova Scotia, and then turn at 
Moncton and continue on to Saint John and then Boston, instead 
of having it go through New Brunswick, benefiting the whole 
province, connecting it to Bernier in Quebec, and going on to 
make it a national line?  Why not do that?  But no.  They are 
going to have it turn at Moncton and then go through Saint John 
to Boston, so they can sell gas to the Americans.  But Canadians 
are not going to reap the benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose, for example, that not everyone can benefit from the 
arrival of a company in New Brunswick, in terms of the jobs 
created. Residents of northern New Brunswick, where the 
unemployment rate is 19.9%, will not benefit from it. They will 
not benefit from companies coming to our province because it 
costs these companies less to operate their business. Of course 
not. But the government has a responsibility. It is the 
government that gives the green light. “We are not concerned 
about you, even though the unemployment rate stands at 19.9%, 
not to mention the number of people on welfare. We are not 
concerned about you”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be careful about the budget. The government is 
boasting about a zero deficit. Great, but at whose expense has 
this been achieved? It was done at the expense of the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lady phoned me last week. Yesterday, I listened to a Reformer 
who mentioned the case of a lady in his riding and wondered what 
would happen to her because she must pay $800 in taxes. It may be 
that Reformers only get one such call, but I get 50 every day. 
So, a lady phoned me and said “Yvon, what can you do for us? My 
husband and I are on welfare. The wood in our house is rotten all 
the way up to the windows. In the bathroom, we have to be careful 
not to fall through the floor and end up in the basement. The 
kitchen floor is not even covered with linoleum and the fridge is 
empty”.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is more worrisome than someone who cannot pay $800 in income 
tax.  I had a call from another lady who said “Mr. Godin, 
yesterday my husband and I thought about shooting our kids and 
then ourselves, because we can no longer feed them”.  That is 
more of a concern than reaching a zero deficit, far more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot bear to watch our country get into debt, but neither can 
I bear to watch the country pay its debts at the expense of the 
poor.  That is not what the Liberals said while they were 
campaigning.  They talked about job creation, and now today that 
is no longer their responsibility.  They have the responsibility 
to administer the country justly, not to impoverish people still 
further.  That is their responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those hon. members from northern or southern Ontario whom I hear 
telling us that all their constituents are in favour of the 
federal budget, very much in favour of it, let them come down to 
New Brunswick and they will see people who are far less in 
favour of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provincial health minister stated on tv or radio, and in the 
press, that there is absolutely nothing in the budget for health 
in New Brunswick. The provincial education minister was quoted in 
the newspaper and interviewed on television—and we cannot claim he 
was misquoted by the journalists because he was the one 
speaking—as saying there is nothing for education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Brunswick finance minister appeared in print and on 
television stating that there is nothing for New Brunswick. 
Their counterparts in Newfoundland said the same thing, as did 
the premier of PEI. Are they all lying?  These are all Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Brunswick finance minister, Edmond Blanchard, is a 
Liberal.  Russell King is a Liberal.  What have they done?  They 
have put money into health and have tried to defend their actions 
in the area of health.  They were given money and they do not 
know how to manage it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a time when provincial money was spent on health.  The 
provinces were not given the chance to spend it on whatever they 
wanted, to pass it on to their friends, as we have seen in our 
province with Doug Young for the four lane toll highway.  That 
was not the case in the past.  The money went into health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If money was given for education, where did it end up? In 
education.  Not any more.  The government is administering the 
country badly, I can assure you of that, because their own 
Liberal counterparts in the provinces are saying so. 
So was it because they have not read the budget or do not know 
how to read, or because they cannot count or do the math?  They 
are trying to shift blame to others, but who created the system 
that allows this?  The Liberals did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the bottom line is that people are suffering.  I get calls, 
and I know that people from my riding are listening today and 
know what I am talking about when I say that I am getting 50 
calls a day and cannot even get back to everyone.  They are 
destitute but they want to work.  They are courageous people, 
not lazy like a former minister in this House would have us 
believe.  Our people are hard-working.  When a company starts up 
and says it wants to hire 300 people, 2,000 to 3,000 people 
apply.  Then it turns out to be a false alarm because the company 
is not starting up after all. 
We are talking about hard-working people who want to go out and 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And then there is the business with EI. Yesterday, the Minister 
of Human Resources Development turned around and said they were 
not his changes, that the three reforms had begun with the 
Conservatives and the Liberals had followed on.  Two weeks ago, 
he said it was too soon to say what was happening, to know how 
many people were affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the minister to come with me and visit homes in my riding 
where there is nothing on the floor but holes and no food in the 
refrigerator.  I issue an invitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the government boasts about all the money it has set aside 
for education.  Only 7.1% of students attending university will 
benefit from the fund; the remaining 92.9% will get zip. 
And they are so pleased with themselves.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine trying to convince Canadians that this is a good budget. 
When we look at what is happening in hospitals, when we see the 
elderly and the young in the corridors, that is the health system 
the Liberals have given Canadians.  Before the budget, Canadians' 
message was clear:  “We want money to be put into the health 
system.  Nothing is more important than Canadians' health”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals did not listen.  They let Canadians down, paid no 
attention. For the good of this country's inhabitants, I call on 
the Liberals to examine their conscience. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
the member who just spoke has outlined an scenario where the 
government should take a posture where it is responsible for all 
things and the solution to all things.  In my experience in 
corporate life and in government life, for every complex problem 
there is a simple solution, and it is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has suggested that this is a bad budget and that the 
government has forced Canadians into poverty.  Yet the member did 
not concede at any point that Canadians have a role to play as 
well.  The member talked a lot about education.  I would raise 
with him the issue of education.  As he knows, the budget 
contains substantial provisions for assisting Canadians to 
improve their educational background so they can acquire those 
jobs they need so they will not be in poverty.  I would raise 
specifically for him the issue of the level of education with 
regard to youth unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a university graduate under 25 their unemployment rate in 
Canada now is about 6.5%.  For a high school graduate their 
unemployment rate is approximately 15%.  But for a high school 
drop-out their unemployment rate today will be somewhere in the 
range of 23%. The member is from New Brunswick.  He probably 
should know that the drop-out rate in New Brunswick approaches 
30%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That directly relates to the level of unemployment and certainly 
the level of poverty and difficulty that some Canadians have. As 
the member also knows, the jurisdiction with regard to high 
school education is provincial. He should look very carefully at 
what each of the provinces has done to invest in those young 
people to provide for their future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also talks about families and I praise him for 
raising the issue of families.  It is very important.  He knows 
that the budget brought in an important first step, a care giver 
tax credit related to home care for those who prefer care in the 
home for the infirm or the aged.  He knows that there is a 
commitment on behalf of the government to home care and to 
pharmacare and to those kinds of issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He must also recognize that we have just balanced the budget and 
we are now turning a critical corner in which we will be able to 
reinvest.  Those items are there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member philosophically whether he would agree 
that there is an important role for all to play to invest in 
things like early childhood development and the early education 
of children, et cetera, so that some of these problems like 
unemployment, health care and social programs would be alleviated 
in order that all Canadians, regardless of their status in life, 
have a role to play in ensuring that we have Canadians who are 
physically, mentally and socially healthy. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B> Madam Speaker, I would first like to thank my 
colleague for his question.  It gives me an opportunity to 
elaborate on my ideas a bit.  I honestly did not come to Ottawa 
to play games.  I believe in our people.  I think they are 
hard-working people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Supposedly at home some 30% of young people drop out of school. 
But those who go to school and university end up with debts of 
$25,000 or $30,000.  They cannot repay them, and their parents 
are stuck with them.  There is no work, and that has to be taken 
into account.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What does February's budget have to offer?  Perhaps a $3,500 
exemption on a loan, but people who are unemployed will still 
have $22,000 to pay back.  They come out of university and have 
no work.  That is one of the major problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give you an example of what happens at home.  With the 
employment insurance surplus—since there is the $5 million the 
federal government gave—we should be able to resolve the 
problems with employment insurance, but things are done always 
at the last minute.  There is no way to get organized ahead of 
time to give our people a good education.  It is a last-minute 
band-aid approach that is badly organized. 
I said there are things we can do, and we will do them by 
working together.

to work with one another to co-operate and to share a great sense

not be appealing to the dark sides of one another. We should not 
be appealing and speaking to each other's weaknesses.  We should 
do something quite unusual.  We should be helping one another to 
promote the ideals of Canadians.  It is unfortunate that we have 
this kind of blatant arrogance and ignorance that seems to be 
predominating in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately this affects our work.  It affects the kind of 
work that can happen in committees.  It affects the kind of 
relationships we can build to do good things for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe after 10 years I see things a little differently.  My 
primary role is not to self-aggrandize but to try to promote what 
Canadians want us to do.  If I look at the budget I see something 
that is quite relevant to my mandate.  My mandate is for children 
and youth.  What I find in this budget is that we have done what 
no federal government in Canadian history has done. We have 
followed an economic policy and undertaken the kind of specific 
initiatives that are more in tune with the hopes and dreams of 
young Canadians and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of young Canadians and on the issue of young, I had the 
privilege of working with Doug Young, the former minister of 
human resources development.  Mr. Young is a very accomplished 
Canadian.  Mr. Young is the minister who allowed the department 
to double the funding for youth summer employment.  We went under 
minister Doug Young's leadership from $62 million a year to $120 
million because he believed that young people across the country 
should have that privilege.  I have no doubt in my mind that the 
former minister will create many jobs out there in what he does. 
Those were his parting words, I was doing that and now I am going 
out there to try to help people create jobs to help people.  I 
believe that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at youth unemployment.  Unemployment is one of the 
most serious problems facing young Canadians.  We are moving on 
many fronts to help young people to prepare to find and to keep 
jobs.  Last year we introduced our youth employment strategy with 
a budget of $315 million.  To encourage employment for young 
Canadians in this budget we offer an EI premium holiday to 
employers to hire persons between the ages of 18 and 24 in 1999 
and 2000. 
This measure will pick up and expand the existing new hires 
program. It will make it more attractive for employers to hire 
young people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget will also help youth at risk, particularly those who 
have not completed high school and have difficulty finding and 
keeping work.  This is very important.  It is important that we 
make an investment in the education of young people.  It is 
important that we do early intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like many of my colleagues from all sides of the House, I spent 
last week in my constituency and in other parts of Canada.  I 
evaluated what we are doing as a government in terms of policy 
and programs and services and how they affect the lives of 
children, youth and communities that work in early intervention 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I started in Inuvik, Northwest Territories.  I visited a whole 
round of programs and services and ended with town halls where I 
heard people's concerns. There are some difficulties and 
challenges but good things are happening as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Inuvik we visited a child care program and saw infants to 
preschool age children.  They were working with their mothers in 
child development in a setting that was conducive to proper 
nurturing.  We also visited a computer lab.  Students who had had 
difficulties in pursuing education are all gainfully occupied in 
learning new skills, in working together and in getting 
themselves into the system.  It is quite marvellous and we had a 
chance to experience that. We shared with parents and other 
people in the community their concerns about the future of their 
young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we travelled to another isolated community, Fort Simpson. 
We were able to see the benefits of what is happening with 
prenatal nutrition.  There is a lot of talk about child poverty 
and rightfully so.  We all have that commitment and dedication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Fort Simpson, Northwest Territories we saw a centre that is 
working with young people. We talked to people who are 
undertaking a youth service Canada project that speaks to 
community service.  These are young people who have essentially 
failed in the regular system, the institutionalized form of 
education.  These young people went out on the land.  They 
worked, hunted and shared their kill with the community.  They 
did community service. They cut a lot of wood for the elders who 
needed it cut.  These are things that are really hard to 
institutionalize but need to be done.  This is the kind of 
community service young people are undertaking but which is not 
recognized.  We only hear about the bad things about young 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were 12 points in Fort Simpson at which programs and 
services were being undertaken in early childhood development. 
The open door society does wonderful work there.  Government 
cannot go in and save communities.  Communities that organize 
themselves are the ones that are able to do it. We can best 
accomplish what we need to accomplish by empowering them and 
assisting them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we went to Hay River, Northwest Territories.  We met with 
various groups.  We checked some snares with the preschool and 
head start children from the reserve in Hay River.  These young 
people have had many kinds of cultural experiences that are very 
good for their nurturing and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We went to a youth service Canada project. Young people with the 
Metis nation were working in various communities.  One set up an 
elders visitors centre.  Another did the layout for a magazine 
which talked about what young people were doing. Others carried 
on with other projects.  Some of the young people were moving on 
to other experiences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We visited a group of young people in another program.  They 
were on the verge of dropping out but are now getting quite high 
marks because an investment was made and an instructor was hired. 
They are now prepared to reintegrate into their regular high 
school and they are going there with special skills. 
They are able to take life skills.  They are able to have 
discussions about complicated and sensitive issues.  They are 
also able to write their own resumes. These are basic functional 
skills which are needed to get into the workplace. They are all 
things that these young people experienced.

</I></B></P><P align=left>To round out the week I met with a hard working and dedicated 
group of professionals.  They work on the whole issue of fetal 
alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol effects. This is where we need 
to continue to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Previously the Stan Wilbee report was done in a standing 
committee of the House of Commons. We need to revisit some of the 
goals and recommendations in that report.  Perhaps it might be 
advisable that we do a national survey of best practices of what 
is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The group is guided by the leadership of Dr. Geoff Robinson.  He 
is one of the foremost experts on FAS and FAE and works with 
other professionals in B.C.  They do very good work.  This has to 
be promoted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps what is needed is a national committee or working group 
to dedicate itself to some broader issues related to FAS and FAE. 
We also need to work into the national children's agenda and the 
centres of excellence a cornerstone piece of research on FAS and 
FAE. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If people are wondering how fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal 
alcohol effects relate to their particular area of concern, look 
at the young offenders who are filling the juvenile delinquent 
centres.  Many of them suffer from FAS and FAE.  There is a 
direct correlation. It is very relevant to what we are trying to 
do in other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to seriously look at an approach that is going to 
promote the work that is happening on this particular issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To end the week on Sunday, I joined Senator Landon Pearson and a 
young lady by the name of Cherry Kingsley at an international 
conference on the sexual exploitation of children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the tutelage of Senator Landon Pearson and others, Miss 
Cherry Kingsley, who is a young aboriginal person originally from 
Alkali Lake has taken the leadership.  She has taken charge of 
how to change the world into a safer place for her and her 
colleagues and to perhaps find a different path and if not, to at 
least have security for those persons who are affected by all of 
these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was an international conference.  There were people from 
Bolivia, Guatemala and representatives from the UN. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very serious issue which all members should consider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this is to say, yes, there are many challenges we face but I 
also know there is much happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of what I have just said refers to youth at risk.  This is 
a very important issue.  In 1995 more than 160,000 Canadians 
between 22 and 24 years of age had not completed high school. 
They are at risk of repeated unemployment because the workplace 
continues to demand ever higher levels of education and skills 
they do not have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many such programs. We have doubled money for the 
youth at risk program because we have experienced an 85% success 
rate with youth service Canada. Most participants have either 
found permanent employment or have gone back to school full time 
or part time. It is the reintegration of young people who were 
totally socially marginalized because they were not in the 
education loop or any other social milieu that would help them 
advance in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone knows about the Canada millennium scholarships.  There 
has been much talk about that. There are 100,000 students per 
year with scholarships averaging $3,000 a year. 
This will provide relief to graduates who are having trouble 
managing their student debt load. There are other measures which 
will make it easier for students and their families to finance 
higher education.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the budget there is the opportunities strategy which 
equalizes access in another way.  There is increased funding for 
SchoolNet and the community access program.  There is also $205 
million of increased funding to connect Canadians which will help 
young people, especially those in rural communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked about child poverty.  One of the ways we thought we 
could augment our efforts was to invest $850 million in the 
national child tax benefit.  That will happen in July. 
Furthermore we will invest another $425 million in July 1999 and 
another $425 million in July 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These measures will mean cost savings in social assistance.  Our 
big battle is how to reinvest that money with our provincial 
partners in youth programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the whole area of FAS and FAE, fetal alcohol syndrome 
and fetal alcohol effects, is one of special need. Other special 
needs children are falling between the cracks in regular learning 
institutions.  We need to give further consideration to that 
issue.  Perhaps this would be an opportunity for us to integrate 
it into the national children's agenda which is currently being 
undertaken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about the north a bit.  I deal very much 
with child and youth issues and I would like to give some 
consideration to the area I come from. I would like to point out 
how the opportunities in the budget will affect northern 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At page 61 of the budget the government commits to working with 
territorial governments and other partners to develop a modern 
economic development strategy which will recognize the dynamics 
of the north and the need to establish more diversified 
economies. The government recognizes that the economies of 
Canada's territories are undergoing significant change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone knows that in April 1999 we will face the division of 
the territories into the western part and Nunavut. Northern 
governments must embrace diversification by pursuing all forms of 
sustainable development from traditional economic activities such 
as hunting, trapping, arts and crafts, and the development of 
other art forms to the new knowledge based industries and to 
Canada's first diamond industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many know, the Northwest Territories are on the verge of 
becoming a major source of diamonds with the first production 
expected this October.  Northerners are now exploring how to 
maximize northern participation in all aspects of the diamond 
industry. A secondary or a value added industry is very much on 
the minds of many northerners and very much the debate of the day 
in the north.  Throughout the north, diversification, full 
participation and sustainable development are watch words for 
economic strategies which will bring us into the new century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to working with my colleagues in cabinet and my 
colleagues in the north to make this commitment a reality which 
will have a real impact on northerners. Canada has an opportunity 
to map a blueprint for a more secure future for northerners from 
which all of Canada can benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other measures in this budget which northerners will 
find beneficial, such as increases in funding for First Nations 
and Inuit health services.  These are necessary to keep pace with 
population increases.  We have committed to similar increases in 
transfer programs which will be administered by the Department of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must point out that the north has a very young and growing 
population compared with the rest of the country.  These 
increases are absolutely essential in maintaining the progress we 
have made in the health of northern peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of the budget commitments demonstrate a balanced and 
compassionate approach by this government to our young people, to 
health care, to social services and to the economic well-being of 
Canadians from all regions while maintaining the kind of fiscal 
responsibility Canadians expect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could not have done it without Canadians.  Canadians helped 
us carve this path and make the commitments we have made to 
children and youth.  As the Secretary of State for Children and 
Youth, I feel we are on a very good path with our young people. 
We are fixated on early intervention, childhood development and 
parenting skills.  These are the essentials for building healthy 
citizens in our society.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the Northwest Territories, we are undergoing a huge 
change.  As of October we are essentially going to become the 
largest diamond producing centre in the western hemisphere but we 
need the resources and the infrastructure to help businesses take 
advantage of the opportunities there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From our visits across the Northwest Territories, we know that 
the highest form of building on capacity is to empower people. We 
cannot do for people what people can do for themselves. 
Governments are facilitators and catalysts, not doers.  It is the 
people in the community at the grassroots who will make the 
difference for themselves and their sense of self-determination. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I know 
there are others who want to ask questions so I will keep my 
questions very short. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week I had the opportunity to meet with a number of 
aboriginal leaders from central British Columbia.  They pointed 
out two serious concerns that they faced, recognizing the need 
for empowerment and the fact that they feel they can solve so 
many of the challenges facing them on their own, but they do need 
further education and training.  A number of individuals living 
on reserves indicated that they simply are not able to access 
funding for education, particularly at the post-secondary level. 
It is a serious problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, native young people who see part of the answer to be 
through friendship centres are complaining about the dramatic 
lack of funding to support the programs in the friendship 
centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could my hon. friend comment on these two areas where yes, there 
is support today, but I think she would also agree that the 
funding is seriously underfunded in terms of the challenges and 
the needs there?  What hope can she give that changes are in the 
offing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am very 
pleased that my hon. colleague asked this question.  It gives me 
an opportunity to share some information with him that he or some 
of the young people he spoke about may not be aware of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For three years, ending in 1999, we have invested $200 million 
for a labour market training program called the regional 
bilateral agreements which were done under national frameworks. 
All the labour market development programs have gone to the 
provinces or territories except in the case of First Nations, 
Inuit and Metis.  We did framework agreements with them and then 
struck regional bilateral agreements so that money could flow to 
the people from those boards that are designated by those people 
who make those decisions.  An amount of money has been out there 
and it is a lot of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was involved with the negotiations in B.C.  We cannot 
guarantee that every single individual who wants to be served at 
a certain level will be served because we have removed that 
responsibility from ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Post-secondary education is an issue that has, I believe, some 
crossover.  There have been some sponsorships.  In fact, the 
Metis from Ontario took some of this money and did a scholarship 
program with their partners so there was a lot of leveraging 
going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further to that, we have just built what we call the aboriginal 
human resources development strategy.  It will be funded to a 
higher amount, I believe, than the current arrangement.  However, 
as soon as this one ends in 1999 another one kicks in for another 
five years.  It does not quite meet what the royal commission 
wanted which was 10 years but we did not feel we could do that so 
we did it for an additional 5 years.  There will be more money 
there than there was previously.  It will be for training in 
labour market development.  This is not necessarily 
post-secondary education but it does not necessarily exclude that 
either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national association of friendship centres get their core 
funding from heritage, so I cannot speak to that.  Because the 
centres were not under the $200 million, we set aside a separate 
provision of $26 million under which the friendship centres 
benefited.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were the beneficiaries.  I cannot remember their exact 
amount but they are beneficiaries under the $26 million and I am 
not sure how they spend that money but that is entirely within 
their purview on setting their priorities and what they should 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a cry about core funding but that is not something that 
I have the responsibility for or can speak to. 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, in 
1993 when we first came to this Parliament, I remember the 
statement on several occasions that there were somewhere in the 
neighbourhood of one million children in this country living in 
poverty and suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 I heard the same thing.  In 1995, 1996, 1997 and now in 
1998 I still hear the same thing.  Over one million children are 
living in poverty in this land and we need to address that. I 
know that the children aid societies in most of the cities that 
are trying so desperately to take care of so many people are 
struggling in terms of dollars and cents.  We have not seemed to 
have gained anywhere because of the million children figure we 
keep hearing about continues to exist each and every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The education the member was talking about is good to hear and 
the opportunity to expand on that is great.  But right now I am 
referring to young people, young children and families across 
this land who do not know for sure where their next meal is going 
to come from, who do not have proper clothing to wear in some of 
the wicked winter months that come through.  There is genuine 
suffering going on and yet each year nothing seems to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find millions and millions of dollars to give away for free 
flags which is a nice thing to do, nobody would deny that, but 
surely $25 million for flags would have fed a lot of hungry kids. 
There are kids out there who need dental work and they cannot get 
it done.  Nobody can afford it, yet convicts in our 
penitentiaries eat three square meals a day, they are very 
comfortable at night in terms of getting out of the weather. A 
dentist visits the institution and takes care of their teeth. 
They are getting better treatment than our young people out there 
in that million who are starving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget does not do anything to address that, nor any budget 
in the past since I have been here.  I would like to know why. I 
would like the member to answer that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I would like to know why, by the auditor general's 
reports and everything through Indian affairs, for every dollar 
funnelled in at the top here only about 20 cents reaches the 
reserve where it is mostly needed.  In the Stony reserve where I 
have toured around many times, there are people suffering and I 
would like to know why these budgets do not address those very 
basic needs. The education and the at risk programs I understand. 
That is all good.  Nobody denies that.  But what about the very 
basics? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am really 
pleased that my hon. colleague has risen on this issue.  It shows 
his commitment and concern and I would like to just let him know 
that we have had great opportunities in the last little while. 
His representatives at the provincial level as well as federal 
partners in terms of our minister and the Minister of Health are 
working on a national children's agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that we do have a child poverty issue but let 
me tell the member what is the basis of this.  We have to empower 
and engage parents in order to deal with part of the problem. If 
the hon. colleague cared to be so informed we could provide him 
with an overview of some of the most successful programs we have 
that have made a difference in the lives of children.  Those are 
the programs I saw this week when I travelled in my riding and 
they are prevalent, hundreds of them across the country.  He 
should take the opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are community action plans for children's programs and 
prenatal nutrition programs.  There are headstart programs, there 
are First Nation Inuit child care programs.  There are many other 
initiatives.  The community action plan for children's programs, 
the centre of excellence for children and the $850 million that 
we talked about that kicks in in July will give more money to low 
income families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also done a bit of debt relief for those low income 
families as well and we were not going to book until the next 
budget week but we have booked the additional, doubled that $850 
million.  This will accrue in savings on social assistance which 
should be able to be reinvested back to children. 
This is the agreement we have with our provinces.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the auditor general's report, I cannot speak for 
Indian affairs but I can speak for what human resources 
development does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreements that we have struck are based on client to 
service.  We will not prop up the industry of poverty.  We will 
not prop up the industry of employment.  What we are doing is 
giving the money directly to the people who are affected. The 
$200 million I spoke about earlier, that is the way we administer 
it.  There is an element of risk.  We know that but we have a 
strong accountability framework.  We give them money directly so 
they can serve the clients.  It does not go to a middle person or 
an middle organization.  It goes directly into servicing the 
clients we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our youth programs are like that.  We put a very small 
percentage of our money into youth programs which results in 
complaints.  We do not provide core funding.  We believe the 
organizations wanting to engage have the ability to do so and 
have the infrastructure for that.  We give them money that goes 
directly to the young people who are affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Youth Service Canada many of our youth who participate end 
up with a completion bonus fee.  If they finish the program, they 
get some money at the end to take a supportable wage subsidy, 
tuition paydown or another form of credit note for starting a 
small business.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to 
inform you that I will be sharing my time with my colleague, the 
hon. member for Trois-Rivières. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message I would like to share with the citizens of Canada 
and those of Quebec in particular is that the budget tabled by 
the Minister of Finance has left a bitter taste in our mouths as 
it is very generous with other people's money. For years now, the 
federal government has been saving money on the backs of the 
provinces, the disadvantaged and the workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics show that, between 1994 and 1998, federal transfer 
payments to the provinces were cut by 52%. 
While the federal government reduced its own spending by only 
12%, cuts in tax relief and transfer payments to individuals 
amounted to 37%. At the same time, the federal government gave 
itself a 51% share of any new spending to be incurred between now 
and the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After impoverishing people and lessening the power of the 
provinces, putting them in a situation I would describe as 
perilous, the government then tries to pass itself off as a 
saviour and tells people “See, were it not for us in the federal 
government, you would not be getting the help you need right 
now”. The fact of the matter is that, were it not for the federal 
government, we would not be in this situation in the first place, 
a situation the government itself has dragged us into by spending 
wildly left and right in the past few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government, which is primarily responsible for this 
situation, would have individual taxpayers believe it is their 
saviour.

Jean-Robert Sansfaçon gives the following analysis of the 
situation:

</I></B></P><P align=left>In an effort to save about $6 billion a year, Ottawa presumably 
sent a $2.5 billion bill to the provinces. To add insult to 
injury, the Chrétien government cut transfer payments intended to 
cover part of the costs of social assistance.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, there is the classic example of employment 
insurance.   What has the federal government accomplished with 
it?  It has given less money to the unemployed.  In reality, 
there are far fewer unemployed persons eligible for employment 
insurance.  What do people do when they are not eligible for 
employment insurance?  They turn to welfare, which is a 
provincial responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indirectly, through its employment insurance reform, the federal 
government has imposed an additional financial burden on the 
provinces, because people turn to welfare in order to survive. 
As we know, welfare is a provincial responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial expenditures are increased because of the welfare 
burden, yet their transfer payment revenue from Ottawa is cut. 
The provincial governments therefore have more responsibilities, 
but lower revenues to meet them.  Why is this?  Because of 
federal government actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why it has always been said that this country had one 
government too many.  One government—the federal—never stops trying 
to acquire powers, with the result that the powers of the 
provincial governments are increasingly becoming merely 
symbolic. I am certain that the underlying intent of this 
federalist government is to one day end up with a single 
government in this country, the one in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what Quebec has been opposing for years, because it knows 
that such a system would result in Quebeckers being assimilated. 
They would see their culture assimilated, their traditions 
assimilated; their language, their fundamental values and 
everything that makes Quebec different would be drowned out 
under a single government, which would be called the Ottawa 
government, the Canadian government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is sadistic; every time the government, from one budget to 
another, from one election to another, gains a year, or four or 
five years, this is just one more step toward subjugation of the 
provinces to the federal government.  This is the ultimate 
objective of this government, one that never changes, regardless 
of which party is in power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, we have a Liberal government, but the situation would 
be exactly the same if the Conservatives or the Reformers were in 
office. This is because the underlying objective is not to create 
a true partnership with the provinces, as could have been 
developed and implemented since 1867, but to subject the 
provinces to the authority of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another example. I just referred to employment insurance 
and welfare, two areas of provincial jurisdiction the federal 
government has encroached upon. Another example is that great 
initiative announced in the Liberal budget, the millennium 
scholarship fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was said, and it is worth repeating again, this is a spending 
initiative in an area of provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec already has a loans and grants program that is the envy 
of all the students and stakeholders in the other provinces, 
whether at the elementary, secondary, post-secondary or university 
level. These people are unanimous in praising Quebec's loans and 
grants program, which is unique in the sense that the other 
provinces do not offer grants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government, under the pretence of helping less 
fortunate students, decided to spend $2.5 billion in the 
country, with the obvious goal of being able to tell students 
“What the province cannot do for you in education, the federal 
government can, thus helping you continue your education”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are the provinces hard pressed to resolve the educational 
problem?  Because the federal government, since 1993, has cut 
billions of dollars from education and health care.  It has cut 
money to the provinces and now wants to give back some—and I 
mean only some—to individuals, like students, so they will 
realize the situation they would be in were it not for the 
federal government.  That is what is ironic about the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everytime the government has a chance, it deprives the provinces 
of real and potential revenues, which it should be giving back to 
them as transfer payments, and then, it uses that money for other 
purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium scholarships are simply a means for the government 
to raise its visibility and the number of votes for federalism. 
That is all.  The average debt of students in Quebec is $11,000. 
In the other provinces it is $25,000.  The problem is really 
different in Quebec.  There a system of loans and grants already 
in existence.  In the other provinces it is not as well developed 
or sometimes there is none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is calling on the federal government to allow it to 
withdraw from this program and to give it financial compensation 
to enable it to set its own educational priorities, wherever it 
has identified them.  It considers it is better placed to 
identify its own priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children arrive at school in the morning without eating or having

<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I do have a comment and a question for the member.  I would like 
to state on the record that I was delighted that the secretary of 
state who spoke previously raised in the House again the issue of 
fetal alcohol syndrome and fetal alcohol effects.  It is a very 
important issue to Canadians.  It costs us $2.1 billion a year to 
deal with this problem.  I appreciate her raising this in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member who just spoke has raised a number of issues.  I 
would like to focus on the thing that he raised with regard to 
the federal government, as he put it, grasping power for itself. 
The member will know that Canadians look to leadership from the 
federal government on a broad range of issues.  In partnership 
with the provinces on a wide range of areas such as health care, 
post-secondary education and social security, the provinces are 
the front line and administrators and deliverers of those 
services.  That partnership is extremely important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also referred to what he called downloading and 
offloading and that the transfers under the Canada health and 
social transfer have been reduced.  There is no question that 
that is true.  He also should acknowledge that with the federal 
funding of the health care system, post-secondary education and 
the social security system, the provinces were granted taxing 
authority called tax points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the tax points, although the cash transfers may have gone 
down by some $7 billion, the value of the tax revenue to the 
provinces has gone up about $3.5 billion.  The net effect is that 
the burden that the provinces were asked to share in dealing with 
the $42 billion deficit was much, much smaller than the federal 
government in its programs absorbed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces were asked to do a very small share of it.  Indeed 
we have many provinces now which have balanced budgets and which 
have granted tax breaks to their constituents and not 
correspondingly shown that health care and post-secondary is a 
priority for their government.  The member should well know that 
there are two partners in this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question has to do with the direct issue of the millennium 
scholarship fund.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that education is important and one of the 
most significant elements with regard to the success of people 
having a job.  The member will know that university graduates 
have an unemployment rate of only about 6.5%.  He will also know 
that high school drop-outs in Quebec approach almost 40%.  It is 
the highest number in all of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member simply to answer the direct question 
whether or not he feels that students in Quebec should say no to 
the millennium scholarship fund in their best interest? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member opposite 
demonstrated the federal government's inability to understand 
the problems confronting the provinces when he spoke of 
partnership. But what kind of partnership is there in the 
millennium scholarship fund? The federal government plans to 
consult the provinces after the millennium foundation has been 
established. In a partnership, people sit down with their 
partners and discuss the best ways of dealing with problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned as another example the fact that zero deficit has 
already been achieved in some provinces; therefore, the measures 
put forward by the federal government will help all the 
provinces. This is not exactly the case in Quebec and Ontario. 
These are the only two provinces that do not have a balanced 
budget as of yet. Their circumstances being different, it is 
normal that their priorities and the solutions contemplated are 
different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps students in Quebec will not say no to millennium 
scholarships. But when the hon. member describes the suicide 
rate in Quebec as one of the highest, does he think that the 
introduction of these scholarships will result in fewer students 
dropping out and fewer suicides in Quebec? Whether or not there 
are millennium scholarships has nothing to do with the dropout 
rate. We already have a loans and grants program in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cause lies elsewhere. That is why Quebec asked the federal 
government for compensation to help it address problems 
identified in education, problems like children who have nothing 
to eat before leaving for school in the morning or children 
without appropriate supervision who are suicidal or those who 
need psychological treatment that cannot be subsidized because of 
the cuts in transfer payments. That is what partnership is about, 
when one understands what it means. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am very 
pleased to take part in this debate on the budget.  I will direct 
my remarks primarily at the millennium scholarships which, while 
little has been said, are evidence of the federal government's 
wish to change the rules of the game and shift the focus of 
decision making from the provinces to Ottawa in the next century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would enter a new era in Canada, and the millennium 
scholarships are a very good example, where centralization will 
be complete and Canada will behave like a unitary country, where 
provincial governments will increasingly be viewed as regional 
governments, thus flouting the Canadian Constitution, which 
gives the provinces very specific jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a direct attack on the whole issue of Quebec, because we 
are a people, not just a province, although a province is all we 
are considered to be right now. 
The debate is not over, because these issues are fundamental to 
the development of our societies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the millennium scholarships, some context is required. 
The federal government wants to set up a special $2.5 billion 
fund, that would provide for approximately 100,000 scholarships 
averaging $3,000 over a ten-year period beginning, as it happens, 
two years from now.  There are a number of criteria for awarding 
these scholarships, notably merit and mobility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What people need to know is that, as this fund is being 
contemplated, tuition fees in Quebec are approximately $1,700, 
while they are about $3,200, or almost twice that amount, in 
Canada.  In Quebec, student indebtedness stands at an average of 
$11,000, while it is $22,000 in the rest of Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must also be realized that, from 1993 to 2003, according to 
the federal government's budget, transfers to the provinces for 
education will have been reduced by $10 billion, including $3 
billion for Quebec alone. These cuts have already greatly 
increased the debt load of students in Quebec and in Canada and 
of post-secondary institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just this morning I read in the 
paper that the CEGEP of Trois-Rivières is calling for help, 
because it is at the end of its rope. Who is listening? The MNA 
for Trois-Rivières, a Quebec minister, and not the federal 
government, which does not care and keeps making cuts at the 
expense of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are cries for help in my riding because the federal cuts 
have made it impossible to provide the services college students 
used to get. It is almost indecent on the part of the federal 
government to take cover in this fashion, while all the pressure 
is on the Quebec government, considering that federal measures 
contributed to the problems we are now facing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We already have the Canada student loan program, but the federal 
government is adding the millennium scholarship fund, which will 
be based on merit. Quebec is being denied the right to opt out of 
that initiative, contrary to what was agreed in 1964 between the 
Lesage and Pearson governments, when the Canada student loan 
program was established. This right to opt out of the millennium 
scholarship fund is being denied to the people of Quebec. This is 
unacceptable. If the federal government respected the letter and 
the spirit of the Canadian Constitution, it would promptly 
congratulate Quebec on its good management of this provincial 
jurisdiction—the loans, grants and financial assistance sector—and 
automatically give Quebec the amount it expected to spend 
in that province through its millennium fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The underlying philosophy of the two programs is totally 
different. The millennium scholarship fund is based on merit, 
while the Quebec loans and grants program is based on the desire 
of students to pursue their education. Quebec then provides 
support to the students, based on their material and financial 
needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian scholarships, on the other hand, are going to be 
awarded according to merit, a pernicious notion contrary to the 
philosophy of the Quebec government loan and bursary program. So 
we will, obviously, end up with still more federal-provincial 
quarrels, stirred up by the Canadian government's trampling over 
the field of education because it is shaping the Canada of 
tomorrow, which involves all of the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada of tomorrow will have Quebec as a region, no longer a 
provincial government, and this will be the result of a decision 
made here in the Langevin Block with no consultation, 
particularly not with Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of debt, I would like to refer you to the words of 
Martin Roy, student association president at UQTR, the 
Université du Québec campus in my riding of Trois-Rivières.  On 
February 5, when he learned of the federal government's plans 
relating to students in need, he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The needs are increasing every year.  So far in 1997-98, UQTR's 
financial aid office has already handed out close to $400,000 in 
emergency funds to this clientele.  They are increasingly in need 
of financial assistance to meet their basic needs for survival, 
not merit scholarships to finish their studies. At UQTR alone, 
these merit scholarships total close to $1.8 million. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those merit scholarships, moreover, come from the private sector. 
Speaking of the private sector, a kind of near-privatization is 
taking place. This $2.5 billion is being entrusted to a 
foundation to be directed by none other than Yves Landry.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six months ago, on October 22, 1997, in a speech to our Chamber 
of Commerce in Trois-Rivières, Yves Landry, who was not aware, I 
think, of the federal government's plans, said, and I quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—there was an urgent need to leave behind the old-style politicking 
slowly destroying us in Canada and to allow the provinces more 
power.  It is suggested that the federal government give them 
authority in their respective fields of jurisdiction. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand Mr. Landry.  He was either misinformed or 
conned.  Nothing is impossible with these people.  He was either 
misinformed or conned. 
Given Mr. Landry's views, I cannot understand why he agreed to 
serve as president of this foundation, which is completely at 
cross-purposes, because we never asked the federal government to 
look after this kind of scholarship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to read some passages from a 
remarkable and extremely perceptive article by Lysiane Gagnon 
that appeared on February 26.  Mrs. Gagnon is known for views 
that are not normally very favourable to us.  The article is 
entitled “A demagogic and provocative project”, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Future generations will find no better illustration of the reign 
of Jean Chrétien than these millennium scholarships:  the perfect 
example of a superficial and demagogic policy, of window dressing 
that does nothing at all about the real problems and that may 
even create a few new ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These scholarships will swallow up money that should have been 
put towards improving the school system, and they will contribute 
to the further deterioration of relations, if they can possible 
get any worse, between Quebec City and Ottawa. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further on, she says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The decent thing—would have been to substantially increase 
provincial transfer payments, now that Ottawa has put its fiscal 
house in order.  This would not have been a question of 
generosity, but rather repayment of a blatant debt. 
But there was the vanity of Jean Chrétien, who wants his name 
associated with some sort of government handout, not to mention 
the deep-seated need of any government for maximum visibility.  A 
direct gift to taxpayers brings in more votes than turning money 
over to the provinces. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And further on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberal Prime Minister was even remotely sincere in his 
wish to stimulate education, he would have provided assistance to 
schools, through the responsible governments.  But obviously, 
when it comes to votes, it is more productive to distribute 
maple-leaf bearing cheques to post-secondary students—all the 
more so because they, unlike primary school students, have the 
right to vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium scholarships will be grafted, God knows how, onto 
an already existing grant system. 
Either they will based on different criteria, and this will 
thwart provincial policies, or they will be based on the same 
criteria used for existing scholarships, and this will be a 
patent case of duplication of services. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that, I conclude my remarks.  I would like to thank those 
who helped with the pre-budget study in my riding and, on budget 
night, with the study of the finance minister's budget. 
Rapidly, they are:  Michel Dupont, of the FTQ; Michel Angers, of 
the CSN; Yves St-Pierre, of Action-Chômage; Jean-Louis Lavoie, of 
the Mauricie St-Jean-Baptiste society; François Brunette, of the

the member from the Bloc Quebecois commented on a number of 
issues but concentrated substantially on the jurisdictional role 
in education and specifically on where the Canadian millennium 
scholarship foundation fits in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the member was in error on one aspect which I would 
like to lay out for him.  As he knows, now that we have turned 
the corner and balanced the budget, education was an important 
theme.  The Canadian opportunities strategy was the prime theme 
in terms of directing funding toward the education of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will also know that the Canadian millennium 
scholarship fund is the centrepiece of the Canadian opportunities 
strategy.  It is designed to create new opportunities for 
Canadians by expanding access, knowledge and skills for the jobs 
they need and a higher standard of living for Canadians as a 
whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The area with which he dealt and in which I believe he was in 
error was the concept of eligibility for merit.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian millennium scholarship is intended to remove 
barriers for low and middle income Canadians.  It is intended to 
get the post-secondary education or advanced technical training 
they need.  The issues here are directed to low and middle 
incomes and accessibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beginning in the year 2000 the scholarships will be awarded to 
over 100,000 full and part time students each year over 10 years, 
with the initial endowment of $2.5 billion.  This is the single 
largest investment ever made by the federal government in support 
of access to education.  We are speaking conceptually of the 
principle of access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question the provinces are responsible for the 
delivery of the post-secondary system.  When it comes down to who 
was unemployed, youth unemployment and general poverty, it is the 
federal government that cannot stand back and leave it up to the 
provinces to be fully responsible.  The federal government must 
play a role in ensuring Canadians have accessibility to education 
and an opportunity to have jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member is so insistent that the funding is necessary for 
the school system in Quebec, could he explain to the House why 
the Quebec provincial government is spending millions of dollars 
annually on embassies abroad? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. I remind him that, on page 14 of the budget speech, 
reference is clearly made to criteria, and I quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—In particular, the Foundation will have the authority, subject 
to mutually agreed needs, merit and mobility criteria— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, when we say the fund will be based on merit, it is not a 
figment of our imagination. The budget speech clearly alludes to 
needs, merit and mobility criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for mobility, one wonders what it means for Quebeckers. 
It may be a good thing for Canadians, but it is not necessarily 
the case for Quebeckers. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also believe that Canadians should get to know their country 
better. Therefore, recipients of the Canada Millennium 
Scholarships who want to travel to study outside their home town 
or province will be provided help to do so. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe such opportunities are a priority for 
Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I could not do so earlier, I remind the hon. member that 
when the Minister of Human Resources Development says the federal 
government makes an enormous contribution to loans and grants in 
Quebec, he may not realize it but he should know that this 
supposedly enormous federal contribution has been of the order of 
15% to 20% since 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is no big deal, particularly because every time the 
government gets involved in education, health and social 
programs, it directly contravenes the letter and the spirit of 
the Canadian Constitution, which it is supposed to respect. It is 
like the rules of the House of Commons, which are trampled 
whenever it suits certain people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same goes for the Canadian Constitution. When it does not 
suit the needs of this Parliament, of this government, it is 
simply flouted. 
This is probably one of the main reasons why it is in the 
interest of Quebeckers to leave this country and to deal with 
Canada on an equal footing, so that the rules of the game can be 
redefined, that we can be recognized as a people and that our 
province is no longer the laughing stock of this country.

federal budget.  When we took office on October 25, 1993 our 
government was faced with a very difficult decision.  In 1993 our 
government had three choices.  The first was to continue spending 
without any concern for the future as the past Conservative 
government had done.  We could have continued to add to the 
deficit.  This choice would have been irresponsible and our 
country's future would have been at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second choice could have been to make deficit elimination 
our number one goal.  This was the Reform Party's position.  The 
most vulnerable in our society would have been abandoned. 
The young, the elderly, the sick, they would all have been 
abandoned by this approach.  Instead, what choice did our 
government make back in 1993?  We chose the most difficult 
option. Our choice was to reduce the deficit while preserving 
social programs.  This approach required sacrifice from all 
Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are we today, five years later?  We are in this House 
discussing a balanced budget for the first time in 30 years.  It 
is the first time since 1969 and 1970 that there is no deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only are we committed to balancing the budget this year, it 
will be balanced the next year and the next.  It is the first 
time in almost 50 years the budget will be balanced for three 
consecutive times.  I am delighted to be a part of a debate 
highlighting our dramatic and historic balanced budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget of balance addresses the needs and concerns of 
residents of Guelph—Wellington.  Guelph—Wellington asked for a 
zero deficit.  They got it.  Guelph—Wellington asked for tax 
relief.  They got it.  Guelph—Wellington asked for increased 
spending on education and health care and they got it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By dedicating 80% of this budget spending to health care and 
education, the government is addressing the priorities of all 
Canadians.  The first and largest increase was for health care. 
This increase in funding acknowledges the many people in 
Guelph—Wellington who have asked us to make health care a 
priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Minister of Finance announced that assistance for 
advanced research had been increased, he was speaking directly to 
the University of Guelph and Guelph Conestoga College. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this budget the minister increased the funding for the three 
granting councils.  It was an increase of more than $400 million 
over three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who in this House is going to stand up and say no to research 
and development?  I should hope no one. The Liberal government 
recognizes the importance of research and development.  These new 
research and development resources will provide increased support 
for the many students and faculty at the University of Guelph. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a letter to the Minister of Finance, this is what Mordechai 
Rozanski, the president of the University of Guelph, had to say 
about this funding increase: “I am writing to applaud the 
initiatives you announced in today's budget to reinvest public 
funds.  The University of Guelph is a research intensive 
institution with a growing reputation world wide.  We appreciate 
the leadership shown by the federal government in today's budget 
announcement”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 budget provides $1.4 billion in tax relief to 14 
million low and middle income Canadians. This is good news for 
Guelph—Wellington and for Canada.  Beginning July 1, 1998 the 
amount of income that low income residents of my community can 
receive on a tax-free basis will be increased by $500.  This 
means that residents of Guelph—Wellington will be among the 
400,000 Canadians that will be taken off the tax rolls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beginning July 1, 1998, 13 million Canadian taxpayers will no 
longer pay any federal surtax.  This means that 83% of all 
Canadians will pay no surtax whatsoever.  This type of tax relief 
is directed at those whose needs are the greatest.  It is tax 
relief for Guelph—Wellington's working parents with low incomes, 
for students, for the disabled and for our local charities. 
Again, how can anyone fight against it?  How can anyone oppose 
it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has always recognized the importance of 
volunteers.  For this reason the 1998 federal budget announced 
that the tax-free allowance for volunteer firefighters would be 
increased from $500 to $1,000.  Not only that but the tax-free 
allowance has been extended to other emergency service 
volunteers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask this House, why is the government taking such progressive 
action? The answer is simple. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1220"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT28"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT28"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1220

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that volunteers are important.  Volunteers are what make 
many, many communities go round. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government has always recognized the importance of 
self-employed business people.  Starting in 1998, those who are 
self-employed will be allowed to deduct premiums from 
supplementary health care and dental costs against their business 
income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This measure addresses concerns residents of Guelph—Wellington 
had with the inequity that allowed owner-managers to receive tax 
exempt private coverage, but not the self-employed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since being chair of the Liberal economic development caucus a 
year and a half ago, I have been working hard to combat the 
underground economy:  many, many meetings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget ensures that mandatory subcontracting income is 
reported.  This measure has been included to ensure fairness and 
equity in the tax system for all contractors.  There are many 
contractors in Guelph—Wellington who will benefit from this 
measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this budget, the Minister of Finance has made the job of 
the opposition extremely difficult.  How do you criticize a 
balanced budget?  How do you criticize tax relief that assists 
90% of all Canadians?  How do you criticize 80% budget spending 
on health care and education?  The answer is you don't. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition should be congratulating the Minister of Finance 
who took an out of control deficit, balanced it as promised and, 
may I add, one year before the Reform had promised—the Reform 
had promised much, much harsher measures—while protecting our 
social programs.  There is the key.  We are protecting our social 
programs.  That would not have happened under the Reform's 
proposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget stays the course.  Canadians are now seeing the 
results of all the hard work and sacrifices they have made since 
October 1993.  This budget takes a balanced approach that is 
delivering real benefits for the residents of Guelph—Wellington 
and all Canadians together are making a stronger country.  We are 
making a difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope every member in this House is willing to stand up and 
applaud this budget.  It is an important one and it is unique. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for Guelph—Wellington for her speech, but 
I do want to take issue with some of the assertions she made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard her say a minute ago that we should be congratulating 
the finance minister for balancing the budget. Surely the member 
knows it was the Canadian taxpayers who balanced the budget. 
Revenue is 70% higher than when the government took power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a situation now where the government has completely 
reversed its stand from 1993.  I point out in the 1993 election 
campaign we had the Prime Minister, the then Leader of the 
Opposition, saying zero deficits, zero jobs, zero hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What conversion on the road to Damascus did the Prime Minister 
go through?  All of a sudden, it sounds as though the member for 
Guelph—Wellington is somehow suggesting that a balanced budget 
was the government's idea all along.  Quite the contrary.  In 
fact, they spoke against it in the election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out, leading to my question, that the hon. 
member does not intentionally want to lead people to believe that 
somehow they are going to get a tax break under this government. 
I am certain that is not her intention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply want to point out by way of a question that the member 
is mistaken if she believes Canadians are going to be getting tax 
relief under this government's proposals.  I point out that if 
the CPP increases that came into effect January 1 are included, 
if the effective bracket creep that takes place every year is 
included, amounting to just over a billion dollars in tax 
increases that Canadians face, and this is all netted out, we 
find that we in Canada will pay $2 billion more in taxes in 
1998-99, $2.15 billion more in 1999-2000 and $2.8 billion more in 
taxes in 2000-2001.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given those facts, will the member acknowledge that Canadians 
will be facing higher taxes, not lower, because of this 
government's actions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased 
that the hon. member for Medicine Hat started off his debate with 
the fact that there are more revenues coming into Canada.  That 
is the reality.  More Canadians are working now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, and I am glad he pointed this out, when we took office 
the unemployment rate was almost 12%.  Now we are down to 8.6% 
nationally.  It is wonderful that we all recognize that there has 
been an almost 4% decrease, and I thank the member for pointing 
that out.  That does mean that the economy and everything else 
works better.  We do have more money to support our social 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member talked about the finance minister and gave 
him credit, it is true, all Canadians shared in this.  My speech 
did reflect that.  Perhaps the member missed that part of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I also want to say is we do also need to have leadership 
shown at the federal level.  We do need to have somebody 
directing and saying that we are on a course.  Clearly the 
finance minister did.  He has said right from the beginning that 
we will balance the budget, we will have no deficit.  Along with 
that he also made a very clear statement that we must preserve 
our social programs, that we must invest in health care, we must 
invest in education, we must invest in research and development. 
This budget does reflect those very values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ever since the Reform Party came to this House, it has said 
consistently that the bottom line is to reduce taxes at all 
costs. We are Canadian.  Our vision in who we are is the fact 
that we believe in social programs.  We believe that health care 
is important.  We do not believe in a two-tier health care system 
like the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have clearly stood up and said no to the Reform Party's 
agenda.  We will balance the budget.  We will and have reduced 
the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly it is a budget we all should be proud of. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in 
this budget debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me start with what the Prime Minister and the finance 
minister have said.  I quote: “The victory over the deficit is 
due to the hard work and sacrifice of Canadians over the past 
four years.  Therefore, achieving a balanced budget is a win not 
for the government but for Canadians.  This is their victory”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only way to measure the significance of this achievement is 
to look at where we started.  First, when we came to office four 
years ago our deficit stood at $42 billion, the highest in 
Canada's history.  At 6% we had the second highest deficit to GDP 
ratio of any G-7 country.  Second, the federal debt to GDP ratio 
was almost 72% and rising.  Third, the unemployment rate was 
11.4% at the beginning of 1994.  Last, our interest rates were 
above rates in the United States.  That is where we were in 1994. 
That was our dismal starting point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where do we stand today?  Today the deficit is dead, dead for 
1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999 and the year 2000.  This is the first 
time Canada has had a balanced budget in almost 30 years.  What a 
monumental accomplishment.  I believe that all Canadians, and I 
hope that all the opposition parties, will applaud.  Canada has 
the only balanced budget of any G-7 nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not all.  This shall be the first time in almost 50 
years that the Canadian government will have three consecutive 
balanced budgets.  Last year the debt to GDP ratio fell, the 
first meaningful decline in 20 years.  It will fall again even 
more.  By the turn of the century, the debt to GDP ratio is 
projected to fall just over 60%, the biggest percentage decline 
of any G-7 nation again.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about jobs?  More than a million new jobs have been created 
since the government took office in 1993.  Last year alone some 
372,000 jobs were created.  Employment has risen in every region 
of our country during the past 18 months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We admit that the unemployment rate is still high, but it has 
dropped remarkably since 1994 and the downward trend definitely 
is clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about interest rates?  For the first time ever both our 
short and long term interest rates are below those in the United 
States.  That means that a home owner who gets a five year term 
$100,000 mortgage will save more than $3,000 a year on mortgage 
payments compared with three years ago.  It means that a consumer 
who gets a car loan of $18,000 will save $320 a year.  It means a 
saving of some $7,500 on a $25,000 small business loan over 10 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not all.  According to a Statistics Canada report issued 
a couple of weeks ago the economy grew by 3.8% in 1997. Inflation 
is at its lowest level in three decades.  Consumer confidence 
rebounded in 1997.  Business confidence achieved record levels in 
the same year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote what others have said.  From the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I>, a longstanding and acerbic critic of federal budgets, 
Jeffrey Simpson, said: “This week's budget was the best in a 
generation. It got priorities—right.  It helped redefine the 
proper role of government in a modern economy.  It balanced 
revenues and expenditures.  It opted for prudent forecasts”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a major accomplishment.  In a four year period we have 
gone from a $42 billion deficit to zero. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CTV Ottawa bureau chief was poetic when he said Canada was 
the <I>Titanic</I> that missed the iceberg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read quotations from my province of Manitoba. 
The headline in the Winnipeg <I>Free Press</I> read: “In the 
black.  Surpluses rolling in after 28 straight years of deficit 
spending”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is more from the <I>Free Press</I>:  “Door opens to tax 
relief. Measures benefit 90% of taxpayers”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members of the opposition that means tax relief for 
about 14 million Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president of the Canadian Federation of Independent 
Business said: “The biggest thing in there for small business was 
the income tax reduction.  Putting more money into people's hands 
is good for the economy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another headline in the <I>Free Press</I> read: “Students' debt 
pains eased”.  It will ease the crushing student debtloads.  It 
will increase interest relief and make post-secondary education 
more accessible for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed praises for the budget come from a cross-section of 
people across the country.  They come from the Canadian Alliance 
of Student Associations, from the Canadian Youth Foundation, from 
the Association of Universities and Colleges.  I hope that 
opposition members will share the sentiments of those people who 
are truly concerned and interested in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chairman of the Association of Universities and Colleges, 
Paul Davenport, said: “The millennium fund is going to help 
students. So for student assistance, this is the best budget that 
I've ever seen in my 20 years of university life. This is a 
breakthrough budget for universities, a tremendous boost for 
accessibility in Canada. This is going to help our young people 
participate in the knowledge based economy”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do they praise the budget?  Perhaps the best quotation has 
come from a Toronto <I>Star</I> editorial: “This budget tells the 
nation how the Liberals see Canada in the 21st century. Their 
vision rests on the principle that every Canadian should have the 
right to learn”.  With those praises I really cannot understand 
how opposition members can still find things that are not in the 
budget.  If they focus on what is not in the budget they will 
miss the great things that are in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The research granting councils receive an extra $400 million. 
This will certainly prevent our best scientists from leaving the 
country. This is of benefit to our scientists and students and it 
is good news for all Canadians, for the fruits of the labours of 
our researchers will certainly spill over for the benefit of all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another quote in the papers was by the social critics: “The 
finance minister heads in the right direction”.  Perhaps another 
article I will quote from in the <I>Free Press</I> will sum up the 
social vision of the Liberals and the social conscience that we 
can see in this budget, in addition to transferring $1.5 billion 
for health care and social transfer for the years far ahead.  The 
finance minister said there are those who seem to believe there 
is nothing government can do and nothing government should do, 
that we should just unleash the market and let loose the forces 
of change and abandon those whom opportunity has passed by. That 
view is not ours.  A rising economic tide tide does not lift all 
boats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I am very glad to see the Prime Minister and the 
finance minister working on a coherent tangent and vision for the 
country.  I have one last quote from the Winnipeg <I>Free 
Press</I> editorial: “This budget is a milestone in Canadian 
politics.  It is the first time we have had a surplus in almost 
28 years.  It is the first time since 1970 that the federal 
finance minister has been able to talk about long term choices, 
not short term choices.  This is the first time that we are able 
to build a country instead of just holding it together”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, while I 
have been listening to the people opposite congratulate 
themselves and the Minister of Finance, calling this a historic 
budget, there are a few things that are historic.  We have 
historic high taxes.  We have historic high unemployment rates 
for youth.  We have a historic amount of families living on the 
edge of poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the member that the people who are to be congratulated 
here are the people of Canada, the long suffering taxpayers of 
Canada who have balanced this budget.  It was not the Minister of 
Finance or that government, it was the people of Canada.  I just 
want to keep reminding him of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They keep bringing up the fact that we would, as an opposition, 
destroy social programs.  I would like this member to explain to 
me how, by not addressing the debt and the fact that some 30 some 
cents of every dollar that comes to Ottawa goes to service that 
debt, the projections in the Liberal budget for the next two 
years do not reduce that debt by $1.  What is that doing to 
social programs in this country?  If that were reduced could we 
not have more money for social programs?  Could we not make it 
truly a historic budget?  I would like to hear his comments on 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will answer the 
question directly, but first let me state very clearly that the 
member who asked the question was not listening at all. When he 
said that instead of congratulating ourselves we should 
congratulate the people of Canada, did I not begin my speech by 
saying what the Prime Minister and Minister of Finance said, that 
the victory over the deficit is due to the hard work and 
sacrifice of Canadians over the past four years?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To even start a preamble to the question without recognizing 
what I have said in the beginning meant that this member was not 
listening at all.  If he does not listen how can he get the right 
message to his question, whether in fact by reducing the debt we 
would be able to spend more on social programs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an amount of money and we have a need at this time for 
health care and education.  If we put all this money into the 
payment of the debt where will be get the money for health care 
and education?  It is simple arithmetic. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my hon. 
colleague is surprised that no one is listening. That is because 
he is basically repeating what has been said by every other 
Liberal speaker these past few days. It is as if they all had the 
same person writing their speeches in praise of the budget. We 
know full well that the budget did not meet all the expectations 
of Canadians, especially in the area of education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on and on about the great millennium scholarship 
program. But let me quote Professor Trent, a professor of 
political science at the University of Ottawa, who had this to 
say about the Prime Minister's millennium scholarships: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“It amounts to the rape of federalism.  It is also politically 
egocentric, administratively inept and strategically stupid. 
Moreover, it is unnecessary”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what John Trent wrote. Professor Trent is right, because 
everyone knows full well that, with this budget, the government 
is once again trying to encroach some more on the provincial 
jurisdiction over education, especially since Quebec has the most 
sophisticated loans and grants program in Canada. Quebec students 
have the smallest debt load, with an average student debt of 
$11,000, compared to $25,000 in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask my colleague this: Does he not agree that there is 
duplication, that the federal government is once again 
encroaching on the provincial jurisdiction over education? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, to the observation 
that the Liberals are repeating almost the same speech, we cannot 
help it.  The Liberals have the same message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to keep repeating the message if the opposition refuses 
to listen.  We also know that not all expectations have been 
achieved.  The job of this government has not been concluded yet, 
and that is why we have three phases in the plan for our budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first phase has been completed.  We are now in the second 
phase and we will go to the third phase.  If the member will wait 
he will see all the beauty of our budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On his question about the millennium fund, I am glad to say that 
Quebec has a loans program as well for its students.  Does it 
hurt for the students to get extra help from the millennium 
scholarship fund?  Let Mr. Trent tell his message to the students 
and I would like the students to reply. The students will 
criticize Mr. Trent.

Speaker, I will be splitting my time with my colleague from 
Nanaimo—Cowichan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister said in his 
speech that this is a milestone.  I am here to say my 
constituents regard this more as a stone in your shoe than a 
milestone budget.  Millstone is another good word.

first speech on a federal budget.  I am honoured but I have 
serious reservations about the honour reflected in this budget.

about, making choices.  Inevitably there will be people on both 
sides of the debate.  Some will be pleased and many will find 
fault no matter what you do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to sympathize with the government on that point but 
I cannot because what we see in this budget is that it has have 
made no tough choices at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals claim their approach is balanced but I think the 
more accurate term for them would be indecisive or unimaginative. 
What we see here is a major disappointment, a huge flop and a 
missed opportunity that Canadians will continue to pay for, for 
decades.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians made it clear in our prebudget deliberations that the 
tax burden on them and their economy was excessive.  That tax 
burden drags on job creation.  We see that reflected in our 
permanent persistently high unemployment figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only has the finance minister ignored the opportunity to 
create real sustainable jobs, but these policies continue to 
penalize the unemployed.  Thousands find themselves ineligible 
for benefits or have had their benefits cut to minimal levels 
while the finance minister shovels billions of dollars into an EI 
surplus fund.  He announced nickel and dime cuts to premiums late 
last year but continues to operate that EI fund as a cash cow 
rather than the insurance program it was intended to be.  I do 
not find much honour in that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's colleagues will quickly point out that there is 
money in the budget for job creation but experience with 
government shows these programs are at best short term fixes with 
excessive bureaucratic costs that still leave not thousands, not 
tens of thousands, but hundreds of thousands of Canadians outside 
the targeted groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the choice they make when they try to be the magic 
bullet that aims itself at narrow agenda items instead of 
creating broad policies that treat all Canadians equally and 
treat the economy not as a revenue generator for government 
excess but as the public trust that belongs to all its citizens 
and their descendants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen programs across the political spectrum that reflect 
the choices the Liberals have made to be always the party of the 
special interest groups as opposed to being the party of the 
whole Canadian community.  We see them choose to base their 
programs on race, language, gender or regionalism rather than on 
creating equal opportunity for everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A government must create an environment where people are not set 
at each other's throats in a competition for rights and benefits 
that excludes their neighbours.  We on this side of the House 
know there are localized or specific problems that must be 
addressed by directing programs but too often these directions 
are given by the special interest and lobby groups with agendas 
that do not reflect the values held by the majority of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister said that the time has passed when a 
government could be all things to all people.  By having so many 
priorities it in fact has none.  The finance minister was trying 
to paint the budget as a point in the nation's history when we 
would turn from the irresponsible, misdirected, wasteful spending 
of the past and open a new chapter where every tax dollar would 
be spent in such a way that it would always reflect focus and 
balance.  I am not saying these buzzwords are meaningless, but I 
am saying that the actions of the government drain them of any 
real meaning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister rejected the notion that the treasury could 
afford broad based tax relief.  He rejected the advice of many 
finance committee witnesses who said that decisive debt reduction 
was not only prudent but would pay large dividends almost 
immediately for all Canadians and their descendants.  Instead he 
made the choice to be many things to many people.  In the process 
he rejected the values of Canadians by ignoring the polls that 
said people wanted debt reduction and tax relief most of all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister left many important things out of the budget. There 
is no mention of the crisis in agriculture or transportation on 
the prairies, no mention of crisis in the east and west coast 
fisheries, no mention of the tax burden carried by our small 
business owners who are the real job creators in the economy.  He 
says to them that they will have to wait, but can they afford to 
wait for this tax relief? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can afford $600 million for an office of official languages. 
We apparently cannot afford to attack the debt, but we can afford 
to subsidize our own heritage to the tune of $440 million per 
year.  I am not saying that there are not worthy causes in there 
somewhere but these expenditures are never questioned.  Would 
Canadians abandon their own culture or a second language if these 
things were not subsidized?  I think the evidence would point to 
the contrary.  The evidence suggests that the majority of 
Canadians being compassionate and reasonable will do many things 
on their own without being bribed with their own money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the Liberals afraid of?  The budget shows what they are 
afraid of.  They are afraid that if they give Canadians the 
freedom to make their own choices they will choose to support 
common values; they will strengthen their families, contribute to 
their communities and naturally gather into a strong country with 
a shared vision of our future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By failing to make any courageous choices, the government has 
not changed anything from the previous three decades of its 
irresponsible predecessors.  Canadians will continue to finance 
massive programs.  They will continue to spend 30 cents of every 
dollar on nothing more than interest on the national debt.  They 
will continue to hear from Ottawa that bureaucrats know better 
than they do how to run their own lives.  I see nothing 
honourable in that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to take this opportunity to ask the member opposite 
for some clarification of his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about having an exclusionary budget and then he went 
on to talk about regional initiatives.  I see those two things as 
cross purposes.  I would like to hear his response as to the 
lifting of the surtax and the benefit that is to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could he possibly speak against an initiative such as that, 
as well as the contingency fund which when it is not needed will 
go toward paying down the debt?  That is exactly what Canadians 
asked for and this government delivered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for her 
question.  She is also a member of the finance committee so she 
knows what we heard on the road from people talking about debt 
and tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many regional programs that we have seen governments direct are 
always mistargeted.  The cost of bureaucracy is excessively high 
and never create the long term sustainable jobs we would like to 
see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She talks about a reduction in the surtax.  We think that is 
great.  It should apply to everybody.  It is great that they 
started off and targeted a few people, but the complexity that 
they have added into the system with this budget takes a tax 
accountant and a Philadelphia lawyer to figure out the 
idiosyncrasies of this system, which certainly is at cross 
purposes to pandering to the poorest sectors of society that are 
not able to afford an accountant to begin with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, that complexity flies in the face of the target 
they are trying to make.  When they take the huge CPP increases, 
which certainly affect Canada's working poor, and balance them 
off with the nickels and dimes we see tossed their way in the 
budget, the end result over the three year program shows the 
working poor as being worse off than they are now.  I do not see 
that as helping that sector of society. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
during the member's speech he said something that caught my 
attention.  It is quite unfortunate that he used these words, but 
he said that the government was pandering in the budget to 
special interests and was somehow providing special attention 
based on race, language, gender and region rather than equal 
opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what part of the millennium scholarship fund falls 
into the special interest envelope he painted.  I do not know 
what part the tax relief to low and middle income Canadians falls 
into the special interest envelope he painted.  I do not see 
where the caregiver tax credit for those who provide care in the 
home to the elderly and the infirm falls into this special 
interest envelope the member painted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member stated very clearly in the House that the budget 
somehow pandered to special interests, in his words, specifically 
on the basis of race, language, gender or region rather than 
equal opportunity.  I would like the member to stand in his place 
this instant to tell the House one example where race, language, 
gender or region is the basis of the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we covered quite a bit in 
that and I am sure I do not have time to cover it all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that pops to mind for race right off the bat is that a 
short time ago the department of Indian and northern affairs 
announced $350 million to address the abuse suffered by natives 
at the hands of aboriginal schools years ago.  Even the 
aboriginal community was not consulted in that.  I know the chief 
of the grand council is having a terrible time trying to sell it 
to his people.  It is a day late and a dollar short in their 
estimation.  Maybe he should have consulted with them a little 
more than he did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about the millennium scholarship fund.  In 
reality that fund addresses 6% to 7% of students in Canada.  What 
do the other 93% or 94% of students do?  Do they sit and wait? 
This does not kick in until the year 2000.  Students in our 
universities are in a crisis now.  They need some help today, not 
two years down the road.  That is a little too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about the caregiver tax credit of $400.  Fantastic. My 
elderly inlaws are living with us and $400 do not even cover the 
cost of putting in a bathroom rail so they can get in and out of 
the tub.  At an $11,500 income that tax credit disappears.  It 
just does not go far enough. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is with a great deal of pleasure that I take part in my very 
first budget debate since having been elected by the voters in 
Nanaimo—Cowichan this past spring.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might have hoped that it would be under much better 
circumstances.  However, having seen what the finance minister 
has brought down, I can only draw one conclusion.  Canadian 
taxpayers have been robbed of debt and tax relief and the 
Liberals are going on a spending spree once again.  It is a 
shame.  In fact the budget is not just a shame.  It is a sham. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not believe my ears when the finance minister stood in 
the House to declare that in effect the deficit battle had been 
won by his government.  I know they go to great pains to disclaim 
that but that was said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing could have been further from the truth.  It is incumbent 
upon us as opposition members of Parliament to keep pointing out 
that the government was able to hopefully balance that budget 
only on the backs of working men and women.  They are the ones 
who have been paying an extra $33 billion in taxes since the 
Liberal government took office in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the reward for the sacrifices Canadians have made?  What 
are taxpayers getting now that the books are supposedly balanced 
and the government expects to start running surpluses?  One short 
word, nothing.  What they should be getting is broad based 
meaningful tax relief.  They deserve nothing less.  They are 
telling me as their representative when I go back to the riding 
that they are disappointed in the budget because they did not got 
that relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 Canadian taxpayers paid $107 billion in income tax. This 
year we will pay close to $140 billion in taxes to fund the big 
red tax and spend Liberal machine.  The chequebooks are out 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to be in a situation where the government could even 
contemplate a balanced budget, let alone a surplus, program 
spending for 1998-99 came in at about $103.5 billion.  Just as 
taxpayers have eliminated this deficit the government is 
resorting to the same tax and spend policies that got us into 
this mess in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year the Liberals will spend $161 billion.  In fiscal year 
1999-2000 they will spend $167 billion.  Finally, projected 
spending for 2000-01 will be about $173 billion.  Most of the 
money being spent over 1997 levels is money that could go toward 
paying down the debt or providing Canadians with real meaningful 
tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government does not seem to get it.  Canadians are 
being squeezed and they desperately need tax relief.  Is it any 
wonder that come tax time each year more and more of us feel like 
we are taking one step forward and two back? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take, for instance, my son in Calgary who has a wife, a little 
girl and another on the way.  As a construction worker at the low 
end of the wage scale he has had trouble making ends meet even in 
boom town Calgary which knows something about eliminating debts 
and deficits and having the lowest taxes in Canada.  Why? It is 
mostly because the federal government still takes so much out of 
his paycheque that he does not have anything left over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deficit battle is won on the backs of people like my son and 
other Canadian taxpayers who have endured 33 tax increases by the 
government since 1993.  The budget holds hardly any hope for any 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most insidious tax of them all is the bracket creep.  It was 
a present from the Tories and one which the Liberals have enjoyed 
using against Canadians as well.  By keeping the Tory bracket 
creep tax, the Liberals have turned a blind eye to preprogrammed 
tax increases.  Why could they have not done something about 
that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bracket creep, since the Liberals have taken office, has taken 
an accumulative $13.4 billion in new and higher taxes out of our 
pockets.  That is not acceptable.  Indexing for inflation in 1997 
would have prevented an automatic $860 million personal income 
tax increase.  This represents an increase totalling $4.3 billion 
over the next five years.  This tax just keeps on taking and 
taking out of the pockets of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics Canada reports that between 1989 and 1995 real after 
tax family incomes fell by $3,461 from $41,084 to $37,623. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another graphic example of bracket creep. An individual 
taxpayer earning $30,000 a year in 1993 whose income increases 
just at the rate of inflation will end up paying $1,581 more in 
federal income, CPP and EI taxes after he files his return this 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to see that there are social consequences to this budget 
as well.  By not providing tax relief and by failing to pay down 
the debt, the government jeopardizes the social programs that we 
have in this country.  After adjusting for the government's 
liquid assets the net public debt will stand at around $583 
billion by the end of fiscal 1997-98. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This mountain of accumulated federal debt requires interest 
payments.  Interest payments on the Liberal and Tory mortgage 
amount to $46 billion for this fiscal year. Canadian taxpayers 
will pay approximately the same next year to service the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Think in terms of social spending what $46 billion represents. 
It represents the entire annual budget for the four western 
provinces.  It represents the entire annual budgets of Quebec, 
P.E.I. and Newfoundland.  It represents enough to pay for all 
Canadian hospitals, physicians and drug costs for an entire year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to do something about the interest payments on this 
debt. It represents enough to provide every poor child in Canada 
with a $30,000 a year endowment.  Do you see how important this 
is?  As I said at the outset, this budget is both a shame and a 
sham because it fails Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until we pay down the debt, we cannot free up that money which 
is being used to pay interest on the $583 billion debt.  Surely 
the lost opportunity that these interest payments represent 
should be reason enough to commit 50% of any surplus to debt 
reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge my colleagues across the way to think of what this means 
to Canadian taxpayers.  Those of us over here are intent on 
finding out what our constituents feel about this.  I asked for 
people to write to me and let me know how they would spend the 
surplus, if there ever was a surplus in this country. I would 
like to read a letter. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dear Sir: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give you some input from some taxpayers in your 
riding on the issue of what to do with any government surplus (if 
in fact one ever occurs). In short, think deficit reduction.  Yes 
we feel heavily taxed and yes we feel some services have been cut 
a little too far and our take home pay buys less than it used to, 
but the $600 billion national debt is a disgrace and a millstone 
around the necks of all Canadians.  It will be even worse for 
future generations if we don't face reality and deal with this 
debt. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is from Bruce and Deborah Maher in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public debt charges will eat up 33 cents of every revenue dollar 
in the current fiscal year or 69 cents out of every personal 
income tax paid by Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the average Canadian taxpayer will pay about $3,285 a 
year in taxes just to pay interest on the debt.  Large debt 
burdens also force interest rates higher.  This increases the 
cost of mortgages, automobile loans and household items like 
washing machines and refrigerators, and carrying credit card 
balances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Debt reduction frees up a fiscal dividend for reinvestment in 
the Canadian economy.  This can be done in the form of 
strengthened social programs, lower taxes or a combination of 
both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cutting the debt in half would put about $1,600 back into the 
pockets of every average taxpayer in this country. Or the 
government could even give a mix of tax relief.  Anything would 
be better than what we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could provide an 8% reduction in personal income 
taxes, or something it promised a long time ago, the total 
elimination of the GST. The Liberals could finally honour their 
1993 election promise to scrap that hated tax.  This could only 
be done if the Liberals reduced the accumulated federal debt by 
half. Given the most recent offering by the Prime Minister, I do 
not think this is likely to occur at any given time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly this budget does nothing to help ordinary taxpaying 
Canadians.  If anything it impoverishes them further by 
increasing the tax burden.  If that fact is not now readily 
apparent to taxpayers, when we all sit down and start filing our 
income tax in the next month or so, then reality will hit us once 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot support this budget.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to deal with a couple of the errors, or misconceptions 
maybe, that the member has indicated in his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all he left the impression that since the tax revenue 
of the government is going to increase from $107 billion to $140 
billion that somehow, and members opposite use the phrase over 
and over again, this is being done on the backs of Canadians. The 
hon. member is using a little bit of smoke and mirrors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a million more people working in Canada than there 
were in the prior year or since the mandate of this government 
commenced. That means there are more taxpayers working, more 
taxpayers paying their taxes and there is more revenue for the 
government. It is absolutely erroneous to suggest that somehow 
this is a greater tax burden on the individual Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also talks a lot about bracket creep. He had a lot of 
fluff in there about all the editorial commentary. The member 
should probably well know, and I think Canadians should well know 
that this bracket creep issue has to do with the indexation of 
the basic personal amount as an example, which is $6,456 and an 
inflation rate exceeding 3%. Given what the inflation rate was 
for instance last year and taking the federal rate, what we are 
talking about is approximately $12.46 for an ordinary taxpayer in 
terms of the federal coffers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member goes on and on about 33 tax increases since this 
government took its mandate. We are talking about small items. We 
are not talking about the substantive items. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask him a question about tax relief. Tax relief in the 
amount of $7 billion was provided to Canadians in this budget. It 
included items like increasing the provisions under the basic 
personal amount.  It included a number of measures, but it 
accumulated to some $7 billion. That is included in the 
determination of a balanced budget. The member may suggest that 
the tax relief is nominal, but it was $7 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member is going to make the argument, can he stand up and 
explain to the House exactly how or what he is going to change in 
this budget? What item is he going to change specifically to 
provide which tax benefit? I want him to say exactly what tax 
benefit he is going to provide to Canadians.  How much is it 
going to cost?  And is he still going to be able to deliver the 
balanced budget that Canadians have asked for? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the most important person to 
consult in this whole thing is the Canadian taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went back to my riding last week and held town hall meetings 
all across my riding.  I sat down with Canadian taxpayers to whom 
I give a lot of credit and who have the intelligence to look at 
this budget and say whether it is really helping them.  All I can 
say in answer to the member's question is that those people have 
told me that the ordinary average Canadian on the whole feels 
they are not getting enough tax relief out of this budget. For 27 
years they have been paying for these deficit budgets by Liberal 
and Tory governments and they feel it is time that the government 
finally rewarded them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  How much? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  I cannot tell the hon. member how much, 
but I can say that they felt that it would certainly have been a 
whole lot more if this government had been listening to 
Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
just heard the Liberal member comment on the tiny impact of 
bracket creep. Actually it is about over $1 billion a year that 
it takes from taxpayers' pockets. But I point out to my friend 
that the government's tax reduction strategy next year will only 
be $880 million. In other words, bracket creep completely 
eliminates the tax relief the government is so proud of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will my friend from Nanaimo—Cowichan comment on this?  Will he 
also comment on the huge impact that CPP tax increases will have 
on the pocketbooks of average Canadian taxpayers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague has hit 
the nail right on the head. This government is taking money out 
of Canadian taxpayers' pockets, whether it is giving minimal tax 
relief or not.  It is taking money out through things like the 
CPP. 
I suspect this government will find other more innovative ways to 
take more money out of the pockets of Canadian taxpayers through 
user fees.  Things which we used to get basically free from 
government we will now be charged for. The government will find 
other ways to do this so it can continue on its big spending 
spree.

debate and to congratulate the Prime Minister and the Minister of 
Finance for leading us and all Canadians into the era of balanced 
budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To me it is not the applause of economists and accountants that 
makes our first balanced budget so historic.  It is the fact that 
our fiscal progress allows us to begin an equally crucial journey 
and that is to relieve the heavy tax burden which Canadians must 
shoulder. The residents of Waterloo—Wellington are grateful for 
the very steady course which has been taken by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also very proud of the way the budget has launched this 
journey with reasonable prudent steps.  The increase in the basic 
exemption and the elimination of the general surtax for Canadians 
earning under $50,000 a year will benefit 14 million citizens. 
They also ensure that our hard won fiscal progress is not put at 
jeopardy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course we have already heard the squawks and the screeching 
that our tax initiatives should have gone further.  As opposition 
parties it is always easy to advocate broader based tax relief, 
but this government has come too far in the fiscal battle to let 
that type of political grandstanding jeopardize the progress we 
have made to date and for which Canadians have worked so hard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The challenge we must continue to meet and master is clear.  We 
can only begin moving to even larger tax cuts when the attack on 
the fiscal mess left by the previous governments is truly over. 
That means not just continuing to run balanced budgets but also 
ensuring that the debt itself is set on a real downward course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am confident that most Canadians know that wider tax relief 
today would have been paid for in one of two ways:  either by 
pushing us back into a deficit, or by cutting back on our 
investments in vital social programs.  The increased funding we 
are providing to the provinces under the Canada health and social 
transfer as an example, or our funding for the Canadian 
opportunities strategy as another example would have been cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about that funding, especially the Canada millennium 
scholarship fund?  I know it is tempting for critics to look at 
this $2.5 billion endowment and suggest that it might better go 
toward augmenting our $1.6 billion personal revenue tax relief 
for low and middle income people.  However, the fact is that the 
scholarship fund is a one time investment.  Its payouts will be 
spread across the 10 years in which we will be providing the 
scholarships.  The general tax relief announced by the minister 
is much more permanent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the two measures, the increase in the basic 
exemption and the elimination of the surtax, single people 
earning $30,000 a year will see their tax burden reduced by 3%. 
For single people earning $50,000 a year, they will see a 2.4% 
reduction. For families this is an important measure.  Taxes will 
fall by 3.3% at $50,000.  This means that a family with an income 
of $30,000 will receive a 31% reduction in taxes, with its total 
federal income taxes falling to about $300 or 1% of income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the saving to the total number of taxpayers.  The 
combination of the increase in the basic exemption and the 
elimination of the general surtax will deliver $880 million in 
savings in the first year.  As the economy and incomes grow, that 
saving will increase to almost $1.7 billion by the year 2000-01. 
In fact in over just three years the bottom line saving to 
taxpayers will exceed $4 billion.  It will continue to grow year 
after year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the fair and honest comparison which critics should 
make:  our scholarship endowment with its one time $2.5 billion 
cost, equal to $250 million a year; and our tax relief, saving 
consumers $1.7 billion year after year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To me this reflects the fair and balanced strategy which has 
become our hallmark since coming to office.  We are not the party 
which tries to play Canadians off against each other. 
Our philosophy centres on acting where the need is greatest and 
where the government can do the most good.  Surely taxpayers and 
students meet those criteria.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me emphasize, as the minister did in his budget speech, that 
this government's goal continues to be lower taxes and lower 
taxes even further.  That is a pledge that Canadians can trust as 
our track record clearly shows and makes clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Remember, from our first days in office we have understood the 
economy and the social problems that are caused as a result of 
Canada's high taxation levels.  That is why we did not increase 
personal taxes in any of our budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You would probably have to go back a long time to find any 
comparable period when personal tax rates stayed unchanged, much 
less dropped as with this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the start, where we could afford it and where it could do 
the most good, we have implemented targeted tax cuts.  These are 
cuts that this budget also builds on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, it is our government that in 1998 lowered the 
employment insurance premium rate for employees from $2.70 per 
$100 of insurable earnings from the previous $2.90 rate.  For 
workers, this means paying up to $78 less in premiums in 1998 
than in 1997.  For employers, it means paying up to $109 less per 
employee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the 1998 premium rate reduction is the second largest 
drop in EI premiums since the 1970s.  It will reduce premiums 
paid by employers and employees by an estimated $1.4 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was our government that in the 1997 budget proposed a 
two-step enrichment for the current $5.1 billion child tax 
benefit to create a new $6 billion Canada child tax benefit by 
July 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall, more than 1.4 million Canadian families with 2.5 
million children will see an increase in federal child benefit 
payments as of this July. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, it was this government that took concrete actions through 
the tax system to assist Canadians with disabilities.  For 
example, a list of expenses eligible for the medical expense tax 
credit has been significantly broadened and the customs tariff 
amended to provide duty free entry for all goods designed to use 
for persons with disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was this government that acted through the tax system to 
enhance initiatives for charitable giving.  These are already 
before this House in Bill C-28. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once passed, this legislation will reduce the income inclusion 
rate on capital gains arising from charitable donations from 75% 
to 37.5%.  This puts Canadian charities on an equal footing with 
those in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me highlight just a few more tax reduction measures we have 
implemented over the last four years to help Canadians and 
sectors most at risk or in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have eliminated the seven-year limit on unused RRSP room so 
that Canadians who face short term economic problems do not have 
to feel that their retirement saving is in jeopardy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have raised the annual limit on the transfer of the tuition 
fee and education amounts to those who support students from 
$4,000 to $5,000.  We have increased the annual limit on 
contributions to registered education savings plans from $1,500 
to $2,000 and the lifetime limit from $31,500 to $42,000. Through 
Bill C-28, we are increasing the annual limit another $2,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have broadened the eligibility for the child care expense 
deduction to assist parents who undertake education or 
retraining.  We allowed most charitable and public organizations 
to raise funds without collecting and remitting GST on sales.  We 
have provided a 100% GST rebate on books purchased by public 
libraries, educational institutions and other specific bodies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still have no illusions that these measures are more than 
very small steps in addressing a very large problem but they are 
real steps, steps designed to do the most good with the resources 
we have available. Most important, most of them are steps that 
reflect our national values, providing mutual support for 
Canadians in need or who face real disadvantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why our 1998 budget keeps our red book II promise to 
further enrich the Canada child tax benefit.  This enrichment 
will be made in two steps, an increase of $425 million annually 
beginning in July 1999 and a second increase of $425 million 
annually commencing in July 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next, as the Minister of Finance told us to help working 
Canadians with children, the 1998 budget proposes to increase the 
limit on the child care expense deduction. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beginning in 1998, the limits for the child care expense 
deduction will increase from $5,000 to $7,000 for children under 
age seven and from $3,000 to $4,000 for children between the ages 
of seven and sixteen.  This measure will benefit some 65,000 
Canadian families with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also been a government that recognizes the challenge of 
the aging population.  We have had to address this in connection 
with the Canada pension plan.  We will be addressing it further 
with the seniors benefit, but this budget takes it a further 
step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other tax measures in this budget that I could 
highlight and other examples of actions in previous budgets that 
we can be proud of but I think my point is clear.  Our 
performance on behalf of the average taxpayer is concrete, 
credible and consistent.  I look forward to our future budgets as 
our fiscal strength expands, when this government will further 
broaden and deepen the tax relief that Canadians not only deserve 
but also desire. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
friend across the way just put the best possible face on the 
budget, which I had expected.  However, in fairness, the official 
opposition has to put things in perspective here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend did not mention that Canadians face the highest taxes 
in the G-7 today, 56% higher than the G-7 average.  He did not 
mention that in the last 15 years, between 1980 and 1995, we saw 
taxes in this country increase relative to GDP by 29% while they 
went down in the U.S., Japan, the U.K. and Germany.  Our taxes 
have gone absolutely through the roof. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What my friend did not point out is that it is people at the low 
end of the income scale who pay the highest price because of this 
huge rise in taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to my friend across the way is, given that the 
government has introduced targeted tax relief but also introduced 
broad based tax increases with the net effect of raising taxes by 
close to $7 billion over the next three years, notwithstanding 
its tiny $7 billion in tax relief, the net effect is still a $7 
billion increase, how does that help Canadians and in particular 
how does it help low income Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would ask the hon. member 
to look at the budget and read it very carefully so that he 
understands fully that low and middle income Canadians have in 
fact benefited from the kind of progress that we as a government 
are making.  The member should consider the evidence.  We have 
some of the lowest interest rates in historical perspective.  We 
have generated an incredible amount of activity which has created 
the kind of climate that Canadians not only want but deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member makes reference to the G-7.  We are leading the G-7 
in terms of the kind of economic activity that we are doing.  We 
have selectively noted that there will be tax reductions for low 
and middle income Canadians which is a good move and one that is 
very much deserved.  We will see more of that.  As time 
progresses there will be an opportunity for those kinds of 
initiatives to kick in.  I look forward to that because it is 
important that we as a government move on that front. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the member on his speech concerning this very 
historic budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the important elements of this budget, after we consider 
the impact of balancing it, is the theme of education as it 
relates to preparing our youth for their place in the workforce 
as they move through their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member well knows that under the Canadian opportunities 
strategy, the Canadian millennium scholarship foundation is the 
centrepiece.  In addition to that, the tax relief on interest 
payments on student loans, the tax free RRSP withdrawals for 
lifelong learning and an education credit and child care expense 
deduction for part time students are certainly some of the 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought I would just ask the member if he would like to 
comment a little bit on the issue of education, maybe from the 
perspective of his own riding, concerning the reception that 
Canadians have been giving to the investment that we are making 
in our youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as a former educator, I can 
say that I was absolutely elated in terms of the kinds of 
initiatives that we see for our young people especially, for our 
youth who deservedly need that kind of assistance.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reception not only in my riding but in Ontario and across 
Canada has been overwhelming in terms of the kind of reception 
people, and especially our young people, have given.  They know 
full well this was an important historic budget that will sustain 
them into the year 2000 and the 21st century.  It is very 
important that we give our young people those all important first 
chances and opportunities to enable them to carve out the kind of 
thing they require in terms of their lives and futures.  I am 
proud to be part of a government that has been able to do that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was 
moved by the member's comments about the benefit this budget 
provides for young people.  My wife and I have raised four young 
people.  My son Spencer has worked for a low paying income that 
most young people are forced into or it may be just a matter of 
growing up.  He made $14,613.32 in the last fiscal year.  He paid 
$393.16 in UI, $1,572.45 in income tax and $296.83 in Canada 
pension plan for a total of $2,262.44. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could my hon. friend across the way tell me if this is being 
fair to the young people of this country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his question.  This government has created the kind of climate 
for the economy that will enable all our young people to excel 
and proceed into their futures with not only confidence but also 
knowing full well they will have an opportunity we used to take 
for granted and now they should too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been able to do that in a way that is commensurate with 
the kinds of dreams young people have.  It is important that we 
proceed accordingly and carve out that kind of opportunity for 
all Canadians and especially our young people. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
certainly a privilege today to speak on behalf of all the good 
citizens of Miramichi riding.  I congratulate the Minister of 
Finance and our Prime Minister for a budget that finally 
addresses the terrible problem of the annual deficit in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I listened to the members opposite, I heard concerns being 
expressed that it was not the Minister of Finance but rather the 
Canadian people who balanced this budget.  I assure them that it 
was the Canadian people who balanced this budget, but the 
Canadian people did this after receiving strong leadership, 
direction and a commitment to make sure the finances of this 
country were brought under control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifty-two months ago when our party took control of the 
government, we were faced with a terrible situation in terms of 
our country almost being on the verge of bankruptcy.  The annual 
deficits were in the vicinity of $40 billion to $50 billion each 
year.  The international bankers were almost on our doorsteps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that members opposite do not seem to 
recognize the necessity of saying to our Minister of Finance that 
he has done a very good job in bringing our deficit under 
control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993-94 the government recognized that a comprehensive 
strategy was needed in order that our government and our country 
could be brought back to a fresh new direction.  It had to bring 
confidence back into our economy.  It had to bring forward 
programs that would eliminate waste, that would develop new 
markets, that would attract new investment and above all that 
would restore some hope and confidence for our Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget in 1998 is a continuation of the plan that was set 
forward in 1994.  On February 24, for the first time in 30 years, 
the Minister of Finance brought forward a budget that was 
balanced in terms of our Canadian nation.  That is an outstanding 
accomplishment. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1330"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians can take pride in the fact that we now have 
brought our economy and our government spending under control. 
We are facing an opportunity now to enter the 21st century with a 
sound economic and fiscal approach to our government and to our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This ever improving financial situation for Canada has helped 
drive down interest rates.  Those wanting to invest in our 
country today have some of the best interest rates that they have 
had in the last 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard today about employment and unemployment.  Being 
from the Miramichi I have to be continually concerned with the 
need for our people to seek employment.  We have had difficulties 
in the Miramichi.  In 1996 we saw the closure of base Chatham. We 
saw a lot of people lose their jobs.  That along with the 
difficulties that we have in Atlantic Canada was a major concern 
for us and the province of New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to report today on the outcome.  Great efforts have 
been put forward by our former premier Frank McKenna, by members 
of the legislative assembly of the province of New Brunswick and 
by our community leaders in the Miramichi. All of us have worked 
together to enhance our economy and to provide more job 
opportunities for our people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite alluded to youth.  In our country we have to 
be continuously concerned that our youth are provided with 
opportunities where they can obtain successful and rewarding 
employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last few years we have seen the unemployment rate in this 
country drop from 11.2% to approximately 9%.  This has certainly 
been an achievement.  Our government must work diligently to make 
sure that unacceptable levels of unemployment especially among 
young Canadians remains a very great concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently we announced the internship program. Some 3,000 people 
will be offered an opportunity to take part in internship with 
governments and private industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also see in this budget that employers who hire young people 
between the ages of 18 and 24 will be given an employment 
insurance benefit holiday for the youth they hire in the years 
1999 and 2000.  Every member of Parliament has to make sure that 
our young people, our most enthusiastic workers in many cases, 
are given opportunities to get gainful employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked about the great national debt which approaches some 
$600 billion, a legacy of overspending particularly by the 
governments before us.  This debt is affecting the lives of all 
Canadians.  Some 28.3 cents of every tax dollar are committed 
toward paying the interest on that debt.  All of us on all sides 
of the House must make sure that we continually approach the 
concept that reducing that debt will be in the best interests of 
all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debt has to have a rigorous program to make sure that it is 
maintained and kept under control and above all, eventually 
brought down to a minimum.  We hear people casting stones about 
the debt.  All Canadians have some degree of debt, whether it be 
a mortgage, a car loan or some personal loan.  As Canadians, even 
though we have to look at the debt in different ways, we must 
assume that the debt generally has been used to pay for some 
worthwhile assets that our country now has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find that more than 14 million Canadians will only get a 
minor break in tax relief, but it is a start.  It is a beginning. 
We have the $500 increase in the amount of dollars people can 
claim on a non-taxable basis.  This will benefit most Canadians, 
especially those in the lower and middle income groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to recognize that money is being put into the child 
tax benefit program by which Canadians of lower incomes, below 
$20,921, can receive $1,625 for the first child and $1,425 for 
each additional one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also happy to see the great attention being placed on 
education in this budget.  We have certain breaks now for those 
who are having difficulty with their student loans. 
We have the concept of Canadians being able to invest in their 
children's education. The Canada education savings grant program 
will mean the government too will contribute toward the annual 
amount that each taxpayer can contribute into an RESP.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I see my time is running out and I have to shorten my speech. 
Overall I would say that most young people in this country, most 
university students, most of our youth see this budget as a very 
favourable beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>University programs have been good.  We also see the concept of 
money being offered in terms of tax breaks to those who volunteer 
as firefighters and members of local fire departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general even though we may hear criticisms from the other 
side of the floor, I think this is only part of our governmental 
process. We on this side of course are doing our best to make 
sure that the programs are well explained.  On the other side, 
and I see some members nodding, it is their duty to point out 
what is difficult in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see more positive solutions instead of negative 
criticisms which really add very little to our debate.  Hopefully 
before the vote is held tonight, we will hear some more positive 
remarks from those members who are sitting opposite. 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to thank my friend opposite for his speech.  I want to point 
to a statement he made when he praised the finance minister for 
his leadership, as he phrased it, in battling the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out to my friend that in 1995 when the finance 
minister brought in his budget he did make a commitment to reduce 
spending by $5 for every dollar in new revenue that he brought 
in. Imagine the surprise of Canadians when three years later they 
found out what actually happened was that the government brought 
in $2.10 in new revenue for every dollar it cut.  In fact the 
government actually reversed completely the promise it made in 
1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is a betrayal.  I think Canadians believe in a 
small limited government, a government that lives within its 
means and understands its limitations, understands that it can 
only do a certain amount of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was taxpayers through revenues who really beat this deficit 
down.  If we look at the numbers, we will find that 69.1% of the 
improvement in the government's fiscal position was due to new 
revenues.  A very, very minor portion, about .6% of the 
improvement in the government's fiscal position was due to 
departmental spending cuts and the rest was cuts in transfers to 
the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my friend agree that the rewards of the surplus should be 
distributed to people on the basis of that formula? In other 
words, two-thirds of the surplus should go to taxpayers, .6% back 
to bureaucrats for increases in government spending and the 
remainder back to the provinces to fix the health care and higher 
education that this government helped destroy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charles Hubbard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is always good to 
hear my hon. friend because I think he has almost as many facts 
as the computer that sits near my desk and we have to judge them 
accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to recognize that some 700,000 or more new jobs have 
been created and that we have a great number of new taxpayers. 
That is what this government is all about.  We are out there 
trying to get more Canadians employed. I mentioned that some 9% 
today are unemployed.  I would like to see that figure at 5%. 
With that, our revenues would increase accordingly.  We would be 
able to restore more people working in terms of our economy, 
building a greater confidence in their ability to invest and to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
member opposite indicated unacceptable levels of unemployment. If 
I heard him correctly, he used the figure of 11.2% as being 
unacceptable.  It is down to about 9%.  I think it might be at 
8.9%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering whether he could shed some insight into why this 
government is so reluctant to set some targets for unemployment 
levels.  The government has done it on reducing the deficit.  It 
did it over a period of years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering why there is such reticence on the government 
side to set realistic targets to reduce unemployment, 
particularly among young people because their level is nowhere 
near the 11% or the 9%.  It is in the high teens if they are 
lucky. Perhaps the member opposite could answer that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charles Hubbard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, certainly the levels of 
unemployment among our youth are of great concern, but in terms 
of our goals, I think all of us should aim toward seeing that 
everybody who wants to work is able to get a job.  We cannot 
really set 5%, 4% or whatever the structural amount might be.  We 
eventually have to provide an opportunity to every Canadian who 
wants to participate in our economy to have work. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have listened for the most part to the member's presentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Job creation is the key to the thinking of most Canadians that 
would satisfy them in earning and contributing to this big 
country of ours and feeling productive. Of course the jobs are 
not out there.  Even with the rates of unemployment that we now 
have and this spurred economy, many people are concerned that 
they will still remain unemployed or underemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a projected debt that will remain at $583 billion.  This 
debt will cost every Canadian family $6,000 a year.  How can the 
Liberal government justify its position of not reducing that debt 
and tax burden on Canadian families and continuing on its route 
of spending the surplus? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charles Hubbard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is an old saying 
in a book on statistics, which I think was written by Lord 
Ashley, that figures lie and liars figure.  Some 14 million 
Canadian families are being offered some degree of tax relief. To 
try to assume that each Canadian family has $6,000 of debt on 
average may be correct, but it is really not a fact.  Hopefully, 
as big corporations such as our banks and other groups improve 
and contribute more to our economy we will see that overall 
general debt being reduced.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the most historic 
budget in Canada in almost 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the budget was presented all members of Parliament had the 
opportunity to go back to their constituencies and hold town hall 
meetings and to have consultations with their constituents 
concerning this historic budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was back in my own riding of Mississauga South I received 
a few phone calls and a number of letters.  I spent time walking 
through the neighbourhoods and talking to businessmen. The one 
thing that became very clear was that there was a great pride in 
the fact that we as a country had managed to put our financial 
house in order and balance the budget.  That was the clear 
message I received in my riding. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that Canadians were asked to step up and do 
their share to deal with a $42 billion deficit.  They were asked 
to bear some of the hardship.  Members across the House have 
raised a number of points.  I think all Canadians understand that 
if we did not get our fiscal house in order nothing could be done 
in terms of backfilling areas of health care, education and 
social programs.  We had to get the fiscal position under 
control.  We had to balance the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to indicate that I will be splitting my time with 
the Minister of Industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clearest indication of what the budget has done is the 
signal international financial markets gave to Canada in terms of 
their assessment of the job we had done in managing the fiscal 
situation of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For ordinary Canadians the clearest indication that was 
happening had to do with interest rates in Canada which dropped 
to the lowest levels in some 30 years.  There was a point at 
which short term rates were some 4% lower than they were in the 
United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An environment was created in Canada which led to massive 
initiatives to stimulate job creation in Canada.  It was not by 
the government.  The government does not create jobs.  In fact as 
part of getting the fiscal situation in order there was 
significant downsizing of the federal public service.  Spending 
of the government had to decline significantly.  There were 
people who had to bear that pressure and that burden.  It was 
very tough for many Canadians and many public servants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that interest rates came down represents one of the 
single largest tax breaks to Canadians that they have seen in a 
long time.  It means that Canadians now have the opportunity 
provided by lower interest rates.  Since house prices and 
mortgage interest on houses started to go down more Canadians 
were able to buy houses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the figures, at housing starts, at the number of 
families that finally have an opportunity to buy houses, and at 
the sale of cars.  The automobile sector represents 30% of the 
economy in my province of Ontario.  Automobiles sales went up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the issue of balancing a budget and turning that 
corner, this is the first budget of this new mandate.  This is 
not the only budget.  There are things yet to do.  There are 
commitments to be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly we have in the budget an emphasis on education, tax 
relief and debt relief.  The stage has now been set for further 
changes to be made.  In the absence of an economic downturn, I am 
absolutely sure we will see continued benefits for Canadians both 
in terms of tax relief and social programs as well as the 
important reduction of Canada's debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude my comments because I am sure members will have 
some questions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have a 
quick question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend stated that governments did not create jobs.  While I 
say that is true to a point, could my hon. friend tell us who 
pays doctors, nurses, teachers, members of the RCMP, people who 
work in our trade offices overseas, our armed forces and our 
parole officers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians and the Minister of Health are calling for more home 
care and for more opportunities in hospitals.  Will my hon. 
friend tell me who pays for these very essential people in 
society? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not exactly understand 
the point of the member's question, but I would say that the 
remuneration of doctors comes from the provinces.  The 
remuneration of the nurses comes from the provinces.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member wants to debate whether we are talking about another 
level of government or this level of government.  I am sorry, but 
we are playing with semantics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key thing for Canadians to understand is the solution the 
NDP has to all of our problems is to throw money at them: hire 
everybody and pay for everything.  That is not the way to manage 
an economy in a fiscally responsible manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NDPers have their way.  I understand where they are in the 
political spectrum.  I understand where they are in the House. 
That is why the Liberal Party is the governing party.  It has 
demonstrated time and time again that proper fiscal management 
translates into a balanced budget, tax relief and debt reduction 
for which Canadians asked.  We promised those things and we 
delivered. 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my hon. friend for his speech and I have a question for 
him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend is a defender of families.  He has written a book 
about families.  He advocates that all families be treated fairly 
in the taxation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder how he would respond to the government's measure to 
increase deductibility for child care expenses only for those 
families who take their children to day care.  The government did 
absolutely nothing for all those families who choose to look 
after their children at home.  How does the member respond to 
that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
plugging my book.  It is called <I>Strong Families Make a Strong 
Country</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the thrust of his question.  In the budget there is 
an increase in the child care expense deduction from $5,000 to 
$7,000 and from $3,000 to $5,000 for older children.  Indeed that 
benefits Canadian parents who choose to have others care for 
their children while they go to work, earn income and pay taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, this is the first budget of the mandate.  We 
brought in the caregiver tax credit.  I put forward a motion to 
implement a caregiver tax credit for those who provide care in 
the home to preschool children, the chronically ill, the aged or 
the disabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have delivered on the disabled.  We have delivered on the 
chronically ill, the infirm and the aged with regard to the 
caregiver tax credit.  We now have an opportunity to look at 
providing some sort of caregiver tax credit to families who 
choose to provide direct parental care to their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I still support that.  I want the member to know that I continue 
to discuss it with the finance minister and have his assurance 
the House will be dealing with the issue of unpaid work in 
Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
hard work on the finance committee as well as for his work in his 
constituency on prebudget consultations.  He certainly had a 
dramatic impact on the budget.  He is very learned in terms of 
tax issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member draw upon his tax experience and comment 
on the tax system in general?  Would he also provide some input 
on what he has heard from his constituents with respect to the 
opportunities program that was put in place by the budget?  That 
program will be essentially for families, on which the hon. 
member continues to focus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Mississauga South has consistently been a 
strong promoter of families.  He has done a fair amount of work 
in that area and continues to do so.  He has spoken with me on 
the issue, as well as with other members of our caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member tell us what he heard from his constituents 
after the budget was presented?  I am sure he has talked to a 
number of people.  I would be very pleased to hear what his 
constituents had to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is important for 
Canadians to know that parliamentarians listen carefully to their 
constituents with respect to government actions or proposed 
actions.  With respect to the budget, as I indicated, the aspect 
of balancing the budget was first and foremost in the minds of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the parliamentary secretary has outlined, the whole issue of 
the Canadian opportunities strategy has been extremely well 
received by my constituents of Mississauga South and others across the 
country, as others members of this place have seen.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium scholarship fund, the increased funding for the 
council on advanced research, the tax relief measures for student 
loan interest and the improvement of the Canada Student Loans Act 
are very important parts of the budget.  As well there are tax 
measures for promoting life-long learning, EI premium breaks for 
employers hiring young Canadians and funding for SchoolNet and 
Internet projects.  There is an opportunity for families to 
provide future education for their children through the RESPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians are unaware of some of these programs.  The job 
of members of Parliament is to pass on this kind of information 
to their constituents through householders and otherwise to let 
them know about the opportunities that have been made available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The theme in the budget has been preparing our young people for 
the knowledge based economy of the 21st century.  I thank the 
member for his kind words.  There is no question there is an 
appetite in the House to see that families have all the 
flexibility, options and choices they need to ensure we invest in 
our children, the future of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the member comment on the new millennium fund his 
government introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is such a good idea to have scholarships available for 
Canadian students and if the program is being front ended by $2.5 
billion this year, why can Canadian students not access it this 
current year? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member asks an 
interesting question.  I noted that provision.  Certain 
accounting rules of the Government of Canada are not 
discretionary. There are accounting rules as there are for any 
business.  The auditor general is the one who determines whether 
or not charges to a particular fiscal period are appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the millennium scholarship fund and the $2.5 
billion, it is clear a decision was taken.  Once the legislation 
is dealt with that endowment will go forward and start earning 
income.  It will have the value that will be necessary to provide 
100,000 scholarships for needy Canadians who show the merit of 
post-secondary education over the next 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member asks a particular question as to the propriety of the 
charge which would be better posed to the auditor general.

<P><A NAME="LINK86"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie—Lincoln, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
congratulations go out to the Quebec Court of Appeal for its 
good sense in ruling that the four year minimum penalty for 
committing an offence with a firearm does not violate the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  The automatic sentence 
was part of the federal government's tough gun control package 
that was introduced in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to the amendments, the one year minimum penalty for using 
a weapon while committing certain crimes was supposed to be in 
addition to the sentence for the crime itself. The new provision 
was challenged by a first time offender and the judge wisely 
ruled that the four year minimum did not constitute cruel and 
unusual punishment contrary to the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms.  The judge continued to say that the mandatory sentence 
was severe but it was not disproportionate and did not offend the 
standards of decency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome this decision as we try to cope with the rights of 
victims. The victim is much more traumatized by robbery with a 
firearm than without.  The four year mandatory is the right way 
to deal with the trauma imposed.  The four year mandatory is the 
right way to go.

substantial financial assistance to the disadvantaged instead of 
a small handout, which is cancelled out by a series of tax

March 4, in Rivière-du-Loup, the Minister of Human Resources

covering only 42% of unemployed workers was inadequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Mr. Fortin's study, not only is the plan inadequate, 
but it encourages people to leave the labour market and go on 
welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister acknowledge that a very high proportion of the 
58% of unemployed workers excluded from his plan have no choice 
but to turn to welfare? 
<P><A NAME="LINK111"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I said yesterday in this 
House, I am delighted that the number of people on welfare in 
Quebec is at its lowest in the past five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is certainly the result of the economic reforms in this 
country, which have led to improved growth in the labour market. 
Because we have a dynamic market and we have corrected certain

better. 
<P><A NAME="LINK112"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, while 
the number of welfare cases has dropped in Quebec, the minister 
neglected to say that it would have dropped even more had it not 
been for his plan, because people no longer entitled to 
unemployment insurance end up on welfare.  This was eloquently 
demonstrated by Professor Fortin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister, who is always talking about his active 
measures, realize that the measures he is proposing have 
contributed to reducing participation in the job market to its 
lowest point in 50 years because people are hesitant to take 
jobs that are too precarious?  They know that they will no longer 
be entitled to employment insurance and so they turn to welfare. 
That is the reality, not what the minister's technocrats see. 
<P><A NAME="LINK113"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

government is being criticized for the additional million jobs 
in Canada we now have.  This means our economy is running 
smoothly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, people on welfare in fact do have the opportunity to 
benefit from active measures, because we broadened access to 
these measures, as people, whether they be on welfare when they 
qualify or on employment insurance when they are unemployed, want 
active measures to be able to return to the labour market.

reform, for 450,000 more women to have the pleasure of 
contributing to employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real question, however, is this: Does the minister admit 
that, according to his own department's estimates, only 10% of 
these 450,000 women contributors will one day have any hope of 
gaining access to EI benefits? 
<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

the employment insurance system met the aspirations of women, 
who are far more likely to be part-time workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are pleased to have accomplished is that people can now 
accumulate hours worked, sometimes in two or three different

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques,

be corrected.  The minister's problem is that he is determined to 
deny the evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister continue to defend his reform, when it is 
clear that far fewer unemployed people will draw benefits than 
in the past, that a large number of them will have no choice but 
to go on welfare, and that Ottawa will save billions of dollars 
yearly at their expense, as a result of this reform? 
<P><A NAME="LINK117"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

fact that participation in the employment insurance system has 
dropped, and I have acknowledged this in the House on numerous 
occasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something we need to understand more thoroughly before

the hon. member will have seen in the budget two weeks ago the

when fiscal circumstances improved was to cancel the intended 
reduction in transfers to the provinces.  This resulted in $1.5 
billion more in transfer payments this year.  We have also given 
$60 million for a new blood system and investment in medical 
research.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I made it plain yesterday that when we have consensus among the

plan as to how to achieve this priority, the Government of Canada 
will be there to fulfil its responsibility to make its 
contribution of an appropriate amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot now spend before we know what we are spending on.  It

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is on the record as saying, and I have to believe 
him, that he does not want to see this issue go to the courts

of out of court resolution or compensation which involves both 
levels of government.  That is exactly what we have been working 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent weeks I have been engaged in discussions with my

<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in a 
reply to the hon. member for Longueuil, it appears that I 
referred to a consultation process that started in 1976. The year 
was 1996. Let me explain: it was not my father who did this in 
1976. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is with some reluctance that 
I rise to bring the issue that I am to the floor of the House. 
It is the issue of what went on earlier today in question period, 
what I would call one of disrespect for the chair and its 
occupant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a privilege of all of us, perhaps even our duty, to be as 
partisan as we feel necessary in order to make our points in this 
House.  I for one, who has been around here for a long time, some 
might say too long, have been more than partisan upon occasion, 
both as a government supporter and an opposition MP, which I also 
was, as your Honour will know, for a very long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all the years that I have been in this Chamber I have not yet 
witnessed what I saw occur here today in terms of asking 
questions, not only referring to the Speaker as “a prominent 
Liberal MP” but also to ask directly in a subsequent question 
about what Mr. Speaker as a person said outside of this Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I bring to your attention Citation 168 of 
Beauchesne's Sixth Edition, on page 49 of this document.  It says 
of the occupant of the chair: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chief characteristics attached to the office of Speaker in 
the House of Commons are authority and impartiality.  As a symbol 
of the authority of the House, the Speaker is preceded by the 
Mace which is carried by the Sergeant-at-Arms and is placed upon 
the Table when the Speaker is in the Chair.  The Speaker calls 
upon Members to speak.  In debate all speeches are addressed to 
the Speaker.  When rising to preserve order or to give a ruling 
the Speaker must always be heard in silence.  No Member may rise 
when the Speaker is standing.  Reflections upon the character or 
actions of the Speaker may be punished as breaches of privilege. 
The actions of the Speaker cannot be criticized incidentally in 
debate or upon any form of proceeding except by way of a 
substantive motion. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been a consistent ruling as outlined in the 
<I>Journals</I> as early as June 4, 1956.  These are very old 
principles in our Parliament and must be respected.  I believe 
that they are by the vast majority of us.  Hopefully they will be 
in the future by all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read further: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Confidence in the impartiality of the Speaker is an 
indispensable condition of the successful working of procedure, 
and many conventions exist which have as their object, not only 
to ensure the impartiality of the Speaker but also, to ensure 
that there is a general recognition of the Speaker's 
impartiality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker takes no part in debate in the House, and votes only 
when the Voices are equal, and then only in accordance with rules 
which preclude an expression of opinion upon the merits of a 
question.

believe, notwithstanding anything that members might have said, 
that these rules are well known either explicitly or implicitly 
by all of us.  Even if they were not, the proper rules of decorum 
in which all of us are to operate would dictate that everything I 
have just said should be the basis of our working here in 
Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I, for one, and I am sure all of my colleagues have the utmost

be withdrawn and instantly regretted by those who have made the 
remarks that have been made so we can continue from here on in to 
have the confidence in you that we have always displayed in you 
and for the great office that you hold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We owe it to this House and to this country and those who came 
here alleging new ways of doing parliamentary business, new and 
respectful ways of the authorities, will see fit to do that here

<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a point of order in regard to what went on today in 
question period, the admissibility of the question that I tried 
to ask in the questions that were put forward by the Leader of 
the Opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These questions were intended to address ministerial 
responsibility of the government because they were designed to 
clear any doubt as to the position of the government in regard to 
its relationship to Cuba.  The doubt, whether the member opposite 
or anyone else likes it or not, was necessary because of comments 
and headlines in national newspapers this morning that we all 
woke up to, and saw in the Quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer you to Beauchesne's 6th Edition, Citation 162 which 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker of the House of Commons is the representative of the 
House itself— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citation 164 states that the Speaker communicates the 
resolutions of the House. Citation 166 explains the rank of the 
Speaker which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker's rank is defined by Order in Council of December 19, 
1968, in which it is provided that upon all occasions and in all 
meetings, except where otherwise provided by Act of Parliament, 
the Speaker shall have precedence immediately after the Governor 
General, the Prime Minister of Canada, Chief Justice of Canada, 
former Governors General, former Prime Ministers and the Speaker 
of the Senate, and immediately before Ambassadors and Members of 
the Cabinet. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you truly do hold a high and exalted role in 
Parliament and in the Canadian parliamentary system.  When you 
speak and when you are quoted, with your rank also comes the 
responsibility of being quoted properly and of being answerable 
for those comments since you do in fact speak on behalf of all of 
us when you speak publicly in your role as the Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the opposition was doing the responsible thing in 
asking the government to clear any misconceptions about the 
government's position toward Cuba, in our relationship with Cuba 
and so on.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker that is what the question was, certainly that asked 
by the Leader of the Opposition, where he asked the government to 
clear up what is our position.  The first question was answered 
by the Deputy Prime Minister.  He tried to clarify it.  The 
Leader of the Official Opposition rose again to get more details 
about what was being done about the communication of that 
position and at that point, you refused to listen to him. You 
refused to listen to him for the remainder of the question 
period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The questions of the Leader of the Opposition were an attempt to 
clear up any misconceptions that the headlines and the quotes 
brought upon the position of this Parliament and, I think, the 
position of the government.  Certainly that was the intent of 
those questions.  Mr. Speaker did not listen to those questions 
and did not allow the normal rotation that has been negotiated 
between House leaders about the rotation between the parties 
during the question period.  I think this was shortsighted 
because we never did get to the bottom of what the government 
position was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those quotes from Beauchesne's I think properly puts you in the 
elevated spot that parliamentarians and Canadians hold you in but 
that does not mean that we cannot ask questions that have been 
raised both publicly in the press and in a public forum in your 
role as the Speaker in order to clarify them and allow the 
government to put their position on the table.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we just went 
through some very sad events and I must say that I agree with 
the last comment made, to the effect that you play an extremely 
important role at the core of the whole democratic and 
parliamentary system of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This role was protected by those who, in the past, through 
wisdom and through practice, established the rules governing how 
this House operates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not spend a lot of time on this issue. I simply want to 
tell you that, in our opinion, this role of yours—which is to 
protect democracy, to see that all parliamentarians are equal in 
this House, regardless of the political party to which they 
belong, and to ensure the proper administration of the affairs of 
this House, including in committee and any other place where 
parliamentarians have to work—is being fulfilled remarkably 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At times, we could have, given the situation in which we find 
ourselves in this Parliament—and we were tempted to do so, 
which is only human, as you know—challenged decisions that were 
not to our advantage or that did not please us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At times, we were even tempted to leave Parliament, to show that 
we were unhappy with the way things were done. 
But always guided by the most elementary wisdom and respect for 
those who sent us here, those who came here before us and those 
who will come after us, we controlled these initial impulses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agreed that it was important to put our confidence in you 
and, time after time, this confidence has been justified: 
decisions have been rendered in our favour when we were right and 
others against us when we were wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated yesterday, there has been a general feeling of 
unease these past few days, with members unexpectedly rising to 
issue an extremely serious challenge to the institution that is 
the Chair. 
I have no intention of raising this issue again today, but I 
would just like you, Mr. Speaker, to know that no member of this 
House has the power to challenge the Standing Orders or the way 
they are applied by you in this place on our behalf, as we have 
mandated you to do with the support of the table officers, whose 
expertise is undeniable.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a matter of respect for democracy. It is a matter of

tarnish the image of this House by behaving in an unacceptable 
manner.

concerned, your duties have always been carried out with dignity 
and competence and that all of us are here for a number of months 
if not years, we will have to learn to toe the line and obey the 
rules, not to defy authority and to realize that, however 
partisan or impassioned the debate, the kind of behaviour we have 
witnessed cannot and will not be tolerated.

Act and hooligans and yet, maybe in spite of the national lobby 
day by the police association, we see a very blatant display of 
hooliganism right in this House of Commons.  They have tried to 
hijack the House of Commons and I personally take offence at 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final point I want to raise is in reference to what the 
Reform whip has made reference to but did not finish reading. 
That is citation 164 in <I>Beauchesne's Parliamentary Rules & 
Forms</I>. The Reform whip read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(1) Communicates the resolutions of the House to 
those to whom they are directed— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He did not finish the sentence, which continues on: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—and conveys its thanks and expresses its censure, reprimands, 
and admonitions. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my view, Mr. Speaker, that you should study this issue, 
study the point of order that has been raised by the government 
House leader, and in your capacity as Speaker if you find that 
this is a point of order relevant to Beauchesne's, that you take 
your authority and reprimand the Reform Party for its disgusting 
action in this House of Commons. 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of reference to this incident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been reference to you and your role as the Chair. 
Perhaps the most important word that has been used here is 
respect. 
I would also suggest an important word is impartiality.  When you 
don the cloak of the Speaker, of the Chair, you also don the 
impartial role of presiding over this House for all members, 
regardless of partisan politics.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, the language that was used in the question that you 
ruled in my opinion rightly out of order had in its preamble 
reference to you particularized as a prominent Liberal MP.  I 
would suggest that you rightly ruled this out of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a point of reference in your deliberations over this 
government point of privilege, I refer you to section 404 of 
Beauchesne, sixth edition, where it states at page 119: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No questions of any sort may be addressed to the Speaker.  If 
information relating to matters under the jurisdiction of the 
Speaker is required, it must be obtained privately. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were options available.  Had the Reform Party wished to 
address this matter, it could have raised it on a point of 
privilege or a point of order.  However they chose not to do so. 
They did so in an improper way which you ruled out of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also with some regret that I make reference to the fact 
that we are here again in this situation, mired down in a debate 
that could have been avoided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, you will recall, there was a point of privilege 
brought forward by the Conservative Party.  At that time the 
government remained silent on this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a very frightening and disturbing trend in that 
there is a disintegration in the rules of Parliament, something I 
am sure you are aware of and something I am sure that you have to 
be concerned about.  We are seeing this happen quite readily over 
the last two weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I am sure, and I join with the voices of support in 
this House for you, that you will make a proper, deliberate, 
judicious ruling, to use your words, over these points of 
privilege and points of order. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to add a few comments to those already made 
on the point of order raised by my colleague, the government 
House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say that none of the precedents cited by the Reform 
whip in any way suggest that the Speaker of the House is ever the 
voice of the government.  Section 162 of Beauchesne says: “The 
Speaker of the House of Commons is the representative of the 
House itself in its powers, proceedings and dignities”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is understandable because section 163 of Beauchesne says 
“The Speaker is elected by the House itself”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform whip attempted to suggest that words of the Speaker 
of this House had some significance as words of the government 
because of the Speaker's place in the order of precedence.  Let 
us take a look at section 166 of Beauchesne.  It says: “The 
Speaker's rank is defined by Order in Council on December 19, 
1968 in which it is provided”, and I go on to read:   “that the 
Speaker shall have precedence immediately after the Governor 
General, the Prime Minister of Canada, the Chief Justice of 
Canada, former governors general, former prime ministers and the 
Speaker of the Senate and immediately before ambassadors and 
members of the cabinet”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing whatsoever in this citation that suggests that 
whenever the Speaker expresses himself, whether in this House or 
outside this House, he is speaking on behalf of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the interpretation of the Reform whip of section 166 were 
accurate, then he himself would be attempting to argue that when 
the Chief Justice speaks, he is speaking on behalf of the 
government, or when the Governor General speaks he is speaking on 
behalf of the government.  This is patently wrong and patently 
ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the questions raised by the Leader of the 
Opposition, I do not think it is proper in the light of the 
precedents of this House for a question to even imply that the 
Speaker of the House is anything other than impartial and that 
anything he says is raised on behalf of the government. 
This is something that should be obvious to somebody in this 
place from the very first moment he enters this House.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I underscore the points made by the government House 
leader and others that the remarks, the implications in the 
questions of the Leader of the Opposition were totally out of 
order. The implication suggested in the questions by the Leader 
of the Opposition that the press reports, assuming they were 
accurate, in any way meant that the person involved was speaking 
on behalf of the government is totally wrong.  I respectfully 
suggest that the best way for things to be put back on their feet 
is for the Leader of the Opposition to come into this House, 
recognize what he did was wrong and express words of apology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Reform Party first came to this House in some 
substantive number, its members said that they intended to bring 
a new tone to the House of Commons, a new atmosphere of civility. 
I wish they would look at their words at that point in time when 
they first entered the House and take these words seriously. 
They should have these words reflected in their actions today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the members of the Reform Party reflected on what they said 
at the opening of the 1993 Parliament and contrasted what they 
said with their actions today, they would feel ashamed of 
themselves. The best way to remove that shame is for the leader 
of the Reform Party to express words of apology.  Mr. Speaker, I 
am sure that you and we would accept those words and we could get 
back to serving Canadians and serving the business of Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Colleagues, the last thing I ever wanted 
to be was the focal point of any kind of anger or any kind of 
criticism in this House.  My only reason for being the Speaker of 
this House is to see to it that all of you, my colleagues and 
myself as a member of Parliament, are treated fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the outset I have tried to see to it that all of you 
Canadian parliamentarians had the chance to express yourselves 
and be heard within the rules of the House of Commons.  You have 
entrusted me to look at the rules and to make decisions on behalf 
of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There can be no doubt that there was criticism of me in the 
House this afternoon.  Of course there was.  Perhaps the hon. 
whip of the opposition party has every right to criticize what I 
do.  Perhaps the Speaker should be criticized when he brings—I 
do not want to use the word dishonour, but I will use the 
member's word if indeed it was that—shame— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Please, my colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is a way.  There are avenues that we have to deal with 
our Speakers and their actions.  Our rules and practice provide 
avenues for such criticism.  I do not think it should be done 
under the guise of a point of order.  I do not think it should be 
done under the guise of debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to return the debate to budget 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last two weeks, I have had the occasion to meet with 
Canadians in many parts of the country and out of the country.  I 
have discussed this budget in communities like Sudbury, Toronto, 
Vancouver, Oakville, London, Medicine Hat and Vancouver. I had 
the occasion last week to speak with business leaders at the 
Chicago Executive Club in Chicago, Illinois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say that everywhere people are recognizing that this 
budget represents a major economic achievement. It is a national 
achievement, an achievement in which all Canadians can take pride 
because all Canadians have contributed to our victory over the 
deficit. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Congratulations are due to my colleague, the Minister of 
Finance, and the Prime Minister for their leadership in achieving 
a balanced budget by the end of this fiscal year—the first 
balanced budget in almost three decades. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In four years, with the commitment and support of all Canadians, 
we have wrestled a $42 billion deficit to the ground and set 
Canada on an irrevocable course to reduce the debt. The benefits 
are now clear. On the fiscal side, we are already moving on debt 
reduction. The 1998 budget delivers $7 billion in tax relief over 
the next three years. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget is more than a milestone in our battle against the 
deficit and debt.  It sets the agenda for building a knowledge 
based Canadian economy for the 21st century. The knowledge 
revolution is changing the basis of success for individuals, 
businesses, communities and nations. It is breaking down the 
barriers of time and distance. It is redefining old notions of 
competitive advantage, giving greater prominence to the quality 
of people's skills and the inventiveness of their ideas.  It 
affects all sectors of our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To meet the demands of our knowledge economy, we face the 
challenge of developing a learning culture.  It will spark the 
continuous improvement and the creation and application of new 
ideas that we need.  It will feed a stronger Canadian innovation 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 budget builds on initiatives that we have taken in 
previous budgets to build an innovative learning culture in our 
country, initiatives such as the technology partnerships Canada 
program and the Canada foundation for innovation.  Budget 1998 
expands and deepens that record of action across the industry 
portfolio.  It injects new resources into key programs that 
invest in people and technology such as the agenda for connecting 
all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last September the Speech from the Throne included our 
commitment to reach an ambitious goal, to make Canada the most 
connected nation in the world by the year 2000.  We want to make 
Canada the world leader in developing and using an advanced 
information infrastructure to achieve our social and economic 
goals in the knowledge economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget commits an additional $260 million to the agenda for 
connecting Canadians.  Of that amount, $205 million will support 
the expansion of successful programs such as community access, 
CAP, and SchoolNet.  Our old goal for SchoolNet was to connect 
every school in Canada to the Internet.  We will achieve that 
goal this year, 1998. With the new funds we will go on to link 
every classroom in every school. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new funding for CAP will allow us to surpass our old target 
of connecting 5,000 rural Canadian communities to the Internet by 
the year 2000. Now we will be able to expand CAP into urban 
areas, providing an additional 5,000 sites, making all centres 
sustainable and upgrading the network. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will also create the Voluntary Sector Network Program 
(VolNet) to link voluntary and charitable organizations across 
Canada to the Internet and to each other. Our initial goal is to 
link at least 10,000 voluntary organizations to the Internet. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the heart of connecting Canadians is the right 
infrastructure. The budget also responds to that need.  It 
includes $55 million for CANARIE to build the next generation 
Internet, the world's first all optical broadband network. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Connecting Canadians is only one way the budget is investing in 
building Canada for the 21st century.  We are making important 
investments in university research and the development of highly 
qualified people by increasing the budgets of the three 
university research granting councils by more than $400 million 
over the next three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are expanding the National Research Council's successful 
industrial research assistance program, IRAP, by an additional 
$34 million this year.  That support will help more Canadian 
small businesses to adopt new technologies.  It will help them 
develop new products and processes for commercial markets here 
and internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>IRAP provides technical advice to more than 10,000 small and 
medium size enterprises each year.  It provides financial 
assistance to help more than 3,000 businesses with research and 
development.  These kinds of initiatives are changing the 
economic face of Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at this city in which we are now, Canada's high 
technology centre tells that story very well.  As we all know, 
this was once a city seen as the home of the federal government 
and little more.  Those days are gone.  Over the past years a 
solid base of high technology employment has expanded enormously. 
I am proud to say that co-operation between federal research and 
development agencies and our private sector leaders have helped 
to spur that growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Ottawa-Carleton Economic Development 
Corporation, in 1990 the Ottawa region had 300 high tech 
companies.  By 1997 that figure was more than 800 and it is 
continuing to rise. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of these new leading-edge businesses are spinoffs from the 
work of the NRC, NSERC and our other agencies.  For example, last 
October, the NRC announced five new spinoff companies, four of 
those setting up shop here in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new and expanding companies in our high tech sector mean 
jobs. OCEDCO estimates that their growth will mean that 
Ottawa-area employers will need to fill nearly 20,000 positions in 
the telecommunications and information technology sectors alone 
over the next five years. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again the agencies that are getting increased support 
through this budget are helping to solve that need.  The National 
Research Council is working with educational and private sector 
partners to address the critical shortage of software engineers 
through programs such as the O-Vitesse partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The investments in learning and in our innovation system that 
the budget is making are important.  They are creating 
opportunities for young people to learn and to find work.  They 
are creating opportunities for businesses to master the tools of 
the new economy.  They are building on our fiscal success to make 
Canada a strong trader in the global knowledge based economy of 
the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have travelled over the last two weeks literally from one end 
of Canada to the other.  I met with people to talk about the 
important aspects that we find in this budget.  We were talking 
not just about the realization of a long time target of reaching 
a budgetary balance, but of the new investments in the ability of 
Canadians to make the adaptations that are necessary to enter 
fully into the knowledge based economy of the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I saw in each of the cities that I visited a realization that 
this indeed is the key to Canada's future.  Our success in the 
past can be built upon by a success in the future that recognizes 
the importance of human resources, the importance of knowledge, 
the importance of learning and the importance of technology. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
listening to the Minister of Industry, one would think one was 
on another planet.  He says he has gone across the country and 
has found that business people, and indeed everyone, is happy 
with the finance minister's latest budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would just quote a few comments made by business people, 
including Mr. Cléroux, vice-president of the Canadian Federation 
of Independent Business, who said the day the budget was brought 
down, and I quote  “It is a budget lacking vision, with no job 
strategy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, when we are told that the business community was happy, we 
have our doubts. 
There was some unanimity around the budget, to the effect that 
it was not the budget of a visionary, and that, as far as real 
strategic planning with respect to the economy and jobs, the 
Minister of Finance was not perhaps the best person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He says that everyone was happy.  The day the budget was brought 
down, and the following day as well, all the provincial finance 
ministers and premiers—Mr. Romanow spoke on behalf of all Canada's 
premiers—were united in condemning this budget, saying that the 
Minister of Finance was taking credit for all the benefits of 
putting the fiscal house in order when it was their work that had 
made it possible and that they had received nothing for their 
efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Income Taxpayers' Association also had something to say. 
There were people representing taxpayers. 
They found $4 billion in tax cuts over the next three years 
laughable.  Since he has been Minister of Finance, do you know 
how much the taxes of Quebeckers and Canadians have gone up?  By 
almost $31 billion in three years. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, thanks to him, people have paid an additional $31 billion in 
taxes over the past three years.  Now he is telling us that, in 
the next three years, he will be reducing taxes by $4 billion. 
That amounts to laughing in people's faces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance is much quicker and more effective when 
it comes to voting in legislation for himself that suits him in 
terms of international shipping business than when it comes to 
reducing everyone's taxes for the collective good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the minister, in view of his remarks.  We 
know that the first deficits date from a Liberal government some 
25 years ago. 
I would ask him whether he agrees with our voting on an 
anti-deficit law in this House that would set specific parameters 
ensuring the accountability of the Minister of Finance to the 
House of Commons? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he agree to anti-deficit legislation to ensure that the 
Liberals do not fall back into their old ways of spending and 
put us in the situation they did 25 years ago? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley:</B> Mr. Speaker, all I can say is that throughout 
Canada, on my visits following the budget, people welcomed me 
enthusiastically and expressed their pride at finally having a 
balanced budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 25 years—it indeed started in the early 1970s and continued 
until last year—we increased the debt burden. It was a major 
problem, and we were limited in the choices the government could 
make because of the deficit and the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that we have a balanced budget—the first of the G7 countries—we 
have choices.  We can regain control over our finances and decide 
ourselves on the vision we will follow in the coming years. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new economy will not be built by bricks and mortar.  The new 
economy requires knowledge, learning and connections of all 
Canadians to the new technologies that will exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget has the vision to do that, but it is based on the 
sanity of finances that has been recovered as a result of the 
efforts of the Minister of Finance. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is with some delight that I rise to talk to the budget of 1998, a 
budget of which Liberals are so proud.  Quite frankly they do 
have not a lot of reason for such pride. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday in the House, in response to a question that I asked 
of the Prime Minister, I suggested that maybe health care was the 
top priority of Canadians generally across the country, whether 
they be premiers of provinces, finance ministers, health 
caregivers or other Canadians.  The Prime Minister suggested to 
me at that time that I should probably go back to the Winnipeg 
budget and look at the budget of my colleagues, the Tories in 
Manitoba, who reduced taxes but did not add one cent to medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had the opportunity to go back and look at the Manitoba 
budget that came down four days ago.  I suggest that we can make 
some comparisons between the Manitoba budget and the Liberal 
budget tabled in the House.  I honestly say that the Liberals can 
learn something from my colleagues in Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Its budget was the fourth balanced budget Manitoba had put 
forward to its citizens. Over $100 million of new money was added 
to the Manitoba health care portion of the budget to bridge 
significant federal cuts to Manitoba's transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the Liberal government, Manitoba has shown that 
health care is a priority. Additional dollars are and have been 
going into health care in the Manitoba budget.  Of that $100 
million Manitoba spends $1.93 billion or 34% of its total budget 
on health care.  I use that to stress the fact that the province 
of Manitoba recognizes health care is in a crisis and is a 
priority of its budget.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also suggest that maybe the Liberal government would like to 
go a little further and take another lesson from Manitoba which 
has implemented balanced budget legislation.  The Liberal 
government could learn from Manitoba.  Its balanced budget 
legislation has been in place for a number of years.  If the 
budget of Manitoba is not balanced, ministers and the premier 
have to pay the consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the budget which was just brought down in Manitoba there was 
a reduction in personal income tax.  Is the government listening? 
There was a reduction in personal income tax.  There was debt 
repayment and a plan for continued debt repayment in the Manitoba 
budget.  It was increased from $75 million to $150 million in 
this budget year to retire the debt.  The Liberal government 
unfortunately has not learned those lessons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Manitoba budget small business was acknowledged.  An 
economic opportunity will be available if the businesses are 
treated properly.  In the small business reduction the payroll 
tax went from 2.25% to 2.15%, but it was a reduction in 
regressive payroll taxes.  Unfortunately the Liberal government 
has not learned the lessons of other provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a capital tax reduction.  There was an increase in the 
exemption from $3 million to $5 million.  That is very positive. 
The Manitoba government recognizes that small business is the 
backbone of our economy.  The Liberal government should take 
lessons from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister suggested that I make some comparisons 
between the Liberal budget and the Manitoba budget.  Let us talk 
about the Liberal budget.  It is balanced for the first time. 
Congratulations.  I am very pleased that finally the budget is 
balanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us understand why the budget is balanced.  It is not because 
of the last three and a half or four years of this 
administration.  It goes back to 1991 when a policy was put into 
place to target inflation.  The 1991 policy caused interest rates 
to drop, which allowed the government to balance the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other policies were put into place from 1991 to 1993.  One of 
them was the NAFTA.  Make no mistake about it.  The reason the 
economy is so strong today in Canada is international trade.  We 
live in a global society.  We live in a global economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When members of the government were in opposition they said “We 
will rip it up.  We will have nothing to do with international 
trade.  We will have nothing to do with globalization”.  Now 
they have decided that it is such a good thing they will expand 
the NAFTA.  We are going to expand into Europe.  We are going to 
expand with the MAI.  We are going to expand into South America. 
Make no mistake.  That policy was put into place by a previous 
administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there was the GST.  The same people who are now in power 
said “We will scrap it.  We will not have it any longer”.  In 
fact the GST, which was put into place by the previous 
administration, was used to bring the operating deficit down to 
zero in this year's budget.  The Liberal government should thank 
the previous administration immensely for balancing the budget of 
1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us have a look at the Liberal record.  Canada today, after 
four years of Liberal administration, has the highest personal 
income levels of the G-7 countries.  We did not hear that in the 
finance minister's budget speech but it is fact.  The Liberals 
have raised taxes 40 times since 1994.

</I></B></P><P align=left>According to an Industry Canada study that was done with the 
United States, Americans today are 25% richer than Canadians. 
American manufacturing workers get paid $1 per hour more than 
their Canadian counterparts.  America's jobless rate is 4.7% 
while Canada's is 8.6%.  Canadian wage earners pay roughly 
one-third more in taxes than their American counterparts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have been making up for stagnant incomes by eating 
into their savings and borrowing more.  I know my colleagues on 
the government side will pooh pooh this, but there is another 
statistic that in this year there will be more bankruptcies than 
ever before.  There will be record levels with 97,000 registered 
bankruptcies in Canada this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government cannot blame anybody.  It cannot blame previous 
administrations.  It cannot blame the economy.  It can blame only 
itself and the tax record it put forward to the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Statistics Canada, taxes took the largest bite out 
of the household budget in 1996.  Taxes took 22% of every dollar, 
whereas 17 cents went for shelter, 12 cents went for food and 12 
cents went for transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope Canadians were not looking for a big break on taxes in 
the budget, because they got none.  Quite frankly they will have 
to pay more taxes.  Even though the spin doctors are putting the 
spin that there were tax reductions in the budget, the fact of 
the matter is that when it comes down to the dollars and cents 
off a paycheque, at the end of every month they will be paying 
more in taxation than they have in tax breaks in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals continue to overtax Canadian workers and employers and 
kill jobs by keeping employment insurance premiums unnecessarily 
high.  It was our position that the government should take the $7 
billion overexpenditures and transfer those dollars to CPP and 
not increase the CPP payments the way it did.  That is where it 
comes to the fact that Canadians this year will be paying more in 
tax dollars than they did last year.  They have had huge 
increases in CPP but have not had an offset in employment 
insurance premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go back to the Manitoba budget.  Manitoba recognizes that 
business is a very important part of the economy.  It reduced 
regressive payroll taxes.  It increased the exemption in capital 
assets.  It reduced capital tax.  It allowed Manitoba businesses 
to have an environment to expand, to hire people and to develop 
an economy that Manitoba would like to have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister said “Go and compare with the Manitoba 
budget”.  He and the finance minister should have made that 
comparison prior to tabling their own budget in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are planning no measure to ensure that a fiscal 
dividend will either be achieved or become a permanent part of 
the federal budget scene.  Like the province of Manitoba, the PC 
Party believes that there must be tough balanced budget 
legislation to ensure the country is never again caught up in the 
spiral of deficits and debt.  We propose a balanced budget law 
that would reduce the pay of the Prime Minister and cabinet if 
the deficit ban were broken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about that.  We have a budget that was tabled in the 
House by the finance minister.  It was the first and only budget 
I have ever seen that never used any assumptions.  It never 
showed Canadians exactly what the surpluses would be.  It never 
showed Canadians a fiscal plan to reduce the debt on an ongoing 
basis.  Why was that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason was that the finance minister did not want to show 
Canadians exactly what the surpluses were.  The estimates are 
that there should be between $5 billion and $15 billion worth of 
surplus if the job were handled properly by the government.  That 
$5 billion to $15 billion surplus should translate into debt 
reduction and tax reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately we never saw those numbers at the bottom of the 
finance sheet because the finance minister is afraid to show them 
in case his caucus, his colleagues and his cabinet may wish to 
spend those dollars on other issues.  Quite frankly they spent 
those dollars because they have not been translated into tax cuts 
or have not been translated into deficit reduction or to debt 
reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Finance projected several billion dollars in 
the government's surplus, but the money has been spent anyway 
before Canadians got a chance to see it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Jeff Rubin, chief economist for CIBC Wood Gundy, said that the 
Minister of Finance “does not have a political mandate to run 
budgetary surpluses so he is hiding them from Canadian taxpayers 
in an effort to explain why he is not giving them tax relief.  If 
he were to acknowledge where he really stands, this budget would 
be politically indefensible”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget raises the basic personal amount of deduction by only 
$500.  The basic exemption right now in this budget is $6,956, 
taking 400,000 people off the tax rolls.  My party would raise 
the basic exemption level to $10,000 which would take two million 
Canadians off the tax roll. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing in this budget to encourage job creation for 
Canadians by alleviating the tax burden on small business.  The 
Prime Minister said that the member for Brandon—Souris should 
look at the Manitoba budget to see what it has done with health 
care in terms of priorities.  The member for Brandon—Souris 
looked at the Manitoba budget and found that there had been a 
personal reduction on income tax in that province.  There has 
been a personal reduction of income tax in Alberta and Ontario 
but the Liberal government is obviously deaf to those who talk to 
the reasoning of tax reductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxation policy can influence the economic environment which in 
turn may affect the competitive position of a country in a global 
market.  As such, a competitive and stable taxation policy has 
the potential to be an effective tool for the Canadian government 
to promote investment in economic activity in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxation generates immense perceptions from investors who are 
looking for new opportunities worldwide.  In recent years Canada 
has shown significant improvement in terms of lowering the tax 
burden.  Nonetheless, even if the present trend continues it will 
take some time to shed the perception of Canada as a high taxed 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Catherine Swift from the Canadian Federation of Independent 
Business comments on the budget: “Further tax cuts would help 
create jobs.  We're still not seeing a major job creation agenda 
here and from a small business job creator standpoint that really 
should be a prime target”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hate to repeat myself but I will.  Let us go back to the 
Manitoba budget. The Prime Minister suggested I do that. Do I not 
listen to what the Prime Minister says?  Go to the Manitoba 
budget.  I went to it and believe me, the Manitoba budget does 
speak to assistance to small business.  We would speak to 
reducing small business taxes from 12% to 8%, to reducing 
corporate tax rates from 28% to 24% and to increasing the small 
business deductions from $200,000 to $300,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC party would also increase the capital gains tax exemption 
from $500,000 to $750,000.  Entrepreneurs and people in the 
farming industry are more willing to take risks and bring their 
ideas to market when they know they will be able to keep more of 
what they earn.  Increasing the capital gains tax exemption is 
just one suggestion for attracting investment capital for start 
up or expansion. The agricultural small and medium size business 
sector is the most dynamic sector of the economy and should be 
rewarded. None of those words were even considered by the Liberal 
budget, which is a travesty because small business was the loser. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget of the finance minister and the government failed to 
restore the $6 billion the Liberal government took out of 
transfers to the provinces for health care, education and social 
assistance.  I was told to go back to look at my own province 
because it is not showing it as a priority.  Wrong.  We put $100 
million into health care which did not come from the federal 
government in the form of any transfer payments.  It came from 
the pockets of the taxpayers of Manitoba. Seven out of ten 
provinces continue to get less cash for health care and education 
than they did before the Liberals formed this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some glowing reports from some provincial politicians 
concerning this Liberal budget:  “It is a further kick in the 
teeth to all provinces and I think you will see more provinces 
retreating into saying we are on our own, we've got to solve our 
own problems”.  That comes from Ontario Premier Mike Harris. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Canadians, Manitobans, premiers, finance ministers, 
governments right across this country have called for the federal 
government to put back into place some of the support for health 
care”. 
That comes from the Manitoba finance minister, Mr. Eric Stefanson.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat this budget has done virtually nothing for the 
provinces which in fact are doing the job and doing it very well. 
They are doing it without any federal assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One area of my responsibility is agriculture. I have looked 
through the budget and I looked through the throne speech.  In 
neither have I seen any indication that agriculture is even 
playing an important part in the Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Canadian farmers gave their pint of blood over and over again 
to help Ottawa get its deficit under control.  Now the federal 
government has to deal with the serious issue of farm income and 
security”.  That comes from Jack Wilkinson, Canadian Federation 
of Agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nowhere did this budget deal with any of the issues that are 
facing agriculture not only now but in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“There is painfully little in this budget on agriculture.  It 
looks like they basically said goodbye to that productive sector 
in terms of any new initiatives for family farms.  It makes it 
pretty clear that we are way down on the list of those who are 
deemed to be worthy of attention”.  That comes from Nettie Wiebe 
of the National Farmers Union.  But she had a point.  There was 
nothing with agriculture in this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government offers nothing to the agriculture 
industry in this budget, nor did the government even mention 
agriculture in the throne speech. Two strikes. A third strike and 
I believe agriculture will see this government out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only measure it confirmed was the $20 million over the next 
four years Canadian rural partnership program.  I have received 
and looked at the criteria of the Canadian rural partnership 
program.  It is a $20 million over four year program. That is $5 
million a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is it going to do?  It is going to facilitate some pilot 
projects.  It is going to allow departments to come together so 
that they will be allowed to see how effective the programs are 
they now have in place.  We will put $5 million a year over four 
years and basically accomplish nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ministry of agriculture's Pest Management Regulatory Agency 
budget for 1997-98 is going to have a $4.5 million deficit.  The 
deficit was a result of the PMRA's not properly analysing its 
product base to generate fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to put $5 million in one hand to try to look at the 
programs are, the pilot projects and facilitate programs for 
farmers.  Yet farmers are going to pay $5 million a year more for 
PMRA which they did not want in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know it is time to wrap up.  I appreciate your time and this 
House's time.  I must say that the balanced budget is the only 
good positive thing that I can say about the budget that was 
tabled.  Other than that, all the issues that were dealt with in 
this budget, unfortunately, could be dealt with much better. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member for Brandon—Souris brought up our home province a number 
of times in his presentation.  I think it is only responsible in 
my reply to respond to some of the things that the hon. member 
has said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that he was concerned about some of the things that were 
somehow omitted, certain kinds of information omitted from the 
finance minister's budget of last month.  Given that the hon. 
member is concerned about omissions, I would like to cite a 
couple of omissions on his part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the hon. member for Brandon—Souris mentioned that 
the Filmon government in the province of Manitoba devotes 34% of 
its budget to health care.  Maybe the hon. member for 
Brandon—Souris would like to know that 36% of Mr. Filmon's 
budget comes from the federal government, just a little, small 
point that he might be interested to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go a little further because he makes certain implications 
about how the provincial government or the province of Manitoba 
is treated by this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the member for Brandon—Souris that when 
our government came to office in the fall of 1993, about four and 
a half years ago, Manitoba, my province, his province, received 
in both transfer payments, the CHST and equalization payments, a 
total of $1.951 billion. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1610"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is it in the next fiscal year starting in less than three 
weeks, April 1?  It will be $1.944 billion, a difference of $7 
million.  Let us put that $7 million into context.  In the last 
three years, as a result of lower interest rates brought about by 
this government's fiscal policies, the Filmon government in the 
province of Manitoba has realized savings of $135 million.  The 
province of Manitoba is doing quite well I would say to the hon. 
member for Brandon—Souris. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us also put these transfer payments into further context.  I 
mentioned that the transfer payments will exceed $1.9 billion 
starting April 1.  That accounts for 36% of Manitoba's estimated 
revenues.  That is 50% above the national average and the highest 
of the four western provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must admit it is really difficult to take criticism from a 
representative of the Progressive Conservative Party that ran our 
economy into the ground between 1984 and 1993.  In the interest 
of facts and in the interest of informing Canadians, the member 
from Brandon—Souris owes us this piece of information about how 
the province of Manitoba has been treated by this budget and 
successive budgets over the last four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Madam Speaker, I have a lot of faith 
in the finance minister of the province of Manitoba.  I believe 
he has done an exceptional job over the last four years.  He has 
balanced his budget for four years.  He has not raised any taxes 
in the province of Manitoba and the economy is doing very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I brought my example up was to make sure that the 
Liberals recognize there are ways of reducing taxes in a budget 
to make sure the economy is going to be improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote the finance minister of Manitoba: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Providing Manitobans with the best health care possible has 
always been and continues to be our top program priority. 
Stefanson said: “Our 
funding commitment to health care is 45% or almost $600 million 
more than we spent in 1987—in contrast to the federal government 
cutting health transfers 35% in the last three years”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proof lies in the pudding.  Needless to say the hon. member 
believes that the federal government is treating provincial 
governments fairly.  That is a head in the sand attitude because 
I can give the member quotes from every premier and every finance 
minister who say that is not the case.  That is okay, the member 
can hide his head in the sand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talks about how previous to 1993 the Progressive 
Conservative government caused the problems for our country with 
respect to deficits.  I talked about the reason why the deficit 
now no longer exists.  It is because of policies that were put in 
place in 1991-93.  I can also say that I remember the Trudeau 
years when deficits and debt were the trademark of the day.  If 
we want to talk about who put Canadians into this debt and 
deficit position, they have to look no further than their own 
history. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I have two questions.  It will only take several 
moments to ask them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really appreciated the member's plea for more tax reduction 
and increasing the personal exemption to $10,000.  I 
wholeheartedly agree with that.  We desperately need that kind of 
help for especially low income Canadians. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1615"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I have relates to that in the sense that the 
government has put in place a child care credit or tax reduction 
that applies only for those who use care outside of the home. I 
think this is a gross injustice.  I cannot agree with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is that this child care credit should apply to all 
parents.  They should not be forced to take their children 
outside of the home.  I was wondering if the member would agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question is in regard to agriculture.  He made a big 
point about agriculture and the fact that it was not addressed in 
this budget.  I agree with him.  In fact agriculture will be 
devastated by what this government has done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In just one example, the CPP premium increase is going to hit 
all Canadians but farmers are going to find that the price of 
their produce, the things they have to put in, their input costs 
into their crops and whatever, are going to increase because of 
the CPP premium increase.  It is going to add to all of their 
costs, as it will for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering if he would agree that we need tax reduction, 
especially in the area of agriculture.  I know there needs to be 
improvements to infrastructure, transportation and all this but 
the tax increases, I hope he would agree, that have been 
implemented by this government are going to hit agriculture very 
hard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the 
question from the hon. member from Yorkton—Melville. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first question with respect to day care, what we believe in 
and obviously with the basic personal income tax exemption of 
$10,000, we believe that sufficient dollars would then come back 
into those individual's pockets who best know how to spend their 
dollars, and in fact would allow them more dollars to have day 
care for their individuals, whether it be in the home or whether 
it be in licensed day centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, back to agriculture, I could not agree more, 
particularly with the CPP.  If you are in fact a small business 
or a self-employed individual, the contributions to CPP are twice 
as much as what they would be if you had employer contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agriculturalists, farmers, obviously are going to be impacted 
quite dramatically by this.  It takes a substantial amount of 
cash out of their own personal pockets to put into a CPP plan 
which I am still not convinced, and have not been convinced by 
government, is going to be there when in fact those individuals 
are going to recover some of their investment from it in 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree, we agree, small business, personal income tax 
deductions and small business tax, regressive payroll taxes 
should be reduced, as by example in Manitoba and fortunately the 
member from Winnipeg suggests that we should be looking at 
Manitoba as being a benefactor from the federal government.  The 
fact is that Manitoba has benefited because of these types of 
reductions to regressive payroll taxes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I must say I have enjoyed this budget debate. We had a 
certain amount of finger pointing.  After all, the budget and the 
exercise that goes into it is the single most important activity 
carried out by government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did we ever get where we are now after 30 years of running 
unbalanced books basically?  The last member was pointing fingers 
at Prime Minister Trudeau's administration.  If we look back to 
that time and place, we see 14% annual increases in spending 
throughout that mandate which was what got us started.  We then 
ended up with a Conservative administration that added to the 
burden once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to wonder when we have the single most important 
activity of government and we cannot get it right.  Even though I 
have been in this place since 1993, it still astounds me that we 
ever arrived at where we are and are still paying the price. 
Whoever was the architect back then should be ashamed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two things to talk about today.  I want to talk about the 
budget in general and make some comments about the fisheries 
specifically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am still at a loss today to say anything positive about the 
budget that was brought down by the minister.  For 30 years, as I 
have already explained, Liberals and Tories abrogated their 
primary responsibility which is to prioritize government 
activities in spending in order to optimize the benefits to 
Canadians.  This obviously did not happen.  This has led to the 
taxpayer being penalized.  They paid the penalty of balancing the 
books which led to the ongoing penalty of Liberal debt costing 
Canadian families $6,000 annually to service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the only legacy.  We still have Canadian jobs and 
economic opportunities that are being stifled which is continuing 
to hamper social program spending.  Canadians have clearly stated 
what their priorities are:  pay down the debt, reduce taxes, and 
spending that is focused on things like health and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and many of my colleagues have asked the question of many of 
our constituents.  Some of my constituents want to know why I am 
asking such a common sense question.  The answer is so common 
sense that they wonder why I am asking the question.  In a sense 
I agree with them, but common sense seemed to be out the window 
for 30 years in this place.  Let us hope we never get back there 
again.  Maybe we are still there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does this budget do?  It has 100% new spending, 0% debt 
reduction and 0% tax relief.  After 30 years the government 
balanced the books on the backs of the taxpayers over the last 
several years.  In this budget it robbed those same taxpayers of 
well-deserved tax relief and debt reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just talk about the department I am most familiar with in 
this Parliament, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.  This 
was one of the most heavily cut government departments in the 
last Parliament and it is ongoing.  At the same time that costs 
are being cut in fisheries, we have a crisis of unprecedented 
proportions in the cod fishery on the east coast.  We have salmon 
disappearing on both coasts.  We have unresolved issues with 
Alaska on the west coast.  We also have a huge lack of vital 
information on many species on all three coasts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we maintain, as the minister has done, that our prime 
concern is conservation if we do not spend any money or devote 
any resources to it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee on fisheries travelled to both the east 
coast and west coast.  We have yet to go to the north coast.  We 
have heard from fishermen everywhere we have gone about the lack 
of biologists and how appalling all that is.  Yet, we seem to 
have a healthy, in terms of numbers, bureaucracy in DFO in 
Ottawa. 
However, when an entrepreneurial fisherman wants to start up a 
box crab or other new fishery, we do not have the DFO biology 
resources to assist in the feasibility study.  Everyone 
recognizes and agrees that field enforcement has been shorted in 
a major way. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1625"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When fishermen complained about the DFO it was never about the 
frontline workers who provided so much support.  The frontline 
workers were often the people who were familiar with the 
community as well as the fisheries.  They were located where the 
action was.  They tended not to be bureaucratized and were 
promoted from within the ranks.  They were effective in 
galvanizing whole communities to assist in the stewardship of the 
fishery resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the poorly thought out cutbacks, they are no longer there. 
It seems that the DFO has a leadership which cares more about 
perpetuating its own self-importance than it does about the 
people who really matter.  The department does not seem to 
realize that without fishermen to manage, it has no mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many fishermen have complained that the DFO is only interested 
in supporting large companies and does not care about the 
independent small businessman.  This government may say that it 
is more cost effective to have large companies fishing and that 
individuals do not have enough of a profit margin to make them 
viable.  However, we do not think it is up to government to make 
that kind of judgment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a person wants to try to set up a business, and if the 
government has set up certain barriers in the way of studies that 
have to be done, it is up to the government to assist those 
individuals in meeting those requirements.  It is not up to the 
government to put up more barriers and create a Chinese maze for 
approval seeking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The DFO needs a new, strong mission statement which includes all 
people.  It needs a new vision which includes empowering lower 
levels of the organization.  Many of the lower level employees 
are paranoid about making decisions because the decisions they 
have made in the past have been countermanded so many times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The DFO needs consistency and honesty at the uppermost levels 
for without this the lower levels are paralyzed.  People need 
direct leadership in order to do their jobs in an enthusiastic 
and creative fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all understand that cuts had to be made in order to fix the 
fiscal mess of this and previous governments.  What is now 
required are measures to ensure that spending is prioritized so 
we do not choke off the lifeblood of our nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard that one of the new spending initiatives of the 
Liberal government includes $40 million to something called 
strengthening communities.  I would think that hiring a few 
biologists and allowing them to do their jobs and allowing local 
fishermen to develop new fisheries would strengthen a community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For every fisherman who is allowed to fish, other jobs are 
created, such as crew and plant workers to process the fish.  The 
spin-off is wonderful and can be multiplied many times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not need only a few large corporations doing the fishing 
to make work for other people and to keep communities alive.  In 
fact, we keep hearing from fishermen that large companies can 
ruin local communities by centralizing operations and by being 
too remote from the realities of daily living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard from many groups and individuals who have attempted 
to develop entrepreneurial opportunities, often with 100% of the 
investment coming from private sources, who have been stymied and 
frustrated by their inability to find one advocate within the 
DFO, or DFO personnel question the economic viability and tell 
them how to rig their boats for new fisheries when it is the 
fishermen who should be determining viability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>DFO personnel should be worrying about fisheries management and 
biology, not boat owner viability, particularly in the pioneer 
fisheries, such as some of the offshore and outside 200 mile 
limit fisheries which are being created.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government must reset its priorities.  It must roll up its 
sleeves and do real work in determining where money should be 
spent and where it can be cut.  When you toss around figures with 
too many zeros after them, you lose your sense of reality.  This 
government has lost that sense.  When we try to talk to a 
government that has its nose up in the atmosphere where only 
millions and billions make sense, we naturally become discouraged 
and disillusioned.  How can we relate to the government?  We 
cannot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is too complacent by far.  It needs to go out and 
talk to the grassroots, those people without whom we would all be 
out of a job.  This government needs to pay back Canadian 
taxpayers by delivering debt and tax relief.  The Liberal 
campaign promise was to dedicate half the budget surplus to debt 
and tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no surplus in 1998 because the government spent it. 
There is no debt reduction forecast because the government budget 
wipes out the surplus for each of the next three years.  The 
Liberal election promise was quickly broken by a government with 
no shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am splitting my time with the member for West 
Vancouver—Sunshine Coast so I will finish now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a government cannot keep its promises in regard to the most 
important mandate it has, then why should it be trusted to keep 
any of its promises? 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity to question 
the hon. member on a very specific component of his speech.  He 
talked critically about the fact that we were spending money on 
strengthening communities.  I was quite surprised to hear him say 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the measures in the budget that my constituents were very 
pleased with was the increase from $500 to $1,000 for the tax 
exempt portion of income for volunteer firefighters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member may not be aware of it but in rural Canada, in 
communities like Bracebridge, Gravenhurst and Parry Sound, fire 
protection is provided by men and women who volunteer as 
firefighters. Without that volunteerism, without the dedication 
of those volunteers, we would not have the kind of fire 
protection and safety we have in our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is positive and important for this government to recognize 
that volunteerism by increasing the tax exemption by 100% from 
$500 to $1,000.  The recognition of those individuals is 
important.  It is critical and it strengthens our communities. 
Why is the member against assisting those men and women who are 
the volunteer firefighters in our rural communities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Madam Speaker, there is nothing quite 
like somebody putting words in your mouth.  In terms of tax 
relief measures and the kinds of measures that are quite generic, 
those are very good things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will not find a Reformer arguing that we should not 
increase basic exemptions for items such as the one mentioned by 
the member.  In terms of strengthening communities, who can argue 
against motherhood?  We want to strengthen communities. My point 
is that this government is doing things in an insensitive 
fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is hurting coastal communities in particular. 
That was my point. The government's attempts to cut costs have 
tended to take away from the field and centralize.  As a 
consequence rural and coastal communities, specifically in terms 
of the fisheries file, have been very much damaged. 
It is ongoing.

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week we are talking about light stations on the coast.  The 
light stations on the west coast are more important to many rural 
communities than are the post offices in Ontario communities for 
example.  They are much more important.  If those light stations 
were in Ontario, with as many Liberal members of Parliament as 
there are in Ontario the government would not be doing what it is 
doing to the light keepers on the B.C. coast.  That is just one 
tiny example, but the fisheries file has all kinds of them; what 
has happened to our field personnel, our enforcement personnel 
and our biologists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Entrepreneurs cannot try to get anything done when it comes to 
developing a new fishery.  There is nobody there to be their 
advocate when they talk to the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans.  This is a big item.  Thousands of jobs are going begging 
in B.C. right now in shellfish aquaculture alone because of a 
lack of people within DFO to be an advocate to either keep 
existing operations going or to allow new entrepreneurs to do 
their thing.  It is very sad. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it certainly is a pleasure to speak on this budget 
debate.  I am sure the Liberal members who had questions to ask 
of my colleague will also have some to ask me when I am finished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals took office, Canadians were paying $125 
billion a year in taxes.  After five years of the Liberal 
government in power, we are now paying $162 billion in taxes.  By 
the year 2000 we will be paying $173 billion in taxes according 
to this latest budget.  That is a $48 billion increase, $5,000 
for every taxpayer in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals took office, we were $500 billion in debt.  A 
lot of that was blamed on my colleagues from the Conservative 
Party but the Liberals were in power before them.  Between the 
Liberals and the Tories it was $500 billion.  Today one would 
think from all these great speeches on the other side that we had 
eliminated that debt.  We have a deficit that is down to zero, or 
so they say.  The debt is at $583 billion.  The Liberals have 
increased that debt in their short term in office by $83 billion. 
That is at a cost of $6,000 per year for every taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have the chequebook out again.  They get the 
deficit down to zero and they come up with $11 billion in new 
spending.  No tax relief and no debt repayment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like all other members, I was in my constituency last week going 
from community to community.  A Liberal member asked a question 
about small communities.  I was up in the Sunshine Coast in the 
area of Sechelt.  A great little business seminar was going on. 
It was business opportunities. A lot of government departments 
were there, both provincial and federal.  They were giving out 
information to small business.  A lot of small businesses had 
some great ideas which I thought we could use in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the people at that conference who was with his wife 
pulled me aside and told me about some of the things they were 
concerned about.  I asked him if he would mind writing them down 
and faxing them to me on the weekend.  I told him I would be 
speaking on the budget and I would like very much to pass his 
comments on to my colleagues in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read some of the comments that the husband and 
wife made.  These people are in their retirement age. They state: 
“Currently there is a lot of concern regarding planning for 
retirement especially for taxpayers 50 to 60 years old due to the 
uncertain changes to old age benefits.  Taxpayers in this group 
do not have the time to overhaul planning for their retirement 
which has been based on long term legislation.  Accordingly, now 
that the budget has been balanced perhaps consideration could be 
given to some other alternatives that would take into account the 
time factor that is so critical to long term planning for 
retirement”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talked about an old age pension phase-in to change the 
entitlement.  It is not a bad idea.  It is being done in other 
areas.  They talk about age 56 to 65 in the year 2000, no changes 
with benefits at 65.  People of the age 46 to 55 now in the year 
2000 will receive old age pension at 66.  People of the age 36 to 
45 in the year 2000 will receive old age pension at the age of 
67.  People now age 26 to 35 will receive old age pension at 68. 
People age 12 to 25 in the year 2000 will receive old age pension 
at 69.  Under the age of 16 in the year 2000 people will receive 
old age pension at the age of 70.  Their attitude was that this 
would scale it down and help balance the books a lot quicker than 
what the government is doing now.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were other concerns that my constituents had.  Their 
comments to me were the constant delays in implementing increased 
RRSP limits, allowing the self-employed to an expense of half 
their CPP contribution to be accorded consistent treatment with 
employed personnel.  This is a great concern of a lot of the 
senior citizens in my area and people who are self-employed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provide some relief for single income families who choose to 
have one parent at home to raise children. There are many 
responsible young parents who sacrifice much to have the mother 
stay at home to raise their children because they understand the 
importance of such a task. Our government needs to encourage this 
endeavour with appropriate measures that give consideration to 
some form of joint tax filing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consideration should be given to allow interest on RRSP loans as 
an income tax deduction restricted to perhaps the interest paid 
only in the year of contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what people are thinking when we talk to them in our 
constituencies.  They are not all that thrilled that the deficit 
is down.  They expected when they elected this government that it 
would get that deficit down.  The message was very clear.  It was 
very clear to the Conservative party.  It went from a great big 
majority to two seats in Canada. It did not take a brain surgeon 
to figure out that we should get the deficit down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has this government done for the debt?  Nothing. It has 
announced $10 billion in new spending programs. We have to look 
at those programs and ask would the average Canadian not be 
better with taxes lowered, with just a little bit more in their 
paycheque.  Let us let Canadians spend the money instead of 
forming new government programs and new bureaucracies. Let us ask 
this government what it is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk a little bit about British Columbia.  British 
Columbia has been a contributor to Canada for many years, in 
excess of what we raise in our province in taxes.  We are very 
happy to do that, to help Canada be a united country. But we ask 
what has this government done in fisheries?  My colleague our 
fisheries critic has talked about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell you that British Columbians are pretty upset with the 
treatment and the respect they get when it comes to fisheries. I 
can only hope when I see the comments about the number of people 
being fired at fisheries on the east coast that they are ready to 
swing the broom and the hatchet in British Columbia.  Let us get 
some action out there so we can get some employment in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a harbour in Squamish that this government has been 
collecting $200,000 a year in fees for as long as you can go on. 
We have asked why the government is not dredging the harbour. For 
those who are boaters, if you read the chart it says you can go 
into the Squamish harbour with no problem, that there is lots of 
depth.  Well the silt has built up.  If you were to try to go 
into that harbour in high tide right now, you would likely go 
aground and somebody could be seriously injured or even killed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have advised the ministry of that but it says there is no 
money for it. Where is the money it collected?  We know the 
government is trying to download the harbours and I have no 
disagreement with that as long as everyone does it fair and 
square.  But while we are waiting for that we should not have to 
wait to dredge a harbour that is a danger to British Columbians 
and tourists who will travel into that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look at immigration in British Columbia. What is this 
government doing in immigration?  I asked a question in committee 
last week about what it would cost to bring that department into 
the 21st century with proper equipment and the answer given was 
$100 million.  An awful lot of money, but not when you consider 
that there is $300 million being spent on welfare alone on people 
who are coming into Canada and abusing our refugee system by 
coming in from safe havens across the U.S. border and other 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the types of things British Columbians want to see 
this government do something about.  They want to look at the 
transfer payments to British Columbia. I said that we pay our 
fair share but we are suffering in health care because this 
government has cut payments in those areas. It should be doing 
more to assist and we should be getting more of our share back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The infrastructure program is a political game with this 
government.  Everyone has their applications in but it is 
amazing.  I checked with my Reform colleagues. Not very many 
infrastructure programs are being funded in the areas with Reform 
members but the minister of fisheries has funding programs and 
the provincial government has funding programs.  They are playing 
politics with the infrastructure program in British Columbia. 
British Columbians are not happy about that, no matter what their 
politics are.  That program should be equally shared among all 
British Columbians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to coast guard services, we are not getting our fair 
share. 
I see Liberal members laughing.  It is not a funny matter.  One 
even sounds like a separatist.  Only my colleague in the Senate 
has ever talked about British Columbia being separatist.

to say it is a 3,000 mile flight to Ottawa but it is 35,000 miles 
back.  That is the feeling still, unfortunately, of a lot of 
British Columbians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I came to this House in 1972 and I could give some of the same 
speeches I made in 1972 right now with what the people in British 
Columbia are thinking about some of the issues as they face 
British Columbia.  We want to make sure our voice is being heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was one of the great issues in British Columbia during the 
last election.  That is why the Reform Party won the majority of 
the seats and why they won the majority of seats in Alberta, and 
why we are growing in Manitoba and Saskatchewan.  It was because 
people there knew that a grassroots party was listening to the 
people, was bringing a message to Ottawa, and oh, will this place 
be exciting after the next election when the Reform Party sweeps 
Ontario and chases a lot of those Liberals home.

fiscal policy to this House.  As he mentioned, he was elected in

not my words.  Those are the words of the Leader of the 
Opposition in the budget debate, that it has taken 15 years of 
policies, including the GST, free trade, deregulation of 
financial services, transportation and, I would add, the 
elimination of the national energy program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative government was able to reduce the deficit as a 
percentage of GDP from 8% in 1984 to 5% in 1993 and reduce 
program spending growth per year from 14% to 0% growth when the 
Conservative government left office in 1993. I think the hon. 
member should look back with some pride at his contribution at 
that time and having contributed to deficit reduction and 
policies that contributed to it and that were continued under 
this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 1970s and 1980s, we saw significant debt growth, in 
fact debt growth from zero in 1970 in Canada and in many 
industrialized countries, including the U.S.  Public opinion was 
not in favour of reduction in social spending.  Public opinion 
ran contrary to the whole notion of attacking debts and deficits 
during the late 1960s through to the early 1990s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the hon. member:  As a member of a party that 
professes to be focused on grassroots populism and on effectively 
listening to the public and responding to whatever the public 
wants, representing via a poll or whatever means that it has at 
that time, as a Reformer, if he or if his party had had access to 
the levers in the 1970s and 1980s when the public clearly did not 
want reductions in social spending and when the public clearly 
was not focused on deficit reduction, would he not, as a 
corollary of that argument, have focused on and supported public 
opinion at that time and would he not have perpetuated policies 
effectively representative of the public at that time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B> Madam Speaker, I should remind the hon. 
member that I was a member of the Conservative Party and left in 
1977 when there were still reasonable budgets in this country.  I 
was not part of the party when it went through the great spending 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member asks me would I have spent that money and would 
I have listened to the public.  It was not the public they were 
listening to, it was the professional spin doctors and pollsters 
that have become such a professional part of this business of 
politics for both the Liberals and the Conservatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member were to go out and listen to the public and 
watch the public, he would understand why in western Canada there 
really is not any Conservative Party any more. 
They stopped listening to the people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can remember being at meetings in western Canada with members 
of the Conservative Party who were friends of mine. They would 
try and tell us that we did not understand, this is the way we 
have to do it in Ottawa.  I told them I did not understand them 
because they were going to be kicked out of office.  That is 
exactly what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the people in this country.  We can stand up in this House 
and make all the speeches we want.  I have been in and out of 
this business a few times.  I had talk shows and radio shows in 
between.  If we are not out listening to the people we will not 
understand.  That is why there are 60 Reformers here and why 
there will be more in Ontario after the next election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Canada told the Conservative Party what they were 
doing in the years it was in office by taking the party from one 
of the largest majorities in Canadian history to the lowest 
number of seats that any major party has ever held in Canadian

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I will be sharing 
my time with the member for Vaughan—King—Aurora. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am most pleased to participate in this debate on this budget. 
My seatmate, the member for Vancouver Quadra, in his response put 
it quite appropriately when he said and I quote “On the budget 
it is a defining moment in our history”.  It is indeed a 
defining moment in our history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After almost three decades of deficit financing that clearly 
handcuffed our ability to govern in the interests of communities, 
people and the nation as a whole, we now have a balanced budget 
and have greater flexibility in making decisions in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the remarks of the members for Vancouver Island North 
and West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast earlier.  They talked about 
their concerns about dredging and some other concerns they had in 
fisheries and oceans.  I would agree.  There are concerns in that 
area.  Now that we are in a position that we are able to balance 
the budget, I would hope that they would be onside in terms of 
spending in some of those areas instead of giving tax deductions 
to the wealthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gaining this position has not been easy.  The last four budgets 
from a personal point of view have not been easy, especially in 
the region where I come from, Atlantic Canada and in rural areas. 
In getting to the position of balancing the budget, rural 
Canadians have had to share a greater part of the burden than 
people in other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have accomplished our goal.  We have a foundation which 
we can build on in the future.  I have been accused of a lot of 
things.  On this, I will clearly say that it is good to see a 
real Liberal budget again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote from Giles Gherson of the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> on 
February 25.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How better to define Liberalism for the 1990s than closing the 
widening income gap between rich and poor by giving the country's 
poorest people not just a tax cut, but help to get the training 
needed for high-skilled, high-paying jobs of the new knowledge 
economy. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What he clearly says in that statement is the direction that we 
have gone in this budget.  We have balanced the budget.  We have 
targeted more to the low income people.  It has been called an 
education budget in terms of looking at the future.  It goes in a 
very different direction than members opposite seem to want to go 
with greater and greater tax relief for the wealthy instead of 
looking at all the people of this great country.

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the general sense, this budget is an education budget with 
its emphasis on youth, education and training and a lot of 
initiatives.  I just want to list a few:  financial assistance to 
students through the Canada millennium scholarship foundation and 
the Canada study grants; support for advanced research and 
graduate students through several granting councils; helping to 
manage student debt loads through tax relief for interest on 
student loans and improvements to the Canada student loans 
program; helping Canadians to upgrade their skills through tax 
free RRSP withdrawals for lifelong learning and tax relief for 
part time students; encouraging families to save for education 
through a Canada education savings grant; supporting youth 
employment through EI premium holiday for youth employment and 
youth at risk; and, connecting Canadians to information and 
knowledge through the SchoolNet and community access programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are measures targeted at the people of tomorrow, the 
people who are going to build this country into the future. That 
is the kind of forward-looking budget and forward-leaning 
government that this government on this side of the House is. 
Such measures show foresight and are indeed building for the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my province of Prince Edward Island the increase in the cash 
floor of the CHST from $11 billion to $12.5 billion is extremely 
important.  I know others have argued that it is not enough. It 
is never enough, but the fact that we are increasing the cash 
portion of the transfer means a lot more to Prince Edward Island 
than to some of the other provinces.  Because of our smaller 
population base, just transferring tax points to Prince Edward 
Island as we have traditionally done would not be as important to 
us as is the transferring of the cash itself.  That is extremely 
important to the health care issue in the province of Prince 
Edward Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One member opposite said there was no tax relief in this budget. 
He is clearly wrong.  I believe there is $7 billion of tax 
relief over the next three years to those who need it most. That 
is the difference between Liberals and Reformers.  We are 
targeting it to those people who need it the most, not those who 
need it the least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The number of taxpayers in Prince Edward Island who are going to 
benefit from tax relief will be about 70,000 people; that is 
97.2% of taxpayers in Prince Edward Island who will benefit from 
the tax relief measures outlined in this budget.  That is good 
news. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should make some other points on tax relief in part because of 
members opposite who are trying to leave the illusion that there 
is no tax relief.  There is an additional $850 million to the 
child tax benefit program.  The child care expense deduction will 
go from $5,000 to $7,000 for children under the age of seven. 
There is the new caregiver credit.  There is the Canadian 
opportunities strategy.  I do not want to take a lot of time on 
this but the list goes on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about rural areas?  I do not mind putting on the record 
that I still have a grave concern about cost recovery and where 
it is going to lead in the long term.  I would hope that in 
future budgets and in future government initiatives that we can 
move to reduce the cost recovery measures.  I am concerned that 
cost recovery over the long term can kill the very economy that 
we are depending on for growth with the cost recovery fees, in 
particular in agriculture and fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put out a caution that I would have liked to have seen more 
done in this budget, especially in the area of cost recovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the budget working for rural Canada, we ought to 
recognize that many of Canada's most important industries, such 
as agriculture, energy, mining, forestry and fishing, are based 
in the rural communities. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These primary industries account for almost half of Canada's 
exports.  Canada's improved financial situation helps to keep 
interest rates low, encouraging small businesses, farmers, 
fishermen and others to invest in rural areas.  That is one thing 
that certainly a balanced budget will help us with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The group that will benefit most from the 1998 budget initiative 
to allow self-employed Canadians to deduct the cost of health and 
dental insurance premiums is rural Canada.  That is a very 
important initiative, especially for the farming community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 budget confirms the four year, $20 million Canadian 
rural partnership initiative.  This initiative will support 
innovative programs to help rural Canadians find community 
solutions to challenges such as maintaining good soil and water 
and charting a successful course in a rapidly changing global 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the budget has foresight.  It is balanced and it 
is leaning and looking toward building for the future in both 
rural Canada and especially among our young people.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
listening to the hon. member for Malpeque, the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, one is tempted 
to take him seriously. However, his partisanship clouds his 
thinking. According to a basic law of physics, for every action 
there is an equal and opposite reaction. In preparing his budget, 
against the revenues the Minister of Finance also wrote a list of 
expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member for Malpeque, who primarily 
represents middle-class Canadians from Prince Edward Island, to 
comment on the 10% increase provided for in this estimates for 
the Senate. 
A $45 million budget for 104 senators. This represents roughly 
$450,000 a year per senator. Given the amount of work they do in 
a year, one might say they are paid a very high hourly rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like the member for Malpeque to tell us what he 
thinks of the 12% increase in the budget for the Governor General 
of Canada and his staff. During last week's break, I asked more 
than 250 of my constituents to name the governor general and not 
one of them knew who he was. I told them he nonetheless cost them 
$12 million a year. Yet no one knew his name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like our colleague from Malpeque, who with his wife runs 
a successful dairy business, whose dairy herd has a good yield, 
why there is absolutely nothing for the farm community in this 
budget he just praised, a so-called forward-looking budget. 
What is left for agriculture after the WGTA, which provided a 
grain transportation subsidy for Quebec and the maritime 
provinces, was eliminated, after the subsidy for industrial milk 
producers was phased out over five years and after almost all 
research stations were shut down? Nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back home in PEI, he will boast about this budget for the 
future. In that sense, the mind of the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is clouded by partisanship 
because there is nothing in this budget for the middle class, 
which really needs tax relief.

by saying that it was a relationship of physics.  I was wondering 
where he was going in terms of his physics lesson in the 
beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the three last points he made including the feed 
freight assistance program, yes, they were cut in the previous 
budgets, but the fact is that we paid funds to compensate 
producers.  Now they have been able to build some additional 
industries because of the money we put into those areas including 
his home province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dairy subsidy is one of the benefits, and he knows it, of 
the supply management system in Canada.  When that subsidy was 
dropped over a period of time, farmers were still able to get a 
return on their cost of production plus a fair return on their 
labour investment.  He should look at the number of dairy 
producers in his home province of Quebec that benefit from that 
kind of scheme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of his point on research, the fact is that with our 
matching initiatives we have been able to considerably increase 
the funding going into research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member would have held meetings in his home province in 
terms of how much Canada as a nation was transferring to Quebec,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan—King—Aurora, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to have an opportunity to 
address the House on this historic occasion.  When I first came 
to the House of Commons as a member of Parliament almost 10 years 
ago, I could not have predicted that one day we would be speaking 
of a balanced federal budget.  No one could have.  At that time 
deficits had become a permanent part of our political culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I moved to Canada in the early 1970s our country never 
witnessed a balanced budget.  Deficits were the reality of my 
generation.  Younger generations grew up with them.  It is the 
reality we lived with.  This is a discouraging fact.  The deficit 
was always a dead weight around our nations leg, slowing us down, 
holding us back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deficit robbed the government of its freedom to act in the 
best interest of Canadians.  It clouded our vision and limited 
our horizons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my first term as a member of Parliament the only thing that 
was more discouraging than the existence of the deficit was the 
former government's failure to control it.  Every year at budget 
time Canadians were presented with an impressive sounding plan to 
reduce the deficit.  Then year after year after year the deficit 
would rise and our faith in the government's fiscal policies 
would fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally Canadians ran out of patience and voted for change. When 
the government took office it inherited a deficit of 
approximately $42 billion.  It was an overwhelming challenge but 
the government did not shrink from it.  From the outset the 
Minister of Finance brought forward budgets based on credible 
plans to control and reduce government spending.  By sticking to 
these plans the government was able to slowly wrestle the deficit 
to the ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance deserves our congratulations for 
succeeding in a task that has defeated many of his predecessors. 
However, let me echo what he said in his budget speech on 
February 24.  “Canadians can be very proud today.  This is their 
victory”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the government took office Canadians have been key players 
in the budget making process.  The public prebudget consultation 
introduced by the government gave every citizen an opportunity to 
speak directly to the government on this issue.  Individuals and 
groups responded with enthusiasm.  They came forward with their 
proposals for what should be in the federal budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year I participated in the prebudget consultations.  The 
finance committee held public hearings from Vancouver to St. 
John's. 
These were complemented by prebudget town hall meetings held by 
members of Parliament in communities throughout the nation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT86"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT86"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1710

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, last year's exercise was the most extensive 
prebudget consultation to date.  On behalf of the finance 
committee I would like to express our warmest and sincerest 
gratitude to the thousands of Canadians who made insightful 
contributions.  Many of their thoughts, ideas and recommendations 
were addressed very clearly and precisely in the 1998 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Canada spoke out in a loud and clear voice.  They 
told us that they want balance; not just a balanced budget but a 
balance in government policies, in its goals and in its results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has listened and it has acted.  The budget is the 
response.  The 1998 budget responds to the expectations of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider the following points.  The government has 
eliminated a deficit which has been a priority for Canadians for 
many years.  It has put in place a mechanism to start paying down 
the debt, which many have identified as the next challenge that 
government must attack.  The government has taken some major 
steps toward tax relief.  It has invested funds in certain key 
areas guaranteed to secure the maximum advantage for the 
resources available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget is a turning point.  This is the year we stop 
borrowing from our children.  This is the year we start giving 
them something back.  Instead of mortgaging their future we are 
now helping them to build their future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the Canadian opportunities strategy we are introducing a 
comprehensive approach which will ensure that all Canadians have 
access to an education.  This is the cornerstone of our 
government's commitment to ensuring the future prosperity of this 
great nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us make no mistake.  Getting an education is crucial.  It 
will decide whether young Canadians will work as active players 
in the knowledge economy or they will be pushed to the sidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian opportunities strategy is the key to a bright and 
rewarding future.  It includes measures to help those who are 
currently students, graduates coping with student loans, the 
worker seeking to renew his or her skills, parents and 
grandparents saving to pay for students' education, 
post-graduates and others working in scientific and medical 
research, young people facing challenges in joining the 
workforce, and children in communities trying to gain access to 
the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am personally very pleased to see the emphasis that has been 
placed on helping Canada's youth.  It is tangible evidence of our 
commitment to Canada's future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget contains other strategic targeted investments.  For 
example, to help families with child care expenses the budget 
proposes to increase the limit on the child care expense 
deduction.  For Canadians providing care for the elderly or 
disabled family members the budget proposes a new caregiver 
credit which will reduce federal taxes by up to $400. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Self-employed Canadians, owners and operators of small 
businesses will now be able to deduct premiums for health and 
dental insurance against their business income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time the government is moving forward in key areas. 
During last year's prebudget consultation Canadians told us that 
they support a measured approach to tax relief.  They understood 
that as we enter a new era of balanced budgets no steps should be 
taken which might jeopardize the hard won victory over the 
deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the vast majority of people who participated in the 
consultations agreed that in the initial stages tax relief 
measures should focus on Canadians in greatest need.  That is 
what we have done.  The government has taken measures to increase 
the basic income tax exemption.  They will mean that 400,000 low 
income Canadians will no longer have to pay taxes.  Another 4.6 
million people will see their taxes drop as a result of these 
changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget also eliminates the 3% general surtax in its entirety 
for individuals with incomes up to $50,000.  The general surtax 
will also be reduced for those with incomes between $50,000 and 
about $65,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taken together, these tax relief measures will amount to a 
saving of approximately $7 billion for Canadians over the next 
three years.  In all, 14 million low and middle income Canadians, 
90% of all taxpayers, will benefit. 
This is only the first step.  In the years ahead as resources 
permit, the government is committed to extending tax relief to 
other Canadians.

<A HREF="#LINKT86"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the budget addresses a third concern shared by a large 
number of Canadians:  reducing the national debt. In the years 
ahead the government will continue to include a $3 billion 
contingency reserve in its budgets to prepare for unforeseen 
developments.  If as was the case in recent years that reserve is 
not needed, it will go directly to paying down the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, our government will continue paying down its 
market debt, the funds it has to borrow on financial markets. 
Already this year the government has paid down almost $13 billion 
of this debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons and many more, it is fair to describe this 
budget as an historic budget.  Not only does a balanced budget 
represent something no other government has accomplished in 30 
years, more importantly, it was done without destroying Canada's 
social safety net. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That has been the genius of the government's budgets.  They have 
always combined fiscal responsibility with social responsibility. 
By doing so the government has ensured that Canadians will leave 
future generations with the legacy of expanding opportunities 
rather than one of high taxes and escalating debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question in my mind that Canadians believe that 
tomorrow will be better than today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
heard the member opposite say that this budget focused on 
Canadians in greatest need and that the prebudget consultations 
were extensive. He also mentioned that all Canadians will have 
access to post-secondary education.  I really disagree with those 
statements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the prebudget hearings that were held in Vancouver, 
where I come from.  I can say that the people at those hearings 
had serious and sharp disagreements with the priorities of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member said that the budget has been brought forward 
without destroying the social safety net.  I would suggest that 
the evidence shows that the social safety net has already been 
destroyed by the Liberal government and the billions of dollars 
that have been taken out of the transfers to provincial 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask one question on education.  The member says that 
there will be access for all Canadians.  We have heard that the 
millennium fund and the $2.5 billion that has been provided will 
assist only 7% of students in this country.  That is certainly 
not access for all to post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The child tax benefit that the Liberals have made so much about 
has not been indexed for inflation.  It will not begin until 
1999.  And it will amount to a measly 80 cents a day for poor 
kids in poor families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member to explain to the people of Canada 
how he believes this budget is helping those who are most in 
need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua:</B>  Madam Speaker, as a member of 
Parliament I have travelled extensively throughout the country, 
not only as a member of the finance committee but also during the 
years when we were dealing with social security review.  Many of 
the measures that have been announced in this budget actually 
address the concern cited by Canadians may I say from coast to 
coast to coast in relationship to key areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do want to go back to the issue raised in reference to the 
Canadian opportunities strategy.  There is no question that it 
does include measures that will benefit those who are currently 
students, graduates who are coping with student loans and workers 
who are trying to upgrade their skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also there is the registered education savings plan and the 
greater flexibility therein and the government's contribution to 
postgraduate students who are working in scientific and medical 
research.  The hon. member ought to say that we are investing 
precisely in the areas she has stated.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say with a great deal of certainty that in many quarters 
this budget is being dubbed at times as the education budget, as 
a budget that speaks to the development of human resources in our 
country.  When we look at the amount of funding that has been 
directed toward those areas, the member must admit that students 
are much better off today than they were prior to the budget.  We 
have to have a sense of fairness in addressing this particular 
budget as it relates to the quality of life that students will 
have as a result of the measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can honestly say it addresses some of the concerns I had many 
years ago when I was sitting in the opposition benches about the 
various cuts the then Conservative government was imposing on 
youth programs.  I am really glad to see that the government has 
highlighted youth as a major issue that we need to make great 
investments in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the question of transfers to the provinces, the hon. member 
knows that we raised the floor to $12.5 billion, as much as the 
national forum on health said that we should.  We followed up on 
that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo—Alberni, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I will be splitting my time with my colleague from Calgary—Nose 
Hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gives me great pleasure to speak on this budget.  As 
environment and Senate critic for the official opposition, I will 
be addressing both of those issues in turn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the new spending initiatives outlined in the budget 
includes new spending for climate change. Before 1997 the 
Liberals spent over $100 million in direct funding each year to 
address climate change.  The last budget provided an additional 
$20 million per year over the next three years.  We are now up to 
$120 million.  This budget provides another $50 million per year 
over the next three years, bringing the budget for climate change 
up to $170 million a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is muddling through on this issue. First, it 
fails to address the real agreement.  It knew that this issue was 
coming down the pipe.  It had been coming for many years.  Yet 
this government failed during Kyoto.  It had the opportunity to 
set up consultations beforehand to go to Kyoto as other countries 
did with a plan in mind.  It failed to do that. The government 
failed to do its homework and show Canadians the various 
implications of the targets that it was about to sign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces have to be onside for any global agreement on 
climate change within Canada.  What did our government do?  It 
consulted with the provinces beforehand and then immediately 
dismissed the provinces and settled for a level that was 6% more 
stringent than the provinces had agreed to.  It is the provinces 
that are going to have to implement this deal.  What a nifty way 
to start out on a deal; alienate one of the partners you are 
trying to work with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To show where we are, the government agreed to levels 6% lower 
than the 1990 levels for climate change.  Picture where we are 
now.  We are already 13% above the 1990 levels. 
Now the government says we are going to go 6% below that target 
in the next 10 or 12 years.  Collectively 13% plus 6%, we have to 
change 19% over the next 10 or 12 years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not fearmongering, but to give people an idea of what 
that 19% means, to reach those levels we could take all Canadian 
light cars and trucks off the road.  I do not think we want to do 
that.  Or we could remove 90% of the commercial trucks and air, 
marine and rail transportation.  Or we could eliminate the 
heating in all of our homes, all of our commercial buildings and 
all natural gas distribution. Or we could shut down 
three-quarters of our fossil fuel power generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the level this government agreed to in Kyoto. The 
problem is how we are going to get there.  There is no plan. This 
government has not put forward a plan.  Look at the players.  It 
is every Canadian.  It is the provinces.  It is industry.  It is 
all of us combined, yet there is no plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throw $170 million at it.  That is the answer.  That simply will 
not wash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of consulting Canadians on the implications of the deal 
and working together to find common ground to develop a strategy, 
this government has a half-baked idea of getting 26 Order of 
Canada members together so that they can express their feelings. 
That is going to get us a long way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the plan?  That is the bottom line.  I would hope that 
with the $170 million we will see a plan from this government 
over the next few months.  Then both sides of this House can see 
where we are going with it, work with the provinces, work with 
all Canadians so that we can solve this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I have the opportunity I would also like to touch on 
endangered species.  Bill C-65 on endangered species died on the 
order paper at the last election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were a number of concerns with that legislation.  I have 
had meetings with various provincial environment ministers, and 
industry and environmental groups. I would hope that the minister 
is doing the same thing. The legislation was so flawed that even 
many Liberals on the other side of the House would not have been 
able to vote for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope those concerns will be addressed in a new bill dealing 
with endangered species that would come forward probably at the 
earliest next fall. We all want to work together to have good 
endangered species legislation which protects the species but 
also works well for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the major flaws with Bill C-65 was the lack of private 
property rights.  There has to be a mechanism to deal with 
private property rights. There has to be a compensation mechanism 
so that if people have something on their land they are not 
basically thrown off their land, they can be compensated and move 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another issue which comes very much to the fore.  It 
has come from a number of groups I have met with.  The 
legislation has to be at arm's length from politicians.  We 
cannot get at it. The example I will use comes from the last 
election when the cod fishery was opened up on the east coast 
just before the election.  It was an issue that was just there to 
catch votes. Any endangered species legislation has to be at 
arm's length so that we as politicians cannot do that.  I am not 
sure what the mechanism is but there has to be a mechanism that 
allows a relationship so that any political party cannot get at 
it to play with or manipulate the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There also has to be clear federal-provincial guidelines.  The 
old legislation basically went into provincial jurisdiction. This 
was a major problem with most of the provinces.  With the 
citizen's right to sue, this was a concern where third parties 
had the ability to sue. There were major concerns with the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope legislation that is possibly going to be introduced 
in the fall will address these issues and that it will be 
legislation we can all support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally in my portfolio I deal with the Senate. 
Some members opposite may say that is the other house and we 
cannot deal with it.  There is one way we can.  Our very first 
vote, vote one of the estimates is the Senate.  It is the Senate 
appropriation.  It is the Senate's money.  This year the Senate 
has asked for $44,691,000 which is $4 million more than it had 
last year, a 10% raise.  I would challenge anyone to look at the 
budget and justify why other departments would require a 10% 
increase.  I do not think they do.  A few departments would have 
that. I am not on a witch hunt.  I am simply looking for 
accountability.

this House passed a resolution to send a letter to the Senate

House of Commons to explain its expenses.  The Senate refused to 
do that.  We have another House that is unaccountable.  That is 
the point we should be dealing with. We appropriate the Senate's 
funds so we should have the ability to scrutinize the Senate's 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope this government in its budget will not only just throw 
money at issues like climate change, I hope it will involve 
Canadians and the provinces, and that we have legislation we 
could all support at the end of the day. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to add some comments on the 
budget.  As the official opposition's social policy critic I look 
at the budget in terms of how it will affect average individual 
Canadians and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, our federal government has lived on borrowed 
money every single year for the last 30 years.  I ask Canadians 
watching this debate did you as a regular Canadian run your 
family finances that way?  Did you borrow more and more money 
every single year for the last 30 years?  What if you had done 
that?  What shape would you be in now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is about the shape our federal government is in after its 
members have been such poor stewards and fiscal managers.  Now we 
have a federal debt of $583 billion.  That is a mortgage on our 
children.  Every single year they have to pay interest on that 
debt.  That is money they will not have to look after their own 
security. If we add provincial debts, even though five provinces 
have balanced their budgets in years past, the total debt of 
Canadians is $900 billion.  Because of that each Canadian family 
of four owes $77,000 on the federal debt alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask Canadians, suppose the federal government took out a 
$77,000 mortgage on your house and expected you to make the 
monthly payments.  That is exactly what has been done.  Annual 
interest payments of $45 billion are made every year by Canadians 
on the federal mortgage.  The average family of four pays $6,000 
each and every year as its share of interest on the national 
debt.  That has to come out of taxes.  There is no money growing 
on trees yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask Canadians watching this debate what you and your family 
could do with an extra $6,000 every single year.  Nearly 
one-third of total government spending goes down the drain to pay 
interest.  That would be enough to pay for the total federal 
government support for all our important social services, for 
health, for education, for welfare, for equalization and for old 
age security. 
That is how much money we give to our lenders every year just in 
interest payments.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because we have to pay so much each and every year in interest 
on our monstrous national mortgage this is what has happened to 
the transfers to support health care, education and welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 the government supported those important programs to the 
tune of $19.3 billion.  In 1995 it slipped to $18.6 billion.  In 
1996 it slipped to $14.9 billion.  In 1997 it slipped to $12.5 
billion.  That is what has happened to the government's support 
for the programs which it has pretended to protect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the government took office interest on the debt increased 
by $7.5 billion a year.  It is no accident that the same 
government has reduced health and social transfers to the 
provinces by $7 billion.  Interest goes up and social funding 
goes down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If an individual has a credit card balance or a bank loan they 
have to pay finance charges.  Those dollars are taken away from 
discretionary spending.  They are taken away from saving for 
emergencies.  They are taken away from the amount each of us has 
to educate our children.  They are taken away from the amount 
each of us can put away for retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same way our enormous national mortgage and the interest 
we must pay on it every year limits the social security which our 
citizens can expect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen that happen.  I have just talked about it.  We have 
seen $3.3 billion a year cut from EI benefits.  We have lost $7 
billion from the health care, education and welfare programs. 
What has that led to?  It has led to hospital closures and longer 
waiting lists.  Now the government is making a big deal about 
home care.  I guess there has to be home care because there is no 
hospital care.  Of course there is no money to fund home care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Students are facing rising tuition fees and high levels of debt. 
There is less security for families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will happen when another recession hits, as it inevitably 
will?  There is a business cycle.  This will require an increase 
in social spending.  Where will that money come from? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will happen when interest rates rise?  They are at historic 
lows.  They will not stay that way forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lower debt is the key to social security, both for us today and 
for our children and our grandchildren, but the government has no 
serious plan to tackle the mortgage which we have burdened our 
children with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only has Liberal and Tory gross mismanagement of Canada's 
fiscal house for decades imperilled the security and social 
services to protect Canadians, their insatiable grasping for more 
and more tax revenues is impoverishing our citizens. The average 
Canadian family has suffered a $3,000 drop in real income since 
the Liberals took office.  Canadian taxpayers must start paying 
taxes at under $6,500 a year of income.  It is less than $12,000 
for a family of four. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many people do we know who can live comfortably on $6,500 a 
year?  Anything they make after that the government starts taking 
out of their pocket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average Canadian family spends more on taxes, about $21,000 
a year, than on food, shelter and clothing combined, which is 
about $17,000.  Since 1961 families have spent less on shelter, 
food and clothing.  What they pay in taxes has nearly doubled 
over the same time period.  It is brutal taxation.  People are 
not able to keep enough of their own money to meet basic needs 
and yet every year the government wants more.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote from a recent study by the Vanier Institute of the 
Family: “Because expenditures on basic necessities take a larger 
share of the monthly budget for lower income families, relatively 
little room is left for other items which can be very important 
for the health and well-being of our family members”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals in their last budget made much of child poverty and 
how they were going to attack it.  Liberal budgets have caused 
child poverty.  Liberals should be hanging their head in shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same study found that families need an average of 76.8 weeks 
of employment to pay for all of their expenses.  Of course, there 
are only 52 weeks in a year.  What happens is that many families 
become dependent on various income security programs to survive. 
Inflation and increasing tax bites are leaving even that security 
in tatters.  The value of the child tax benefit declines every 
year.  The refundable GST credit declines in value every year. 
Personal taxes payable creep up steadily every year.  These 
stealth taxes fall most heavily on the working poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government makes much of the tiny bit of tax reduction 
thrown into this budget but the facts are that over four years 
total tax relief will be $6.3 billion but bracket creep over the 
same period of time will bring in $8 billion, a net tax increase 
of $1.7 billion.  Only a Liberal could call a $1.7 billion net 
tax increase tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Families and Canadians must have tax relief.  They must have a 
sensible determined plan to get rid of this mortgage on our 
country.  Because neither of these things were done in this 
budget, I will not be supporting the budget in the vote tonight. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would like to put a question to the member for Calgary—Nose Hill 
which she may or may not want to answer.  I do not mean to pry 
but I was wondering whether she has ever had a mortgage on a 
home, her own home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the good fortune of owning a home in Canada.  When I 
bought my first home in the late 1970s I had a mortgage of 
$50,000.  Frankly, I thought I would have to declare personal 
bankruptcy within the first or second month.  However, in another 
six months to a year I looked at my mortgage and it was suddenly 
fairly manageable.  I had not become obsessed with the mortgage 
and life went on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to treat the member's remarks about dealing with 
the debt facetiously.  I am all for dealing with the debt, but I 
think there is a danger of becoming obsessed with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member would answer my question, although I 
would understand if she declined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Madam Speaker, the mortgage on our 
country is not backed up by any asset.  The mortgage on our 
country is simply and solely money that our children owe.  We 
have a situation where we have consumed $583 billion that we did 
not pay for.  Now we are simply loading it on our children's 
credit cards and telling them to pay the interest every year and 
maybe sometime somebody will get around to paying down the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this member to suggest this is in any way analogous to 
buying a house shows how very little the Liberals understand the 
terrible injustice that has been done to our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would just point out to Canadians watching this debate that 
this is the kind of frivolity with which the Liberals treat the 
mortgage that has been put on our children's future.  It is not 
backed up by any asset and not fairly incurred. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, there are two points that I would like to make to 
the hon. member. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1745"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT93"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT93"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1745

<A HREF="#LINKT92"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, she talks about taxpayers.  She is right to talk 
about taxpayers.  They are an important part of Canada.  In fact, 
there was $7 billion worth of tax relief in this budget. What 
this member and what her party do not talk about are those 
Canadians who are not taxpayers:  the disabled who are unable to 
work; seniors who are living in poverty; Canadians who are unable 
to find work for whatever reason.  Those 10 million plus 
Canadians in this society who are not taxpayers deserve the 
interest of this government as much as Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, and I will be very brief here, it was interesting that 
the member, in talking about transfers to the provinces, failed 
to bring up the fact of equalization and the fact that 
equalization payments have actually increased. Do you know why I 
think she may not have brought it up?  Because her party's 
platform in the last election called for the absolute gutting of 
these transfer payments, of these equalization payments, so that 
our poorer provinces, the provinces where access to basic 
services are important and need the support of equalization, 
would be disadvantaged.  That party would simply do away with it. 
So I ask the question:  Why would she not talk about 
equalization payments and her party's determination to gut them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Madam Speaker, the Liberal member 
opposite has a lot of nerve to talk about gutting when this is a 
party that has cut $7 billion from support for health care and 
education.  That is gutting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have done in our program is to say that equalization 
must go to the poorest provinces. Remember, equalization does not 
come from the federal government. It goes from have provinces to 
have not provinces. It has nothing to do with federal government 
spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about what this government has done for seniors and 
the unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I am afraid the time 
has expired. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to share my time with the member for Ahuntsic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess the member opposite has had a mortgage and is still 
alive and well and unfortunately she missed the point of my 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased and honoured to be part of a very historic 
moment because our federal government budget will be balanced for 
the first time in almost 30 years.  We have achieved this with 
balance and with determination.  We have not been slashing and 
burning.  We have been listening to Canadians.  This balanced 
budget could not have been achieved without the support and with 
sacrifices from many Canadians. The effort has been worth it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A balanced budget means no new borrowing by the Government of 
Canada.  We can now begin to pay down our public debts.  We can 
reduce the tax burden of Canadians and we can make important and 
strategic investments in our health care system and in providing 
Canadians with access to the knowledge and skills that will be 
necessary for the jobs of the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our federal budget will be balanced for 1998, 1999 and 2000. 
This is the first time in almost 50 years that the federal 
government will have balanced its books for three years in a row. 
That is why I am pleased to be part of this historic moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some, including members of the official opposition, call for 
more departmental and program budget cuts.   Certainly there will 
always be room to increase efficiencies and make sure that 
programs are still relevant. 
I would like to highlight that by the end of the year 2000 
federal program spending in relation to GDP or the size of our 
Canadian economy will be at the lowest level in 50 years.  That 
is quite an achievement.  Over the next two years the percentage 
of our federal debt in relation to the GDP, the size of our 
Canadian economy, will drop from 72% to 63%.  It will decline 
very quickly in the years following.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have started the very important process of paying down the 
public debt and we will continue to do so.  As my colleague 
pointed out, so far this year $13 billion of market debt has 
already been paid down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this budget the Minister of Finance is providing $7 billion 
in tax relief to Canadians.  When members opposite say there is 
no tax relief, please, there is $7 billion in tax relief. In 
terms of new spending initiatives, 80% of our new spending 
initiatives reflect two of the highest priorities of Canadians, 
access to knowledge and skills and increased funding for health 
and education through increased transfers to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key to jobs and growth in the years ahead is knowledge and 
skills.  The Canadian opportunities strategy will help prepare 
Canadians for this rapidly changing world.  The Canadian 
opportunities strategy acts on seven fronts: one, to help 
students in financial need to cope with rising costs; two, to 
increase assistance for advanced research and graduate students; 
three, it helps individuals repaying student loans, particularly 
those in need; four, it helps Canadians upgrade their skills 
throughout their working lives; five, it helps families save for 
their children's education; six, it encourages employers to hire 
young Canadians and help young people make the transition to 
work; and seven, it helps bring the benefits of information 
technology into more classrooms and communities across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very important component of the Canadian opportunities 
strategy is a Canada millennium scholarship foundation.  Canada 
millennium scholarships will be awarded to more than 100,000 full 
and part time students each year over the next 10 years.  This 
initiative will level the playing field or begin to level the 
playing field for low and middle income individuals who 
demonstrate academic merit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very pleased also to see more support for research in 
Canada.  The increased funding to three granting councils will 
complement very well the $800 million Canada foundation for 
innovation which our government launched last year.  As a nation, 
we must invest increasingly in both the public and the private 
sectors in research, development and in our people.  Our federal 
government, as the fiscal capacity permits, is demonstrating this 
commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many conscientious students in my riding come to my office with 
problems paying off their students loans, so I am very pleased to 
see the improvements in the Canada student loans program that 
were announced in this budget.  These measures include income tax 
relief for interest charges on student loans and the extension of 
loan repayment periods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changes to RRSP provisions, the new Canada education savings 
grant and an increase in the limits of contributions to the 
registered education savings plans will provide greater 
opportunities for adults to participate in lifelong learning and 
for them to save for their children's future education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget allocates a further $850 million to enrich the 
Canada child tax benefit, a further investment in the future of 
our children.  When children are deprived of the opportunity to 
reach their full potential, we as a country are deprived of our 
full potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are concerned about the state of our national health 
care system.  This budget confirms an increase in the cash floor 
of the Canada health and social transfer from $11 billion 
annually to $12.5 billion annually.  This amount responds 
directly to the recommendations of the national forum on health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to this annual cash contribution, our federal 
government will pour over $13.5 billion in 1998-99 into 
provincial coffers in tax points for health and social programs. 
This is totally different from the equalization transfers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been much misinformation about the impact of federal 
transfer payment reductions to the province of Ontario over the 
last few years.  I would like to clarify that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When fully implemented, Mike Harris' 30% tax cut scheme will 
reduce provincial revenues by $4.8 billion per year, money that 
could have been used to balance the budget or fund health care. 
It is more than five times as much as the $850 million that 
federal transfer restraint will have cost the province by the 
year 1998-99.  Let us put things in the proper perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Ontario has made some choices as we have and we 
have not sacrificed important social programs for tax cuts. 
General tax cuts will come when we can afford them as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget begins the process of tax reductions as I said, and 
I am confident that more tax reductions will follow.  We have 
heard much recently about the so-called brain drain.  Some would 
call it the brain trade, but I think it is clear that we need to 
pay attention to differential tax policies in the United States 
and Canada as it affects individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United States, for example, tax policies encourage 
employees to own shares in their own company.  Tax policies also 
encourage employers to set up employee share ownership plans. 
The results are significant.  Increased productivity, more 
employment, greater job satisfaction and many other benefits.  I 
believe we should be moving aggressively in these areas as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the overall equation, we need to understand and accept the 
fact that individuals moving to the United States are often 
making a lifestyle choice.  I quote from the Toronto <I>Globe and 
Mail</I> recently from a professional who moved to the United 
States and then moved back to Canada after some years in the 
United States.  The article is entitled Back from the Brain 
Drain.  He said: “I doubt that there are substantial tax gains 
to be made for the average young professional if he had to pay 
the real cost of health care and relocation.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not from a right wing think tank.  This is not theory. 
This is from a Canadian who went to the United States and has 
come back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other positive provisions in this budget which we 
cannot really outline here in any detail. We have heard about 
many of them from my colleagues.  Not too many of the other 
members opposite have mentioned them but there is health care, 
child care expenses, people with infirmities, with disabilities, 
self-employed individuals, the voluntary sector and a host of 
other very positive provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To sum up, this budget has balance.  It is the Liberal way but I 
would ask all in this House to celebrate this historic moment and 
agree among parliamentarians that we will work together to 
build a stronger future for all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have a very simple question for this member.  I have 
asked this question previously but really did not get an answer. 
One of the things that the government has done in its budget is 
give a tax break to parents who use child care outside of the 
home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel this is totally unfair and unjust.  The member talks 
about balance.  There is no balance here.  Does he not agree that 
parents giving care to their children in the home provide just as 
valuable a service to society as anyone else and should be 
afforded the same tax considerations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is going to have a very negative effect on the family to have 
parents subsidize other parents who use child care outside of the 
home.  Those parents that make that choice, I believe, should be 
afforded the same privileges as those that use child care at 
home.  Would he agree? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the question the member 
poses I think raises some fundamental questions about the imputed 
value of a number of different services that are provided by 
members of the family.  For example, we have questions about the 
value of services that housewives provide.  Is there imputed 
benefit to that that should be considered in the overall tax 
system?  As far as caregiving in the home, I think it is sort of 
tied up in that question.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an issue I think we need to consider but in fairness there 
is a cost to making moves with respect to those provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has ramifications throughout the whole tax system.  I think

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
listened attentively to the comments by the government member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is about transfer payments.  Listening to the 
comments by the Liberal member, he seems to be praising the 
government for this budget. In reality, seven of the ten 
provinces will lose money with this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my province of New Brunswick, the health system is deplorable. 
I myself was at a hospital in my region this past weekend, and I 
saw beds out in the halls; people were waiting for operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member says it is a good budget.  New Brunswick will 
lose another $11 million by the year 2001 or 2002. That is $11 
million, Mr. Speaker. 
Seven provinces out of ten will lose money.  Quebec will lose 
$333 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Liberal member believe that his government is right to 
continue to make cuts, or should it not put its finger on the 
problem and put an immediate end to the cuts in transfers to the 
provinces affecting the health system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
hon. member from New Brunswick for his question. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the federal government dealt with our budgetary deficit it 
was unrealistic to expect we could not deal with federal 
transfers.  We had to deal with federal transfers which comprise 
20% to 25% of the total budget of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We gave the provinces the lead time required.  We told them that 
some modest adjustments were coming and we gave them time to 
prepare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to New Brunswick, the figures the member opposite 
is quoting may be slightly out of context.  If we look at the 
federal government transfers to New Brunswick, from the year 
1993-94 to 1998-99, including equalization and the Canada health 
and social transfer, it has actually gone up, although not by a 
large amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998-99 transfers to New Brunswick will exceed $1.5 billion. 
They will account for about 34% of New Brunswick's estimated 
revenues and they are expected to total about $2,000 per person, 
which is more than 75% above the national average. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to New Brunswick I think our government has been 
very fair and the equity is obvious.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am very proud to rise in the House in support of our government's 
outstanding achievement in bringing Canada back to economic 
prosperity. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, the Liberal Party received a very clear mandate from 
Canadians: that the government's finances must be put in order. 
Now, more than a year before the target date, we have kept our 
word and fulfilled our promises.  Canadians had sufficient 
confidence in our ability in this area to give us a second 
mandate to keep up the good work. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January 1994 the deficit was $42 billion.  The unemployment 
rate was higher than ever and our debtload had jeopardized the 
future of our social programs, health programs and most of all 
our children's futures, my two daughters' futures. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1805"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Five years ago I was very concerned about my daughter's future. 
The country was in a financial and political crisis.  But since 
the Liberals took office over five years ago, more than one 
million jobs have been created, the unemployment rate has dropped 
steadily down to 8.9% in January.  Now Canada is the first G-7 
country to reach its target of a balanced budget.  With a growth 
rate of three and a half per cent in 1998 we will be leading the 
group of most industrialized countries according to the OECD.  So 
I have good news to tell my two daughters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this budget Canadians regained the liberty to choose their 
future and what they want for their country.  We can set our 
priorities, we can invest in our children and young people, we 
can create an optimal environment for economic and social 
prosperity while at the same time pursuing our goal to reduce our 
debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what is being said by the official opposition we are 
not putting aside our concern for the debt.  We are putting money 
aside to take care of the debt.  The 50:50 formula proposed 
during the last election campaign and reaffirmed in the Speech 
from the Throne is a well balanced approach allowing us to invest 
in the future while assuring our financial stability. In other 
words we are beginning to build a house from the foundation up 
and not the other way around according to some of the opposition 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be fiscally responsible while ensuring all citizens have 
access to high quality health and social services while fighting 
against social exclusion and creating optimal conditions for 
growth is what this government is offering to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members of this House would have us believe that the 
government should not invest in our future, that it should 
concentrate solely on debt reduction.  We believe the quickest 
way to reduce our debt is to have a growing economy and therefore 
to invest in job creation and most of all in education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the government has a role to play in providing the 
tools to facilitate growth and this is exactly what this budget 
is doing. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Ahuntsic for example, investments made by the 
federal government in the transition job fund enabled several 
textile companies to update their equipment and hire more 
employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to federal grants, Tricot Giorgio, Tricot Terrytex and 
Christina Canada were able to buy new state-of-the-art equipment 
and export their products to new markets. This initiative has 
generated 366 new jobs in my riding of Ahuntsic since September. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This goes to show the emphasis placed by this government on job 
creation and the development of a vital economy for my city, 
Montreal, my province, Quebec, and my country, Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and many of my colleagues believe that education should be a 
priority for any government.  As we all know, education is a 
priority for this government.  By investing in education the 
government is showing its clear commitment toward the future of 
our youth and our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My parents believed in education.  They sacrificed their own 
future in order that I would have a better future by coming to 
Canada.  They truly believed, and thanks to them today I can say 
education is the reason I sit in this House.  As the mother of 
two young daughters I also place a high premium on education. 
When I have occasion I encourage all the young people in my 
riding to continue their studies. I believe this is what the 
budget does.  It encourages young people to stay in school and to 
get a good education in order to have a better future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian opportunities strategy will provide Canadians, 
especially young Canadians, with greater opportunities to prosper 
in the new knowledge based economy.  I believe the federal 
government has a responsibility to prepare our youth for the 21st 
century. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Establishing the Canadian millennium scholarship foundation, to 
support young people who wish to pursue post-secondary studies, 
fits in with this. Through an initial endowment of $2.5 million, 
the foundation will provide scholarships to over 100,000 part 
time and full time Canadian students, and this will be done in 
partnership with the provinces and the various stakeholders in 
the education community. This is the most important investment 
ever made by a Canadian government in support of the education of 
our youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some criticize this initiative, as if the federal government 
were trying to take the place of the provinces in the field of 
education. 
No one, however, has questioned the fact that the provinces are 
responsible for programs and their contents, as well as 
administering educational institutions.

<A HREF="#LINKT97"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the contrary, I believe the creation of an independent 
foundation designed to better position Canadians on the labour 
market will benefit the provinces. In order to avoid any 
unnecessary duplication, the administration of the fund and the 
allocation criteria for scholarships will be decided upon in 
partnership with the provinces, through an organization at arm's 
length from the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Faced with the challenges of the new millennium, governments 
have a duty to work together. However, we know that the Quebec 
separatist government does not really intend to co-operate. That 
might show that Canada works, that Canada is a good place and 
that Quebeckers should remain in Canada. 
I feel it would be unfair to penalize thousands of young people 
from Quebec and elsewhere in the country simply because of the 
illusions of the separatist leaders. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A well educated labour force creates employment.  The youth 
employment strategy announced in 1997 to help young Canadians in 
gaining experience in the workplace has been renewed.  This is 
extremely important for young Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Ahuntsic 51 organizations and private enterprise 
used federal funds to hire 81 young people last summer. Hopefully 
they will hire more because we have increased funding in that 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to these programs, young Canadians are able to find a 
crucial first job that bridges the gap between school and work. 
Also, this budget supports youth employment by more than doubling 
funding for youth at risk, principally those who have not 
completed high school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had occasion to work on three such projects since I was 
elected to this House.  I can say that the young people who 
finished those projects felt it was one of the best experiences 
they had.  Three of them returned to school, and they were street 
kids to begin with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another measure that encourages youth employment is the 
employment insurance premium holiday provided to employers for 
additional Canadians age 18 to 24 hired in 1999 and 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These initiatives will make it easier for young Canadians to 
integrate into the work force.  Yes, with the Canadian 
opportunities strategy this government is clearly showing its 
commitment toward the future, a future firmly anchored in the 
social values of this country and in liberalism and our Liberal 
values also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is very recognizant, despite what the opposition 
members would have people believe, of the sacrifices of all 
Canadians.  With Canadians' support and good Liberal management 
we now have a balanced budget which allows the government to 
reduce taxes without affecting our social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe tax relief must be targeted to support Canadians' 
priorities and to those who most need it.  In fact, my 
constituents told me so.  I polled my constituents and the 
majority of them asked that there be some tax relief for those in 
the most need in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the 1998 budget is proposing by delivering $7 
billion of tax relief over the next three years to middle and low 
income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Starting in 1998, the basic personal exemption will increase, 
meaning 400,000 low income Canadians will no longer pay any 
federal income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, there will be $850 million which will be injected to 
increase the child tax benefit and to help working Canadians with 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government proposes to increase the limit on child care 
expense deductions from $5,000 to $7,000 for children under 7 and 
from $3,000 to $4,000 for children between 7 and 16. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 budget is in keeping with the tradition of sound 
financial and economic management initiated by this government 
when it was first elected, in 1993. This approach reflects the 
priorities of Canadians. This new budget is very significant. By 
balancing its books, the Liberal government gave back to 
Canadians the freedom to decide the future of their country. We 
can now define our priorities and invest to prepare the future of 
our children and our youth.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale—High Park, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is truly a privilege and honour to rise this evening 
to speak to the first balanced budget since 1970. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the credit undoubtedly goes to the Minister of Finance and 
the Prime Minister for their vision and leadership, primarily 
first and foremost it must go to all Canadians.  Without the 
partnership that existed between the government and Canadians 
from coast to coast in our first mandate and our subsequent 
re-election on June 2, a balanced budget would not have been 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some other good news from the budget of 1998 is a guarantee of 
consecutive balanced budgets for 1998-99 and 1999-2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While hon. members from across the floor may disagree with 
aspects of the budget, they must accept at the outset that a 
balanced budget is a good start.  Many of my colleagues have 
talked about the wonderful aspects for education the budget gives 
our youth in retraining and the vision of the budget as an 
educational budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to concentrate in my 10 minutes on actually talking 
about the government's renewal of the arts and cultural 
industries in Canada.  I submit that the budget already sets the 
stage for dialogue about the strategic reinvestment in our arts 
and cultural industries. 
In the budget it is clear that we are again promoting Canadian 
culture.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I think some colleagues are close by and 
their conversation is coming over the system.  I wonder if we 
could just ask them to take their meeting outside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Sarmite Bulte:</B>  Mr. Speaker, three programs were 
announced by the Minister of Canadian Heritage prior to the 
release of the budget:  the additional $25 million to the Canada 
Council, an increase of $15 million in support for our publishing 
industry, and an additional $50 million to cover athletes and 
coaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most important, what I would like to talk about is the 
government's renewal of the Canada television and cable 
production fund.  This fund represents a uniquely successful 
blend of public and private funding.  It joins government and 
cable industry contributed moneys to enhance the broadcast 
presence of high quality Canadian programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year the fund supported from 19,600 full and part time jobs 
throughout Canada.  I must emphasize it was throughout Canada. 
Most of these jobs were in highly specialized skilled and were 
well paid jobs.  The direct economic spin-off benefits are in the 
range of $625 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There also exists further economic benefits to those small and 
medium size businesses that supply services as a result of this 
increase in production activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The funds objectives are clear:  to increase the quality and 
quantity of Canadian programming available to Canadians on 
television, to assist job creation and growth in all regions of 
Canada, to enhance the capacity to produce and distribute 
domestic television programs, to maintain and increase broadcast 
presence of distinct Canadian programs, and to encourage greater 
export opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fund is financed by the Department of Canadian Heritage, 
Telefilm Canada and the cable industry's former cable production 
fund.  In its first year of operation the new television and 
cable production fund has made possible a record number of 2,221 
hours of Canadian programming that reflect the dynamic increased 
talents of Canadians and reach wide audiences both at home and 
abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when Canadians watch an average of 24 hours of 
television a week we must realize that this medium is our primary 
source of entertainment, information and news. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coupled with the size and resources of the television industry 
of our neighbours to the south there exists a real danger of 
Canadians, young and old but especially our young people, our 
future, knowing more about the United States than about their own 
country, Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The renewal of the fund represents not only the government's 
commitment to Canadian television but recognizes the positive 
economic impact of Canada's arts industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A country's real strength lies in its people.  The arts and the 
culture of a people are the expressions of their heart and soul. 
It is the movies, television, music, painting, dance and theatre 
that enable Canadians to laugh, talk and cry together.  Through 
them we can express our identity, our similarities and 
differences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The production fund is a proven success, culturally and 
economically.  The government's decision to extend the program is 
recognition of that success and of the importance we attach to 
Canadian cultural expression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have a right to see and hear their own stories on 
television, the most powerful cultural medium of our time. 
Canadians deserve Canadian programming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The renewal of the Canada television and cable production fund 
will go a long way to achieve this end.  To date the fund has 
delivered more than 2,200 hours of high quality prime time 
programming from all regions in Canada.  Without funding from the 
fund, many of these projects would never reach television 
audiences in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not just good news for television.  This fund in 
particular was good news for the CBC.  The 1996 cable production 
fund brought critical new resources to CBC schedules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996-97 the fund supported independent production for CBC-SRC 
totalling $91 million and produced $218 million in overall 
program budgets. 
The fund supported independent production for CBC-SRC totalling 
some 384 hours in 1996-97 with over 300 more new hours projected 
for 1997-98.

significant enrichment of French television could not have 
happened without the fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was the establishment of quotas for access to funds 
investment and licence fee components by independent producers 
working with the CBC.  Half of the fund's moneys went to fund CBC 
programming production. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This targeted predictable funding has partially offset other 
funding cuts.  It has permitted the CBC's television services to 
pursue national cultural objectives that would not otherwise be

the arts.  One of the things the public has sometimes felt is 
that when we are investing in the arts we are only investing in 
arts organizations.  That is not true. The message we must bring 
to all Canadians is that when we invest in the arts, we are also 
investing in our economic and social well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the Canadian Conference of the Arts published a 
discussion paper “Arts in Transition Project”.  It looked at 
how and why the Canadian public should justify public sector 
funding. I would like to conclude by reading from this report.

</I></B></P><P align=left>No reasonable Canadian believes that the purpose of our health 
care system is to employ doctors.  No one complains that our 
legal system exists only to pay judges—.We value our health

benefits they make available to all Canadians who want or need 
them, whether or not specific individuals ever go to a hospital, 
take a case to court, or study at a post-secondary institution. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would challenge our arts and culture industries and the 
government to work together with the public to show once again 
that our strategic reinvestment in the arts and culture 
industries is not just to benefit the artists and arts 
organizations, but is to benefit Canadians and our economic and 
social well-being as a whole.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
feels just a little bit strange tonight after the episode that we 
have gone through over the last couple of days that I would be up 
speaking on the budget which has already been passed.  I thought 
the purpose of a debate was that hopefully you could sway 
somebody to see things your way and maybe influence them when the 
issue came to a vote, but this issue has been settled and we are 
still debating it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to participate to that extent but I find it really 
strange.  I should not get too upset or worried about it.  What I 
have seen happen in this House in the last four and a half years 
that I have been here is that most of the decisions are made 
before we start talking about them in the House of Commons. 
Unfortunately, behind closed doors a decision is made by a few 
then everybody is instructed how to vote.  That is exactly what 
happens.  They come out like little puppets and vote the way they 
are told, then it carries and the debate does not really mean 
much anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to take this opportunity to extend my gratitude to 
the taxpayers of Canada.  Although for the last month the 
Liberals across the floor have been busy patting each other on 
the back for a job well done, we all know that the balanced 
budget is due to the hard work and sacrifice of Canadians from 
coast to coast. Their sacrifice has been compounded through 
provincial hardships which no one wants to talk about in this 
House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth of the matter is that the federal government has 
forced the provincial governments to do its political dirty work 
by reducing transfer payments by up to 55% for health care and 
education.  That has put an additional strain on our already 
strapped provincial governments while the Liberal government has 
been allowed to write in black ink.  It has forced provincial 
governments into the red in an effort to balance their budgets. 
This cannot, in my view, be considered a success. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To add insult to injury, the Liberals have begun a surplus 
spending spree, which is a very good habit of theirs.  We can 
simply look at the $600 billion debt.  We know that the Liberals 
started that debt and then the Conservatives chimed in.  They 
really like to spend.  They spread our hard earned gains so thin 
that no real good will be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of giving taxpayers well deserved tax relief or reducing 
the debt, they have launched $11 billion of new spending.  Once 
again we have all sizzle and no steak from our finance minister. 
It is a classic example of short term thinking and there will be 
no long term rewards for our nation.  It is obvious the Liberals 
can only think as far ahead as the next election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big government philosophy of the 1980s has not yet left the 
Liberal Party.  We continue to see billions of tax dollars wasted 
each year in the name of political pride. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First we had the Pearson fiasco to the tune of $260 million. 
Then we had the Airbus scandal which cost us $3.4 million.  It 
was a futile but expensive effort to try to embarrass a past 
prime minister. The helicopter deal cost us $478 million in 
cancellation penalties.  Only in the Liberal Party could they 
spend twice the amount for half of the helicopters and call it a 
good deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget is clearly without a plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In presenting the 1991 budget Michael Wilson stated “We will 
establish a debt service and reduction fund solely dedicated to 
offsetting the costs of the public debt.  All revenues from the 
goods and services tax and from privatization will flow into this 
fund”.  That was a promise made back when the fabulous GST was 
brought in, which the Conservatives were going to steer directly 
toward the debt in order to get it under control.  It was a big 
joke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If nothing else, the 1991 budget had a vision.  It was not long 
after that that the Tories gave up the responsible spending fight 
and selected the easier tax and spend rhetoric, just like the 
Liberals are doing today.  We really only need two parties in the 
House, the spenders and the non-spenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition by the year 2000, Canadians will be paying $48 
billion per year more in taxes than when the Liberals were 
elected.  This increase alone is equivalent to $5,000 per 
Canadian family.  Beware Canadian families.  The day is coming. 
Taxes are going to go higher and higher.  This budget proves it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, by the year 2000 the Liberals will be collecting 
$22 billion per year in GST. That is 46% more than the year they 
were elected.  That is an awful lot of money for a tax which our 
Prime Minister promised to abolish.  He gave the nation his word. 
He was going to abolish it.  Instead it is going to draw 46% 
more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a former teacher I am deeply concerned about the young people 
of Canada.  What will the future hold for them?  This budget 
offers them little hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's millennium legacy scholarship fund and job 
training programs, such as youth service Canada, are merely 
band-aids and not solutions to the problems facing youth.  Once 
again our government is playing a public relations game with 
Canadian youth.  On the one hand there is the slash and burn 
approach to cutting education transfer payments to the provinces 
which makes the dream of a university education unattainable for 
many.  Then in a vain attempt to make itself look good, the 
government offers a select few students funding by way of 
scholarships which will not begin until the year 2000.  For the 
vast majority of desperate youth today, the millennium fund will 
be too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals' ambivalence toward children begins at an early 
age.  By expanding the child care expense deduction they have 
added to the degeneration of the Canadian family unit by 
promoting non-parental child care.  It is beyond me why the 
government does not understand that a child's parents will 
provide the best care available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our entire tax structure focuses on those who use alternative 
care.  A recent Compas research poll stated that 90% of the 
population believes a family setting is preferable to daycare 
when asked what is the best for an infant or a preschool child.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really have a tough time when I hear about a father or mother 
who wishes to stay home with the children while the other one 
works and they are not going to be able to because of this budget 
and this government.  These parents must work in order to meet 
the taxes that they are going to be obligated to pay. I truly 
believe that many of the problems with today's youth, including 
violent crime, teenage pregnancies and the intolerable dropout 
rates stem back to the government's promotion of limited home 
parental care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I came here in 1993, the Liberals said there were one 
million children in this country who were living in poverty and 
starving.  Now in 1998 I still hear the same thing from that side 
of the House. I heard a member a moment ago talking about all the 
wonderful money they are going to give to the CBC, the little 
give outs here and all the wonderful glorious things they are 
going to do.  But nobody has given any money to these children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about giving to the children's aid societies in these cities 
that are struggling to try to keep food on these kids' tables and 
clothes on their backs. When are they going to start doing 
something like that?  I guess that is not the politically popular 
thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One more group which has been neglected and which I would like 
to speak about is the seniors.  This budget has left them 
standing in the cold.  In 1996 the seniors benefit was floated as 
a trial balloon in the budget with the legislation promised for 
the fall of that year.  This proposal established a punishing 
marginal tax rate of up to 75% for middle and upper income 
seniors while providing a meagre 17 cents a day to the poorer 
seniors. Two years have passed and the finance minister has not 
found a face-saving solution to this dilemma. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform believes that changes should be made on the following 
basis.  The benefit must be better targeted to those in need. Any 
reduction in benefits must treat middle and upper income groups 
fairly.  There must be sufficient time for not yet retired people 
to make retirement plans.  For those whose birthdays cause them 
to miss the cutoff date they are being unduly penalized. 
Apparently this government feels that it is fair to ignore 
Canadians who have generously paid taxes their entire lives and 
are looking to enjoy what few years they have left. They should 
not get their hopes up because there is nothing in this budget 
that is going to make that happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next on the list of those that do not concern the Liberal 
government are the Canadian small businessmen.  It has upped the 
payroll taxes and given no tax relief to the businesses, 
especially small businesses that provide jobs.  People running 
small businesses should not get their hopes up because nothing is 
going to happen through this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the Canadian government has finally stopped 
acting like a household living beyond its means.  It may have cut 
up the credit cards but the debt remains.  Regretfully the 
Liberals' spending of our surplus on new programs is a sign that 
we will soon see a deficit again which will truly be a shame.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
take part in the debate on the budget speech, all the more so as 
it is ironically at complete odds with its title:  Building 
Canada for the 21st Century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this budget really does is provide the tools to weaken 
Canada.  It seems that a real blueprint for society should 
contain a genuine vision, and that is what this budget lacks.  It 
should also respect its partners and be attentive to the needs of 
the disadvantaged.  It is about this lack of vision, respect, 
compassion and transparency in the budget speech that I am going 
to talk to you today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After four years of fighting the deficit on the backs of the 
provinces, the unemployed and the disadvantaged, the Liberal 
government is in a hurry to get back to its old habit of 
spending.  In his budget, the Minister of Finance announced over 
$10 billion in new spending and tax cuts of $7.2 billion by 2001. 
But nowhere did he mention that his government wanted to pass an 
anti-deficit bill, the purpose of which would be to balance the 
budget.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government will once again be interfering in 
provincial areas of jurisdiction, ones that do not belong to it. 
Instead, it should be looking in its own backyard, reducing its 
own expenditures so the people of Canada and of Quebec will never 
again have to experience the situation they were thrown into of 
battling the deficit.  As we know, everyone contributed heavily 
to that effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance's audacity does not stop there, moreover. 
The Liberal party bagman, the man with the heavy responsibility 
of deciding what he will do with the surplus, is talking about a 
balanced budget.  The provinces, who got hit with 52% of federal 
cuts, are entitled to only 23% of the new expenditures. 
Individuals got hit with 37% of the federal cuts and are 
entitled to only 26% of the new expenditures. Federal spending 
was cut by only 12%, yet accounts for 51% of the new 
expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So it is easy to understand why the President of Treasury Board 
has said “When Mr. Bouchard has to cut in Quebec, we in Ottawa 
will be able to demonstrate that we are the only ones preserving 
the future of social programs”.  We can say that this greatly 
desired objective of the President of Treasury Board has been 
attained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening in the provinces?  Cuts are being made.  What 
is happening at the federal level? Money is being spent left and 
right in areas under provincial jurisdiction, without any real 
vision or strategies.  The deception has now been revealed, the 
figures are there to prove it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister talk about balance when he has reduced his 
own spending by only 9 per cent? We all know that he had promised 
cuts of over 19 per cent. Therefore, it is not the first time the 
finance minister has made vague and contradictory statements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 10, 1997, this same Minister of Finance said, and I 
quote: “I believe child poverty is the greatest political 
challenge of our time from a social point of view”. Whatever 
happened to this minister's willingness to fight poverty? Instead 
of eliminating the problem, I think he is making it worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government just gave a meagre $600 million that will be 
added to the $250 million announced in 1995 for the child tax 
benefit. This increase will not take effect until next July. The 
finance minister also announced another $425 million for July 
1999 and the same amount again for the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has been saying since 1996 that he would do something to 
fight poverty and he has not done anything yet. He is promising 
something for next July, but he is already $250 million behind. 
To be effective in our fight against poverty, we need $2 billion 
right now. Members of the Bloc deplore the present situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Minister of Finance took action to index the child tax 
benefit, 50,000 more children would be eligible for this 
benefit, children who are not eligible now because no indexation 
has been done  in a very long time. There were indeed solutions, 
but the minister did not want to listen to the solutions proposed 
by various groups. That is what Campaign 2000, a very well known 
organization in Canada, had proposed to the finance minister to 
deal with the issue of child poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the fight against poverty, the government could have tackled 
the indexation of personal income tax tables and the GST.  Once 
again, the minister failed to go after the real problem of 
poverty.  Had he done so, 840,000 low income households would 
not have paid income tax.  At the moment, because there is no 
indexation, they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are therefore specific measures that the Minister of 
Finance often neglects. He could have taken real action to fight 
poverty among adults and children, because when children are 
poor their parents are poor too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another measure the Minister of Finance neglected was a reform of 
employment insurance.  Such a reform has a negative impact on 
poverty.  The reforms that took place were hard on people 
without work.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The first report on EI reform recently obtained by the Standing 
Committee on Human Resources Development and the Status of 
Persons with Disabilities is a great disappointment.  You might 
say the Liberals are incapable of seeing the day to day reality, 
and are promising another report to evaluate the impact of these 
measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that those who cannot get employment insurance are on 
welfare.  Studies have been done in Quebec showing that 220,000 
people are on welfare.  When you are on welfare, you are not in 
the labour market.  This is where to attack the problem of 
poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means an additional 194,000 welfare cases in Quebec.  That 
means that Quebec has to pay out an additional $845 million in 
assistance to people who cannot find jobs. 
Countrywide, the figures are as follows: an additional 730,000 
welfare cases or an additional cost of $2.5 billion to the 
provinces, while the federal government saves $6 billion.  That 
will enable it to spend wildly, as it wishes, with its 
propensity for meddling in provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sum of $2.5 billion is destined for the millennium 
scholarship fund.  That is not acceptable because it does not 
deal with the problem; rather, it amounts to investing money 
without vision or strategy.  There have been cuts in Quebec. 
Canada has cut $10 billion in education, including $3 billion in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has proposed many measures for analysis by the 
Minister of Finance.  Instead of that, we get this skimpy budget. 
And who is going to pay for it in the end? 
We are paying too much in federal taxes for the strategy chosen 
by the Minister of Finance.  It is a short term and shortsighted 
strategy that ignores the demands of the various stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In education, for example, a number of people told the Minister 
of Finance that their energy was misdirected.  They were ignoring 
educational priorities.  Furthermore, a lot of people are 
dropping out of school and there is a shortage in funds for 
education because the transfers to the provinces are not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not name everyone in positions of authority in the various 
university and college administrations who want the money needed 
for education to be given to the provinces.  The students 
federation and a lot of people are disappointed at the federal 
government's attitude regarding the millennium scholarships. 
It is ignoring what is happening in the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have asked the minister to stop spending in areas of 
provincial jurisdiction, to not create any new programs and to 
give the money back to the provinces.  The administration of the 
employment insurance plan must also be changed.  There must be a 
targeted reduction in the tax burden.  Legislation must be 
passed—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to express the disappointment of my 
constituents and Canadians everywhere with this federal budget. 
It was a budget of profound disappointment for Canadians, 
particularly on the health care front.  It was a budget that was 
greeted not only with disappointment, but with disbelief from 
Canadians who really believed that this government was prepared 
to deal with the critical health care situation in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard those sentiments expressed from all parts, all 
areas in this country.  We have heard it from nurses.  We have 
heard it from doctors.  We have heard it from people in hospital 
hallways and many other Canadians.  We have even heard it from 
the Minister of Health.  Medicare is underfunded and people are 
suffering unnecessarily for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget offers no new money for medicare.  We have heard 
time and again from Liberal members suggesting that the cancelled 
cut of $1.5 billion is new money. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1940"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT107"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear, it is not.  It goes no distance at all to 
reversing the $3.5 billion that this Liberal government took out 
of health care in 1995.  There is no new money in this budget for 
health care.  There is no federal leadership in this budget. 
There is no commitment to expanding on our medicare model by 
putting money toward home care in this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not work for Canadians to continue to recycle old 
commitments and to transform foregone cuts as if they were new 
proposals and new initiatives.  It does not work to continue to 
blame the problem on the provinces although it is quite obvious 
that one cannot ignore negative developments on the provincial 
front. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This afternoon I listened very carefully to comments by the 
member for Brandon—Souris who tried on the one hand to suggest 
that the federal government had made a terrible mistake in this 
budget with respect to health care and I agree with him on that 
point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand he tried to suggest that the Conservative 
government in Manitoba had made brilliant decisions with respect 
to health care and done a great service to Canadians in that 
province.  It makes no sense to on the one hand criticize the 
federal government and then to praise the Manitoba government for 
doing precisely what has been happening here federally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On both counts we are dealing with governments which are so busy 
offloading and privatizing and deregulating in the area of health 
care that it is in fact the patients who are suffering and 
Canada's health care system that is in disarray. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that there is no longer a fiscal deficit in this 
country, but what cannot be overlooked is that there is a 
profound human deficit.  It is the result of another kind of 
deficit, a moral deficit on the part of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government does not want to reinvest in health care 
because it is afraid it will not get the credit for it as those 
funds are channelled through the provinces.  People can literally 
suffer, even die, because the Liberals may not get the credit 
they and only they feel they deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another offensive argument that is being used by the government 
to justify their continued squeeze on the health care system is 
that if they give the provinces money, it may not be used for 
health care because we have a block transfer system for health 
and social services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget who established this block transfer system. 
It was the Liberals and now the same Liberals are using it as a 
convenient excuse to starve medicare out of the billions of 
dollars it took out of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In these difficult times it is important to acknowledge how 
Canadians are struggling and trying to cope in the face of these 
continued and demoralizing cuts.  The media have also played a 
role in bringing these stories to the public's attention; 
painful, personal stories about waiting for hours in an emergency 
ward before receiving any treatment, stories about nurses working 
24 hour shifts and collapsing from exhaustion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals patted themselves on the back for this budget, 
Canadians did not let them forget the terrible cost.  We once had 
one of the finest health care systems in the world.  For decades 
our health care system provided efficient, good quality service 
for all Canadians.  Now, because of successive Conservative and 
Liberal cutbacks, we are left with a system practically in chaos 
in which people can no longer count on timely treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solution is clear.  A reinvestment in medicare is absolutely 
imperative.  Let us not turn to a private system in which the 
rich go to the front of the line and low and middle income people 
suffer and die on long waiting lists.  Let us reinvest in 
medicare so every Canadian has access to timely, good quality 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On another matter, it is clear that there is a set of issues 
that have been certainly left off this agenda for a very long 
time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard to believe from the absence of discussion on child 
care, on women's health, on violence, that in 1984 there was 
actually an all party leaders' debate on women's issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet today many of the issues that are central to the lives of 
women, that are critical for the advancement of the goal of 
equality, have been forgotten, ignored, disregarded, and are 
invisible on the agenda and in the budget.  Like pay equity, for 
example, the federal government continues to refuse to pay its 
own women workers what they are worth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On another matter, we had hoped to see in the budget a 
restoration of funds to the women's program which has been cut 
back by millions of dollars over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fair share campaign is calling for the government to spend 
$2 for every woman and girl in Canada, on organizations and 
projects that bring women and men closer to social, economic and 
legal equality.  Unfortunately the government and the Secretary 
of State for the Status of Women are silent on this matter in the 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has committed itself to analysing all policies 
and programs for any possible differential impact on women and 
men.  It begs the question where that analysis is in the 
formulation of the budget.  We want to know if this analysis was 
ever considered in terms of the budget decisions like the 
decision not to reverse the Liberal's $7 billion cut to health 
and social services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Women, as we all know, make up the majority of workers in and 
users of health care and social services.  These cuts clearly 
have a disproportionate affect on women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the budget child care expense deductions were raised.  That 
is a good step, but where is the national child care program that 
was promised and promised until the Liberals were blue in the 
face?  The 1993 red book promise of 150,000 new spaces is long 
forgotten.  What good is a child care expense deduction by itself 
for those parents whose children have been waiting on lists for 
years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want it to be known that my colleagues in the NDP caucus, in 
particular the member for Vancouver East and the member for 
Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, have launched a national campaign for 
child care on behalf of NDP participation in the women's 
committee.  We will do what we can to put pressure on the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other issues to raise, but let me conclude by 
saying that I am certainly proud to represent the people of 
Winnipeg North Centre.  It is a diverse riding made up of 
seniors, children, parents trying to make ends meet, people 
working in all sorts of jobs and professions, and people looking 
for work.  What is in the budget for them?  Not much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government plays with numbers.  It sets targets for 
inflation.  Why can it not set targets for employment, to get 
people into jobs?  There is no new spending for youth employment. 
Less than half of one per cent of unemployed youth will get a 
job as a result of the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government now has the money to do something about 
health care and unemployment and chooses not to.  That is the sad 
and unacceptable thing about the budget.  The government had a 
wonderful opportunity to deal with both fiscal issues and the 
human deficit.  It has missed this opportunity and left a 
terrible price for all Canadians to pay.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are being 
spoiled this evening.  I am pleased to speak to the budget 
speech.  Normally, the main purpose of a budget speech is to 
generate a bit of enthusiasm among people, to generate a bit of 
hope, but after a few hours, this budget has been completely torn 
to shreds.  We are going to have to live with a budget that has 
not inspired a single Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vast majority of editorial writers across the country panned 
the budget, which is completely regressive, and puts Canadians in 
an even tighter spot. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1950"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT109"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of generating hope, the budget has shown us once again 
that this government has absolutely no agenda of any sort. 
Budget-wise, this government has spent the last five years 
fixated on the deficit.  It should at least have done its 
homework, however, in preparation for introducing progressive 
measures, because it knew full well that, in the ten years 
leading up to 1984, the debt had been increased eleven-fold by the 
former Trudeau government from $18 billion to $200 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over almost the same length of time, about ten years, instead of 
multiplying the debt by 11, we multiplied it by two.  The 
operational deficit was kept under firm control during that 
period. 
But, in the meantime, we had to adopt measures that would 
subsequently enable us to wipe out the deficit and also pay down 
the debt.  We adopted measures such as free trade.  As members 
will recall, we waged an extremely strong campaign on the issue 
of free trade.  We were almost defeated on the issue, and this is 
what enabled us—and I point this out to our colleague who used to 
work in the finance and trade sector—to increase our exports from 
$90 billion to $215 billion over a seven-year period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sight must not be lost of the money this brought into Canada for 
the government.  They had promised to abolish this measure.  The 
government campaigned on a platform of abolishing free trade.  In 
the end, this government embraced free trade with a vengeance. 
Talk about an about-face.  This takes the cake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget the GST.  It was a disaster for us, the goods 
and services tax.  We knew at the time that it was the fairest 
tax.  It was the best route to take before starting on a major 
tax reform to get the richest people contributing to the 
government coffers.  Obviously, a doctor or engineer earning 
$50,000, $100,000, $150,000 or $200,000 will pay more GST than 
someone who just gets the old age pension.  That was precisely 
the objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax shelters were considerably reduced.  We knew it would not win 
us any popularity contests, but we felt in all conscience that 
when one has a country to administer, one must do so 
objectively, and with the conviction that the best interest of 
the country is being served. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our ultimate goal was a comprehensive reform 
of the tax system for individuals and small businesses. But what 
did this government do?  Absolutely nothing. They raised taxes, 
40 tax increases for a total of $30 billion, a pretty 
considerable amount, as well as several billions in cuts to 
essential services.  If we add on the considerable tax hikes and 
the cuts in transfer payments to the provinces, we have our 
answer.  The deficit was attained at the expense of the poor and 
of the individual taxpayer.  Such is the policy of the present 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could spend a couple of hours listing all of the tax increases 
the present government has slipped in.  There is nothing 
surprising that nearly all the media reports state that Ottawa 
is pocketing the savings and sticking the provinces with the 
bill.  That is how it is in all fields. 
Our fellow citizens in every province are afraid to get sick, 
because of the budget cuts, the cuts to transfer payments, made 
without consulting the provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Millennium scholarships have been created to benefit tens of 
thousands of students, while thousands of children in primary 
and secondary school no longer have even basic services.  There 
are schools that no longer have guidance counsellors, that no 
longer have psychologists.  They are trying to convince us that 
they believe in the importance of education for our young people. 
No way.  They are making drastic cuts.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When an organization like the OECD blames the shrinking of 
available income after tax and the major brain drain in this 
country on our overall tax policy, I think we should take heed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are told that our small businesses are no longer able to 
reinvest because of our extremely regressive tax system, which 
is aggressive to them, they not longer have the required net 
assets to reinvest. I think this is serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Editorial writer Alain Dubuc said “Here is why Mr. Martin is no 
longer credible”. These are not my words but those of an 
editorial writer known from coast to coast. “In March 1997, the 
minister announced that the deficit for fiscal year 1996-97, which 
was ending, would be $19 billion. 
It turned out to be $8.9 billion”. That is not a small 
miscalculation; it is a huge one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was an error of $10.1 billion. Mr. Dubuc went on to say 
“This did not stop Mr. Martin from once again announcing an 
obviously unreasonable deficit of $17 billion for 1997-98. It 
turned out to be a zero deficit. This is a $20.5 billion 
miscalculation, and Ottawa anticipated expenditures like those 
associated with the millennium fund”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To establish such a fund when most provinces, and Quebec in 
particular—we will speak for Quebec—have a very well organized 
system, for the sole purpose of ensuring that recipients will see 
that their cheques were issued by the federal government and not 
to promote harmony, again this borders on provocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two major problems in Canada. In both cases, 
provocation is involved. 
On the constitutional issue, on numerous occasions over the past 
30 years, Canadians agreed on proposals but, invariably, the 
Liberal government was responsible for one failure after another. 
Support for the sovereignist movement in Quebec has grown from 3% 
originally to 50% today. Why? Because of provocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fiscally, the federal government has yet again found a way to 
use a budget to provoke the provincial governments. That takes 
some doing. It could have said “We are for harmony and good 
understanding; there is a little money left over, we will 
transfer it to the various provincial governments; you are good 
managers, you are close to your people, you will manage these 
surpluses”. It did not even do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, it arbitrarily—fancy that—established a new $3 billion 
fund that cannot be used for another two years. 
Again, it is only to create a little interest among those 
concerned. But, in fact, these budget measures that do not favour 
decentralization and do not respect other levels of government do 
nothing but accentuate our problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only does the government base its economic intervention on 
provocation, but it travels the world singing the praise of 
economic missions. In my mind, the first economic mission that 
the government must undertake is the Canadian economic mission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the whole world, Mr. Chrétien's government is in favour of 
free trade, but not for Canada. Tariff barriers between the 
provinces cost a fortune each year. 
The time has come for businessmen from Chicoutimi, from Nova 
Scotia, from Shefford, from New Brunswick, from all regions, to 
travel across Canada with the various governments to create free 
trade within our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell you a secret. Do you know how many jobs a 10% 
increase in interprovincial trade would create? Free trade 
strictly within Canada would create 200,000 jobs. I think that if 
there is an issue that needs to be addressed, it is the issue of 
Canadian free trade. We must eliminate trade barriers between the 
provinces.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the reality the government must work on. It must stop 
provoking all the provincial governments by creating new 
programs without ever consulting them, or pretending that it is 
consulting them through committees that travel across the 
country, knowing full well that the Minister of Finance will not 
listen to them. He is not interested in that. All he wants is to 
write cheques for the millennium scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think this is the road to the future. It seems to me 
that when a party governs a country such as Canada, it must do it 
a lot more selflessly than the Liberals are doing right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased to say a few words on the budget. We should also 
have a long discussion on the growing problem of poverty in our 
country. 
People on welfare eat very poorly because of cuts in transfers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to rise in the House of Commons this evening to 
represent the people of the riding of Essex and to participate in 
this economic development debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 24 we introduced our fifth budget.  I am unsure if 
this is the most important budget in our country's recent history 
or if the distinction more rightly belongs to our government's 
first budget which set the course that allowed us to be debating 
today, for the first time in 28 years, a balanced budget and the 
economic development that results from a balanced budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing I am sure of is that our Prime Minister and our 
Minister of Finance deserve praise and thanks for restoring 
fiscal sanity to our country's books and for ensuring the future 
of Canada's children and grandchildren for years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we were first elected in 1993, the federal deficit stood at 
$42 billion.  It is sad but amazing to consider that prior to 
this budget one in three Canadians, everyone under 27 years of 
age, had never seen their federal government balance its books. 
For the 1997-98 fiscal year there will be no deficit, for the 
first time since 1970.  This historic announcement that the 
Government of Canada has recorded its first budgetary surplus in 
28 years is great news for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to extend praise and to thank all Canadians who 
helped guide this government through the difficult task of 
balancing the books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing this government did different from previous 
governments in addressing the deficit problem was to consult with 
Canadians.  I know full well from my experience as vice-chair of 
the finance committee last year on how widespread those 
consultations were and how seriously the Minister of Finance 
viewed them.  It is not just the finance committee that holds 
prebudget meetings.  Many individual members of Parliament also 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each year since being elected in 1993 I have hosted prebudget 
hearings in my riding.  Each year I am pleased with the 
articulate and well thought out presentations and how many of the 
suggestions, which come up in similar meetings across the 
country, are reflected in the budget.  I held my fourth prebudget 
consultation in the town of Essex on November 14, 1997.  I would 
like to read into the record my conclusion from that meeting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“In conclusion, the one point on which there seemed to be 
almost universal agreement was that the federal government should 
be allocating financial resources and management to training and 
to research.  Although the debt was acknowledged as a problem, it 
was not given priority over basic concerns for our social 
programs, pension plans, health care and education”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a moment and compare that statement to the 
1998 budget.  One of the themes of my meetings was the need to 
allocate financial resources and management to training and 
education.  This is certainly reflected in the 1998 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the budget the government introduced the Canadian 
opportunities strategy which builds on actions in the 1996 and 
1997 budgets and also introduces new measures.  The Canada 
millennium scholarship program is the centre of the Canadian 
opportunities strategy.  It is the single largest investment ever 
made by a federal government to support access to post-secondary 
education for all Canadians.  Through an initial endowment of 
$2.5 billion, the arm's length Canada millennium scholarship 
foundation will provide scholarships to over 100,000 students 
over 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Scholarships will go to help Canadians who need help financing 
their studies and demonstrate merit.  For full time students 
scholarships will average $3,000 a year.  Individuals can receive 
up to $15,000 over a maximum of four academic years.  The Canada 
millennium scholarships could reduce the debt load that 
recipients would otherwise face by half. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is also introducing Canada study grants.  These 
recognize that many students needs are not fully met by 
scholarships and student loans.  Beginning in 1998-99, Canada 
student grants of up to $3,000 a year will go to over 25,000 
needy students who have children or other dependents. 
These grants will help both full time and part time students and 
will cost up to $1 million annually.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we are aware, student debt has become a heavy burden for many 
Canadians.  In 1990 a graduate completing four years of 
post-secondary education faced an average debt student loan of 
$13,000.  By next year the same graduate's average debt will 
almost double to $25,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To deal with this problem, the budget proposes five things. 
First, all students will get tax relief, 17% federal credit for 
interest paid on their student loans.  Second, we are increasing 
the income threshold used to qualify for interest relief on 
Canada's due loans by 9%.  More graduates will be eligible. 
Third, we are introducing graduated interest relief which will 
extend assistance to more graduates further up the income scale. 
Fourth, for individuals who have used 30 months of interest 
relief, we will ask the lending institutions to extend the loan 
repayment period to 15 years.  Fifth, if after extending the 
repayment period to 15 years a borrower remains in financial 
difficulty, there will be an extended interest relief period. 
Finally, for the minority of graduates who still remain in 
financial difficulty after taking advantage of these relief 
measures, we will reduce their student loan principal by as much 
as almost half. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another item in terms of training that often came up at my 
prebudget hearings was that assistance needed to be targeted, not 
just toward youth and students, but also to assist individuals 
already in the workforce who needed to upgrade their skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several new measures are proposed in this budget that will 
improve Canadians' access to learning throughout their entire 
lives.  The first is tax-free RRSP withdrawals for life long 
learning.  At least six million Canadians have RRSPs with total 
assets of $200 billion.  This represents an important source of 
funds.  Beginning on January 1, 1999 Canadians will be able to 
make tax-free withdrawals from their RRSPs for life long 
learning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An individual who has an RRSP and has enrolled in full time 
training or higher education for at least three month during the 
year will be eligible.  An individual will also be able to 
withdraw up to $10,000 a year tax free over a period of four 
years to a maximum of $20,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To continue to upgrade knowledge and skills can be particularly 
hard for the growing number of Canadians studying part time and 
trying to manage the difficult balance of work, family and 
studies.  The 1998 budget proposes two measures to help them. 
Beginning in 1998 the education credit will be extended to part 
time students and, in addition, for the first time parents 
studying part time will now be able to deduct their child care 
expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian opportunities strategy also addresses the urgent 
problem of youth unemployment.  The actions we are taking will 
give young Canadians the job experience they need and provide 
support for those who have dropped out of school and face 
particularly tough challenges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the 1998 budget provides employers with an employment 
insurance premium holiday for hiring additional young Canadians 
in 1999 and the year 2000 between the ages of 18 and 24.  This 
will increase employment opportunities for youth and reduce 
payroll costs for employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, investing a further $50 million in 1998-99, $75 million 
in 1999-2000 and $100 million the year after will more than 
double fund the youth at risk who lack basic education and 
skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These programs do work. For example, there are several at work 
in my riding currently. There were four youth centres in my 
riding just last week which received $33,000 in funding to run 
programs to assist young people, to help find employment, write 
resumes and prepare for job interviews. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another comment that came up during my prebudget hearing, not 
just this year but over the last several years, was the need for 
Canada to invest in research and development.  As chair of the 
industry committee, this is a theme very close to my heart. 
Consequently, I was thrilled to see the 1998 budget provides 
additional funding of $34 million annually for the national 
research council industrial assistance program to help small and 
medium size businesses as was announced in our election campaign 
promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the budget also makes available increased funding for 
more than $400 million over three years for science research 
granting councils: the medical research council, the national 
science and engineering research council and the social science 
and humanities research council:  $120 million in 1998-99, $135 
million in 1999-2000 and $150 million in 2000-2001, providing 
invaluable service to Canada.  This will encourage our best and 
brightest to stay in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, similar to the concerns of my constituents, this budget 
has proposed a rational approach to reducing national debt, and 
to do so in a manner that does not put our social programs or 
health care or education at risk.  I know that in my home 
province the premier has claimed the opposite.

newspaper journalist, Andrew Coyne, who had little time for the 
tired old provincial complaint about transfer cuts, pointing out 
that “the total cut to federal cash transfers to the provinces 
amounted to barely over 3% of total provincial revenues, 
hardly draconian”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to outline for my constituents that 
this budget also confirms a four year, $20 million Canada rural 
partnership initiative.  It will support programs, help rural 
Canadians and communities to find and support maintaining good 
soil and water and charting a successful course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, our budget has many stages and we go on into the 
future.  It delivers real benefits for Canadians today and a 
great outlook for Canada as we start the new millennium. 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this budget is very interesting in terms of the response that it 
has had in my constituency. The members of my constituency have 
seen through this budget very clearly.  They have seen the 
flimflam that is involved with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, they are asking a very simple question, one of many.  For 
example, the finance minister is very proud to have eliminated 
the deficit retirement surcharge for most Canadians. We note that 
the finance minister has also eliminated the deficit.  Under what 
pretext does he continue to collect the deficit retirement 
surcharge from any taxpayers? This is part of the flimflam. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, they are also aware of the fact, and this is according 
to a news release from the Government of Canada dated March 9 on 
supplementary estimates, that what Canadians may know is that 
obviously there are estimates made as to what revenue and 
expenditures we are going to have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the fact, there have to be adjustments to reflect reality. 
They are also very well aware of this fact.  The government 
document calls for decreases in the expenditures, a decrease of 
$4.5 billion in public debt charges from $46 billion printed in 
the 1997-98 main estimates to $41.5 billion reflected in the 
supplementary estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand how this government can possibly take the 
credit for the fact that world interest rates have declined.  As 
a result of the world interest rates declining, it has had a 
windfall of $4.5 billion.  That is part of its saving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The document also talks about a decrease of $1.4 billion in 
forecast employment insurance payments resulting from 
improvements in labour market conditions. This government is 
still taking $5 billion to $6 billion out of the pockets of 
Canada's workers and Canada's employers in the form of a tax for 
employment. In fact, if there was a decrease of $1.4 billion in 
the forecast for employment insurance payments, surely there 
should have been a decrease in the premium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unconscionable that this government continues the practice 
started by the Conservatives of including in general revenue the 
so-called insurance rates under Employment Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am the heritage critic and I would like to deal specifically 
with the heritage department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again in the supplementary estimates, we see that all of a 
sudden they have had to ask for and have achieved an increase of 
$59.9 million just for department expenses.  That is over a one 
year period. The department itself will now be spending $1.1 
billion on itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Capital Commission is looking for and has received 
an increase of $1.6 million.  The National Capital Commission is 
now budgeted to spend $72.7 million, up $1.6 million.  The 
National Film Board, an increase of $2.4 million, now up to a 
rate of $61.4 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of spending we know about because it has ended up in 
supplementary estimates.  It must drive most Canadian taxpayers 
wild.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why in the world must we have constant increases in spending 
while at the same time there is a meagre, tiny turnback of tax 
revenue for Canadians?  Canadians want to know why we must have 
these increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at one specific area of Canadian heritage, that of 
sports.  It is interesting to note the comments made by Ms. Lori 
Johnstone, the chair of Athletes Canada, to the committee a 
couple of weeks ago.  She was commenting on the Nagano Winter 
Olympics which were held at that time.  She said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It's very exciting.  There's a lot of interest and emotion.  At 
the send-off in Calgary, (the heritage minister) thanked the 
athletes for letting us share the dream.  These athletes are 
representing our nation and we are sharing in their successes and 
their failures, their disappointments, their joy and also their 
controversies. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She went on to say about the athletes: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of sacrifices, the cost question was asked earlier, the 
cost of pursuing the dream and roughly, athletes at an elite 
level can incur as much as $10,000 per year of their 
national—dream.  When you combine that with the income that 
most amateur national team athletes make, which tends to be under 
$15,000, it's quite a powerful statement of the willingness to 
make sacrifices to pursue the dream. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of faith it strikes me that the heritage minister, 
and indeed the whole government, should respect the fact that we 
have some of the world's finest athletes in Canada.  They go to 
world events to compete for us.  Not only do they make 
themselves, their parents, their sponsors and their coaches proud 
but they make us as Canadians proud.  And what do they get? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote from an article published today in the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I> in Toronto entitled “Canadian athletes want shirts to 
pin medals on”: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six months from the opening of the 16th Commonwealth Games in 
Kuala Lumpur, Canada's team is outfitted with 400 airline 
tickets—and perhaps 400 fig leaves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Commonwealth Games Association of Canada is about $1.5 
million short of its budget of $3 million to take a full team to 
the Games and the team hasn't a stitch to wear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Clothing is what we need, big time,” says Margie Schnell, the 
chef de mission for the Canadian team.  The games will be held 
Sept. 10-20 in Malaysia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“It will cost about $6,000 per athlete to outfit and send the 
team.  Air Canada and Malaysian Airlines are looking after most 
of the travel, but we still don't have clothes”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This compares with the question I asked in the House on Monday. 
I asked where the Minister responsible for Francophonie got the 
idea that she could arbitrarily, off the top of her head, 
determine that she was going to offer free airline tickets to 
foreign athletes to come to Ottawa-Hull for the Francophonie 
games in the year 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time she made that commitment she new the Ottawa-Hull 
games were budgeted by the federal government for an expenditure 
of $12 million.  She also found out that it was likely 
Ottawa-Hull would not get the games, that Lebanon would get the 
games with the backing of France.  The reason she thought Lebanon 
would get the games was that it was offering to pay half the 
airfare for the athletes to go to Lebanon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did our minister do?  This comes right back to the starting 
point of my speech.  Where did these extra expenditures come 
from?  How did they happen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Off the top of her head she suddenly said “Why don't we give 
free airfare to all the foreign athletes so they can come to 
Canada?”  We are talking about 42 countries and probably 2,000 
athletes.  We do not know how many millions of dollars it would 
cost to get them here.  Meanwhile back at the ranch our Canadian 
athletes do not even have uniforms to pin their medals on.  It is 
absolutely ludicrous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, in a report to parliament from the International 
Assembly of Parliamentarians of French Language on February 17 I 
noted that some prize winners at the earlier games, that is at 
the Francophonie games, have still not even claimed their prizes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know the priority of the government.  Is the 
priority of the government to get foreign athletes to come to 
Canada?  Indeed, should the priority of the government not be our 
athletes?  They are contributing money from their own pockets. 
They are contributing their time, effort and sweat to represent 
us as Canadians.  The priority of the government should be to 
properly look after our athletes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cite this as one example of a thousand stories I could tell to 
illustrate how the government is completely out of control.  The 
government has no idea where it is going.  All it knows is that 
it has a blank cheque.  Guess what?  That cheque was signed by 
Canadian taxpayers and the government is spending it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in the House tonight to add my congratulations to the 
Minister of Finance on the balanced budget.  Not only did he 
balance the budget but he brought in a budget with balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governing is more than merely making the books balance.  If you 
are not fiscally responsible you will soon not have a nation to 
govern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am one of those who thought that debt reduction should be the 
first priority.  After 30 years of running deficits it seemed to 
me that getting our fiscal house in order was the highest 
priority.  I heard that at the door.  I heard it at three town 
hall forums.  I heard it by way of correspondence and I heard it 
in my office.  The people of Scarborough East repeatedly said to 
me that debt reduction was the highest priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I communicated those views to the minister and to the Prime 
Minister, privately and in caucus.  I was therefore pleased to 
see the commitment of the minister to debt reduction.  It is 
something to be celebrated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget documents that the debt for fiscal year 1997-98 will 
be $583 billion.  That is a serious amount of money by anyone's 
standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debt is divided into two components:  market debt and 
non-market debt.  Approximately $477 billion or 80% of the debt 
is in fact market debt.  Because the total is so high our 
percentage of GDP is approximately 73.1%, which has since been 
revised down to about 71%.  Some market analysts actually put our 
GDP to debt ratio at about 68%, primarily due to the growth in 
the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will recall recently that when the Prime Minister was in New 
York he chastized money market traders who buy and sell the 
Canadian dollar.  He called them the men in red suspenders.  He 
was upset because Canada's fiscal house was in order, the 
fundamentals were the best of all the G-7 nations, and yet the 
dollar continued to be discounted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately our debt is high relative to our G-7 partners and 
the traders have noticed.  We have no choice but to commit 
ourselves to a steady reduction in the absolute amount of the 
debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some economists feel that the economy will grow us out of our 
debt difficulties.  However, if one is to commit oneself to the 
virtuous circle, one needs to make an absolute commitment to debt 
reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the greatest respect, I do not believe that merely letting 
the economy grow us out of our difficulties is an answer.  There 
are at least two significant reasons beyond interest rate 
fluctuations for that view.  The first is the diminished size and 
role of government in the lives of Canadians.  The second is the 
wild card effect of a rogue provincial government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the people in red suspenders look at Canada they are not 
only looking at federal government debt.  They are looking at 
national debt.  The provinces contribute to the national debt. In 
fact, if we add the provincial debt to the federal debt, it 
virtually adds up to 100% of the gross domestic product. 
If every man, woman and child worked in this country for an 
entire year they might pay off the debt.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have been saying in a variety of ways that there is 
too much government and too much overlap.  In some measure the 
government has listened and has devolved or even abandoned areas 
of jurisdiction to other levels of government.  The House has 
vociferously debated those things, but even after the cacophony 
has died down this is a reduced federal government, a reduced 
entity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The net effect of the role of government, therefore, in terms of 
GDP is a reduced role.  The government plays a significantly 
reduced role in the gross domestic product and the red suspenders 
crowd has noticed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reality is the role of provincial government national 
debt.  New Brunswick, Saskatchewan and Alberta have all balanced 
their budgets and are not contributing to the debt. However I 
cannot say that for Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario will over the course of the mandate of the current 
government add $30 billion to the national debt.  It is a charter 
member of the flat earth society.  It expects that the provincial 
economy will grow its way out of its difficulties.  This is a 
terrible waste of a time of prosperity.  It is as if we have 
learned nothing.  We have learned nothing from the Mulroney years 
where there were periods of prosperity which were squandered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The men in red suspenders have taken note and Canada does not 
get enough respect, a la Rodney Dangerfield, because Canada is 
far from out of the woods when it comes to the management of the 
national debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government, to its credit, paid down $13 billion of 
market debt last year.  In addition, it did not go to the market 
for any new debt.  It reduced the ratio of foreign debt as a per 
capita and a per cent of the overall federal debt.  It is on the 
way to becoming a master of its own house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, certain provinces have not seen the light, in 
particular the province of Ontario.  The good efforts of the 
federal government may well be offset by those provinces.  The 
men in red suspenders, I anticipate, will have a few more 
profitable years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government wants the ratio down from 73% over the 
course of the mandate to a low 60% or 50%.  A number of private 
forecasters have in fact said that will happen.  For instance, 
CIBC-Wood Gundy predicts that even if the contingency reserve is 
not used there will be an absolute reduction in the net debt by 
about $20 billion over the next two budget years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of a debt to GDP ratio of something in the order of 70%, 
it will be down around 59.7% according to that private 
forecaster.  It is good news indeed and something that the red 
suspenders crowd should notice.  However, it will not have any 
impact on the dollar unless provinces make similar commitments. 
Spending one's way to prosperity does not work.  Tax cutting 
one's way is equally foolish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Books that balance is a laudable achievement but a balanced 
approach to debt reduction makes the budget even better. Building 
into the budget a contingency is prudent.  Committing to debt 
reduction on a straight line basis is even more prudent. 
Diminishing the per cent of debt to GDP is more prudent again. 
However, balancing to other compelling priorities is the most 
prudent thing a government can do, and to heck with the red 
suspenders crowd.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased I am not wearing my red suspenders this evening.  I 
congratulate my colleague from Scarborough East for some 
thoughtful comments on the budget, on the state of the economy 
and on where we are going.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to specifically talk this evening about one page in this 
budget that I think is equally as telling and equally as 
important in laying out what this government thinks about turning 
the economy around and moving forward.  It is page 127.  While I 
certainly would agree with my friend and my colleagues who have 
spoken about the significance of a balanced budget and what that 
will do to the overall economy, what happened on page 127 will go 
an enormous way toward bringing fairness to our economy and 
increasing the revenue not only for the federal government but 
for the provincial government which we constantly hear talking 
about how it has been cut back and it is always moaning, at least 
in the case of the province of Ontario, which my friend has 
referred to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is page 127 of this budget will indeed put more 
money in the hands of Ernie Eves in the province of Ontario and 
all provinces.  Perhaps even more important than that, it will 
put more money in the hands of average Canadians.  The heading is 
Tax Fairness: Tackling the Underground Economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been studies done on the underground economy.  We all 
know what we are talking about.  If you do this for cash we will 
not pay the taxes.  We will give you a special deal if we pay you 
under the table.  We know this goes on.  We also know, and I 
think we should admit, that a tax regime that is too high and 
does not put fairness into the system will drive the economy 
underground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Page 127 in my estimation goes a long way toward tackling and 
fighting the battle of the underground economy.  It goes on as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax evasion through participation in the underground 
economy penalizes honest taxpayers.  The federal government has a 
comprehensive strategy for addressing this problem.  This budget 
announces additional measures to reduce the underreporting of 
income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal departments and agencies will begin issuing 
information slips for contract payments made from January 1, 1998 
as will federal crown corporations effective January 1, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The various associations involved in the construction industry 
have been concerned with competition from the underground economy 
for some time. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might add that it is the construction industry that actually 
tackled the underground economy head on.  It came united with the 
private sector, with the labour movement and with academia. It 
came united to this place and said it had a plan that will fight 
tax evasion in the underground economy.  This was not something 
that was dreamed up in the finance department.  It was not 
something dreamed up by a committee of parliamentarians.  It came 
from the men and women who work in the industry on all sides.  I 
really congratulate them for their foresight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget page goes on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to their concerns, the 1995 budget implemented a 
voluntary reporting system for the construction industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More recently, key industry associations, including the building 
and construction trade department of the AFL-CIO and the Interior 
Systems Contractor's Association of Ontario, have indicated that 
the reporting system to be effective needs to be made mandatory. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The private sector and the unions came forward and said 
voluntary is not working, they need this to be a mandatory 
reporting system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion on this page: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Effective January 1, 1999, reporting of construction contract 
payments to Revenue Canada will become mandatory.  The federal 
government will consult with industry to ensure that any industry 
compliance costs are minimized and the system is effective. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In perhaps a little more plain English what this simply means is 
that if contractor A wins a contract for $1 million and decides 
to sub it out to three contractors, B, C and D, for $300,000 each 
and pocket $100,000 for doing it, that is perfectly legal.  We 
have no problem with that.  What this budget change will do is 
ensure that contractor A must not only say that he has offloaded 
$900,000 worth of revenue but now in a mandatory prescription he 
must say who exactly he is paying it to. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2035"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT118"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Heretofore what would happen is that contractors B, C and D 
would have the option of taking that $300,000 in cash, maybe even 
discounting it and doing the work for $250,000 and avoiding 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not just talking about a sales tax.  We are talking about 
the ability to avoid employer health tax which would be an 
enormous loss in revenue to the provincial government here in 
Ontario.  We are talking about an ability to avoid worker's 
compensation premiums, extremely important particularly in the 
construction industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this does is give some security and some assurance to the 
men and women who work in the construction industry and let us 
face it, most are men but there are also more and more women 
coming into the business.  It gives them the assurance that they 
need not worry about getting injured on the job and then finding 
out that their employer ducked the responsibility of paying the 
workers compensation premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It really makes the entire process transparent.  I think it is 
an enormous step to put this mandatory reporting system in place. 
I think we will see over time. Rather than simply guessing at the 
figures, I think we should monitor this and the people in finance 
should monitor this to see exactly what it does to the revenue 
base of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my belief right across the country we will see an increase 
but we will also see greater protection for our workers.  One of 
the reasons that this is important is there are tens of thousands 
of people who work in this business in the construction trades. 
Whether we are talking about carpenters, electricians, boiler 
makers, pipefitters, formers, we are talking about labourers, it 
is tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of men and women 
across this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until this change was brought in by the minister of finance in 
this budget, they were simply at the mercy of some of the 
companies.  Not all of them were.  I do not want to cast 
aspersions across a broad perspective or suggest that everybody 
in the construction business is avoiding taxes.  I do not think 
that is true.  I do not think that is fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment came about as a result of the efforts of people 
like Joe Maloney with the Construction and Building Trades 
Council here in Ottawa. A number of people along with Joe, his 
colleagues, did their homework.  They explained to us on this 
side of the house how important it was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know one of the concerns was that business would come out and 
say you cannot do this, it is more red tape for business.  But 
ask a simple question.  If a business does not want to disclose a 
contract that it just received the question is why. What is it 
trying to hide?  What is it trying to avoid?  There really is 
nowhere to hide in this.  It is transparent and it is fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of what it means in our communities, let me just 
tell a little about my riding Mississauga West which is 
fundamentally a bricks and mortar economy.  Certainly we depend 
on the auto industry, just like many other parts of this great 
country, and we depend on software companies.  We are known for 
pill hill where all the pharmaceutical companies are, in the 
north end of my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are, if nothing else, a bricks and mortar economy and as the 
construction trades win a contract they then put into practice a 
process that leads to the development of new communities, 
industrial, residential communities. Out of that comes everything 
a family needs when it moves into a home, everything a business 
needs when it opens in a new industrial complex, and it goes on 
and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a snowball rolling downhill and it all starts with an 
amendment like the one on page 127 which brings fairness to the 
economy, which helps to fight the underground economy, ensure 
that employees, hardworking men and women in the construction 
trades, are protected, and ensure that government gets its fair 
share so that we can continue to provide the services Canadians 
want and indeed deserve.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to take part in the debate 
this evening. My speech will reflect what my constituents think 
of the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked my constituents whether this budget was supportive of 
regional development or not. The first finding is that it is a 
standardizing budget. The government decided to treat all the 
regions of the country in the same way, regardless of their 
specific circumstances. The only exception is northern Ontario. 
Everywhere else in the country, the proposed measures have a 
standardizing effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, in the case of the employment insurance surplus, the 
government could have said “Some regions are in a more difficult 
situation as regards employment. We will show some innovative 
spirit”. For example, the government could have allowed 
businesses and employees in high unemployment areas to stop 
paying employment insurance premiums and make up for the lost 
premiums by dipping into the surplus. After all, it is these 
workers and these employers, along with those of the other 
regions of Canada, who generated this surplus. The government 
could have allowed people in high unemployment areas to stop 
paying premiums, so as to promote employment. But there are no 
such initiatives. There are no specific measures to give all 
Canadians the same opportunities to find work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget reflects a neoliberal philosophy. It is in keeping 
with the practice started by the Conservatives and perpetuated by 
this government, by the current Minister of Finance, to the 
effect that the market will regulate everything. We see the 
result of this reliance on the market. 
We now have a situation where there is high unemployment in some 
regions, in spite of an improved economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation of some people is getting worse all the time. More 
and more people end up on welfare, mainly because of the 
restrictive employment insurance rules put in place by this 
government, as part of its fight against the deficit. We now have 
a surplus, but the government refuses to budge. Those who made 
sacrifices are not the ones eligible for the benefits generated 
by this surplus, and I think the government will be judged very 
severely on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium scholarship fund is another element which I 
considered in the context of regional development. Will this 
fund be a good thing for Canadian regions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to realize that the province of Quebec has developed an 
education system where regional universities, such as the 
Université du Québec in Chicoutimi, for instance, or in my region 
of Rimouski, and the general and vocational colleges called 
cegeps are funded by the provincial budget, a part of which is 
made up of transfer payments coming from the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, since 1994, for each dollar the Quebec government 
has had to cut, 75 cents were because of the decrease in federal 
transfer payments. This year, we had hoped that with the surplus 
the provinces would get a break and receive more money for health 
and education. But that is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What really upset our regions was to see that the surplus was 
used for the millennium scholarship fund. 
A marvellous program that will provide grants to students, 
mostly in the other nine provinces, where the student debt level 
is very high. These grants will surely be welcomed. In Quebec, 
however, we already have a student loans and grants program. We 
already provide grants, which explains why the average student 
debt in Quebec is $11,000 compared to $25,000 in the rest of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can understand why the residents of the nine other provinces 
have asked for a grants program, such as the one that has been in 
place in Quebec sine 1964. The program is in place. On this 
issue, the sovereignists, the Liberal Party of Quebec, the 
student federations, university presidents, all of the 
stakeholders in education want the same thing. They want the 
money to go to the Quebec government so that it can be added to 
the existing program which—the evidence is there—is the best 
one to keep the student debt load down and to provide well 
balanced funding in the area of education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, millennium scholarships will be granted to students, but 
where will these students choose to study? If the Université du 
Québec in Rimouski does not have the necessary funding to ensure 
its future, if it is unable to develop interesting programs to 
attract the students, these students will go and study outside 
their native areas. 
It is like the Hygrade sausage complex. The less money 
universities have to offer interesting programs, the less 
students go to these universities and the less funding these 
universities will get.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is this vicious circle that the government should have broken 
by putting money back into transfer payments. However, this is 
not in the budget. Therefore, it is a budget against regional 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was saying this was because of standardization; I am also 
saying this is because of the federal government's intrusion in 
the education sector, as there is no other reason for it than 
visibility. 
Indeed, the prime minister has admitted here, in response to a 
question by the member for Lac-Saint-Jean, that the government was 
doing this so that people could see where the money was coming 
from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This could have been done in another fashion. The government 
could have given the money to Quebec and ensured it was known 
that it was coming from transfer payments. This type of situation 
was uncalled for. It is a bit like someone who owns a house. You 
have maintenance expenses to pay, you have made plans to repaint 
it and, all of a sudden, there is money coming from someone else, 
from an inheritance or some other source. You are told that, with 
this money, you will have to build a chimney, a fireplace. You 
say this is not what you need, that you have to repaint the 
house. The person who lends you the money says that it is for the 
chimney and nothing else. This is not doing a favour to the 
homeowner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same thing here. The federal government is not doing a 
favour to the provinces by not allowing them to get some money 
for their education and health sectors. This has a major negative 
impact in our regions. This further contributes to depopulate the 
regions. Students will go elsewhere and we will have less chance 
of seeing them come back home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there is a principle here that this government did not 
put forward at the beginning. Quebeckers and Canadiens had the 
right to live in their region, to develop the human and financial 
resources available to them, and to promote interesting life 
environments, without people being displaced from one end of the 
country to another for no reason. The market alone must not 
dictate what happens. This cannot be the choice to be made in our 
society. There again, the budget is not interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The holiday on EI premiums for emplloyers hiring 18 to 24 year 
olds is a pretty good thing in terms of visibility but in reality 
it could have consequences for a small business with only four, 
five or six employees. What small business will create a job 
paying $20,000 or $25,000 a year in exchange for a premium 
holiday of $800? This is not the way to generate growth of the 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was needed was a more general reduction of premiums 
representing a significant amount of money for a business. This 
would have generated enough growth to promote job creation. A 
small business of 20 employees that could save $10,000, $12,000 
or $15,000 in EI premiums would be interested in creating jobs. 
The government could also have also required that the premium 
holiday be applied to the hiring of young people. This could have 
been an interesting requirement but the government's initiative 
lacks that kind of originality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last thing I would like to say is that as early last 
January, I told my constituents to watch to see whether the 
government would introduce measures in the coming budget to 
address the issue of poverty. There again, the government has 
failed. It does not get a passing grade. The most effective way 
for the government to address poverty would have been to improve 
the conditions of the employment insurance program and allow 
people to maintain an acceptable standard of living between 
jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week, we had clear evidence. Almost 750,000 people, 
including 200,000 in Quebec alone, had to go on welfare in Canada 
because the employment insurance program was not adequate or did 
not provide an acceptable standard of living. The areas with high 
unemployment were particularly hard hit. I think there is nothing 
in the budget to address poverty effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that in this year's budget, the federal government 
missed a fantastic opportunity to give their due to those people 
who had contributed to the fight against the deficit and to go 
back to a value traditionally shared by Quebeckers and Canadians, 
that is a fair distribution of wealth. The budget lacks those 
elements. For these reasons, I believe that the Minister of 
Finance should go back to the drawing board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, I call upon the Minister of Human Resources 
Development to review the employment insurance reform so that 
such measures can be implemented in the future. There is a lot of 
money in the fund, and each year the surplus will be $6 billion. 
There will be a $25 billion surplus at the beginning of the 
year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will end on that. The government has a chance to go back to 
square one and ensure fairness in the future, otherwise 
Quebeckers and Canadians could continue to judge the government's 
budget very severely.

examination of the budget reveals to Canadians that this budget 
fails point by point and initiative by initiative to live up to 
the expectations and the needs of the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In education, providing only 7% of the nation's students with 
benefits of the proposed millennium fund, which will be 
administered by the CEO of Chrysler, for industry to train people 
for industry ignores the role that education plays in our 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of reinstating funding for post-secondary institutions, 
the Liberals have chosen to dole out some money which is 
desperately needed to a few students who are cash starved and 
then to offer advice to them on how to manage their debt.  They 
are ignoring the student debt crisis and advancing our 
educational institutions at an alarming rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the Yukon, a very poor area of Canada, has recognized the 
importance of investing in education and for over 20 years has 
provided approximately $5,000 for each of its graduating students 
accepted at an accredited institution.  Part of that is for 
travel and part is for tuition and books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a really poor area of the country that through thick and 
thin has provided that amount of funding for students.  I believe 
the federal government should match that as well as provide 
funding for the institutions to make sure that our students and 
our young people have a place to go and be educated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The modest increases in transfer payments to the provinces and 
territories do not begin to restore the cuts made in 1994.  The 
Liberal government is only giving back a small portion of what 
was taken from Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saddest of all, this budget ignores the poor people of our 
country.  It has nothing for the poor and the minimal tax breaks 
announced will for most families amount to less than $500 in tax 
relief a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will not take the elderly poor off the tax rolls.  Over and 
over members of my community ask why, when they get so little, 
they have to pay so much in taxes.  That is income taxes and the 
GST.  People are struggling to make ends meet.  Gone are the days 
when the single income would support a family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget is a reflection of free enterprise government, a 
government willing to transfer responsibilities for governing 
this country to large, private corporations or business 
associations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have created fundamental shifts in the building 
blocks of this Canadian society.  Canada is running toward a 
society where the protection of profits and corporate rights are 
paramount to the protection of our individual rights, our 
culture, our health, our social and our educational institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget confirms the direction of policies that select a few 
to thrive and prosper while the rest sink and suffer.  An 
important aspect that we are missing in the debate is the 
original causes of the huge government deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister stated that never again will we let old 
habits return of defining bigger government as better government 
or believing that every problem requires another program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening is the denying of anything more than a minimal 
role for government in the economy and a minimal role for 
governing our country, a government that believes only private 
companies and market forces will bring employment and prosperity 
to Canadians.  This is not true.  It has brought only poverty, 
not prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The liberal Conservatives or conservative Liberals running the 
government are believers in high unemployment but low in stable 
inflation and low in stable interest rates as the tools for 
profit oriented companies looking to take over the role of 
government in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance is preaching a misleading hypothesis 
that deficits have been caused by extravagant, big-spending 
government and the only cure was to cut back.  Who was cut was 
the poor and middle class. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deficit came from high interest rates, overspending and 
support for very big business and high unemployment.  A 
Statistics Canada study indicated that the rise in deficits came 
mainly from high interest rates to a Bank of Canada obsession 
with zero inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An Alberta former civil servant explanation of the deficit is 
government overspending on business support while slashing health 
and education that was the real cause of the deficit.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Montreal economist Harold Chorney argues that high unemployment 
with its loss of revenues and social costs has created far more 
debt than social spending.  The above explanation seems to be 
shared by the finance minister who said that only a quarter of 
the savings that cut the deficit came from program cuts.  Far 
more were due to low interest rates, growth and raiding the UI 
funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no balanced budget with the present government 
policies.  There was a drastic shift of federal government 
deficit to the provinces through federal transfer cuts, then to 
municipalities and finally to individual Canadian families.  We 
see the consequences of these policies in our health system, our 
education system, in UI benefits that are no longer available, in 
housing that is no longer there and in the total loss of a whole 
generation of young Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian priorities and the priorities of the NDP are being 
ignored by Liberals.  There are no new job strategies, no support 
for education or health infrastructure and no indication of a 
fair tax system.  Our priorities for the federal budget are to 
make full employment the primary goal of government and to make a 
real commitment to addressing the cost of education.  It is not a 
sustainable policy to provide a student with small financial 
relief if the universities are not being funded and are forced to 
increase tuition costs to counter government cutbacks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want strategic investment to rebuild health care and targeted 
direct tax relief.  This government must stop taxing the poor and 
the elderly who live below the poverty line.  We want targets for 
the elimination of child poverty as many countries do not accept 
the level of poverty we accept.  Our country is wealthy and we do 
not have to accept poverty in our midst.  We want to rebalance 
taxes to achieve greater fairness and advance broader goals. We 
want to see government bring the people of Canada to the centre 
of government policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1993-94 and 1996-97 government budgetary revenues 
increased by $24.9 billion.  Of this increase, 48% was due to 
personal income tax.  Corporations through corporate income tax 
paid $7.6 billion or just 30%, a clear indication that the 
federal government is squeezing the people of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To reward Canadians for their individual contributions to the 
reduction of the federal deficit, the government reduced federal 
cash transfers to the provinces for health care, education and 
social assistance from $18.7 billion to a floor of $12.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Yukon has already faced a reduction of 11% in just one year 
which comes at the very time of a major closing of a mine in the 
Yukon and absolutely devastates its economy.  The federal 
government is not willing to do anything to recognize the 
hardship and strife of Yukoners.  This is compounded by changes to 
the EI system where people are not eligible and will not be 
relocated out of the north to places where they can work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian living standards are falling.  An ever increasing slice 
of the family budget is consumed by income tax.  Twenty-two per 
cent of Canadian families spend their budget on income tax.  The 
federal government has been taking a bigger slice of Canadians' 
income but there are still hundreds of rich Canadians who are 
very good at not paying taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent figures indicate that 230 individuals who earned at least 
a quarter of a million dollars did not pay income tax.  Another 
1,520 who earned between $100,000 to $250,000 a year did not pay 
any tax.  These figures provide a very good picture of the 
growing disparities in our country.  It is clear that the 
Liberals are not reinforcing the foundations of an egalitarian 
society at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister needs to look back to students with high debts and 
no jobs, back to those waiting for surgery, back to working 
Canadians who are slipping economically and socially, to those 
who are not working and who cannot even get UI.  The federal 
government says that it has won the war on the deficit but its 
policies are based on the need to make corporations profitable 
while the social and economic costs are not a concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let history record that the Liberals tore up the just 
fundamentals of our society and that the deficit was defeated on 
the backs of Canadian people and the fundamental tenets of a 
caring society.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My remarks by coincidence are going to dovetail to a certain 
extent the remarks of the member for Mississauga West.  The 
member was commenting that one of the provisions in the budget is 
the mandatory reporting of construction contracts which would 
help solve some of the problems of the multibillion dollar 
underground economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Mississauga West was saying that this change in 
the budget came as a result of lobbying by members of the 
construction industry, the unions and so forth.  I do not doubt 
that these groups lobbied, but I happen to know that a colleague 
of the member for Mississauga West, the member for Mississauga 
South, was a very strong champion throughout the previous 
Parliament in addressing the issue of the underground economy. 
Indeed he moved a private member's motion that addressed among 
other things the possibility of bringing transparency to the 
reporting of construction contracts as a means of solving the 
problem of GST evasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of the things I like about the budget.  We on all 
sides of the House should admire this budget as it is very much 
the MPs' budget.  As we look through it we find many instances 
where the finance minister has heard MPs and made the appropriate 
changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thinking for example of the restoration of funding to the 
Medical Research Council.  There was an enormous movement inside 
the Liberal caucus asking for this funding to be restored.  I do 
not doubt that members on the opposite side also campaigned to 
restore this funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly there was a concern on all sides of the House about 
the problem of student debt.  This budget has provisions which 
will help alleviate the problem to some extent for students who 
have found themselves burdened with enormous debts at the 
conclusion of their studies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too had input into the budget and had hoped that the finance 
minister was listening to me.  I must say that after reading the 
budget I was disappointed to a certain degree because I have long 
been a champion of cutting back on the GST. Reducing the GST by 
even one percentage point in my view would be a very positive 
saving for Canadians, particularly because of the underground 
economy.  In the previous Parliament I was very concerned about 
the amount of money that was being lost to government coffers and 
to the economy at large because of unreported work and the 
resulting unpaid taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was disappointed for a short while in what I found in the 
budget, but then I encountered that portion of the budget which 
dealt with the elimination of the 3% surtax for all those 
Canadians earning incomes of less than $50,000.  The more I 
looked at this provision, the more I realized the government had 
come up, if I may say so, with its own novel answer to some of my 
own concerns.  I do not remember at any time before the budget 
was actually brought down a debate at least in my own caucus 
about getting rid of the 3% surtax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we examine this initiative we can see that there is some 
genuine wisdom on the part of the government.  By limiting the 
elimination of the tax to 13 million Canadians whose income is 
less than $50,000, what we are in effect doing is putting more 
money in the pockets of not only less better off Canadians but 
also younger Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that those who earn more than $50,000 are likely 
to be the more affluent Canadians and more likely older Canadians 
who have established households.  They have boxed their worldly 
wealth and are probably enjoying retirement and perhaps leaving 
the country to take holidays down south. 
Younger Canadians on the other hand, those earning less than 
$50,000 are the ones who are going to be buying consumer goods. 
They are going to be buying automobiles, refrigerators and new 
homes.  They are going to be stimulating construction.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we think of the elimination of the surtax in this context, 
that it actually puts money back into the pockets of consumers, 
what we see is a very efficient way of not only stimulating the 
economy but getting maximum value for the tax cut dollar which 
has been put in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When these young people buy things, it creates jobs.  It creates 
employment.  It creates salaries for people who will in turn pay 
taxes.  The tax cut which is involved in eliminating the 3% 
surtax has enormous repercussions throughout the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Particularly after the remarks of the member for Mississauga 
West, I realize that the government in its wisdom has found a 
better solution than I had thought of with respect to the 
underground economy.  It is stimulating younger Canadians to 
purchase by eliminating the surtax instead of simply taking a 
percentage point off the GST.  That would have been an across the 
board tax cut.  It would not have been half as effective as 
eliminating the 3% surtax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important not only to praise the government and to 
look at what was done in this budget, but also to look ahead.  We 
have to tell the finance minister at this early stage what we 
would like to see in the next budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret that sometimes the opposition members focus only on 
criticizing what is already on the table and what is already very 
good.  They should be looking at this debate as an opportunity to 
make suggestions to the finance minister on what we can do next 
year.  He listens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact I will give an offhand compliment to the Reform Party. 
The Reform Party embarked in 1993 on a deficit reduction platform 
and continued the deficit reduction campaign.  If the NDP had 
been the official opposition, there is no doubt in my mind that 
the finance minister would have perhaps within his own caucus had 
more of a struggle with the very good and tough medicine he came 
up with.  Even the Reform Party shares in the success of the 
finance minister's budget, and so it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look ahead.  I am very interested in finding novel ways 
in which to make the economy run more efficiently.  One of those 
ways is for the government to address those sectors of the 
economy which have been overlooked for decades.  One of those 
sectors is the not for profit sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people would be amazed to realize that the Canada Business 
Corporations Act has fairly stringent reporting requirements for 
profit companies, yet it requires virtually nothing of not for 
profit companies.  For example, not for profit companies are not 
required to prepare financial reports on an annual basis, as are 
for profit companies.  There are no standards set for not for 
profit companies to prepare financial reports for their own 
members.  There are problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the not for profit companies are very large.  Many 
charities are not for profit companies.  Large entities such as 
the Canadian Automobile Association are not for profit companies. 
These companies take in millions of dollars a year, yet the 
government requires no financial reporting to government of their 
activities.  There are no mandatory standards on how these not 
for profit companies should report to their memberships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is amazing to realize that the Canada Business Corporations 
Act does not even require not for profit companies to use a 
qualified accountant or auditor to prepare financial statements 
for their members.  Literally anyone can do them. There is a lack 
of transparency.  I could go on.

the next budget at the not for profit sector and rewrite the 
Canada Business Corporations Act.  It should require of the not 
for profit sector the same standards of financial transparency as 
are required of the for profit sector. Since the not for profit 
sector deals with an area of the economy in the billions of 
dollars, I think it would be a very positive measure for the next 
budget.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be speaking over the next 10 minutes about our plan for 
growth and what we should have seen in the budget.  It is the 
plan presented by the member for Sherbrooke, the leader of the 
Progressive Conservative Party of Canada.  He is someone who will 
be the best prime minister we will ever see in this country in a 
few years from now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a plan for growth in this economy.  A plan for growth 
based on less tax and less debt will ultimately mean more jobs 
and more money back into the pockets of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Budgets are supposed to be a reflection of our values and our 
priorities.  I find it very difficult to understand that this 
budget has not provided tax relief to the middle and lower income 
Canadians. By that I mean as a society, within this budget we are 
saying it is acceptable to tax someone who makes $7,000 per year, 
$14,000 less than the poverty line.  We are saying as Canadians 
that it is acceptable to tax those individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a plan to grow our economy so that more individuals, 
middle and lower income earners, can actually participate in the 
economy to the degree they are capable of doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just the Progressive Conservative Party that actually 
understands that we need a plan for growth in our economy. I 
would like to make reference to a press release sent out by the 
Canadian Chamber of Commerce on February 24, shortly after the 
budget. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce challenged the 
government to draw up a detailed fiscal framework for the new 
millennium based on clear criteria for growth, competitiveness 
and opportunity rather than arbitrary commitments to allocate 
half the surplus to spending and half to debt reduction and tax 
relief. We need to deal with it more strategically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am speaking on behalf of the citizens of Fundy—Royal. 
Actually the chairman of the board of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, Gerry 
Pond, happens to be a Fundy—Royal resident. What he is saying 
can actually be incorporated with the initiatives we have put 
forth in this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before we actually start talking about a surplus or perceived 
fiscal dividend, I think it is very healthy for us to actually 
examine whether we have a surplus in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members probably know as they may have heard when we were out 
campaigning back in the month of May leading up to the election 
on June 2 that there is a $14 billion accumulated surplus in the 
employment insurance fund, $14 billion. I know the member from 
Kings—Hants and the member from Chicoutimi understand that that 
money belongs in the pockets of Canadian taxpayers. The chief 
actuary for the EI fund maintains that the EI fund is sustainable 
at $2 per $100 of insurable earnings as opposed to $2.70 where it 
certainly lies.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a lot of debate on whether lowering job killing 
payroll taxes will actually have a jolt in terms of job creation. 
One does not have to take it as my word.  In this very same press 
release the Canadian Chamber of Commerce stated that if the 
premium were a $1.95, which is even lower than the $2 I 
mentioned, instead of the present $2.70 per $100 of insurable 
earnings, every medium size company across Canada would be able 
to hire at least one more person.  Those are not my words but 
those of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to put more disposable income into Canadian taxpayers' 
pockets.  I would like to quote the member for Sherbrooke who 
understands this initiative.  He stated that the message the 
Prime Minister and his government seemed to be sending to 
Canadian taxpayers was that he knew how to spend their money 
better than they did.  The truth is that less taxes and less debt 
means more growth and more jobs for Canadians and more money in 
the Canadian taxpayers' pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government actually maintains that there is tax relief 
within the budget.  The average amount of tax relief for a low or 
middle income earner in Canada is about $80.  That represents a 
cup of coffee a week.  As the hon. member for Kings—Hants 
pointed out it would represent one a month if you go to 
Starbucks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are actually pledging as one of our primary first initiatives 
to raise the personal exemption on the income tax form from 
$6,500 to $10,000.  That one initiative alone would take two 
million off the tax rolls overnight, two million Canadians who 
should not have been there in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also calling for an initiative that actually kills the 3% 
surtax, the deficit elimination surtax, as the budget is now 
perceived to be balanced.  We can actually put more money back 
into Canadians' pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go further I want to point out that we have a balanced 
budget.  We should say bravo, that is good for all Canadians.  It 
ensures that we are headed in a better direction and that we will 
not continue to mortgage the future of younger generations any 
further.  We have a debt of $600 billion.  The younger you are, 
the higher proportion of the debt you have to repay.  It is 
fiscally immoral to pay for today's programs with tomorrow's 
moneys. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to ensure that we never go into the spiral of deficit 
spending again.  I challenge the government to bring in a 
balanced budget legislation with teeth.  One of our proposals 
within our plan for growth, which the member from Kings—Hants 
was instrumental in developing, was to ensure that if we do not 
balance the budget we would cut the salary of the Prime Minister 
and the salaries of the cabinet ministers if they failed to reach 
their actual targets.  That is the minimum we owe Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The balanced budget initiative has been a result of almost 15 
years.  As pointed out in the <I>Economist</I> magazine's year end 
review, Canada's balanced budget is largely due to structural 
changes in the Canadian economy implemented in the late 1980s and 
early 1990s.  It pointed to tax reforms, privatization and making 
our economy that much more cost effective, or free trade as the 
member of Kings—Hants pointed out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile the Liberal government has balanced the budget on the 
backs of Canadian taxpayers by only having the courage in 
leadership to cut Ottawa bureaucratic spending by a mere 9% while 
cutting transfer to the provinces for health care and education. 
These are the priorities of the Liberal government.  Yet it 
actually maintains that its priorities are health care and 
education.  It gutted health care and education by over 35%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past five years the government has taxed and cut 
indiscriminately.  The advent of a balanced budget does not give 
the authority to tax and spend indiscriminately.  Canadians have 
made their priorities clear: increased job creation, the 
protection of health care service and investing in young people's 
future through education.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada needs a plan for growth.  In the budget the government 
had an opportunity to outline some positive measures to make our 
economy grow, and that starts with real, meaningful, across the 
board tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I apologize to the 410,000 unemployed young Canadians that I am 
leaving youth to the end of my speech.  In terms of our economic 
spending we almost forget about our youth.  When it comes to 
student debt, I understand that back in 1993 in Atlantic Canada 
there were nine students who actually had a student debt of over 
$30,000.  Today there are 904 students who have a debt of over 
$30,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not actually provide the funding that today's younger 
generation requires to ensure that they have access to 
post-secondary education, and we do not have a lower tax regime 
so that once they graduate from university they actually have a 
chance to seek a job and have some opportunity, the brain drain 
we talk about will turn into a brain train. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the government to actually provide Canada with a 
plan for growth through less tax.  Less debt means more jobs and 
more opportunity for young Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is with great pride that I am able to speak to the budget, 
especially after my week back in the riding of St. Paul's where 
it was very clear that the people of St. Paul's and indeed the 
people of Toronto were extremely grateful to the Prime Minister 
and to the Minister of Finance for their leadership in what they 
felt they had asked for, in what they had voted for and in what 
had been delivered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the people of St. Paul's and all other 
people of Canada.  Everybody knows that over this past four years 
there had to be tough decisions.  Those people have paid in ways 
that they felt hard.  They are very relieved that the days of 
cuts are over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comments I had on the budget back in Toronto were that it 
was thoughtful, intelligent, practical and compassionate.  It 
exceeded people's expectations of how well the pulse of the 
people had been taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been said before, it was not only a balanced budget but 
it was a budget that demonstrated balance in its being able to 
deliver new programs, debt reduction and strategic tax relief. 
The people felt relieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a great privilege last week to see my predecessor, John 
Roberts, who was ecstatic that we could actually reach a time 
where Jeffrey Simpsom from the <I>Globe and Mail</I> could 
actually applaud a Liberal budget.  His quote was: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a long-standing and often acerbic critic of federal budgets, 
let me switch gears completely.  This week's budget was the best 
in a generation.  Here's why:  It got priorities roughly right. 
It helped redefine the proper role of government in a modern 
economy.  It balanced revenues and expenditures.  It opted for 
prudent forecasts.  It resisted the temptation to spend gobs more 
money in the wrong areas— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It contained modest tax cuts.  It was a balanced budget.  It 
provided additional spending in the right places and avoidance of 
foolish spending.  It adds up to the best budget in a generation 
and it sets a stage for what must come next, lower taxes and less 
debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget has been called an education budget.  It was 
interesting to see the faces of our Reform colleagues at the HRDC 
meeting last week when Frank Graves of Echos Research came to 
present his data on what Canadians wanted with respect to the 
role of the federal government in training and education.  Well 
over 59% of Canadians said that the federal role must be 
increased and 21% said that it must at least remain the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting that the sentinel piece of the budget is 
indeed the $2.5 billion millennium fund which the Prime Minister 
promised to Canadians.  When we look around the world in the year 
2000 we will see that lots of countries built buildings and great 
monuments to themselves.  This country will be seen to have 
created a legacy in terms of the future of our young Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Life-long learning is indeed the future.  As we see people 
perhaps requiring four careers in a lifetime, the ability to go 
to university is one of the biggest things we can give. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week at a skating party in St. Paul's Ken Dryden came to 
sign autographs and was able to talk to people about what we were 
raising some money for in terms of the three out of the cold 
programs in our riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Dryden actually has his own scholarship fund where every 
year he is able to fund six young Canadians.  He chooses young 
Canadians from either group homes or foster homes.  He says that 
the hardest thing is to read those 75 applications for those six 
precious spots and realize that every one of those extremely 
special young children has demonstrated with very little family 
support an ability to go to university.  He would love all 75 of 
them to be able to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to look at the other budget items in terms of 
the RESP and the Canada education savings grant, huge incentives 
for parents to save for their children's future education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax free withdrawals for life-long learning from RRSPs is 
important when we realize that the most important indicator for 
Canadians at 30 years of age of whether or not they are working 
is whether or not they have been to university.  It is something 
important for us to move forward on.  The presence of the 
university community was felt today on Parliament Hill. 
University presidents are very happy with the millennium fund, a 
future investment in young Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Robert Pritchard from the University of Toronto, where I am on 
the faculty, said that we could not do a better as a country.  He 
could not be happier for our students because this help will make 
all the difference in the world to them and their ability to 
manage the costs of higher education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a physician I heard clearly the member for Winnipeg North 
complaining about no new money for health care.  I feel I should 
respond and say that I am very happy with the direction of the 
government in health care.  The restoration of the CHST to $12.5 
billion is exactly what the National Forum on Health asked for. 
The additional $134 million for the MRC, the $211 million for the 
HIV and aids initiative, and the $60 million for the new blood 
agencies are indeed new money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The innovative tax relief evidenced in the budget in health and 
dental care allows self-employed people to proceed with 
preventive care.  The caregiver tax credit is the beginning of a 
home care plan.  Tax credits for training courses for caregivers 
of dependent relatives with disabilities and helping families 
with child care show the ongoing commitment and dedication of the 
government to health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was happy with the 1997 budget where we began with a health 
transition fund of $150 million, the innovation fund of $800 and 
the national system on health information with $50 million. These 
are the building blocks to creating a sustainable health care 
system for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the percentage of GDP, which is a good marker for 
countries in terms of health care, is appropriate.  At 9.7% for 
Canada it is clear that the 14.2% in the United States does not 
give better health care, does not give better perinatal mortality 
or better health in all the other markers we now have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am encouraged.  We need principles and values.  Then we can 
form a plan and only then can we cost it out.  The health 
transition fund is helping us with these three conferences, the 
last of which concluded today on pharmacare, information 
structures and home care.  We still do not have consensus on 
exactly what is the right thing to do.  We cannot in any way 
allocate budgets until we know what we want to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In pharmacare there is still a debate on whether it should be a 
single payer or whether we should patch the holes in the 
patchwork quilt.  In information structure we know we need an 
ability to be able to measure quality as we go so that we can 
then allocate resources appropriately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Information technology is imperative.  We are still overcoming 
the stumbling blocks of privacy and confidentiality.  We must do 
those things first.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of home care we need research into health care 
delivery and we still need to debate who is doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the minister of health eloquently articulated the 
principles and values and the priority of this government to 
maintain the confidence of Canadians in our health care 
system.  We recognize that when medicare was designed health care 
was delivered in hospitals by doctors and nurses.  Times have 
changed and we must now evaluate that delivering medically necessary 
services to Canadians cannot depend on the building in which 
the care is delivered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must move on to a new system so that Canadians do not lose 
confidence in their system.  We as a government are committed to 
that and we will not allow the slippery slope of two tier 
medicine that happens when Canadians lose confidence in the 
system.  We have to do our homework.  We develop a plan and then 
together we can go together with the post-budget consultations 
and plan for the budget of 1999, the health care budget. 
<P><A NAME="LINK257"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the constituents I represent I think have 
a correct sense that the country is not functioning anywhere near 
its economic potential.  They know they are generally worse off 
this year than in past years and they know that the average 
person is not confident about their financial future.  Neighbours 
talk about the weather but soon they break into groans of dismay 
or sad laughter of hopeless resignation that the federal 
government just does not care.  They are saying that it knows 
little about their financial realities, the real truth about 
families and what they face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My neighbours may not be experts in macroeconomic and the 
doublespeak of the annual budget speech.  However, they did have 
some reasonable expectations this time around and they were sadly 
disappointed.  It was not extreme but reasonable to desire that 
the federal government live within its means and not spend more 
each year than it takes in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal Liberals were excruciatingly slow to get this 
country to the balanced budget situation, and in hindsight the 
numbers reveal that the most prudent course would have been a 
balance last year after the debacle of the Conservatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their government was replaced in October 1993 and the Liberal's 
spending control really began with the 1994-95 budget.  However, 
like in 1984 when there was a national mood and general public 
will to quickly get the national finances in order, the Liberal 
government dithered and we wound up with worse pain and unneeded 
deeper financial wounds to heal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a big missed opportunity in 1984, and again in 1994 
there was brief hope but it was soon dashed with another big 
disappointment when the Liberals set such an anemic response to a 
Canadian financial situation that was by then almost out of 
control.  We plodded so slowly toward a balanced budget but we 
failed to reap the benefits of earned confidence from the 
international community and we dragged out the pain of internal 
disruption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also achieved a balanced budget through massive tax hikes 
rather than a more appropriate balance of spending restraint.  We 
got to the right economic position in the wrong way, in a 
needlessly painful way, especially concerning health care.  The 
Liberal's cut on that national trust was heartless.  It reflected 
their lack of competence to cut elsewhere, to stop the giveaways 
to favourites.  They failed to be realistic with program review 
concerning measuring the actual results of much of their program 
spending.  Then from a balanced budget Canada is again 
disappointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Setting a right course for budgets is not all that difficult 
when a government listens and strives to be accountable to the 
community.  The Liberals are weak in view of the national 
challenges because of that very fact.  They are not committed to 
local community accountability.  They have too many vested 
interests.  They care too much about other agendas and they are 
too weak to control them.  The needy average Canadian at the 
lower end of the economic order becomes only a Liberal 
afterthought or a mere slogan.  The Liberals lack the 
accountability to what average Canadians want and need, and this 
is revealed in the numbers of every budget since the election in 
1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents have told me that they agreed with the opinion 
of the leader of the Reform Party when he said:  “What a 
disappointment.  For the first time in a generation a prime 
minister could have charted a new course for our country. 
He could have set us on the path to debt reduction and tax 
relief, but he blew it”.

question period following the February 24 budget speech.  What is 
resonating in British Columbia is exactly this, debt reduction 
and tax relief.  It seems that those from the left are also 
attempting to adopt the notion of fiscal responsibility, albeit 
with a radical twist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP member for Qu'Appelle recently made some interesting 
comments in a newspaper article when he stated: “The party and 
the left in general now has realized that we have to have now a 
sound financial base”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This goes back to the CCF and Tommy Douglas.  The first thing he 
preached is that you can't do anything for people unless you have 
your financial house in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The radical twist is that the NDP now wants the government to 
allocate large amounts of money on new program spending while 
maintaining strong fiscal practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to suggest to the member for Qu'Appelle that a 
sound financial base includes debt reduction.  We cannot ignore 
the debt.  As of today, it is moving frighteningly close to $585 
billion or more.  Canada's fiscal house is not in order.  It is 
not even close. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals in the last election promised that of the surplus, 
half would go to new spending and the other half would go to debt 
reduction and tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians may have been impressed by this notion, however 
Reformers knew very well that, like so many broken promises 
before, this was just another to throw on the heap of promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals promised to make changes to the North American Free 
Trade Agreement and they did not.  The Liberals promised to scrap 
the EH-101 helicopter deal.  At first they did and then the 
pressure got to them and they were forced to renege on that 
promise.  Then there was the infamous promise to scrap, kill and 
abolish the GST.  They did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These were major policy decisions upon which governments are 
made or unmade, a series of broken promises.  I cannot speak for 
all Canadians, but I can speak for my own constituents in New 
Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby and I can assume that their 
feelings are similar to those from other cities and provinces and 
territories.  They simply want promises kept.  It is as simple as 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it so tough for this government to understand what is 
meant by integrity in politics?  Government members sit in their 
seats, smirking, thinking about how wonderful it is to have 
gotten away with broken promises.  They said things to get 
elected which they had no intention of keeping.  These actions 
will come back to haunt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I watched the newspapers quite closely following the budget.  It 
was important to me to see how the others reacted, in many cases 
columnists and financial institutions in the private sector with 
their finger on the pulse of the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to read a couple of the quotes that I pulled from the 
papers: “The government's approach in this budget falls 
far short of providing adequate emphasis on debt reduction”. 
That is Ernst & Young's analysis of the 1998 federal budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another one: “Lower tax rates would generate more spending, 
jobs and income.  They would increase Canada's attractiveness for 
new investment and improve the quantity and quality of job 
opportunities, particularly among our youth”.  That was also 
from the Ernst & Young analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another quote: “For a situation in which balanced budgets are 
being forecast for the years ahead, there is not nearly enough 
relief for overburdened taxpayers who have taken the hits for 
deficit reduction”.  That was Neville Nankivell of the 
<I>Financial Post</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the Canadian Chamber of Commerce:  “The federal budget 
sets its sights on the wrong target by focusing on spending 
rather than taking strong action to pay down the massive $583 
billion national debt.  The federal debt translates into $19,000 
for every man, woman and child”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are being squeezed to death and they are pleading for 
tax breaks, yet the finance minister feels that Canadians want 
more program spending.  Did the minister not consult with the 
average citizen to see what they really needed most and wanted? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the average citizen really tell the minister that what was 
needed was a $2.5 billion millennium scholarship fund that would 
only affect 6% of all students in Canada and would discriminate 
against students who choose open public universities that do not 
take taxpayer money through direct support? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the minister believe that Canadians would accept a tax 
increase to pay for new program spending of paid day care while 
discriminating against parents who sacrifice income for one 
parent to stay at home to look after their own?  Absolutely not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister does not care what ordinary Canadians think because 
they have expanded their discriminatory ways.  The only thing 
that the minister cares about is finding new methods to reclaim 
the old Liberal ways of spend, spend, spend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform's budget plan says there is a need to revise the 
Income Tax Act regulations to end discrimination against parents 
who provide child care at home and also ensure equitable 
treatment for one income child care at home.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Thankfully this year's budget is balanced but now is not the 
time to open up overall spending again.  Canada cannot continue 
down that path.  Our fiscal house is not in order.  The finance 
minister cannot claim victory.  There is still a tremendous 
amount of work to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moody's Investor Service of New York has indicated that it is 
not ready to reinstate Canada's highly coveted triple A rating. 
It says that the success of this budget was due to extremely good 
luck due to the upturn in the economy and tax increases.  This 
says to me that the government could have done so much more. Had 
the government attacked the debt Moody's may have been compelled 
to boost the national credit rating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to close by saying that though things may not look very 
good, Reform is not going to give up.  In 1993 we came to Ottawa 
with ideas that made sense and they make even more sense now. The 
vision we have for this country is sound and we have stood by our 
principles and our promises.  We believe in Canada and we believe 
strongly that it can recover from this fiscal crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I desire to serve to bring a better Canada to everyone 
regardless of economic situation, and with more economic 
compassion we can do better as we enter the next millennium.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay—Atikokan, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it feels like a very short time ago, but a little over 
four years ago I as a newcomer to the House of Commons heard my 
first budget presentation by the hon. Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It brought a little apprehension to me because after listening I 
believed what he was saying.  He said that we could do what was 
necessary to achieve our deficit target of 3% of GDP and we would 
repair the disaster that was left to us by previous 
administrations.  Naturally I had faith in his plan, a plan that 
was laid before us.  However, I am going to be very honest, there 
were some reservations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did I have these reservations in my mind?  It was simply 
because I as a student of the political scene had followed the 
34th session of Parliament during Brian Mulroney's government and 
had watched the hon. minister of finance, Mr. Wilson, time and 
time again make predictions and discover that he was always way 
off in his predictions.  I was a little fearful that maybe that 
would be a permanent sort of occurrence that happened with every 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately with my faith I knew that we could achieve the 
target.  However, not in my wildest dreams did I think we might 
be in the position that we are today, balancing the budget so 
quickly and so far ahead of schedule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sure, I am ecstatic about this situation and proud but I am also 
relieved to see that the promises made back then have been 
fulfilled and then some.  We have a balanced budget and Canadians 
should be proud.  Their efforts and sacrifices have paid off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we have all made sacrifices.  We all know the vast majority 
of companies in this country have debts.  We know the vast 
majority of households in this country have debts. However, there 
comes a time, whether in a corporation, a company, a business or 
in a household, when some decisions have to be made.  We cannot 
have expenditures exceeding income.  That is when the sacrifices 
have to be made.  In a household that is when the husband and 
wife get together and say they cannot afford this or that and 
must make a decision.  They have to curtail their spending.  They 
decide that the wife will not get a fur coat this winter but will 
get it when they can afford it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, sacrifices of that nature had to be made on a 
personal basis by all Canadians in order for us to achieve the 
targets that we have in a little over four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a long time educator, I was particularly pleased to see the 
efforts that were made to improve the situation that faces our 
students. Improvements for the management of student debt, the 
provision of tax relief for interest payments on student loans 
and the granting of increases in funding for advanced research 
and for graduate students were most welcome announcements.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all are aware of the fact that we have done quite a few 
things by implementing certain measures in past budgets as well 
as this one.  I predict that there will be many more measures in 
budgets in the years ahead.  These measures will help many to 
survive and benefit from their involvement in the post-secondary 
educational system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point this out to all the august members of the 
House of Commons who are here to listen to my presentation 
tonight.  Just about everything the budget implements has a 
direct or indirect bearing on the educational development of each 
and every citizen of this country.  Whether they be health, 
agriculture or industry, whatever measures are implemented will 
have positive spin-offs as far as learning processes are 
concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite popular support for this educational budget initiative, 
we are still hearing complaints from the opposition.  For 
instance, Premier Bouchard and his Bloc allies have claimed that 
the millennium scholarship fund represents interference in 
provincial jurisdiction.  Others also complain about that very 
same issue.  The reality of the matter is that his position is 
seriously at odds with the sentiment of his constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A survey which was taken last fall by a major polling company 
indicated that the notion of a scholarship program was widely 
popular in Quebec, so much so that only 6% of Quebeckers opposed 
the concept of a scholarship fund.  This is clear cut evidence 
that the Bloc and Mr. Bouchard are seriously out of touch with 
their constituents, as are other premiers of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last weekend I was very fortunate to have spent three days in 
Montreal.  On Friday night I spent over two hours with four 
students, three from McGill University and one from a college. 
They pointed out to me that they were not opposed to any 
federally funded initiative that would help people in 
post-secondary educational systems in their province, provided 
that it was fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I asked for their definition of fairness they said “What 
is good for the goose is good for the gander.  If we can get it, 
it must be equally available to someone else in another province. 
Whatever they get in British Columbia we should also receive”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An interesting point emerged.  They felt that fairness could 
only be achieved through national federal programs.  That is 
quite obvious.  When there are as many provinces and partners as 
there are in this federation, which represent a variety of 
ideological political positions and which have a variety of 
strategies for achieving their goals, there will be great 
discrepancies between and among each and every province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only way we can get uniformity and the only way we can 
maintain a degree of fairness is to have a nationally instituted, 
initiated, administered program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the real problem is that Mr. Bouchard has a serious 
problem allowing young Quebeckers to be aware of the fact that 
Canada contributes moneys to their education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at what is happening in the province of 
Ontario.  There have been a lot of complaints about the transfer 
payments.  We know that the 30% tax cut pledge of the Mike Harris 
government will cost that province $4.8 billion each year. 
This represents money that could have been used for education and 
health care in Ontario.

<A HREF="#LINKT133"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This tax cut in the province of Ontario amounts to approximately 
five times more than the federal transfer reductions to Ontario 
in 1998 and 1999.  Rarely does a premier of any province mention 
the transfer of tax credits which is another strategy we have 
agreed upon to transfer money directly to the provincial coffers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Higher and higher levels of education are now necessary in order 
for Canadians to adequately participate in today's job market.  I 
am not only concerned about the job market, but also about 
quality of life.  It is absolutely essential that we be the 
guardians of the individuals in this country.  That is the main 
purpose of a government, to protect its citizens, to see to it 
that their quality of life is enhanced on an ongoing basis, to 
see that its citizens grow.  We must bring about those strategies 
to guarantee that all people in Canada will continue to progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on for another two or three hours talking about all 
the wonderful things that have happened, are happening and will 
happen under this government. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK259"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, like 
you and everybody else in the House, I am really eager to wrap up 
this debate, which is of concern to all our fellow citizens, 
since we are talking about the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am extremely disappointed by the budget brought down by the 
finance minister. He is known to be somewhat undemonstrative, 
with a lack of vision and imagination, as shown in previous 
budgets.  What we did not know, however, was how little concern 
the Minister of Finance and his government had for social issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you who are concerned with social justice, can you 
understand how this government, in a context of budget surplus, 
the first in a number of years, can give no thought to those 
people who are our society's most disadvantaged and who need the 
government's help? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have hoped to see much greater concern in this budget 
over the social role of the banks.  I would like to give you an 
example of the situation in the United States since 1977, when 
the Democrats passed a certain bill.  It certainly cannot be said 
that the United States does not foster freedom of enterprise. 
Well, since 1977, they have legislation that requires banks to 
become involved in underprivileged communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation annually reviews a public report, which 
obviously receives a lot of attention from consumers.  The 
report, released in June, evaluates the social behaviour of 
banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there one good reason why such legislation would not be well 
received in Canada?  There is one: we need a government that has 
some backbone, that has vision and that can stand up to the 
financial world.  We know that we are not talking about this kind 
of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like you, Mr. Speaker, I am a great traveller and, undaunted by 
a challenge, I went to Washington three months ago. 
There I met members of the American Banking Association, 
businessmen and consumer groups and I was told about all the good 
this sort of legislation brought about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I got the list of investments. If members want to obtain a copy, 
I would be delighted to circulate this list. 
Since 1977, American banks have invested $356 billion in local 
communities?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did Canadian banks do? Throughout the world, conventional 
wisdom has it that Canada is the easiest country of all for 
banking. It is a well-known fact that Canada is a very well 
protected market for bankers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened in Canada? We have four major chartered banks 
which have made record profits. In 1994, profits stood at $4 
billion, but they reached $7 billion last year, and there is no 
reason to believe this trend will abate. 
In this context of banks getting richer and richer, with our 
Canadian borders closed to foreign competitors, banks have 
resorted to the most drastic streamlining ever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that since 1991, banks have laid off one way 
or another 10,000 employees. In the next ten years, they are 
expected to lay off 35,000 more. All of this, when profits are at 
a record level and the return on common equity has never been so 
high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should this Parliament remain indifferent and silent, 
callously silent, about the social role banks could play? 
In many communities experiencing a great deal of poverty and 
unemployment, where it would be important for the banks to get 
involved in the development of the local economy, banks are 
conspicuously absent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the riding of Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, for example, 
which I believe you had the chance to visit recently, Mr. 
Speaker. The number of underprivileged people there is quite 
high. But I hasten to add that there is also an intense community 
involvement, so that for each of the existing problems, we have 
community resources to help individuals through their particular 
situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seniors in my riding tell me that 20 years ago, we had about ten 
branches of the various chartered banks. Believe it or not, no 
more than two are still there. 
They tell me that there are no banks in Saint-Henri any more. If 
it were not for institutions like the caisses populaires, it 
would be impossible for people to access basic financial 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can a Minister of Finance responsible for preparing a budget, 
one with any feelings, remain cruelly silent on the question of 
financial institutions?  Are members aware that, across Canada, 
there are 600,000 Canadians who have no bank account, because the 
existing rules demand identity documents, and some branches even 
require them to have a job, and they therefore do not have access 
to basic financial services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that it must be made perfectly clear that the banks 
have acted like highwaymen, like Shylocks, like thieves, without 
any respect for consumers. 
In major cities, there are voices asking that we, the law 
makers, regardless of political affiliation, take action to get 
the banks to shape up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that in the next few days, we could adopt a community 
investment bill, as they call it in the United States. We could 
give the Superintendent of Financial Institutions the mandate of 
assessing them on the basis of widely known and accepted 
criteria; this could be done in co-operation with community 
groups, representatives from the banking community and the 
private sector. Banks should have to account every year, in a 
report which would be made public, for their actions, investments 
and community involvement.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You know what I am like.  I am certainly not someone who shrinks 
from political life.  Faced with the problem of the banks, I 
introduced a private member's bill that, as luck would have it, 
is now before the House and should be debated in the coming 
days, probably in early April. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on the solidarity of all my colleagues.  Can it be that, 
for once and for all in the House, we are going to ask the banks 
to behave like true corporate citizens with a stake in their 
community?  It requires a certain amount of political courage. 
It requires that we work together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not given up the hope of creating a coalition with a 
number of members to pressure this government to provide 
legislation such as they have in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I need only your support now.  I know you support 
such action, and I am sure that legislation of this kind 
ensuring social justice will, in the end, be passed in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pursuant to order made earlier this day, the 
motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 2 
p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
