<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker, this is my first speech in the House as Minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec and Minister responsible for the Francophonie.  I will therefore begin, if I may, with a few words to the people of my riding.  I would like to thank the people of Brossard—La Prairie for their confidence in me.  These are people who know how to build bridges and work together for the common good. I am very proud of them.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very pleased to mention how proud I am of my own people in Brossard—La Prairie on this occasion of my first rising in the House after being appointed Minister  of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec and Minister responsible for the Francophonie.</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am pleased to have the opportunity today to speak to the members of this House on the occasion of second reading of Bill C-9 to establish the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec, which the Prime Minister did me the honour of entrusting to me on July 20.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill defines the framework within which the government intends to address the regional economic development of Quebec.  Why have such a bill?  First of all, because the agency as we know it operates under the terms of a series of orders in council under the Department of Industry Act.   By providing a legislative framework governing the operations of the department and confirming its status, prerogatives, powers and authorities, we hope to make the minister responsible more directly accountable.  There is also a requirement for the agency to submit to Parliament a comprehensive report of activities by December 31, 2006 and every five years thereafter. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second purpose of this bill is to establish consistency in the status of the federal departments responsible for regional development.  It provides the agency with a legal basis on its own right, modelled after the Atlantic Opportunities Agency, ACOA, which of course looks after the Atlantic provinces, and  the Department of Western Economic Diversification for the west, both of which have had that status for several years. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last, the bill is a testimony to the commitment of the Government of Canada to support regional development in our country through regional economic development agencies, in cooperation and in sync with our provincial counterparts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill before the House today establishes the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec, commonly known as  Canada Economic Development or CED, since the use of acronyms is so widespread in Ottawa. The bill confirms its role   as a federal agency whose mandate is to  foster economic development opportunities for the regions of Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, this bill does not make any change to the agency's mandate or goals as set by my department.  So, how can we describe our mandate in simple terms? In order to become or remain competitive, our businesses, and especially our small and medium size businesses, often need some help, and they can count on us. To compete against the best, businesses must benefit from unconditional support in terms of research and development,  and they can count on us. To revitalize or preserve the vitality of our regions, they can count on us. To help create a climate that would persuade our youth to stay in or to come back to their region, career opportunities have to be provided, and they can count on us. To stimulate the economy in our regions whose main towns are single-industry based, and therefore, of course, more vulnerable, the economy needs to be diversified, and they can count on us. To help communities move away from dependency and stand on their own feet, they can count on us. To grow, businesses have to export and rely on some support and networking, and they can count on us. They can count on us for everything that brings dignity to workers, confidence in the future, some comfort and a certain enthusiasm. We are there for the families. That is the beauty of our department. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I am concerned, the  economy  is not an end in itself. It is only an instrument to enhance individual and collective well-being. That is how I see the mandate of my department.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To fulfill this mandate in the past few years, Canada Economic Development has focused its efforts on achieving three strategic results, that is, SME development, improvement of  the environment of regional economic development and development or renewal of collective infrastructure. Our development strategies are tailored and adapted to regional and even local needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is precisely to ensure that our strategies respond to the needs of the people that the bill gives the agency the responsibility of directing and coordinating federal policies and programs in relation to the development and diversification of the economy of Quebec regions. </p><A NAME="T1010"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1010"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1005"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1010)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill confirms the role of the agency and its minister in the coordination of federal policies and programs, the achievement of an integrated federal strategy, with the cooperation of other relevant federal departments and agencies, and the promotion—I did not say defence, but promotion—of Quebec's interests in the development of national policies and programs in its area of activity. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ability to listen, this very fine synchronization, this intimate  knowledge of the field and the players are the trademarks of this department that I am honoured to head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All members—I repeat all members—who, at some time or another, have been interested in regional development recognize this quality over and above any political partisanship. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, it will be incumbent on the agency to establish and maintain close partnerships to properly play the role of  unifier and coordinator with other federal departments. Equally important, it is incumbent on the Canada Economic Development to work closely with the Government of Quebec, throughout the province and in all regions. This has been a common practice for a long time. This bill confirms this desire.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, complementary does not necessarily mean identical. Sometimes Quebec City and Ottawa do not have identical goals. Complementary means, for example,  that Quebec City is able to work with certain businesses because they share similar goals, while Ottawa can support other businesses for the same reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, it benefits everyone. The bill also recognizes the importance of working in close collaboration with all actors in the field—Economic Development Canada, entrepreneurs, development agencies, research centres and so on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I want to pay tribute most emphatically to all the employees in our 14 regional offices and head office, who enhance our reputation through the quality of their work, their knowledge of the environment and their professionalism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to remind the House that the Government of Canada created its first regional development policy in the 1960s, thus recognizing that the needs and realities of the country's various regions sometimes required interventions to ensure equality of opportunity for all citizens. This principle has even been recognized in the Constitution, in section 36.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let this be perfectly clear: ensuring equality of opportunity does not mean giving everyone, everywhere,  the same thing. Rather, it means to make sure that everyone, everywhere is treated fairly. Today, the needs that once justified our regional development activities in Quebec have not disappeared, but they have evolved a great deal. In order to meet  these changing conditions and take advantage of them, since 2001, the agency has been emphasizing innovation and the knowledge economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last five years, the relative share of financial assistance granted by the agency to innovation projects has increased considerably, from 24% of total financial assistance in 1999-2000 to 61% in 2003-04.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the knowledge economy, we have provided support for a number of research centre projects. For example, there is our support for the plan to acquire highly specialized equipment for ISMER, the  ocean sciences institute of the Université du Québec à Rimouski. I could also mention the Aluminium Technology Centre in the Saguenay. Here I should thank our former colleague, André Harvey, who worked very hard on this project for his region.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I could also mention the Aerospace Manufacturing Technology Centre in Montreal. Of course, this one is of particular interest to me, because such firms as Pratt &amp; Whitney, Héroux-Devtek and others, which are very significant in the aerospace and aeronautical field, are located in my region. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our communities are our greatest assets. Our recent throne speech said what makes our communities strong is the willingness of men and women from allwalks of life to take responsibility for their future and for one another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The solution to the problems in the regions is not to be found in the ivory towers of our capital cities, but in the regions themselves. Communities are in a better position to find local solutions to local problems, to meet the challenges, and to achieve their potential.</p><A NAME="T1015"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1015)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agency's role is to support regional entrepreneurship with all the resources available and help the regions channel their energy toward strategic projects for their development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For over 20 years, the Canadian government has been active in the communities and regions through the community futures program, the goal of which is to encourage communities to take charge of their own future. In the context of this program, the Canadian government is cooperating with 57 community futures development corporations, or CFDCs, and 9  business development centres, or BDCs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth strategy which CED is implementing is an example of action by CFDCs. Its main goal is to help young men and women in rural areas of Quebec fulfill their dream of having their own business in their area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From November 1997 to March 31, 2003, the youth strategy helped fund 2,731 entrepreneurs, promoting the creation, growth and modernization of 2,250 business in rural regions of Quebec. That is why it should be emphasized that, for each dollar invested by CED, a total of $7 was invested. This is a remarkable performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better yet, the youth strategy helps young people who migrated to urban centres to study or work, to come back to their region and start their own business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the Community Futures Program, Canada Economic Development supports 13 CEDC, community economic development corporations, which provide services and support to community organizations and SMEs  in disadvantaged urban areas in Montreal, Quebec City, Sherbrooke and Gatineau.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also contribute to the  maintenance  and development of  community infrastructures in close cooperation with the Quebec Government. I am referring of course to the Canada-Quebec infrastructure agreement. This program is a resounding success. Allow me to pay a tribute to my counterpart, Jean-Marc Fournier, the Quebec minister, for his cooperation, hard work and professionalism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial support provided through this program should help in the short term to improve Quebec community and transportation infrastructures, develop new technologies, and improve  the management of drinking water, waste water and solid waste.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agency intends to develop the social economy sector to better  meet the needs expressed by the communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Quebec alone, there are over 7,000 social economy businesses . With annual sales of over $17 billion, they employ more than  125,000 people. These businesses  are rooted in the community and play an essential role in regional and rural development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of March 31, 2004, there were over 2,100 projects across Quebec receiving  support from the agency overall. These projects represent a contribution of  close to $4 billion to Quebec regional economies. The agency is involved  to the tune of $1 billion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These numbers speak for themselves. They show how much the various projects help strengthen the economy in our regions. Of course, since the good economic health of Canada depends in part on a vigorous Quebec economy, good results in Quebec can only have a beneficial impact on the Canadian economy as a whole, where Quebec continues to  make a difference.</p><A NAME="T1020"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1020"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1020)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These numbers are impressive, of course, but the reality they represent is even more so. Whenever the Economic Development Agency becomes involved in  a project, our fellow citizens benefit, jobs are created and thousands of lives take a turn for the better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take for example the quartz production plant in Cap-Chat, Gaspésie, where 60 new high technology jobs  will not only help families to earn a living but to develop expertise in job intensive areas.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cooperative La Relève in the Asbestos RCM is another good example. We have decided to support it because it has chosen to tackle the exodus of young people to urban centres. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example would be Renyco, a company that specializes in  manufacturing hardwood flooring in Thurso. The Outaouais regional office has invested a total of $342,000, but thanks to the developer's know-how, finished products are of a better quality, productivity has increased by 15%, sales have tripled and the company has created about thirty jobs in rural areas. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we wanted  the development to be part of the surrounding realities, we have adopted regional intervention strategies. These strategies were based on consultations, joint actions and mobilization of regional economic stakeholders. While enhancing local expertise, these strategies allow every region to define how each one of them  can use the Agency's programs and services to maximum benefit. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regional development is a complex issue. You cannot talk about it without taking environmental, social and cultural issues into account. It is thus essential to focus on   the synergy of expertise provided by various departments. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not sure that I will have time to say everything I wanted to say, but I would like to come back to two elements. The first is the quality of the cooperation and the complementarity that exists between my department and the Quebec government in order to better serve the public, which expects nothing less. This regional development  is in keeping with the desire expressed in the Speech from the Throne. We are being true to that mandate. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mandate should have a broad humanistic vision. In this regard, if you allow me, I would like to conclude with an experience I had not so long ago, in  one of my very first events as Minister of Economic Development Canada. I referred to that activity a bit earlier. I am talking about Sural, in Cap-Chat. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know as well as I do that, when an announcement is made somewhere, generally, one meets with a few elected officials, some local stakeholders, perhaps the heads of organizations and members who deign to have an interest in those matters that come up. In general, that is the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Cap-Chat, the room was full. The people were there, along with local elected officials. All the officials had mobilized to show how important this was. I saw people who, after long despairing,  felt renewed hope for the first time in the Gaspé Peninsula.   In their small municipality of 7,000, a plant was opening, which, when fully operational,  would create 100 jobs. This is the aim of human dignity, which comes of the collective work which we, Economic Development Canada, have done in partnership with the Government of Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local authorities got involved. Why would a business from Venezuela set up a plant in Cap-Chat? It looked totally incredible in the beginning. The community brought it about. It did it through its strength and its resolve. We were there to support that project, just as the Quebec Government was, and I am very proud of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atmosphere in the room was electrifying. To me, the hope that the Sural project generated in the eyes of these people from the Gaspe is worth the recognition and the tributes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank the people from Cap-Chat for giving me such a taste for my department.</p><A NAME="T1025"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1025"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1025)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1003954"></A><a HREF="#Int-1003956"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1003904"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière—Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to the speech on Bill C-9. We hear that this bill will create a department of regional development in Quebec. This is the only time I heard the word “Quebec” in this broad definition that the minister has just given. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously partnership is involved. Agencies are mentioned. However, I still feel that Bill C-9 shows one again that the federal government is interfering where it has no business. In addition, I also think that the government is trying to convince the Quebec regions, which where depopulated because of this government's employment insurance policies,  that they will be repopulated. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot imagine all the political decisions that have been  made by this government. There is employment insurance. There is also the present crisis in the textile industry as well as  the situation in agriculture and in the manufacturing industry, which is a soft sector. All these are international responsibilities, responsibilities that fall to the Government of Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, this is where the federal government should focus its actions, instead of once again creating regional duplication in Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I ask the minister if he is ready to announce that he will work in close cooperation with the Quebec government on the project, meaning that he will hand over  the federal funds to the Quebec department responsible for the regions and that the Province of Quebec will manage the funds because it is Quebec that     is responsible for its regions.</p><A NAME="Int-1003956"></A><a HREF="#Int-1003958"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1003954"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Jacques Saada: </b>Mr. Speaker, this statement was quite interesting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I would  remind the hon. member that this is simply an administrative bill. I talked about the mandate. However, the bill itself does not change a thing in the mandate. Therefore, I suggest that he read the bill before asking questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, he talked about jurisdictions. I will remind him that section  36.1 of the Constitution is extremely clear about the role of the federal government:</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is absolutely no mention of “regional development” in the Constitution. What gives them the right to  usurp power that simply does not exist under the Canadian Constitution?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the member deplores the fact that the word “Québec” occurs only once. I remind him that the agency's name is Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec. If that is not enough, there must be some comprehension problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In  conclusion, if I may, he referred to textiles, among other things. He said  it involves an international responsibility and, therefore, it has to be addressed. I remind him that  Economic Development Canada is managing softwood lumber support programs. The member contradicts himself for  reasons that have nothing to do with the substance but a lot to do with a regrettable political bias.  </p><A NAME="Int-1003958"></A><a HREF="#Int-1003961"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1003956"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Odina Desrochers: </b>Mr. Speaker, I am having a hard time understanding how the minister, who says he is responsible for regional development, can say  that that responsibility is conferred to him by the Canadian Constitution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am surprised also that the Liberals know their Canadian Constitution. Indeed, judging by their behaviour in the House, one can conclude that they are constantly at odds with the Canadian Constitution, because they are always invading provincial fields of jurisdiction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find that  reassuring, because a Liberal member has finally started to read his Constitution. In my opinion, this is good news today. That  said,  I hope he will also ask his colleagues to do the same, particularly all those who, since we came back on October 4, presented bills that fall under provincial jurisdiction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, the eloquent member for Outremont said that it was high time for his government to take care of federal jurisdictions.  I also hope that the eloquent member for Outremont, who seems to have some control over Quebec, will ask his colleagues to read the Constitution. Indeed, at the present time, they do not respect  the Constitution. They not only force it on us in 1982, but they do not even respect  it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When there are international and economic conflicts—and I call bilateral agreements that do not work conflict—it is not the textile industries that asked to be in trouble. It is this government which made the decision to remove import quotas two years in advance. When an economic situation is caused by a bilateral agreement or is about international trade, it is federal jurisdiction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am asking him if, instead of invading Quebec's fields of jurisdiction, he could look in his own yard and deal with the problems the regions of Quebec are facing because of his government.</p><A NAME="T1030"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1030"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1030)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1003961"></A><a HREF="#Int-1003963"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1003958"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Jacques Saada: </b>Mr. Speaker, as a Quebecker, I claim that Quebec is my backyard too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the negative comments that the hon. member  has made in relation to the interpretation of the Constitution, it is interesting to note that, had he read it, he would not have asked his first question. He would then have fully understood that regional development is not covered by the Constitution; therefore, the jurisdiction is shared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirdly, he talks about textiles. Why doesn't he mention the fact that we have earmarked $26.7 million to maintain a program that we had already undertaken to help textile workers improve their performance and their ability to compete and find more profitable markets? They talk, we act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one last thing I am quite interested in. These people live in the past. There is nothing I can do about that, I accept it, I have no alternative. We can choose between brooding over old quarrels and looking to what will be useful for the future of Gaspe, the Lower St. Lawrence, Sherbrooke, Montreal, research,  the return of young people to their region of origin; all these are exciting plans for the future, plans  that give hope.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of confining myself to the nonsense of a  misinterpreted past, I would rather focus on hope for the future of our youth and people in the regions. I will do it, with or without them.</p><A NAME="Int-1003963"></A><a HREF="#Int-1003965"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1003961"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Raynald Blais (Gaspésie—Îles-de-la-Madeleine, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, I did not really intend to address the issue at this time, but what I heard really made me sit up straight. It woke me up, but not in a positive way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the minister a question about the record of the agency, especially in the region of Gaspésie—Îles-de-la-Madeleine. Just before the election, they announced that about $35 million would be spent over three years. Those three years were stretched to five years, and by March 31, 2004, only $11 million had been spent. Is that a good record? I do not think so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What goes around comes around, so we are not about to be told what to do by a department whose goal is simply to become more visible, not more efficient. We should talk about efficiency. In terms of efficiency, Bernard Landry and his Parti Québécois government get top marks for what they did in the region of  Gaspésie—Îles-de-la-Madeleine.</p><A NAME="Int-1003965"></A><a HREF="#Int-1003967"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1003963"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Jacques Saada: </b>Mr. Speaker, let me say that seeing a Bloc member come to the defence of Mr. Landry makes me smile a little. I thought that he had been elected to the federal level to work on the federal scene, for the good of Quebec, and not to defend his big Péquiste brother on the other side of the street.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one thing that interests me. I do not believe that the member opposite quite gets it that, when we intervene for the softwood lumber industry, we have to intervene in a way that does not open the door to justifying the Americans' misinterpretation of this problem. We cannot help  the softwood lumber industry directly so that it is perceived as a subsidy and have the Americans come after us on this. We have to help in a smart way to diversify, to seek niches that will allow for the development of regions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a third thing that I would like to focus on a little. I would like the Bloc to explain its reasoning. It tells Quebec that it will defend its interests. Now we create an agency that will be totally at arm's length from industry and that will focus exclusively on Quebec. The first thing that members want to do is vote against this to abdicate their responsibilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They want to be elected to not take responsibilities. If this is what they want, the people will make a judgment. Certainly, we, on this side, will not abdicate our responsibilities. We are the government and we will be there to help the regions of Quebec. </p><A NAME="T1035"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1035"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1035)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1003967"></A><a HREF="#Int-1003974"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1003965"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. James Moore (Port Moody—Westwood—Port Coquitlam, CPC): </b>This is my first speech in this House  as a member of the Official Opposition and of the Conservative Party with you in the chair, Mr. Speaker.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to rise on behalf of my party to speak to Bill C-9, an act to establish the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Conservative Party supports this bill whose intent stems directly from paragraph 28 of the Policy Statement of the Conservative Party of Canada.</p>

</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Bill C-9 is very straightforward and uncontroversial. It creates the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec out of a program in the Industry Canada portfolio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, a program in the Industry Canada portfolio is being transformed into an agency. The staff from the former program will be maintained; their responsibilities will remain the same and their activities will continue. All that will change is the letterhead and business cards to   reflect the agency's new legal status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will more or less  place the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec on an equal footing with the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-9 will establish for Quebec an economic development agency reporting to Parliament through its own minister. We can see how  its legal status is similar to that of the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, which was  established un 1985 under the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the purpose of the bill is mainly a name change, Bill C-9 also allows the government to say it is committed to regional development without spending a cent of new money. In this respect, Bill C-9 is brilliant and allows the Liberal government to do what it likes best: be all talk and no action. This way, a visionless government enjoys another day of doing nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regions need development, and the government's response is to change the business cards. That is all this bill is really about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we are in favour of regional development and we believe that the responsibilities and structures of regional development agencies should  be the same across the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, I will now turn to the creation of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, Bill C-9 was given  first reading on October 8. Clause 8 of Bill C-9 says:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From that we conclude that the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec will come into being when Bill C-9 comes into force.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, that is not so. In the summary of Bill C-9, we are told that the transformation from  a former industry program under Industry Canada to a development agency answering to Parliament through its own minister has already happened. I quote the summary: </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a minority government, which means there are more opposition members than government members. In light of this situation, we presume there is a commitment to a spirit of democracy and to listening to all the voices from all the regions. We also presume that backbenchers will have a say in the establishment of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, in this debate, my opinion and the opinion of members from the other parties, particularly Liberal backbenchers, does not mean anything, because the agency, which is the focus of Bill C-9, already exists, and the changes affecting its legal status have already been implemented. Therefore, this debate is strictly an academic exercise without any concrete impact. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is sad to see that this government, which promised us that it would look at the needs and options relating to the reform of our democratic institutions, is asking us to debate a bill to create an agency that already exists. We must learn to judge this Prime Minister, based not on his words, but on his actions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we support the establishment of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec, I propose that all regional development agencies be on the same footing. We should promote regional development agencies that have similar responsibilities and structures right across the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the national level, there are three different models of regional development. Bill C-9 will create, for Quebec, a development agency that will be accountable to Parliament, through its own department. The Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency is a development agency that is accountable to the Minister of Industry. As for the Department of Western Economic Diversification, it is not an agency, but a real department with its own minister.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the agencies' objectives are slightly different. In the Maritimes and in Newfoundland and Labrador, the role of the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency is to promote Atlantic Canada's economic development opportunities, particularly income growth and job creation in that region. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In western Canada,  the Department of Western Economic Diversification is responsible for promoting economic development and diversification in that region, and the interests of that region during the development and implementation of policies, programs and operations under the national economic policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Quebec, the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec need only promote the development and diversification of the economy of the regions of Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Quebec, the federal government is proposing an agency to promote the development and diversification of the economy of the regions. In Atlantic Canada, there is a responsibility to increase revenues and create jobs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In western Canada, there is a department that promotes the interests of this region within the national economic policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is nice to know that the Gaspé does not need an agency to develop the growth of revenues and to create jobs. It is also encouraging to know that Quebeckers do not want a department in charge of promoting their interests within the national economic policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government may have consulted Quebeckers and been convinced that they did not need an agency to create jobs or grow revenues, or a department to promote their interests within the national economic policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is also possible that the government tried to get Quebeckers' opinion in the same spirit with which it presented this bill to Parliament. In other words, without too much consultation or attention to the response.</p><A NAME="T1045"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1045"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1045)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any event, this is a case of asymmetrical federalism. The Conservatives are in favour of regional development and thus, we will vote in favour of Bill C-9. However, we believe that the regional development agencies, such as the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec, have to be depoliticized and focus on drawing new investment from the private sector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the sponsorship scandal, it is very important that all agencies be depoliticized. In committee, Conservatives will do what they can to ensure that this agency is on equal footing with the other agencies, that it is free from any political influence and that it will serve Quebeckers, not just the Liberal Party of Canada.</p><A NAME="Int-1003974"></A><a HREF="#Int-1003977"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1003967"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière—Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to the speech my hon.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have liked to ask the hon. Conservative member, whose party always defends the provinces' jurisdictions, including Quebec's, if it would not have been preferable for this bill to let the Quebec government manage the region's money instead of an agency that is only looking to increase its visibility in Quebec?</p><A NAME="Int-1003977"></A><a HREF="#Int-1003979"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1003974"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. James Moore: </b>Mr. Speaker, in the Conservative Party, what we support in Canada really is equality in all regions of the country, from one end to the other. What we want to see is a federal government which respects the jurisdictions of provinces in an equal fashion in every region of this land.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not really what we are talking about right now. What we are deciding today, and this will be decided upon through a vote on this bill, is whether we support for Quebec what we already have for the Atlantic region and for the West.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought that the Bloc Québécois would support a bill which would put Quebec on an equal footing with other regions of Canada in terms of national finances. That is why we support Bill C-9.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not agree with the current program of the federal government concerning regional economic development. We do not agree with the program and with the theory underlying the Liberal government's ideas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the reality is that bill would, in our opinion, be in the interest of Quebeckers. It would improve the life of economic regions and their development. That is why we support this bill.</p><A NAME="Int-1003979"></A><a HREF="#Int-1003981"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1003977"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is my first question:  Would the hon. member be prepared to discuss this issue with me when it is debated in committee? I am quite ready to look at where and why there are differences, and to explain them, if necessary. I am open-minded.</p>

We can talk about ways to improve this bill. If he is ready to make compromises, so are we. </p><A NAME="T1050"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1050"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1050)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1003983"></A><a HREF="#Int-1003985"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1003981"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Odina Desrochers: </b>Mr. Speaker, I would like to come back to the arguments I presented earlier on to my Conservative colleague.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that his federalist perspective inclines him to give some weight to the principle according to which each region of Canada should get its fair share. But that is a federalist principle. For members of a party such as ours,  advocating the interests of Quebec exclusively, there is the conviction that it is not the job of the federal government to allocate  money in Quebec. The federal government should give the money to Quebec and Quebec, much more attuned to regional needs, should allocate  it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would his party be ready, within the framework of the amendments it wishes to put forward, to see money available at the federal level handed over to Quebec to administer on its own for the regions of Quebec?</p><A NAME="Int-1003985"></A><a HREF="#Int-1003987"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1003983"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. James Moore: </b>Mr. Speaker, as I was saying to the minister responsible for this bill, if the Bloc Québécois really has new ideas about this bill, and if that would be a better way to represent Quebec, then we would certainly be willing to consider that. I think we should support this bill, as should the Bloc Québécois.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the way that money should be allocated is open for debate. However, it would be a regrettable error for the Bloc Québecois to oppose this bill intended to enhance economic development in the Province of Quebec and the situation of Quebeckers. </p><A NAME="Int-1003987"></A><a HREF="#Int-1003989"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1003985"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Raynald Blais (Gaspésie—Îles-de-la-Madeleine, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, I would like the member to clarify his position on Bill C-9.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There could be some contradiction as to the creation of a department, because  in his speech, he seemed to say that it would not change a whole lot with regard to regional socio-economic problems compared with what an effective agency could do. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also understand that he is in favour of the bill. It is something different and I would like him to explain how on the one hand we can be supportive,  since it will not change much or not even anything, while saying that what is needed is not necessarily a department, but some action.  </p><A NAME="Int-1003989"></A><a HREF="#Int-1003991"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1003987"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. James Moore: </b>Mr. Speaker, in fact this bill will promote the development of a department answering to Parliament.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the member that there is really a problem, that there is an imbalance as far as the regional programs are concerned.  This is, in my opinion, where we disagree with the Liberal government. We need a balanced national program, a program that would cover the whole country. This is part of the political program that our party presented to Quebeckers and to Canadians in the last electoral campaign. This is what we support and this is what we want. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister just told us that he would be willing  to look at these propositions so there would be a balance to reflect the reality of our country in the economic development area. We would be willing to support this program and this approach. I do believe the minister when he says that he would be willing to discuss this proposition. We would be willing to discuss it too in order to make things better for Quebec within Canada. </p><A NAME="T1055"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1055"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1055)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1003991"></A><a HREF="#Int-1003993"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1003989"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

Does he not think, like me, that when one hides behind dogmas, it is the best way not to face reality and that, essentially, what concerns these members more than anything else is not the interest  of Quebec, but rather the interest of their option, which they pretend to be the interest of Quebec, which has never been demonstrated?</p><A NAME="Int-1003993"></A><a HREF="#Int-1003995"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1003991"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. James Moore: </b>I partly agree with what the minister just said. However, I must frankly tell the House and Canadians that I listen to everything that the Bloc Québécois tells us, because its agenda is to destroy our country and to use its money for a Quebec freed from Canada. All its agenda and its ideas are geared toward destroying our country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, we agree with its approach and its ideas on different things. However, finally—and this is why I look closely at its ideas and I really examine everything it says—, in every step that it wants to undertake here, in Ottawa, in relation to its agenda, its every move is to destroy our country. We should not ignore this reality. </p><A NAME="Int-1003995"></A><a HREF="#Int-1003998"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1003993"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Raynald Blais: </b>Mr. Speaker, I will just take a few seconds.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why I would encourage the Conservative member to examine this issue a little more closely.

It is therefore important to note the birth of this great builder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mouvement des caisses Desjardins is today the largest financial institution in Quebec and the sixth largest in Canada, with 5 million member-clients and total assets in excess of $100 billion.  Its strength depends on the skill and commitment of its 38,000-plus employees and close to 7,500 elected directors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The model designed by Alphonse Desjardins has spread to the United States and English Canada, where there are several major networks of credit unions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Beauce alone the caisses Desjardins employ 737 people and have contributed this past year close to $1 million to the community development fund and in sponsorships and donations. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alphonse Desjardins was a man with a strong vision for the world, and  his vision lives on.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close to 100,000 of our brave compatriots were involved in this campaign.  Allied troops landed in Sicily in 1943, where they had to contend with the dust and heat and the mountainous terrain in order to reach the towns and villages of Italy.  Let us remember today the sacrifices made by these heroes who served their country and the cause of human rights and freedom.  I salute them all. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As hon. members are aware, a number of my constituents in the riding of Alfred-Pellan  are originally from Italy.  They have come to realize how staunchly we defend the values we hold dear, and together we shall build a better future for Quebec.

Osteoporosis, currently affecting 1.4 million Canadians, is a disease that makes bones fragile and more likely to fracture. These fractures most commonly occur in the spine, hip and wrist. As a result, people affected by osteoporosis often require hospitalization and surgery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Osteoporosis is referred to as the silent thief because no symptoms are apparent until a fracture occurs. Luckily, once diagnosed, there is a variety of drug treatments that will help prevent further loss of bone density. A diet rich in calcium and vitamin D is also recommended for treatment and prevention of this disease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to recognize the contribution of many charities including the Osteoporosis Society of Canada. These organizations strive to educate the public about the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, and to support individuals affected by this disease.</p>

Many are on fixed incomes that have failed to keep up with rising expenses. The small increases in their incomes fail to keep pace with major spikes in expenses like rent, electricity and heating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government needs to be more proactive to ensure that those on fixed incomes are better able to address these increases faster. The lag time between cost spikes today and increases in their cheques later is creating undue hardship. Seniors in my riding are telling me that their cheques just went up $3 a month and their electricity costs have gone up $30 a month.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It benefits none of us to have our seniors skipping meals or medication just to make these budget adjustments. I know this is a problem right across Canada.  For this reason, I hope this government will act soon.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cascades is a major  international company that  recycles more than two million tons of paper and board annually. Leading edge de-inking technology and sustained research and development enable Cascades to create innovative, high-value-added products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want  to congratulate the brothers who built the company, Bernard, Laurent and Alain Lemaire, and all their employees on their success and their contribution to Quebec's economic development.</p>

I am inspired by the confidence they have shown in me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My purpose for rising today is to commend the residents of Surrey and our law enforcement community for being diligent and working together to curb auto theft in our city.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members may be aware from past comments in this place that in recent years Surrey has suffered some of the highest rates of auto theft in North America.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our police point out that residents have played a key role in reducing the problem by locking their vehicles, ensuring that nothing of value is left in them and using anti-theft devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For their part, the police have implemented a number of programs, not the least of which is the use of bait cars, a strategy which has proven exceptionally effective.  They have also turned up the heat on repeat offenders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The substantial decrease in auto theft in Surrey  in the first half of this year shows us that a community working together can make a difference.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to reiterate that the government has not made a decision on BMD at this point in time. First and foremost is the security of Canada and Canadians and the government will continue to do all it can to ensure that the obligation is met.</p>

Development Agency of Canada for the Regions
of Quebec Act
</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-9, an act to establish the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec, be read the second time and referred to a committee. </p><A NAME="Int-1004360"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004404"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004792"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Raynald Blais (Gaspésie—Îles-de-la-Madeleine, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, I thank you for this opportunity to speak today on Bill C-9 to establish the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will admit, to begin with, that I would much rather ask the following question: is there any future for the regions? For example,does Gaspésie—Îles-de-la-Madeleine, the region from which I come, have a future?  I think this is illustrative of the basic issue confronting us in connection with this bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be a good thing if the bill were aimed at improving the situation and permitting all the money allocated to local and regional development to go to Quebec, where there are resources and structures.  I do not want to see what is already in place shunted aside, the CFDC and other resources. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are certain resources already available on the federal level.  I would pay acknowledge the efforts of staff, both past and present, of Economic Development Canada or the CFDC, the community futures development corporations in the Quebec region.  I think there are 57 of these corporations in all and their contribution certainly deserves recognition.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Canada, when we talk about regions, when the issue is about my region, Gaspésie—Îles-de-la-Madeleine, for instance, we can say that that  word does not exist in the vocabulary. When we talk about regions in the Canadian sense of that term, we talk about Quebec as a whole. There are 18 regions in Quebec. In the federal system, one does not talk about a region per se, such as Gaspésie-les-Îles or Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean or others, but about Quebec in its entirety.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about local and regional development, that is where this becomes important. One realizes that Quebec has its own specific tools, such as the local investment centres, now also called local investment funds, which revolve around various structures, headed and funded by Quebec. These tools boost local and regional development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill before us is such that we find ourselves in a situation where programs are not changed, and neither are budgets. So, in my region, one realizes at the end of the day that it is possible to make considerable headway while having  a very good grasp of issues as they play out in our local environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I draw attention  here to <i>Histoire de la Gaspésie</i>, written by Marc Desjardins, Yves Frenette, Jules Bélanger and Bernard Hétu, a book to which something was added recently. When one looks at the history of the Gaspé region, specifically with respect to demographics, one realizes that in 1870—it was thus quite a while ago—there were 31,480 inhabitants. By 1960, the number had jumped to 104,824. Yes, we can talk about development, an increase, the demographic factor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the situation today is the following. In 1960, there were 104,824 inhabitants. In 2001, there were 99,886. We are talking about the Gaspésie—Îles-de-la-Madeleine region. In 2004, this year, the numbers are very worrisome. We are talking about approximately 97,000 inhabitants.</p><A NAME="T1225"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1225"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1225)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a serious decrease in population. By their very nature, figures sometimes allow us to make projections. Accordingly, looking ahead to 2021, we foresee a population of only 86,000 people in the Gaspésie and Îles-de-la-Madeleine region.  This means that we are getting back to the figures prevailing in 1940. It also reflects the reality we live in, and shows that we have a very important job to do to ensure that this region as well as other Quebec regions can overcome some very serious problems, including outmigration and socio-economic challenges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that context, the minister's proposal is basically to create an agency responsible for I know not what exactly. In the statement or the briefing document that we received  concerning the bill, the department itself mentions that  this legislation does not entail any foreseeable consequence on the programming and on the present client base of the agency. What does that mean exactly? It means that we end up with a department that is already telling us that Bill C-9 will not change in any way the real tools we should use. I think that the Bloc Québécois members, at least this is my view, would rather approve a scheme to transfer the $400 million that are being spent or invested by the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec so that these funds could be  used by the people who work on these files, once the necessary resources and employees are transferred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C-9 is nothing more than duplication. It also shows that we are stuck with a federal government that forgets that by creating a new structure, it is not addressing the real issues. I think the federal government should pay more attention to its own responsibilities and stick to its own jurisdiction. Speaking about responsibilities, this reminds us of the mess it made in areas like fisheries, employment insurance, VIA Rail, Air Canada, and so forth. I believe that the government could be much more effective if it paid more attention to its own responsibilities, namely in the fisheries area. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to what is going on in the fisheries. To get some idea of the problems, one only has to visit port facilities throughout Quebec. We recently had the opportunity to tour the maritime areas of Quebec. I was accompanied by the hon. member for Manicouagan and the hon. member for Haute-Gaspésie—La Mitis—Matane—Matapédia. We saw some terrible things. We have a government, a department which does not fulfill its own obligations, namely to provide fishers and boaters, as well as all potential port users, with facilities which are well maintained and repaired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The efforts of the Bloc Québécois in recent years helped get much more money, but not enough to deal adequately with the needs. In 2000-01, there was a $50 million budget for Canada's  entire small craft harbours program. Such an amount is not only insufficient, but ludicrous. Because of this ludicrous situation, an additional amount of $20 million a year, starting in 2002,  has been allocated for the next five years. The Bloc Québécois was instrumental in getting this modest budget increase.  </p><A NAME="T1230"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1230"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1230)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the efforts made regarding this issue are really inadequate, considering the needs. Based on some estimates—and the reality may actually be even worse—we are talking about an amount of over  $500 million to  repair or maintain small craft harbours across Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Year in and year out, the budget is only a few tens of millions of dollars. This means that we are postponing the solving of existing problems. Assuming one's real responsibilities would mean to earmark large budgets for small craft harbours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, there are some horror stories in Grande-Vallée, Rivière-au-Renard and Cannes-de-Roches, in the Gaspé Peninsula. I had the opportunity to visit some facilities and to talk to people about these issues. I can say that, when it comes to the federal government's initiatives, as they relate to its responsibilities regarding fishing  infrastructures, these people do not beat around the bush and they are totally unsatisfied. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill does not change anything in terms of budgets and programs, and the department keeps telling us that, in the end, it will have no impact on the agency's current program and clientele. This is a bill that merely seeks to increase visibility and that will ultimately result in duplication. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This duplication will generate real problems. The real issue is demography. At the beginning of my speech, I alluded to what will happen in the regions in terms of demographics, and to the fact that, by the year 2021, the population will be the same as it was in 1940. This is not what we call progress. This is not an improvement. This is not what we call building a future, a promising one. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why it is very important that the federal government, considering the resources that it has available and the existing fiscal imbalance, ensures that this money can be transferred to Quebec, which can really look after our own business in a proper and responsible manner.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to examples showing what is currently happening, let me say that, unfortunately, there are many. The railway system is really in a state of neglect, or even inappropriate. Furthermore, there is passenger train service in the Gaspé Peninsula only three days a week. Service is provided only three days a week, not seven days a week. Air transport is deficient, indeed practically almost inoperable. Flight schedules are inadequate. There are few airlines to choose from, and so on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I occasionally use air travel. Therefore, I can say that it is inaccessible because of cost. Indeed, we are not talking about a few hundred dollars, but nearly a thousand dollars to travel between Montreal and the Gaspé Peninsula, or between Montreal and the Magdalen Islands. For this price, on could easily go to Europe. That having been said, in 2004, I do not think that this reflects an honest effort or what could be a situation where proper services are offered.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the employment insurance file. This is a real mess. I have had the opportunity—and that is part of my reason for being in politics—to meet a lot of people in connection with this file. This is something I have experienced myself, as a resident of the Gaspé—Magdalen Islands area, and I am experiencing it again today. In that context, when we look at the results, at the way the federal government handled its responsibilities, and the way it could have handled them, we realize that  it is certainly not by introducing a bill like this one, which changes nothing and simply seeks to create duplication, that it will resolve any problem whatsoever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This duplication shows that the new department goes far beyond the current Canada  Economic Development.</p><A NAME="T1235"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1235"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1235)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are talking about a real federal department of regional development for Quebec. The bill says that the minister shall guide, promote and coordinate federal policiesand programs in relation to the development anddiversification of the economy of the regionsof Quebec. His mandate includes all federal activities in the regions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly, in cooperation with other concernedfederal ministers and boards and agencies, the minister shall formulate and implementpolicies, plans and integrated federalapproaches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Integrated federal approaches says it all. That's the real issue. The minister will in fact be responsible for the impacts of all federal programs on the regions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We certainly do not want any integrated federal approaches to the development  of Quebec's  regions. The regions do need an integrated development strategy, but only Quebec is able to implement it. I think this is the crux of the matter, the crux of what Bill C-9 can represent and the crux of what is  fundamentally at stake here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We already know that the Constitution gives Quebec responsibility over most matters relating to regional development. I remind hon. members of what I said at the beginning: regions for Canada and regions for Quebec are two different things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When reference is made to regions of Canada, this certainly does not mean regions like   Lac-Saint-Jean—Saguenay, or Gaspésie—Îles-de-la-Madeleine for instance.  It means Quebec as a whole.  In Canada, the regions mean the Atlantic region—which includes more than one province—Quebec, Ontario and the west.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when we speak of regions, we mean regions like Gaspésie—Îles-de-la-Madeleine, where we have six RCMs, or county regional municipalities, for a population that now numbers under 100,000, as I have said. With demographic projections as they are, we obviously need a really big hand up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that we owe a vote of thanks to the men and women who  have worked on economic recovery plans. I will touch on the federal plans, but first I will take a moment to talk about the Quebec plan.  That effort has been translated into concrete action and a plan, as far as the development of my region is concerned. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the figures are still pretty alarming, we have seen slightly fewer young people leaving these past few years.  This positive effect on the very serious problem of our youth exodus is the result of a recovery plan that has been created and implemented by Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now for the federal plan.  Just prior to the 2000 election campaign, an announcement was made in our region about a three-year $35 million recovery plan. Three years would bring us now to the end of the program, but imagine this, over time, it has been turned into a five-year plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do the math, we see that the plan, rather than injecting $35 million into the region by March 31, 2004, has put in $13.2 million.  This is an example of how this government fulfils its responsibilities.   It is therefore very important to look the situation squarely in the face and ensure that help is really forthcoming to regions such as Gaspésie—Îles-de-la-Madeleine.</p><A NAME="T1240"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1240"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1240)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1004404"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004408"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004360"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Jacques Saada (Minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec and Minister responsible for the Francophonie, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I presume that my colleague opposite is speaking totally in good faith, of course. However, he used the word “duplication”. I would like to ask him something. The CFDCs which he referred to have been in existence for about twenty years. Interestingly, the PQ government of the day, seven or eight years ago, annoyed because the federal government was more efficient in the field and because its efficiency ran against its own political objective, made the decision to create an organization identical to the CFDC, which excluded the federal government totally. Is that not a patent example of duplication, duplication imposed by the PQ government of the day?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a second question. The member across the way, just like others in his party before him, would like us to centralize the funds in Quebec, to channel all the funds toward Quebec so that the province can manage them. It so happens that Economic Development Canada manages its own programs those of other federal departments, on their behalf. I would ask my colleague opposite to  show me the list of federal departments that he wants transferred to Quebec.</p><A NAME="Int-1004408"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004438"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004404"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Raynald Blais: </b>Mr. Speaker, as a sovereignist member of Parliament, my goal —to which  I will dedicate myself actively for the following weeks, months and, maybe, years—is to make sure that Québec becomes a country  able to repatriate all responsibilities so we may have all the  tools we need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning duplication, it is difficult for me to fully understand the minister's reasoning. Concerning local and regional development issues, I refer him to the intervention I made a few minutes ago. I am pretty sure he heard what I said about local and regional development. I stress that “local” refers to municipalities and “regional” refers to regions like Gaspé and the islands, and not the Province of Québec, as he seems to understand. Local and regional development are part of under Québec's responsibilities. In this respect, I think that the Minister probably wants  to  muddy the waters to distract us  from the real problem, the real issue. However, I am convinced that he will agree with me the issue is a very big one. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to a region like mine, which is facing a difficult situation demographically speaking, since population figures will be back down to 1940's level. The trend will be very difficult to revert. Just try to imagine all the work that will have to be done. Try to imagine all the effort that will be needed. I think that Quebeckers, thanks to their structures, responsibilities and past track record will succeed in meeting that enormous challenge. I am convinced that duplication, which is what Bill C-9 aims for, is not the way to resolve or contribute to resolving the problem, so that a region like mine may have a  better future.</p><A NAME="Int-1004438"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004443"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004408"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Jacques Saada: </b>Mr. Speaker, I see that the hon. member has carefully avoided answering the very simple question I asked of him, that is, for  what other departments does the CED—which acts as an agent, in fact—carry out its mandate. He does not know the answer and so he avoided answering. Does he not understand the implications of what he is proposing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remind him once again, furthermore, that the Canadian Constitution is extremely clear in terms of jurisdictions. He has the right to disagree with the Constitution, but not the right to be unfamiliar with it. Obviously, he does not know it very well, since section 36(1)(<i>a) </i>specifically enables the federal government to promote equal opportunities for the well-being of Canadians and 36(1)(<i>b</i>) enables it to further economic development to reduce disparity in opportunities. This refers to the whole country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing—I would like to remind my colleague that his figures may indicate some research problems, for this very simple reason. Here are the investments we made during the year from April 1, 2003 to March 31, 2004, and I am speaking exclusively about the Lower St. Lawrence region to begin with. Of course, I have the figures for all the regions, and I can give him those too, as we go along. The Berger Group received $688,000; PCG Systèmes d'information, $578,000; AMH Canada, $212,000; Glendein, $468,000; Saint-Alexandre, $20,000; a numbered company $152,000;   Océanova Biotechnologies, $3 million; Technopole maritime du Québec, which I have visited, by the way, $2 million;  ISMER at the Université du Québec à Rimouski, $2 million. When I add up all these amounts that have been allocated, and I am talking about only one year, for all CED programs put together I get a total investment in that region of nearly $15 million. Just to be perfectly clear and use the most accurate numbers, it is exactly $14,814,612. The figures provided by the hon. member do not agree with mine. I have details and evidence, which he does not. </p><A NAME="T1245"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1245"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1245)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1004443"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004447"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004438"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Raynald Blais: </b>Mr. Speaker, first, I thank the minister for allowing me to comment these figures. I simply want to tell him he is wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is wrong because, had he listened to my remarks carefully, he would have realized that I was talking about the recovery plan in my riding of Gaspésie—Îles-de-la-Madeleine, a plan which was made public just before the election in 2000. The recovery plan and other actions of Canada Economic Development are not the same thing. For example, a program like the coastal Quebec fund  is not a recovery plan. A recovery plan means new money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2000, the government made a great deal of noise about how it would help a region in deep trouble with a recovery plan especially designed for this region and with additional funding. But now, the minister is telling us that it was not true. What was announced then was perhaps the recycling of old money, and that the $35 million could be spent, but with the contribution of existing programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gaspésie—Îles-de-la-Madeleine recovery plan was meant to bring in new money, not use the money that could be invested through existing programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister should do his homework. If he wants to have a frank and probably interesting discussion, I am ready to meet him at the appropriate time, here or in my region, so that we can further discuss these figures, and perhaps go beyond them. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can tell you serious work needs to be done in my region. I think people in Quebec can do it, and do it well. Those at Canada economic development or in the CFDCs can also play a role. In that sense, I think we will eventually be able to work all together for the future of my region.</p><A NAME="Int-1004447"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004450"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004443"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Jacques Saada: </b>Mr. Speaker, I am always afraid to run out of time before I go through everything I have to say. Therefore, please allow me to add two or three elements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to remind my colleague of the investments made by my department in three projects essential to the riding of Gaspésie—Îles-de-la-Madeleine. I am referring to the TechnoCentre éolien Gaspésie, an integrated wind energy research and technology transfer centre. I think that we invested $3 million in this project. In addition, we invested another $3 million, precisely, $3.1 million, if I recall well, in the Carrefour national de l'aquaculture et des pêches. There is also the e-business centre of expertise, in which we invested $1 million. All of this as part of a clear investment strategy to promote research and develop better tools.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the Gaspe Peninsula is concerned, I was referring in my speech to the Sural plant. Why a quartz plant in Cap-Chat? Despite appearances, there was an enormous potential, first, because of the Government of Quebec had incentive programs that were useful and, second, because the federal government was able to intervene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last thing: the member did not comment on my remark about the duplication of services provided by the CFDC for the past 20 years. For political reasons, the PQ government created a CLD at the time, which duplicated what the CFDCs were already doing, but with a different condition, that there would be no federal representation in it. That is the duplication I was talking about.</p><A NAME="Int-1004450"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004745"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004447"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Raynald Blais: </b>Mr. Speaker, it will take me only a few seconds to provide other numbers which exemplify very well the situation we are faced with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The budget for Quebec is three times less generous than the one for the maritime provinces. Proportionately, the federal government invests three times less in regional development in Quebec per capita than in the maritimes. The level of support in the four  maritime provinces is $164 while it is  $51 in Quebec--three times less. For each unemployed person this comes to almost $3,000 as opposed to barely $1000--almost three times more. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gives you a fairly good idea of the situation. And we could go on and on with numbers. But what would be really useful for people in the Gaspésie—Îles-de-la-Madeleine region would be to put an end  to duplication and start cooperating with Quebec to look at the region's future and to set aside destructive-- </p><A NAME="T1250"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1250"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1250)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1004745"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004454"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004450"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Speaker: </b>The hon. member for Burnaby—Douglas.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-1004454"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004490"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004745"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Bill Siksay (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP): </b>Mr.  Speaker, I am happy to participate in the debate on Bill C-9, an  act  to establish the economic development agency of Canada for the regions of Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my understanding that the purpose of the act is to promote the development and diversification of the economy in the regions of Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The NDP supports  establishing the economic development agency for the regions of Quebec as an individual legal entity.  We think this is making the move from a program in Industry Canada to being a stand-alone agency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government's ability to bring money into a region and decide what organizations benefit from it for many areas can be the most public example and sometimes the most controversial example of government policy.  Most of the government's economic development is focused exclusively on the private sector, but there are many other organizations that can contribute to a region's prosperity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the NDP would argue that Bill C-9 could be improved by specific reference to community economic development, which is  what I will be focusing  my remarks   on this afternoon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did appreciate hearing from my Bloc colleague who spoke previously about some of the larger and more specific issues facing the regions of Quebec, issues like transportation, infrastructure and  employment insurance polices.  We in the NDP are also very concerned about addressing those issues, but this afternoon I want to talk about community economic development in particular.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last budget, the government promised $132 million for community economic development across the country.  Community economic development is not a short term project, however.  Unfortunately,    that is how most government funding is promoted, in the short term category. Seventeen  million dollars of the funding that was announced are planned for a two year capacity building pilot project so that the government can learn more about community economic development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Mike Lewis,  the director of the Centre for Community Enterprise  said, “This should be a part of a long term strategy, not short term project based funding  if the government truly wants to build capacity in a community economic development sector”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Focusing on short term project based funding does create capacity but it  does not create trust or cooperation among community groups. What is needed instead is an integrated policy relationship where ministries and agencies allow the groups that have already done the research to educate the bureaucrats instead of wasting taxpayer dollars on short term projects that  will  not produce long term gain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it is the chantier de l'économie sociale in Quebec that will deal with this funding through the new organization that we are debating creating today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Community economic development is known as social economy in Quebec and has proven very successful.  Overall in Quebec the social economy sector, without even counting financial co-operatives, the two largest agricultural co-ops  or the community action networks, is made up of over 6,200 co-operatives and non-profit enterprises that employ 65,000 people and generate over $4.3 billion in sales.  It is an important sector in the economy of Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Community economic development improves the whole community and not just the business sector.  A stronger community leads directly to a stronger economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Community economic development uses triple bottom line accounting.  It considers the environmental, the social issues and the economic factors when doing economic planning.  This is a far more holistic approach to economic development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to thank the centre for community  economic development at Simon Fraser  University, which is in my riding of Burnaby--Douglas, for  its descriptions of community economic development which  we  used   to prepare our  remarks today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Community economic development can be described as a community based and community directed process that explicitly combines social  and economic development and is directed toward fostering   the economic, social, ecological and cultural well-being of communities and regions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Community economic development has emerged as an alternative to conventional approaches to economic development.  It is founded on the belief that problems facing communities,  such as unemployment, poverty, job loss, environmental degradation, economic instability and loss of community control, need to be addressed in a holistic and participatory way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The background information that the government sent out to accompany  Bill C-9  talked about small and medium sized enterprises.  This is a recognition that in smaller communities, unless there is a resource nearby to exploit, it will not be a large corporation that brings in the jobs but many small businesses.  There is already an emphasis in the bill on smaller enterprise and that makes a connection to community economic development even more possible and, hopefully, more likely.   </p><A NAME="T1255"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1255"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1255)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following principles underline community economic development, which is an evolving and ongoing process.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equity:  Community economic development is based on the principle of fairness and the belief that community members should have equitable access to community decision making processes, resources and the benefits of community economic development projects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participation:   Community economic development encourages the active participation of all members of the community in the planning, decision making and benefits of community economic development initiatives and works to remove the barriers that limit the participation of marginalized citizens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Community building: Community economic development seeks a sense of community by fostering relationships of acceptance, understanding and mutual respect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooperation and collaboration:  Community economic development recognizes that there are important linkages and connections between communities and regions and that many problems cannot be addressed in isolation. Community economic development, therefore, encourages relationships based on cooperation and collaboration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self-reliance and community control:    Community economic development builds on local strengths, creativity and resources, and actively seeks to decrease dependency on invulnerability to economic interests outside the community and region. Furthermore, community economic development supports decentralized, non-hierarchical decision making processes that strengthen the autonomy of the individual, the community and the region.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Integration:   Community economic development recognizes that the healthy development of communities requires a holistic approach that addresses the social, economic, cultural and ecological dimensions of community well-being.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interdependence:   Community economic development recognizes that the local community exists within the context of a larger complex web of relationships and that its decisions can have an impact far beyond its own boundaries. Therefore, community economic development embraces strategies that aim to benefit the local and the larger community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Living within ecological limits:   Community economic development recognizes that the social, cultural and economic well-being of the community depends on healthy local, regional and global ecosystems and that there are real ecological limits to human economic activities. Therefore, community economic development encourages processes, structures and initiatives that respect these ecological limits and supports work that is sustaining, regenerating and  nurturing of both the community and the earth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capacity building:   Community economic development contributes to self-reliance by encouraging the acquisition of relevant skills and the development of supportive structures and institutions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diversity:   Community economic development contributes to self-reliance by encouraging economic activities that are diverse and appropriate to the express needs within the community and region.  As a result, community economic development looks different in each community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appropriate indicators:   Community economic development monitors and evaluates its progress through community derived and appropriate economic, social, cultural and ecological indicators rather than through conventional measures and standards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a long list  but I think it indicates how community economic development approaches are perfectly suited to the needs of a regional economic development agency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might seem like a bit of a digression  but I want to talk briefly about the issue of literacy.  We celebrated National Literacy Day just a few weeks ago.  Improving adult literacy skills is one area of community economic development that needs more attention.  We think that  should be part of the mandate of all of Canada's regional development agencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The skills that a community workforce needs change as the community moves from a resource or farming economy to one based on knowledge or tourism.  Overall, workers from agriculture, fishing and forestry occupations have shown lower literacy skills than other working age adults. In some parts of Canada nearly half the working age adults do not have the necessary literacy skills to work in knowledge economy jobs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has reported that 33% of Canadian businesses reported training problems because of low literacy rates.  How can any community build its overall economic social and environmental capacity when half the people available to make that happen do not have the needed skills. It is a national shame that we do not work harder to provide all of our citizens with the training they need throughout their lifetime  when we expect all workers to continually upgrade their skills.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regional development agencies should be empowered to help train adult workers in literacy skills in both of our official languages. Education and training are part of the building blocks to building a strong and prosperous economy.</p><A NAME="T1300"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1300"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1300)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, let me reiterate the NDP's support for the establishment of the economic development agency of Canada for the regions of Quebec. We also urge the government to ensure that community economic development, the social economy, is central to the activities of the agency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague, the member for Nanaimo—Cowichan, will be working hard on this legislation and looks forward to continuing the discussion on the bill in committee on behalf of the NDP.</p>

However, I would like to give him the opportunity to explain to me further what he thinks of the way the current government and Canada Economic Development are fulfilling their responsibilities and doing their work, for the Quebec region in particular, so that we can speak further on the development of our regions in Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that sense, I would like to hear his comments on how he sees the situation. I would like him to assess the result of the actions or maybe I should say inactions. What does the hon. member have to say on that subject?</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-1004492"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004494"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004490"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Bill Siksay: </b>Mr. Speaker, I just want to reiterate that we have seen that a lot of the economic development in Canada is focused on the private sector, on small and medium size businesses, which is  a good thing because they generate a lot of economic activity in our country.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what we are trying to emphasize    today is that community economic development needs to be an explicit part of the mandate of an agency such as  this one.    Local communities    need to have  more of a say in the kind of development that happens in their areas. The people of the community need to have more  involvement   in the actual project.  The communities need to have more learning and capacity building  to do the kind of economic development work that is most important for the people of those regions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We think   the government  needs to pay more attention to community economic development all across the country.  Now that we have the opportunity, with the establishment of this agency, it needs to be an explicit part of its mandate.</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-1004494"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004499"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004492"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Claude Drouin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Rural Communities), Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker,  I am very pleased to rise today in this House to speak to an important bill that is being presented at second reading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-9 is important because it concerns the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec, which works on behalf of the entire population of Quebec. The purpose of this agency is to encourage the implementation of projects throughout Quebec that will provide our fellow citizens with development opportunities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill before us today is a good example of this government's vision for the future,  a vision in which our current and future entrepreneurs are encouraged to  turn their  innovative ideas into projects and can count on the Government of Canada to help make these projects a great success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec is to promote the development and diversification of the economy of the regions of Quebec. It focuses particularly on regions where economic growth is slow and there are not enough jobs.  It seeks to improve regional employment opportunities and prosperity for the long term.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In carrying out its mandate, the agency helps the Government of Canada fulfil its commitment to promoting equality of opportunity for all Canadians in the pursuit of their well-being. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of its core mandate, the agency targets two key strategic outcomes to contribute to the economic development of the regions of Quebec. The first is enterprise development and the second is the improvement of the environment for economic development of the regions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that in Canada, enterprises are the main driving force behind economic development and wealth creation. There is no doubt that the economic development of the regions involves the growth of enterprises.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this reason, to contribute to building a 21st-century economy founded on innovation, the agency provides Quebec SMEs with a continuum of support necessary for innovation, from access to financing for the startup of innovative enterprises to the commercialization of innovative products via the adoption of new technology and more productive equipment. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in that context that SKL Aluminium Technologie in Saguenay was granted repayable financial assistance of $243,125 for the establishment of an aluminum heat exchanger and radiator plant. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I draw your attention to this announcement, because when this was done, it was to help an Ontario business that provided materials for vehicles to the United States and that was previously buying its products in the United States. Thanks to the commitment of Canada Economic Development, we have helped a business from our region to provide an Ontario business with products for vehicles built in the United States.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project, besides creating eight jobs, has led to the development of  a strategic partnership with various businesses in the region that specialize in the processing of aluminum. Financial support to this project was  a priority in the efforts of Canada Economic Development to consolidate and increase the favoured position of the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean region in the secondary and tertiary processing of the white metal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Carleton-Saint-Omer, in the Gaspé Peninsula, the thalassotherapy centre Aqua-Mer benefited from a $1.938 million contribution to expand its facilities. The centre attracts a lot of foreign tourists and its activities have a ripple effect on other businesses in the region. It is now better positioned to help making Carleton-Saint-Omer a most valued destination both at home and outside our borders in relation to health tourism. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project, which  will increase the number of cure-days, fits well with one of the priorities of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec, which is to increase tourism development in Gaspesia-Magdalen Islands. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give the House another example of what we were able to do with Canada Economic Development, and we often work with other departments to ensure that our interventions are more effective. Just think about the aluminum technologies centre, where the Government of Canada made  an investment of $57 million, including $25 million from Canada Economic Development, to recruit 80 researchers to help develop aluminum and particularly secondary and tertiary processing.</p><A NAME="T1305"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1305"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1305)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In collaboration with the National Research Council of Canada and the Department of Industry, this $57 million project has already had considerable economic impact on the region, Quebec and Canada.  Through Canada Economic Development  we were able to invest $2.9 million in a planned automotive parts factory, which enabled Alcan to obtain a contract for manufacturing aluminum bumpers for Cadillac cars. This contract could have gone to either of two cities, Jonquière or Detroit. Therefore, because of the investments by Canada Economic Development, with its partners in the Government of Canada, we were able to help create this project that provided some 50 jobs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the centre of Quebec, the agency joined with Industry Canada to provide total support of $4.7 million to VisuAide in Drummondville, to support the development of assistive technologies for persons with visual disabilities. This project, aimed at developing innovative digital devices for persons with visual disabilities, will further the development of accessible and affordable technology for these persons.This is not only a promising project in terms of technological innovation and optimization of the innovative capacity of local businesses, but also a technological application that will provide a clear improvement in quality of life for many of our fellow citizens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are some examples of the grants made by the Canada Economic Development Agency that demonstrate the diversity of its activities and its commitment to support projects that blend into the existing economic fabric of the regions of Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, these projects share a common outcome: to create more dynamic, more competitive businesses with a greater ability to create prosperity and employment in their own regions. Regional economic development is not only about SMEs and entrepreneurs. The whole community must participate and take ownership in order to make it a success. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the context in which, as I said before, the agency works at improving the environment for regional economic development. In order to do so it supports development organizations that provide services regionally. It also supports non-profit agencies and businesses with plans for projects to develop a region's competitive advantages and spirit of entrepreneurship. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through its funding of such organizations, the agency seeks to create a network of businesses that can take full advantage of  projects to improve the economic development environment, so that the expansion of these businesses creates increased economic activity, employment and income. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to give two examples to illustrate the role played by the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec in improving the economic development environment in the regions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, several studies have demonstrated the wind power potential in the Gaspésie-Îles-de-la-Madeleine area. This potential explains the interest shown by a number of regional stakeholders in the development of the wind power industry, which could generate billions of dollars in investments in the Gaspé Peninsula.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, a non-profit organization, the Technocentre éolien, was created. Its role is mainly to gather and distribute information to its members. For example, the organization is working on setting up in the area a research and development centre identified as necessary for industrial development. The operations of the technocentre are funded by Canada Economic Development  and the Government of Quebec on a 50-50 basis, which, once again, shows the importance of collaboration and of serving the well-being of the public.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the agency provided $1.5 million in support to the Quebec Wood Export Bureau, commonly known as Q-Web, to promote, over a three-year period, the value-added wood products of Quebec on export markets.</p><A NAME="T1310"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1310"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1310)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need not emphasize the importance of this action, considering the crisis that the softwood lumber sector is going through because of the tariffs imposed by the Americans. Canada Economic Development helps ensuring that we reduce our dependency on one market and increase our exports in order to promote jobs in this country. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This contribution will allow the organization to establish a commercial vigil on the certification of forest products on foreign markets. Moreover, the contribution of the agency will allow Q-Web to develop the American market for value-added products for new exporters. Representing 185 manufacturing companies in the exports industry, Q-Web is opening international markets for wood products from Quebec. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is again representative of what Economic Development Canada is doing in the regions of Quebec.  I would be remiss if I did not mention the Crossroads for Industrial Materials Innovation in Boucherville, i which the government, through the Economic Development Agency of Canada  for the Regions of Quebec, invested $6 million, again in cooperation with NRC and Industry Canada. This allows Quebec researchers to innovate, to find new ways of developing products to  start businesses or to create jobs and wealth here in our regions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have visited the Industrial Materials Institute in Boucherville and I recall seeing researchers developing a porous metal that could be injected in patients' spines to prevent a second hip operation. It cuts costs and promotes speedy recovery. This is a Quebec product that can be exported worldwide. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows the importance of the Economic Development Agency and government allies in the development of Quebec's economy. These examples show that the federal government is committed to give the regions the tools they need, not only to face new market conditions, but also to take advantage of them for the benefit of the Quebec population as a whole.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish I could give you many more tangible examples from all the regions in Quebec to illustrate the importance of Economic Development Canada. There are examples in connection with the  environment, where we help our businesses to go green and to be more efficient and more environment-friendly, while saving money. Success was achieved thanks to help from Economic Development Canada and partners like the Department of the  Environment and other departments. Businesses all over Quebec appreciate the environment clubs that were created for the purpose of helping them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the development of businesses owned by women is concerned, the CFDCs, in all regions of Quebec, contribute to economic development, in cooperation with Economic Development Canada.   CFDCs are our proud partners in the creation  and development of female entrepreneurship. I can testify to the fact that they achieved great successes. They must be encouraged and thanked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Programs in the areas of softwood, textiles and clothing are currently going through a terrible crisis. We must work together to find solutions. Can we  say that Economic Development Canada did anything about that situation? Of course, they created programs aimed at supporting communities and industries when possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, allow me to pay tribute to our 14 regional and central offices, their staff and  the women and men who are dedicated to the well-being of Quebeckers and all Canadians. </p><A NAME="T1315"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1315"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1315)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1004499"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004511"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004494"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Robert Carrier (Alfred-Pellan, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, I listened attentively to the comments of my hon. colleague for Beauce. I find the various regional development possibilities quite interesting. I believe we are all aware of the tremendous needs all over Quebec. Earlier on, my colleague for Gaspésie—Îles-de-la-Madeleine made us aware of the various needs in her region. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem at present is one of duplication, since the Quebec government already has an effective regional development policy, and  what is stopping that policy from reaching its full potential is the present lack of funding to adequately meet all needs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see this as an illustration of fiscal imbalance. With all the surplus money in Ottawa—we learnt recently that the surplus for last year was almost $10 billion—it is tempting for the government to move into areas which are already under the responsibility of the provinces and create a second body at some cost to Canadian taxpayers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I stop to think of the number of civil servants it takes to properly manage a new regional development policy, over and above one which is already in place in Quebec, I do believe that this is not an efficient way to spend our money.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, this is clear proof of fiscal imbalance as it presently exists. The fact is that if we were forced to tightly manage taxpayers' dollars, the government would hardly consider setting up a body which simply duplicates what is already there. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore turn to my colleague for Beauce and ask him to explain how he can deny  that what we have is a continuing fiscal imbalance which allows his government to get involved in areas where Quebec is already present. </p><A NAME="T1320"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1320"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1320)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1004511"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004517"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004499"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Claude Drouin: </b>Mr. Speaker, I do not know if my colleague from the Bloc, when he mentions provincial political efficiency in regional economic development, thinks about the Gaspe. I hope not. It is a fiasco, with which the Government of Quebec and the Société générale de financement were closely linked. Mr. Blanchet and Mrs. Marois were partners. Is it the example of a regional success story the hon. member wants to give?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hear about duplication. I find it curious that the Government of Quebec created a revenue department. It is a choice they made, and we respect that. However, the other provinces did not make that choice. It is duplication. We respect that too. Elsewhere, we had the RCMP; they decided to have Sûreté du Québec, not that we  are complaining.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition is not exclusive to the private sector. It exists between departments or between levels of government in an effort to provide better service to Canadians. Since 1997, I have had the honour to sit here as the member for Beauce. I was here during the manpower training issue. There was  a healthy competition between provincial and federal departments then.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we avoid duplication. We transfer annually $600 million to the Province of Quebec. Now, there is no more duplication, but people have to  take a number and wait for their turn. Do they  have better service? I am not sure, but this is what stakeholders wanted and we accepted it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we are able to work together. If  the Bloc member is here to defend the interests of his constituents and of Quebeckers, he will help us implement an independent  agency with the tools to contribute to the economic development of the regions. That is what we are doing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that, during  the softwood lumber crisis, the members of the Bloc were  asking us to do something, because the situation made no sense. We accepted, we contributed approximately $300 million to help in that file, but we could not support the industry. I asked the members of the  Bloc what the  PQ government did. Was it not there to help? They answered that this was an international issue. Are the men and women living in regions international? No. They need support. What did the PQ  do? Absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would that mean it is not perfect? Indeed, it is not perfect. Have they done good things? Yes, they have. We also have done positive things, we want to work with the Province of Quebec. With a liberal government at the federal level and in Quebec, it is much easier because we both have the same interest: that is, the Quebec people.</p><A NAME="Int-1004517"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004519"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004511"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Raynald Blais (Gaspésie—Îles-de-la-Madeleine, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, it is rather unfortunate to hear the member's comments about the Gaspé. I clearly remember how the hon. member, who exercised other responsibilities in another life, bragged about having played a key role in the Gaspé recovery plan; he made sure that $70 million dollars  would be not invested but  loaned—mark my word, loaned—even though $110 million had been requested. We had to wait 18 months to receive this answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To that extent, if there is a fiasco, it is due to the manner in which the federal government, the department and its minister, handled the Gaspé file at the time, that is, by dragging their feet before making an announcement.  Moreover, they have provided much less money than was anticipated, making it a lot more difficult for investors, the people who wanted this recovery plan and who believed in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why was the Gaspé recovery plan credible back then, and is now being dismissed out of hand? This makes no sense.</p><A NAME="Int-1004519"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004522"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004517"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Claude Drouin: </b>Mr. Speaker, the comments made by the Bloc Québécois member are a bit much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did it take so long? Because we  wanted guarantees and we wanted to make sure that the project would work. Unfortunately, stakeholders applied a lot of pressure and the timetable had to be moved up. I would also point out to the hon. member that I was not there at the time. However, I support the decision made because we wanted to help the Gaspésie and Îles-de-la-Madeleine region. We had to make sure that all the necessary tools were in place for the project's success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, we probably went a bit too fast and, today, the project has come to an end. Hopefully, it can be revived. Hopefully,  companies from outside the region will give it new life, because that is what counts for the Gaspé and  Îles-de-la-Madeleine region. That is what we, as the Government of Canada, want to do through the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec--help this region and all other regions in the  province of Quebec, by working with the community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the way we are going to succeed.</p><A NAME="T1325"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1325"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1325)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1004522"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004519"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Jacques Saada (Minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec and Minister responsible for the Francophonie, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask a question of my colleague, the member for Beauce, who, by the way, held the position I now hold, and did so  brilliantly, with integrity and effectiveness, and I want to pay tribute to him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of content—I am not talking about politics, but wording—the bill before us simply gives official effect to a decision whereby Economic Development Canada, which was earlier part of the Department of Industry, now becomes independent of that department.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How does he interpret the fact that, since the beginning of the debate, the Bloc members opposite have concentrated exclusively on their agenda of separation and handing back money to Quebec, whereas, actually, we are talking about giving Quebec more power to manage its own affairs?</p><A NAME="Int-1004525"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004528"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004522"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Claude Drouin: </b>Mr. Speaker, the minister's comments are really important, and I would like to thank him for his fine words.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he said is important because, in effect, the question is as follows: How can the Bloc Québécois be hurt by the fact that Economic Development Canada is independent and no longer part of the Department of Industry? What is wrong with that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that going to adversely affect the regions? No.  Can we work for the betterment of the people, as the minister responsible for the Economic Development Agency so aptly said? Yes, and that is what the members of the Bloc Québécois should be interested in doing--working for the betterment of the people with what is presently on the table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are in a united Canada. We are working for all the provinces and all the territories, and they should respect that and make sure that communities get what they are entitled to in all the regions of Quebec.</p><A NAME="Int-1004528"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004611"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière—Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in this House to speak to Bill C-9. I would like to take this opportunity to rectify a few things that have been said earlier in this debate which started at 10 a.m., particularly with respect to statements that were made by government members.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we look at the strategy behind the creation of this department, we see that this is a duplication. I want to go back to what the  member for Beauce and the minister responsible for the agency said earlier, when they stated that this government  would work with the various levels, the people in the field.  I have a hard time understanding why Quebec's  government was never mentioned. All that was said was that the agency bypasses Quebec's decision makers and attempts to solve a problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach requires a significant amount of energy. A lot of time is being wasted, between this agency and the Government of Quebec, establishing priorities. If this government were serious, it would announce today that, with the creation of this department, it intends to include the Government of Quebec in order to better define the priorities of the regions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I consider that the Government of Quebec, with the CLD structure, has a model local and regional development tool. This model includes people from municipalities, decision-makers, business people and also people from the communities. It was first promoted by former minister Guy Chevrette, then by Louise Harel, when she took over the municipal affairs and regions. It is a  model that really meets the expectations in Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talking about CFDC, some of them work very well with the CLD, but not within the guidelines given by the federal government to CFDC. There are men and women working in these regional organizations who really care about regional development and go beyond partisanship and the presence of the Canadian flag. They work with people from the community and often, they establish exceptional cooperation links with people from the CLD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are structures in Quebec. What Quebec needs is money. We have denounced the tax imbalance over and over. Before establishing again a Department of Regional Development, the Government of Canada should consult the Government of Quebec to identify its needs. All we hear today is how this department will work with people in the community, neglecting, of course, to consult the Government of Quebec, bypassing the people who manage the local and regional infrastructures in Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people are trying to make me say that there is no new duplication, and I don't understand why the supporters of Bill C-9 today can't see the duplication. Personally, I have a hard time understanding that the federal government has responsibilities in this field. </p><A NAME="T1330"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1330"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1330)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The responsibilities of a federal government are to intervene in its own jurisdictions. Currently, there is a whole lot that the federal government could do in its own jurisdictions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some economic issues in Quebec, including in my riding, that are the result of situations with the Americans, the Chinese or other nations. The federal government should deal with these issues.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the federal government still dragging its feet regarding the mad cow issue? Imagine: a single cow has brought a whole economic sector to a standstill, a sector that is critical for Quebec, namely the dairy production. This problem has been going on since May 2003. And they are telling me that this government is taking action? Yet, this issue comes under its jurisdiction. It is up to the federal government to deal with border disputes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we know, and the hon. member for Beauce should know that, the textile industry is currently going through a crisis. Again, this is a crisis triggered by the Liberal government's lack of responsibility. It is that same government which decided that, on December 31, 2004, quotas would be lifted to further promote trade. This government did not do anything to prepare our local and regional industries to meet these new challenges.    </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of industries in small towns are closing. When this happens, for example in a town of 2,000 or 3,000—and there are several ones in my riding—when a plant that employs 125 or 150 people stops operating, it is almost the end for that town.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, the Minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec said that he did his best to resolve the textile crisis. He announced some programs, but budgets were non existent. There is no money left. We are confronted with these issues on a daily basis. There are no transition measures. This government failed to do its duty by not preparing the industry to face these new global challenges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, this government wants to establish a department to try to save our regions. This is not acceptable. The main reason why people had to leave our  regions is because the employment insurance fund was robbed. Just imagine a young person in a region who wants to replace a seasonal worker ready to retire. Up to now, this person needed 450 or 500 working hours to be entitled to benefits. Employment insurance is there for a reason. In all its geographic diversity,  Quebec needs a program to support its seasonal workers. A young person willing to replace a retiring worker who was ready to show    him or her the ropes  will now have to work 900 hours to be entitled to the same benefits. What do these young people do? They get discouraged. They leave the regions for the big centres. As a result , a poverty belt  is forming in Quebec's central regions, in the main cities. Once again, it is the Canadian government that created this  poverty belt by ignoring the needs of the unemployed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they want to convince us today that Bill C-9 will solve regional problems. </p><A NAME="T1335"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1335"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1335)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way that the Bloc Québécois will accept another partisan tactic. Let me explain how Economic Development Canada works, how it respects elected officials and how regional directors are given instructions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more, we are seeing the 54 democratically elected members of the Bloc Québécois being  shut out of decisions made by regional directors. And they are telling us that they want  to fix the democratic deficit. This is a good example of the democratic deficit. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Centre-du-Québec region, which  is very familiar to me, has been without a director for three years. This is an economically powerful region.  Every time the social and economic stakeholders  ask Economic Development Canada for help, there is a lot of foot-dragging.  Everything has been centralized in Trois-Rivières by an individual who completely ignored the needs of the Centre-du-Québec region. And passing Bill C-9 is supposed to solve all these problems? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have noticed as well that Canada Economic Development has become a promotional tool for Liberal partisanship. It is crazy how much partisan work former MPs get. Just look at the former member for Frontenac—Mégantic, Gérard Binet. He is busy because every time Canada Economic Development has something to do, he is there. Christian Jobin is another former Liberal member. He was defeated and has a special mandate to set up some sort of summit on municipalities, another action that once again interferes in Quebec's business. I could name others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> David Price from Compton—Stanstead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Odina Desrochers:</b> There is also David Price from Compton—Stanstead. These people use taxpayers' money,  Canada Economic Development, or any other arrangement set up by this government, to promote themselves and get re-elected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing is certain: we are 54 members and these 54 members—maybe more—intend to keep coming back to denounce this government's actions since it came back to this House on October 4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I have only seven minutes left, I will not have enough time to get into how far removed this bill is from Quebec reality. However, I will take the time to talk about—in the hopes that the Liberals will understand—how the people of the regions of Quebec  take care of their own responsibilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have CLDs—I mentioned this earlier. We have regional structures. We increasingly try to hold our municipal representatives accountable. We give businesspeople their space. We pay particular attention to the community groups. In Quebec, un like in the rest of Canada, we  take a much more social democratic  approach  than the Conservative or the Liberal approach taken in Ontario and the rest of Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that all our arguments today will help the minister and the Liberal team recognize the serious mistake they made in introducing Bill C-9.   I also hope that during the work on possible amendments to this bill, the federal government will be open and honest enough to recognize that, once again, it has created an organization while ignoring Quebec.</p><A NAME="T1340"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1340"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1340)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that point, we will recognize that this government has specific plans for Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying, I have been listening all day to the Liberal Party members. I only heard the name “Quebec” when I was being  told that this bill is about a law to establish the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec. Beyond that, Quebec was never mentioned in the speeches of these members. On the other hand, we understand from what the Liberal government has said is that they intend to intrude in the regions, to take control of our regions, while ignoring what these regions really expect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Quebec government, that of Mr. Landry or of  Mr. Charest, regularly consults the regions to discover their expectations. Did the minister take the time to review these people's work? Did he take the time to get more familiar with Quebec's expectations?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, I was listening to the member for Beauce enumerating the numerous projects in which his government had been involved. I wondered whether the member for Beauce thought we were going into an election tomorrow. That was not very helpful in terms of preserving jobs. Usually, any politician, wherever he came from, especially when he is in office, holds a press conference to report his accomplishments. This is when the quality of the government and its accomplishments are praised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a moment ago, the member for Beauce was saying that his government did a lot for softwood lumber.  Only one  phase of the assistance program has been implemented. We're still waiting for phases two and three. We're still waiting for this government to listen to industry and to give it  support. This crisis has been going on for three years but the government does not budge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What great programs, what a great philosophy and what small projects. I was listening earlier. The member had all that he needed to go on a tour of Quebec. He said he spread all the federal money over the regions and that that is how the Canada Economic Development Agency for the Regions of Quebec will be strong. Only small amounts were negotiated and they were announced in the absence of elected representatives. They keep the members of the Bloc away from the action.  We run our own show. And then these people have the gall to tell us that they are working  with the local stakeholders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that the first stakeholder of a riding is the member of Parliament who was democratically elected by the people. Speaking of the democratic deficit, I would have liked, at least, for them to try to work on a cooperative basis rather than on a partisan one. As I was saying, there are many examples of what the Prime Minister boasted about before the election. The fight against the democratic deficit, just like the issue of asymmetry, lasted only the duration of a conference. We talked about asymmetry, and English Canada  got angry. The Ontario caucus said: “Wait a minute, Mr. Prime Minister, do not give too much to Quebec. You were not able to get many members elected in Quebec.  If you are Prime Minister of a minority government, it is because of Ontario.” The Prime Minister then came up with another approach for the fiscal imbalance. He did not listen, he just imposed his views, the same way Jean Chrétien used to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing has changed. The only change in this Parliament is that, through a democratic effort, we, the opposition parties, are now at least able to adopt motions to push some issues forward. Members will recall the many times, under the 1997 and  2000 governments, that proposals from opposition members were systematically turned down by the Liberal government. Any motion, amendment or idea from the opposition was simply voted down. </p><A NAME="T1345"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1345"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1345)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I have only a minute left, let me say that all 54 Bloc Québécois members, all CLDs, all regional bodies in Quebec, as well as the Quebec government are saying to the federal government: “No to Bill C-9”. </p><A NAME="Int-1004611"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004613"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004528"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Jacques Saada (Minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, there are so many contradictions I do not know where I should start. The hon. member talked about the sprinkling of CED money for the sake of visibility, and then he said he regretted not being invited to public announcements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he want to be invited because he has worked on the project being announced? Not at all. Is it because he initiated the project? Not at all. Why does he want to be invited? Because it is a photo op.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why accuse others of wanting to be visible when his sole goal is visibility? This is a case of the pot calling the kettle black. It does not make sense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member also talked about cooperation. Let me remind him of the Alumiforme case in the Saguenay area, for example. Canada and Quebec cooperated closely to promote secondary processing of aluminum. There is also the Centre de recherche en biotechnologies marines. Again, $6 million came from the federal government and $8 million from the province. We worked in cooperation and took care of both the infrastructure and the equipment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what about Montréal International? Perhaps the hon. member does not know that Montreal is also an area in need of development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something fascinates me. In the very riding of the hon. member, 5 businesses and 172 jobs were created over the last year only, thanks to the action of my department.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a question for the hon. member. I have to go back to my CED office in Montreal today to sign a financing proposal of $300,000 for the Chaudière-Appalaches ATR. The chief executive officer of the ATR is Mr. Richard Moreau. Would the hon. member opposite like me to tell Mr. Moreau that, at the request of the Bloc, I have refused to authorize this $300,000?</p><A NAME="Int-1004613"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004611"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Odina Desrochers: </b>Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to learn that, at long last, ATR will receive the money, which does not come from the government, but from our pockets. So, it is only fair to have  that money go back to our regions from time to time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spoken with Mr. Moreau and the people of ATR. They were asking me why that was taking so long. I told them it was the federal government's trademark. They let organizations run out of breath so that, in the end, they can appear as a saviour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know Mr. Moreau well, we have an excellent relationship, but when EDC comes bragging in the riding to announce its financial assistance, let the local elected official be recognized. I will understand then  that this party is not partisan, but that it understands that in a community, the most important person is the elected member. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I am told that the only reason I want to be there is to be in the photo, that—</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Some hon. members: </b>Oh, oh!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An  member:</b> What do you know about it? Are you in his riding?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>M. Odina Desrochers:</b> You know it is not the first time that these things  get on their nerves. There is a storm brewing. A few inches of snow are being forecast and, when that happens, there is turbulence in the House of Commons. Liberals often behave like children.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same goes for teachers or professors who see students demonstrating become unruly in such cases. It is like that every time there is a storm of criticism in this Parliament. They become unruly, they do not listen and they revert back to Jean Chrétien's good old method: arrogance.</p><A NAME="T1350"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1350"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1350)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1004615"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004617"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004613"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Jacques Saada: </b>Mr. Speaker, first of all, I am a bit surprised that my colleague across the way sees himself as a student at a demonstration. That is what he said earlier on. I am both surprised and intrigued </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is right on one aspect. It is true that, whenever a government, be it federal, provincial or municipal, spends or invests money, it does so with taxpayers' money, all coming out of the same pocket. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I take pride in the fact that, having been asked to manage that money, we chose to redistribute it to the ATR in his region as a key priority, based on its excellent plan. It does take time and that is because, as a government, we act responsibly. We do not throw money around, left and right indiscriminately. We do a careful, professional and systematic analysis. We  work in cooperation with applicants. Once we have all the information, we work  on the plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While he is  posturing and telling the gentleman across the way, once again, how worthless we are--it is so predictable--we do the work and deliver the goods. </p><A NAME="Int-1004617"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004619"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Odina Desrochers: </b>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has the gall to say that he spends his money well and that he delivers the goods. I hope the minister is following  the work of the Gomery Commission and the Standing Committee on Public Accounts' deliberations. If the regions had received the money that was funneled instead into the agencies and into small projects all planned by Liberal members, I could stand here and  tell you that Quebec regions are in good shape. I do not think the minister has any right to comment on the way we manage our money in Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never before have we been faced with such a scandal that tarnishes Canada's history. I was just saying a few minutes ago that I hope the Liberal government will be held responsible, whether it be before Gomery, before the public accounts committee or before the House of Commons. I hope that there will be legal, maybe even criminal sanctions and, more importantly, that the government will legislate to ensure that it is the last time in Canadian history that such a shameful financial scandal ever occurs. That is what responsible people would do.</p><A NAME="Int-1004619"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004622"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004617"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Raynald Blais (Gaspésie—Îles-de-la-Madeleine, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to commend my colleague from the Bloc Québécois on the soundness of his comments. I think the hon. member put his finger on the real issue. I would ask him to elaborate further on what is going on with Bill C-9 that is before us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, I understand that we need to be very careful about what we have now, because this bill could be just smoke and mirrors. So I would like to hear again his views on federal interference and the new government asymmetry. I think we could learn more from the hon. member.</p><A NAME="T1355"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1355"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1400"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1355)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1004622"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004627"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004619"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Odina Desrochers: </b>Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, Bill C-9 is like a good number of bills that have been introduced, by the Chrétien government as well as by the current one, and like the throne speech.  All of them are commitments involving Quebec's home turf. Therefore, I am absolutely not surprised to see that the usual intrusion into areas of  Quebec's jurisdiction in this bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I do not believe that this government will cooperate with the Government of Quebec. It will go above its head. It will try to pose as a saviour in regions it itself destroyed with previous policies</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this respect, the Bloc Québecois will keep an eye on them. If Bill C-9 turns out to  be a change of course in the behaviour of the Liberal government, democracy will be the winner. Unfortunately, after what I have seen in the throne speech, and what I have heard since 10 o'clock this morning, I am still under the impression that we will end up with duplication; therefore, people will not know what doors to knock on. Often, those people will say: “If you knock on the door of CLD, don't expect anything from us”. This type of blackmail does exist. If you encourage the little Canadian flag, you won't need the little government of Quebec. This often happens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for this reason that every time the government introduces a bill to deal with the regions of Quebec, it is always the nice Canadian flag that we see in the background.</p><A NAME="Int-1004627"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004628"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004622"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, when they become paranoid because a bill mandates all of Quebec's representatives, federal and provincial, to work together and develop the regional economy, they get upset. I would like to know why.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe they are not happy because Ms. Normandeau, who is my provincial liberal counterpart and who is well versed in those issues, and I, who believe I am also doing well, have done interesting things together for the Gaspe Peninsula and the Lower St. Lawrence as well as  for young people. Of course, members opposite are disturbed by that. It is a proof that federalism works. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, when we talk about interference, perhaps the hon. member would  be good enough to read the Constitution before asking such a question? </p><A NAME="Int-1004628"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004629"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004627"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Speaker: </b>I ask the member for Lotbinière—L'Érable to give a very short answer.</p><A NAME="Int-1004629"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004631"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004628"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Odina Desrochers: </b>Mr. Speaker, the answer will be very short.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It  is because I do not trust the Liberal government. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member accuses me of not being in contact with stakeholders in that area. The hon. member will know that during election campaign, I went to the regional ATR and I was told that the government in dragging its feet. Today, it is trying to portray itself as a saviour. Those people had financial problems. I hope they will receive their $300,000.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it was not the case when I met them during the election campaign. The ATR said: “You know, if a Liberal member is elected, you may get your money.” This is what I call political blackmail.</p><A NAME="Int-1004631"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004644"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004629"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Francis Scarpaleggia (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to have this opportunity to speak today in connection with the bill on the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government has set itself the objective of ensuring the success of Canadians in each and every region of our country.  Its intention is to support our fellow citizens, as far as is possible, in the realization of their aspirations for prosperity and an enhanced quality of life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the context within which the Economic Development Agency of Canada fulfills its mandate to promote the economic development of the regions of Quebec. To that end,  it pays particular attention to all the regions of Quebec, especially those with a slower growth rate and insufficient jobs for the size of their population.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my capacity as a member of Parliament, I have had the opportunity to see for myself the work done by the agency to ensure the regional economic development of Quebec and improve its residents' quality of life.  The agency has, for instance, made the financial commitment to provide over $1.02 billion for 2,116 projects during 2003-04.  When investments from other funding bodies are factored in, the total value of these projects represents an injection of over $3.9 billion into the economy of the various regions of Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more, these projects have contributed to the creation, conversion or maintenance of close to 13,700 jobs in all of the regions of Quebec, regions such as Chaudière-Appalaches, where $60,000 from Economic Development Canada has enabled Soliroc Metal to enhance its productivity.  With this financial assistance, the company was able to acquire more efficient equipment, and as a result to raise its productivity by 60%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one example of the kind of projects Canada Economic Development has supported, which have highly positive economic spinoffs for the competitive position of a company, thereby enabling it not only to continue to grow, but also to play a vital role within its community. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the region of Quebec, the National Optics Institute received a $3.6 million contribution from Canada Economic Development  to implement an agro-photonic research program. The purpose of this research campaign is to bring together two major industries in the region, namely  agro-processing and optical photonics technologies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada Economic Development wanted to support this regional initiative because it has consolidated the institute's leading position in the industry and paved the way for various economic development projects in many regions of Quebec. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Lower St. Lawrence, the marine biotechnology research centre was set up with a contribution of $7.6 million from Canada Economic Development. To carry out its work, the centre plans to create 24 direct jobs and 75 spin-off jobs. In addition, the centre's activities will bring top researchers to the region to set up new companies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should add that these research facilities are a priority to the people of the Lower St. Lawrence. This is why Canada Economic Development wanted to be involved in carrying out this project as part of its commitment to support initiatives that best respond to the needs of the public and that target the strength of the region. These projects contribute to solidifying the economic development opportunities in the regions that welcome them and other regions in Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These examples show what Canada Economic Development does. They also show that the agency attaches a high level of importance to the promotion of innovation throughout Quebec. This priority stems from our government's commitment to building the robust and innovative economy that we all want for our country in the 21st century. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The projects I mentioned illustrate Canada Economic Development's goal to strengthen the niches of excellence specific to each region of Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all, in 2003-04, the agency invested $54.6 million in 739 innovative projects in Quebec. These investments have led to the creation, transformation or maintenance of 4,796 jobs. Furthermore, even the promoters have said  that without the financial support of Canada Economic Development, 55% of the projects would never have materialized.</p><A NAME="T1400"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1400"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1405"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1400)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to foster a culture of innovation in the regions of Quebec,  Economic Development Canada and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada contributed $3.6 million to the Université du Québec en Abitibi-Témiscamingue in order to take part in an important research project aimed at developing  a new beef product that meets consumers’ more demanding requirements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, I would like to say that this project came about through an initiative of regional cattle producers and researchers. Besides creating 34 jobs, this initiative should translate into a 15% to 20% increase in profits for the industry.  As I pointed out earlier, the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec also supports communities in their efforts to focus on their strengths and take charge of their development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The agency's goal is to promote public interest initiatives that could have a significant impact at the regional level as well as generate a ripple effect on regional economic activity. The agency works with a network of partners that includes 57 community futures development corporations, 15 community economic development corporations and 9 business development centres.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the 2002-03 fiscal year, the various projects that received loans from community futures development corporations generated $135 million in regional investments. These loans amounted to some $45 million. The nine business development centres were involved in 222 investment projects and 570 technical assistance files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in the context of the partnership between the Economic Development Agency of Canada and Quebec's network of community futures development corporations, that the  AFER program, designed to help women entrepreneurs in rural areas, was implemented. This pilot project consisted in establishing a financial assistance fund  to  stimulate women's entrepreneurship in rural areas. The twelve community futures development corporations participating in this initiative represented the Gaspé, Magdalen Islands,   lower St. Lawrence,  Abitibi—Témiscamingue,  North Shore,  Saguenay,  Mauricie,  Chaudières-Appalaches and Montérégie regions. So far, the AFER program has assisted 93 women entrepreneurs and has contributed to the creation of  31 businesses and 60 jobs in various Quebec regions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fonds AFER Canada is indicative of  the Government of Canada's desire to foster greater participation of women in the overall economy of the Quebec regions and in the efforts to diversify the development opportunities in the various communities of Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned a few minutes ago, the Economic Development Agency of Canada is active in all Quebec regions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the agency promoted the Entreprises rurales Nord-du-Québec initiative. In this project,  Economic Development Canada gives $50,000 annually to the  Chapais-Chibougamau, Matagami and Eeyou Economic Group CFDCs to help them sustain activities that they could not have financed within their mandate. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CFDCs were able to support eight new business projects only in the last six months or so and, thanks to this funding, many local business people will be able to enlarge their market share and increase their revenues. In other words, they will create wealth in their region and their fellow citizens will benefit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind the members of the House that the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec also helps Quebec's municipalities renew their infrastructure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this part of the agency's mandate is to  help Quebec's communities to maintain their capacity to attract businesses, and to improve their citizens'  quality of life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the Canada-Quebec  Infrastructure Works program, which entrusted to Economic Development Canada the management of the projects, the Government of Canada contributed a total amount of $463 million to the realization of 867 projects, from the beginning of the program in 2000 to March 31, 2004. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to all those different projects, 484,408 Canadian families have already had or will have access to municipal waterworks providing better quality drinking water.</p><A NAME="T1405"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1405"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1410"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1400"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1405)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, almost 5,950 families will be hooked up to a proper municipal sewer and wastewater treatment system. And 260 communities will benefit from the construction or improvement of sports or cultural facilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last few years, the Canadian government has often stated its commitment to build a strong Canadian economy for the 21st century, an economy that creates quality jobs and equal opportunities for all individuals and regions in Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Economic Development Agency of Canadafor the Regions of Quebec accepts fully this goal, as the bill before us shows. The agency also plays an active role in the implementation of the broad economic priorities of the government in the whole province of Quebec, and its many good results speak for it.</p><A NAME="T1410"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1410"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1415"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1405"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1410)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1004644"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004657"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004631"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Raynald Blais (Gaspésie—Îles-de-la-Madeleine, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to the speech just made by the member. I found some elements particularity interesting. When the various initiatives of Canada Economic Development are mentioned, one is left with the impression that everything is just fine.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, for regions such as mine, which I know quite well, we can also take stock of what Canada Economic Development has done. With regard to the Gaspésie-les-Îles region recovery plan, any action taken was late as well as minimal. And this was a situation which required urgent action. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It may therefore seem important to list all the initiatives taken by Canada Economic Development in Quebec, since this makes it look efficient and active, but there is unfortunately another reality, one which hits us close to home. It has to do with what we see when we take stock of what Canada Economic Development has done in the Gaspésie-les-Îles region.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I am not the only one saying it. On May 26, 1991 in Chandler 7,500 people gathered in an arena to complain about what the federal government and Quebec had not done for the region. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 10 years later, there have been complaints in the region, again in relation to the federal government's inaction. When we talk about the agency, putting aside the numbers, putting aside what I have heard a moment ago, I think we must look at the situation as it is. Unfortunately, the results are weak and negative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like the hon. member to explain why, with  so many good initiatives, we are faced with problems in this region  and it is hard to see a future there. We have the impression that there is a lack of action, that  we are being ignored, that we are being forgotten by the federal government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They offer up all sorts of initiatives, but I think it would be appropriate to look at the other side of the coin, what is really going on. The fact is that initiatives have been infrequent, ineffective, late and often partisan. In this respect, Quebec needs to play a greater role. We know what the needs are, and we also know the solutions.</p><A NAME="Int-1004657"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004661"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004644"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Francis Scarpaleggia: </b>Mr. Speaker, I find strange some of the comments made by my colleague, who claims that many investments made by the federal government in his region have had a negative impact. His math is foreign to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell you briefly about Canada Economic Development's activities in the Gaspésie and Îles-de-la-Madeleine region as of October 6, 2004;  there were 62 financial projects totalling $14.1 million. Where is the negative impact here? If we were to talk to the stakeholders my colleague claims to speak for, would these people agree with him that there is a negative impact there?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of  the 62 projects I mentioned came under the emerging initiatives and development of medium-sized enterprises components. This means that we invest in emerging technologies, which is good for the future of this region. Again, I do not see how investing in the future could have a negative impact. I have a hard time understanding some of my colleague's remarks.</p><A NAME="T1415"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1415"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1420"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1410"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1415)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1004661"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004666"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004657"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Robert Carrier (Alfred-Pellan, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the  comments of the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Louis on the whole list of the government's investment projects in various regions. At first glance, this looks quite interesting. However, given the scope of the needs, it should be possible to invest in various areas. The problem is to invest in the really useful sectors that truly reflect the region's needs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, the hon. member for Beauce told me that it was important to have competition and that the Quebec government should not be left on its own. I am surprised to hear such a reply from the government. Does this mean that the Canadian government sees itself as being in competition with the Quebec government? Are the projects they choose to support competing with those of Quebec or, in their minds, more successful, more important for the population of the region? Or is it simply that the Canadian government does not believe that the Quebec government is effective? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier, the Gaspesia fiasco was  used as an example to explain the lack of importance of the Quebec government in regional development. I think the federal government would be well-advised not to elaborate too much on fiascos for which it is responsible. Take, for instance, the case of Mirabel, which is a monumental fiasco in which billions of dollars were invested. And what about the sponsorship scandal, which is truly a fiasco created by the whole government bureaucracy? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I wonder if the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Louis could comment on the role of a second government regarding the same regional development issues.</p><A NAME="Int-1004666"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004670"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004661"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Francis Scarpaleggia: </b>Mr. Speaker, the federal government has been working with the provinces for decades, even before my colleague's party was first formed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I sincerely believe, and this is my personal opinion, that no individual or government has a monopoly on ideas. The more ideas we have and the more analysis we do, the better. In my opinion, it is in this spirit that the federal government is working with the Province of Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noted that some of   my colleagues on the other side of the House  had a tendency to wander off topic when they were talking about Mirabel and other matters a little while ago. I would therefore appreciate if my colleagues would stick to the subject of today's debate, which is an act to establish the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec.</p><A NAME="T1420"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1420"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1425"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1415"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1420)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1004670"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004676"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004666"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Robert Carrier (Alfred-Pellan, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a short statement, something I had not planned at the outset. Due to the importance of the topic we are debating today, it seems a good idea to me to express my opinion on the bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am an engineer by trade and I have 40 years of experience. I therefore have a logical mind; I calculate things and the value of decisions. But I have always been a committed man, a citizen committed in his community and concerned about decisions made by the various governments. That is why I find it very important today to tell you that I am against the bill. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not because I am against Canada, contrary to what a colleague opposite stated yesterday, in saying that the Bloc Québécois was against Canada. Our position is not against Canada. We want the two governments to spend our money as effectively as possible. This is really the position I want to express. It is not about competition, about determining the better of the two. It is not about lumping them together and letting them fight it out to try and make just about everybody happy. That's the way to waste our money. It goes without saying that our general level of taxation in Quebec is much higher than that of North America as a whole. There is a link with all those decisions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regional development policy is a very complex issue. Significant structures must be put in place in every  region to monitor  the needs of the regions and make the choices that will help them. We must not be partisan and say that  we will fund a project because it is presented  by friends or people we know, and that will please them. The important role the government must play is to be non partisan and understand the needs of each region. Members are aware of the fact that their region must be developed to the maximum, regardless of their  political stripes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why the Quebec government put in place a regional development structure that has already proven to be very efficient. As I said earlier, I found odious that members mention a fiasco of the Quebec government without talking about all its successes. It is out of line with the discussion we are having today. I do not believe that we are out  to prove  the Quebec government is incompetent and hence the reason for  the Canadian government's getting involved in the area. In politics everyone tries to make the best possible decisions. Mistakes are always possible, and it is important to recognize  it and change tack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the government, instead of putting forward this bill,  to further officialize its involvement in an area where the Quebec government is already involved by having a minister in charge of this agency. Such a move would further politicize the whole issue of duplication. For that reason, we are opposed to  the bill, not because we are against regional development, since we really need it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are lacking in Quebec is money. We have been saying it for a long time. There is too much money in Ottawa and not enough in the provinces. It is that money we need. The current government should instead put forward a bill to transfer to the Quebec government the money it usually allocates or is trying to allocate to regional development. That way, the Quebec government could do a better job.</p><A NAME="Int-1004676"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004680"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004670"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. David Smith (Pontiac, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am proud to see that my colleague across the way feels that the Canadian federation serves a purpose. As Canadians, we have to work with our fellow Canadians in Quebec, as I do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in my lovely riding of Pontiac, which is just across the river, not far from here, we regularly work with members of the Quebec National Assembly to find solutions that enhance the quality of life of our taxpayers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This week, I will have the pleasure of taking part in press conferences to announce funding as a result of a solid analysis by Canada Economic Development and all the people. The CLD's role in the projects was to participate in the analysis of the business plan. The CFDC played another role on another level. The CED will also contribute, as will other Quebec agencies and departments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a perfect example of a collective effort for the well-being of our region, the beautiful riding of Pontiac.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the question for my colleague opposite: Does the member believe that this formula, under which federal and provincial members work together with all the regional stakeholders to find solutions that will enhance people's lives, is a good thing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he apply the same philosophy in his riding that we do in Pontiac?</p><A NAME="T1425"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1425"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1420"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1425)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1004680"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004685"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004676"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Robert Carrier: </b>Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, I think that we must be positive in the action that we take as members of Parliament. When we work within a well established system, we must of course cooperate as much as possible to achieve common goals. I commend him for applying this principle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, since I am a new member of Parliament, I still have not had many opportunities to cooperate with my provincial counterpart, but this is already a given. We will have good cooperation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That being said, however, this is not a reason to agree to such an intrusion in an official way, let alone through  the approval of the bill. Despite all the goodwill of my colleague, he must admit that, with regard to regional economic development, there are certainly several public servants and a budget behind all this. They must analyze and coordinate the action of both governments so that they do not impede on each other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite all the goodwill to cooperate that  might exist, this would still not be efficient, because we would create a duplication of public servants and joint responsibilities, which would make this system more costly. Anyway, in most cases, there is no cooperation and, in the end, decisions do not necessarily meet the real needs of the people, because each government holds tight to its own projects and priorities, despite all the goodwill on both sides. </p><A NAME="Int-1004685"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004688"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004680"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. David Smith: </b>Mr. Speaker, in my riding there is a roundtable of all federal and provincial stakeholders. There are anglophones, francophones and Algonquians working together for the good of the community. I encourage my hon. friend opposite to take part in this kind of working environment for the good of the community and of all Quebeckers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the program before us, we are not creating a new structure. This structure already exists. We are just removing the Industry Canada shell and giving it its own identity.</p><A NAME="Int-1004688"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004689"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004685"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Speaker: </b>The hon. member for Alfred-Pellan for a brief answer.</p><A NAME="Int-1004689"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004690"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1004688"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Robert Carrier: </b>Mr. Speaker, my answer will be brief. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obvious that the same structure is being maintained. But the important point is that it will create a department, with a minister who is responsible, who, in any case, will politicize the whole federal approach even more, which will only complicate all negotiations and collaboration that may be happening with the various levels of government.</p><A NAME="Int-1004690"></A><a HREF="#Int-1004689"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Speaker: </b>There are five minutes remaining for questions and comments on the speech by the hon. member for Alfred-Pellan.
