	The House resumed from October 10, consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-29, an act to regulate interprovincial trade in and 
the importation for commercial purposes of certain manganese 
based substances, be read the third time and passed; and of the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rex Crawford (Kent, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
honoured to speak on a bill that I am confident will benefit every 
Canadian from coast to coast. I am especially honoured to speak on 
the bill as it directly affects my riding of Kent in Ontario. Next 
Friday will be the ground breaking day for a world class ethanol 
plant in Chatham, Ontario.
<P>
	Alternative fuels are the wave of the future using corn as the base 
product. Ethanol is an environmentally friendly, cost efficient and 
job producing substance. It is my hope and belief that some day 
every vehicle in Canada will run on alternative fuels.
<P>
	Speaking of the ethanol plant in Chatham, I would like to give a 
little history of how it came to be. Approximately four years ago I 
was approached by Doug MacKenzie of Commercial Alcohols to 
try and promote this to the federal government and get its backing.
<P>
	Over the years we had a very busy time. We met with every 
minister and every potential minister at that time to try and sell this 
project for the county of Kent. Every Wednesday morning at 
caucus we would present different proposals to all the ministers. 
Every Wednesday morning it seemed as if I was approaching them 
with a summons. I showed up every Wednesday with an envelope 
for every minister which had information and articles on ethanol 
and how it would benefit the Canadian population.
<P>
<B>(1005)</B>
<P>
	There are 21 municipalities in Kent, not the riding of Kent but in 
the county of Kent, of which I had the fortune of being a past 
warden. All 21 municipalities sent in their support not only once 
but twice to every member of Parliament.
<P>
	I remember one cold day in January, in fact I think it was the 
coldest day we had that year, the administrator of the city of 
Chatham and the administrator of the county arrived here to meet 
with the finance department. They were in their raincoats as they 
were used to the weather in southwestern Ontario which we refer to 
as the banana belt of Canada. We walked to the minister's office 
which is approximately five blocks from here and both gentlemen 
were completely frozen. They were not used to the weather in 
Ottawa. The administrators met twice in Ottawa with the finance 
department and the minister.
<P>
	Over the year we had thousands of petitions from the riding of 
Kent supporting an ethanol plant in Chatham. Really they were not 
asking for money; what they were asking for was a tax deferment. 
Since alcohol is not taxed in Canada they wanted to make sure that 
it stayed off to give the company a kick off start.
<P>
	This company is a $153 million project. On next Friday October 
18 will be the kick off party to starting to build this project. The 
ridings of Kent, Essex-Kent and Lambton-Middlesex, the corn 
belt of Canada, will supply this company. It is another way of 
people in agriculture being able to utilize their produce. Any 
commodity that helps agriculture is to the benefit of all.
<P>
	There will be approximately 90 to 100 jobs within the company 
and a spinoff of approximately 400 jobs. People who work in 
agriculture, truckers, labourers and shippers will all be involved 
with this plant in Chatham. It is not only a benefit to the 
environment, it is a benefit to the economy.
<P>
	Over those years we tried every way possible to get the ministers 
and the members of this party and the other parties to agree to 
having this tax deferral. I must mention a chap who worked for me 
by the name of Emery Huszka. Emery drove down to his hometown 
of Bothwell filled a pickup with a load of corn and drove all the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5408"> 5408 </A></B>
<P>
way back to Ottawa. One weekend he and his wife wrapped ears of 
corn and our proposal with a ribbon. I must compliment Emery and 
his wife Julie for all the work they did in such a novel way to get 
attention. All  the offices received an ear of corn with our proposal 
wrapped by ribbon.
<P>
	I must thank the member for Halton-Peel and the member for 
Lambton-Middlesex who co-chaired the ethanol program for the 
environment here under the former minister, the hon. member for 
Hamilton East. They worked night and day to get this project off 
the ground.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	I would like to thank all the members of Parliament who 
supported this. It was almost unanimous. I believe there was only 
one member who fought me on it, the member for 
Sarnia-Lambton. I do not blame the member for 
Sarnia-Lambton one iota. We are very close friends. But living in 
the chemical valley of Canada he has to stand up for the people who 
support him.
<P>
	There were debates in Windsor. I debated along with Robert 
Wheeler from the city of Chatham who is the head of economic 
development against the member for Sarnia-Lambton and Ray 
Curran, the chair of the Lambton industrial society. Our debate was 
on the pros and cons of ethanol versus MMT. Later Doug 
MacKenzie and I debated in the city of London against the 
chemical companies themselves which were there to debate why 
they felt MMT should not be banned and why we should not go 
ahead with ethanol.
<P>
	It was a very busy year and a half. My staff worked night and 
day. But had it not been for the ministers of our government and the 
members not only of the government but of the opposition who 
gave their support, we would never have attained our goals.
<P>
	Let me now address another important issue. As more and more 
cars make their way onto our city streets and highways, we face a 
major environmental problem. Every year the 14 million cars on 
Canada's roads release about four tonnes of pollutants into the air. 
Not only do excessive emissions infect the air we breathe but they 
also pollute our water systems and environment. This is a massive 
problem that is only getting worse.
<P>
	I have personal evidence that ethanol is very beneficial as I have 
used ethanol in my car for some 20 years or more. I drove one car 
for over 450,000 kilometres without any trouble with its catalytic 
converter or motor. Ethanol certainly benefits with a cleaner 
running motor. I still use ethanol today after 20 years. I always pick 
a gas station that sells ethanol.
<P>
	I congratulate both the ministers of environment and agriculture 
for taking hold of this problem, for tightening emissions 
regulations, for improving fuel compositions and for encouraging 
Canadians to make careful and environmentally sound 
transportation choices.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, I come from a rural area. It is the corn 
capital of Canada. We do not have public transportation. My 
community relies almost exclusively on automobiles for travel. We 
do not have bus service or trains in our area so all individuals must 
use their own transportation.
<P>
	With the economy the way it is, husbands and wives work, 
children work. They all have cars and they are all polluting our 
environment. I am certain this is the case all over Canada. If we 
accept that people are not going to give up their cars, then we have 
to accept a cleaner, cheaper and better fuel product. MMT is the 
exact opposite.
<P>
	MMT is the gasoline additive that increases octane. It is not 
essential to the operation of a car and many experts, including 
automobile manufacturers, say that it causes significant problems 
with pollution control components. That is why, relating to the car I 
have, the catalytic converter is the same as the day I bought the car 
new.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	Cars today are very sophisticated with onboard diagnostic 
systems. These onboard systems are used to help drivers maintain 
their car's pollution control systems. I understand that if one had to 
be replaced it would cost approximately $1,000 with labour. 
Studies have shown that MMT corrupts these systems.
<P>
	The decision to ban MMT was made after serious consideration. 
Along with many of my colleagues and the Ministers of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food and the Environment, I have spent over 
two years consulting automobile manufacturers, oil companies and 
environmental groups. We are certain that banning this nasty 
American fuel additive, and it is not a Canadian additive as it is 
made in the southern United States, will improve the health and 
safety standards for all Canadians.
<P>
	Banning MMT also makes sense when we are already producing 
better alternative fuels such as ethanol. There are several ethanol 
plants in Canada. The one in Chatham is not the original as there 
are several out west and down east.
<P>
	When ethanol is made I talk of corn but ethanol can be made out 
of anything: wood, straw, beans. It can be made out of any product 
that is grown and is renewable.
<P>
	As I mentioned before, ethanol is a cheaper and cleaner 
alternative fuel. Banning MMT makes way for corn growers across 
the country to contribute to the new exciting industry of alternative 
fuels. I am confident that this bill will benefit all Canadians by 
improving their health and their environment.
<P>
	There are questions why Bill C-29 is important. Bill C-29 
represents a prudent approach to ensuring that Canadian consumers 
and the environment are protected in view of uncertainties 
regarding the long term effect of MMT on advanced emission 
control 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5409"> 5409 </A></B>
<P>
technologies such as the onboard diagnostics that are now only 
emerging in the motor vehicle fleet on a widespread basis.
<P>
	Why is it important to have OBD systems in Canadian vehicles? 
OBD systems are designed to monitor the performance of pollution 
control systems, in particular the catalyst, and alert the driver to a 
malfunction. This could prevent cases of increasing tailpipe 
emissions, carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, which impact on 
local air quality, as well as carbon dioxide, the principal contributor 
to climate change.
<P>
	Properly functioning OBD systems are in essence an inspection 
and maintenance tool in the vehicle. Inspection and maintenance 
programs require vehicles to be emissions tested on a periodic 
basis. I feel the environment committees and ministries will be 
doing more of this to improve our society. Successful 
implementation of properly functioning OBD systems will permit 
all Canadians to benefit from such an emissions reduction strategy.
<P>
	For example, an assessment of the emissions benefit attributed 
to the air care inspection and maintenance program in the 
Vancouver area, conducted on an annual basis, shows that 
hydrocarbon emissions have been reduced by 20 per cent, carbon 
monoxide emissions by 24 per cent, nitrogen oxide emissions by 
2.7 per cent and fuel consumption by 5 per cent from the tested 
fleet.
<P>
	What are automakers going to do if MMT remains in Canadian 
fuels? The automakers have indicated that if MMT remains in 
Canadian gasoline they would take action ranging from 
disconnecting OBD sensors to removal of the OBD system and 
decreased warranty provisions for consumers. General Motors of 
Canada has already advised the government that it has disabled 
certain functions of the OBD system on 1996 model years.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	As I mentioned, by using ethanol these motors can run almost 
indefinitely. In our positions as members of Parliament we travel 
many miles in a year. Unfortunately, I must keep a car for a long 
time because I am not in a position to trade it too often. I put an 
immense amount of mileage on a vehicle.
<P>
	How is this action to eliminate MMT from Canadian fuel 
consistent with what is happening in U.S. fuel? The current 
Canadian situation is not consistent with the U.S. MMT is 
permitted up to twice the level in Canada today compared with the 
level now allowed in conventional U.S. gasoline. When we test 
gasoline for purities we use American gasoline to check mileage 
and emissions here in Canada. I think this is wrong. We should be 
using our own fuel to test.
<P>
	However, there remains considerable uncertainty about the 
widespread acceptance and the use of MMT in the U.S. First, there 
already exists a patchwork of fuels,  that is, some that use MMT 
and some that are MMT-free in the North American market.
<P>
	MMT is still not allowed in reformulated gasoline in the U.S. 
which is required in areas that suffer from extreme air pollution. 
Air pollution is starting to build up in the city of Toronto. Second, 
the Environmental Protection Agency supported by the 
Environmental Defence Fund has expressed serious concerns about 
the lack of data related to the use of MMT in gasoline and 
consequently has advocated a cautious approach with respect to the 
use of this additive.
<P>
	Third, many of the larger petroleum companies in the U.S. have 
indicated that they do not intend to use MMT. In Canada right now 
certain service stations use only an ethanol blend. In Chatham three 
different companies use an ethanol blend.
<P>
	The Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment task 
force report on cleaner vehicles and fuels recognized that fuels and 
emissions control technology should be treated as an integrated 
system to reduce motor vehicle emissions. The ministers have 
further agreed to require that cleaner fuels be mandated for use in 
all Canadian motor vehicles. The MMT initiative is fully consistent 
with that approach.
<P>
	I would like to thank all members of Parliament both on the 
government and opposition sides who supported the ethanol plant 
for the city of Chatham in the county of Kent. Without your help 
and the help of the minister it would never have been realized for 
our area. Chatham is still in a recession and this company will 
certainly benefit the area. For all the people in the riding of Kent 
and the county of Kent I wish to thank everyone for the efforts that 
helped to implement this project. I also wish to thank the 
Government of Canada for supporting this ethanol plant.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the hon. member for his speech, but I think it reflects, 
to some extent, the pressure exercised by lobbies and felt in this 
House since the bill was first tabled.
<P>
	I heard a lot about the ethanol plant, which is located in Ontario. 
The hon. member is from that region, and I do not blame him for 
his position, however, I would like to go back to some important 
facts.
<P>
	First, we asked the auto lobby and Ethyl corporation to submit 
studies.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	Ethyl Corporation provided independent studies confirming that 
MMT is not harmful to health, and that it is not harmful to 
automobiles either. We asked auto dealers to do the same, but were 
told: ``No, these are confidential studies. We cannot release them. 
It would be dangerous from a competition point of view''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5410"> 5410 </A></B>
<P>
	The point is that six provinces out of ten oppose this bill. Once 
again, the federal government is getting involved in a field of 
provincial jurisdiction. It will even prohibit the interprovincial 
trade of manganese. This is another reason why we will vote 
against the bill.
<P>
	In our amendment, we simply asked that the bill be read the third 
time six months from now. Again, we cannot be opposed to virtue. 
We ask that independent studies be done, so as to check the version 
of both sides and see if MMT is indeed dangerous and harmful, as 
claimed by some Mps and others, even though no conclusive 
studies support such claims.
<P>
	All we have is a 1994 study from the health department itself, 
which concludes there is no evidence that manganese is dangerous 
or harmful to health.
<P>
	There is another important point: manganese was just 
reintroduced into the U.S. market. The government talks about the 
North American market, but it wants to pass a bill to prohibit this 
product at home.
<P>
	The result is that this government is now being sued by Ethyl 
corporation, to the tune of $201 million, in U.S. dollars, for 
presumably violating certain NAFTA provisions. Mr. Speaker, I do 
not know if you have $201 million to invest in this bill, but I feel 
that, before making a decision like this one, we should do some 
thinking.
<P>
	In conclusion, we know that an ethanol plant was built. We have 
nothing against ethanol, but who knows, maybe in five or ten years, 
this product will be considered dangerous. After all, it is also an 
additive. We are talking about additives. This may not be the best 
solution to eliminate environmental problems caused by 
greenhouse gases generated by automobiles.
<P>
	Why not invest in a lasting technology such as the electric car? I 
discussed this option the other day. To replace an additive with 
another additive looks a lot like a response to big lobbies.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crawford: </B>Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank the hon. member 
for her questions and her statements concerning MMT and the 
studies that have been or have not been done over the years.
<P>
	I have only been in the House of Commons approximately eight 
years. The matter of ethanol production was brought up long before 
I arrived. The feeling was that we should look into ethanol.
<P>
	I believe hon. members have said that six provinces are not in 
favour of banning MMT. There are ethanol plants out west, down 
east, in Quebec. Those are the only plants I know of at the present 
time, that is, in three different provinces.
<P>
	I would imagine that Vancouver, and British Columbia in 
general, would certainly be in support of ethanol over MMT. As far 
as the safety of ethanol is concerned, whether it has been tested, all 
I know is if someone can  drink it, it cannot be that bad. One thing 
about ethanol, if your car breaks down, while you are waiting for 
help which takes a long time to arrive, you can sit there and drink 
ethanol. You might not be in shape to drive the car afterward, 
though.
<P>
	Ethanol has been proven to be very safe. MMT, on the other 
hand, has been banned in several states. I believe there are 16 states 
in which there is an outright ban. For areas that have large car 
populations such as Los Angeles, Chicago, Montreal, Quebec, 
Toronto, Vancouver it is to their benefit to be using ethanol instead 
of MMT.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	There has been what we call evidence, although Ethyl said that it 
is not evidence, coming from the United States. The United States 
has studied this for the last 50 years. Ethanol is nothing new. 
Ethanol has been produced in the United States for over 50 years. 
In fact, when Henry Ford first came out with the Tin Lizzy, the 
model-T, long before the hon. member was born, it burned ethanol 
at that time. I have driven a model-T, but not new.
<P>
	The evidence over the years in the United States has proven that 
there are problems with MMT. It is not banning it just for the sake 
of banning it. It is a very cheap additive. It is banning it because of 
health reasons.
<P>
	As far as the $201 million lawsuit, living on the border, I am 
very familiar with Americans. They sue everyone for anything. It is 
a good bluff.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, we are now at the next stage of 
debate. Speakers will have a maximum of 10 minutes without 
questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have been 
listening for a few days now to the famous debate on MMT and Bill 
C-29. For the benefit of those who are still wondering what MMT 
is after so many days of hearing about it in the House of Commons, 
it is methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl.
<P>
	I am surprised that Liberal members supporting the bill have not 
each given the name of the product in full, so dangerous does it 
appear to be, so chemical that anyone surveyed would oppose such 
a product.
<P>
	We know that it is a fuel additive, a manganese-based product 
used to increase the octane rating in gasoline and improve engine 
performance. It has been in use for a number of years.
<P>
	Before preparing my speech, I reread the speech of the hon. 
Minister of the Environment, who called for a ban on this additive 
in gasoline. We heard about children with respiratory problems, 
and city smog. It was a bit apocalyptic. It brought to mind certain 
futuristic films with gloomy cities whose inhabitants are all 
dressed in black, a bit like Batman films, where everything is dark 
and dirty. Such was the image evoked by the minister.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5411"> 5411 </A></B>
<P>
	However, on giving it further thought and listening to the 
speeches, we realize that many of our colleagues across the way 
are talking about ethanol. We are wondering whether this is a 
debate about MMT or about ethanol. We have questions. A closer 
look at the situation reveals that there are two large lobbies, two 
large organizations behind each of these products.
<P>
	First, there is the automobile lobby, which is telling us that 
MMT could damage the anti-pollution system. There was talk of 
fouled spark plugs. There was also talk of devices to test new 
motors. You know that there is a lot of computerization and 
electronics, and they are claiming that the presence of MMT in 
gasoline could cause this equipment to malfunction.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	According to the automobile manufacturers, the product presents 
a hazard. But if the product is harmful, we would have liked to see 
the Department of Health add it to its list of hazardous products. If 
it had, we would not have had this debate. The Minister of Health 
had the authority to do this.
<P>
	The Department of Health looked into the matter in 1994 and 
said there was no obvious hazard, and so the use of MMT as a gas 
additive was not prohibited.
<P>
	Then the following question arises: What are the arguments of 
those in favour of continuing this practice? Those in favour are 
mainly the oil companies. Here again, these are not necessarily 
companies that are very reliable from the average citizen's point of 
view, because the oil companies, like the automobile 
manufacturers, pursue their own particular interests. They have a 
vested interest in MMT as an additive. Let me explain: According 
to the oil companies, production costs would go up if MMT were 
ever to be replaced by another product.
<P>
	Meanwhile, the oil companies have other arguments as well, 
because they cannot just tell us it will cost us more and they will 
have to sell their products at a higher price. They are also warning 
us against replacing MMT with a specific product, ethanol, which 
we will discuss later on.
<P>
	There is also the issue of reducing the amount of nitrogen oxide. 
It seems that the presence of MMT would reduce the production of 
nitrogen oxide in the atmosphere. This is a positive factor, and the 
oil companies have mentioned this. I already mentioned the cost 
factor. The oil companies also quoted a study by the company that 
produces MMT. There is, after all, a company that has an interest in 
the production of MMT, Ethyl Corporation. It demonstrated on the 
basis of its studies that the product as such was not harmful.
<P>
	Considering these arguments, we are inclined to believe that the 
bill aimed at prohibiting the use of MMT is not entirely on solid 
ground.
<P>
	Much has been made of the fact that in the United States, the use 
of MMT as an additive was banned. However, there has been a 
court ruling allowing certain larger oil companies to resume adding 
MMT. So that argument is no longer valid.
<P>
	There is another argument in favour of maintaining the use of 
MMT as a gas additive, and that is NAFTA. As you know, we 
signed NAFTA several years ago. The Liberal Party was opposed to 
it. It was supposed to make very significant changes in the treaty, 
but it was all much ado about nothing, because there were no major 
changes. However, according to the NAFTA treaty, we would not 
necessarily have the right to ban the use of MMT.
<P>
	Earlier, there was a reference to a $200 million lawsuit, and one 
hon. member opposite said, in responding to the hon. member for 
Laurentides: ``They-the Americans-sue everyone for anything''. 
But when you read the American newspapers, you realize that 
people are being sued for enormous amounts of money. So I do not 
think it is very reasonable to argue that it does not really matter if 
we are sued, that we should not take it seriously, since it is just a 
way for American lawyers to make a living.
<P>
	There is another aspect we should not overlook, and it is that six 
provinces in Canada are opposed to this ban. If it were only 
Quebec, people could say that the Quebec separatists are at it again, 
objecting to a federal measure because it interferes with provincial 
jurisdictions, but here we have not one but six provinces. We could 
also mention a letter from the Premier of Saskatchewan who is 
opposed to banning MMT.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	We can see there are two lobbies in opposition here, the 
automotive lobby and the petroleum industry. However, we as 
legislators must reach a decision. We can see that the arguments for 
removing MMT from gasoline have no scientific basis. We can see 
that the arguments for continuing to introduce the 
manganese-based additive to gasoline are readily defended.
<P>
	There is another aspect which is becoming more and more 
obvious, one on which my colleague from the party in power has 
spoken at length just now: what would replace MMT, since 
gasoline needs to have an additive in order to have the proper 
octane level, would be ethanol. We note that there has been major 
development in that industry in Ontario.
<P>
	The other day, I heard our colleague for Lambton-Middlesex 
speaking of the imminent opening of a $153 million plant in 
Chatham, Ontario, which would provide an outlet for some of the 
15 million bushels of corn produced in the Chatham region.
<P>
	I am well aware that the product is being developed in Ontario, 
that they want to replace MMT with ethanol, but I feel this should 
be done openly. They ought to say: we have a Canadian product we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5412"> 5412 </A></B>
<P>
want to develop, and it  can be proven that it would replace MMT 
advantageously. Then they convince the gasoline companies to 
replace the MMT. There is no obligation for them to add MMT, 
they could just as easily put in ethanol.
<P>
	What we are doing now is doing the work of those who are trying 
to develop the ethanol industry in Canada. We are trying to get 
MMT taken out through binding legislation, which would leave 
only one possible additive, ethanol, which just so happens to 
benefit many ridings in Ontario.
<P>
	This is why my party will be voting against the bill. There is no 
proof that this is a dangerous product. It is not appropriate to vote 
in favour of such a bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise briefly in the debate on the MMT legislation. I will 
address some of the points raised by some of the opposition 
members with regard to this issue.
<P>
	The first issue is the impact of lobbying. All members must be 
well aware of the activity of lobby groups from various sectors of 
business and industry. Lobbyists to a great extent provide an 
interesting service to members of Parliament in that they bring to 
our attention their points of view and their interests with regard to 
proposed legislation. We cannot forget there are lobbyists on both 
sides of the question and probably on every position in between.
<P>
	Yesterday I had the opportunity to meet with representatives of 
the Canadian automobile dealers association. I had a good chat 
with their chairman, Mr. Douglas Leggat. We talked about a lot of 
issues. The lobby is not a single issue group. It represents Canadian 
automobile dealers association and not necessarily the 
manufacturing sector.
<P>
	The group has concerns besides banning MMT as an additive in 
our fuels. Its representatives had concerns about the propriety of 
banks getting into auto leasing. They had concerns about the GST 
discrepancy, about whether GST had to be dealt with on their 
trade-ins, whereas the small independents who apparently deal 
with the vast majority of used car transactions do not get caught by 
the GST situation. They are concerned with a broad spectrum of 
issues.
<P>
<B>(1045 )</B>
<P>
	The fact remains that it is not just the Canadian Automobile 
Dealers Association. Throughout the debate we have heard that 
virtually every automobile manufacturer has come out in support 
of the banning of MMT.
<P>
	MMT is a fuel additive which replaced lead in our gasoline. All 
members know of the problems we faced when we phased out lead 
because of the serious health consequences that could be caused 
over a long period of  time. As a result MMT, and I will not even try 
to pronounce the full name, is a complex chemical additive and 
replaces the additive lead which was necessary for the 
configuration of the combustion engines.
<P>
	A number of the Bloc members have said that they are not sure 
that it is a dangerous substance. I sense that they are trying to say 
that until we know it is dangerous, do not do anything. The first 
thing I thought of when I heard that argument was, is it a good 
policy to wait until after there is a problem to do something? 
Maybe it is more prudent and responsible to deal with issues on a 
preventative basis to make sure that we do not get ourselves into a 
situation such as we had with lead additives or with 
ureaformaldehyde insulation. Again, at the time it came out there 
was a lot of interest. It was a new product recommended by 
jurisdictional authorities. As everyone knows, serious problems 
were revealed later.
<P>
	On the point of not being sure, the issue is that we are not sure. 
There are no definitive studies that show the significance of the 
health impacts. There are some indications from some sectors. 
There is some disagreement and this is the reason that a strong 
central government is necessary because there is a disagreement 
among the provinces.
<P>
	Apparently six of the ten provinces have said they do not think 
they want to support the banning of MMT. I am not sure of their 
individual reasons. The fact remains that we are not meddling in 
provincial jurisdictions. This is a health issue and an environmental 
issue. The federal government has to be proactive in terms of the 
protection of the health of Canadians and of Canada's environment.
<P>
	There was some question about it having been reintroduced in 
the United States. Even the materials that were provided to 
members refute that as well. There are no major changes in the 
position of the U.S. More questions have been raised than answers 
given, quite frankly.
<P>
	This piece of legislation calls for the banning of MMT. If we 
need an additive and MMT is going to be banned, it will have to be 
replaced by something. Major petroleum industry representatives 
are looking at ethanol as the additive replacement. When I was with 
United Co-operatives of Ontario, our petroleum division actually 
had a test site in the production of ethanol. It could not keep enough 
of it in stock for consumers who wanted it because of the 
significant increase in the performance level of automobiles. That 
was in the Guelph area. As I recall, this was a big breakthrough.
<P>
	With regard to ethanol, another point that has been made by the 
opposition is that it is an Ontario issue. That is not quite right 
because there is an ethanol plant in Quebec and one out west. We 
now have a new plant in Chatham.

that members know.

<P>
	In closing I want to reiterate that the purpose of the bill is 
environmental health and protection. The most efficient way to 
ensure environmental health and protection is through pollution 
prevention. We have heard enough already about the impact on 
catalytic converters and the need for dealing with emissions into 
our environment.
<P>
	Cars are the single largest polluter of our environment. This is 
one constructive, positive and necessary step to make sure that 
Canada has a cleaner environment.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
this opportunity to take part in today's debate on Bill C-29, an act 
to regulate interprovincial trade in and the importation for 
commercial purposes of certain manganese-based substances.
<P>
	The purpose of Bill C-29 is to ban manganese-based products, 
including MMT, which are suspected by the government and the 
automobile industry of damaging antipollution devices in cars, 
although in Canada this substance has been added to most types of 
unleaded gasolines since 1977. Therefore it follows that MMT is 
harmful to the environment and to the health of Quebecers and 
Canadians. However, this is not so.
<P>
	When added in very small quantities, as it is in gasoline, MMT 
has been shown not to be harmful either to the environment or to 
health. Since the conclusions arrived at by Health Canada were not 
the ones the government expected, it had no other choice but to 
resort to a special piece of legislation to ban interprovincial trade in 
and importation for a commercial purpose of certain 
manganese-based substances, including MMT.
<P>
	After the auditor general, is it now the turn of Health Canada 
scientists to be the butt of Liberal wrath? One might wonder.
<P>
	If the Canadian government wants to legislate in this area, it is 
not on environmental grounds nor to protect the health of its 
citizens, but as the result of pressure from various lobbies. If MMT 
had been proven to be a health hazard, or harmful to the 
environment and cars, its use would have been banned a long time 
ago.
<P>
	To better understand the whole controversy surrounding the use 
or prohibition of MMT, it might help to mention again who the 
stakeholders are in this issue.
<P>
	First there is the Ethyl Corporation. Based in the United States, it 
manufactures lubricating additives and engine performance 
enhancing fuels. Moreover, it is the only exporter of MMT to 
Canada. MMT is added to gasoline in Sarnia, Ontario.
<P>
	Second, there is the American Environment Protection Agency. 
For years it has been fighting Ethyl in court to maintain the ban on 
MMT. On November 30, the EPA regulation was overruled by the 
US court of appeal in the District of Columbia. The EPA announced 
it did not intend to appeal the ruling.
<P>
	Third, there are the car manufacturers. They are against any kind 
of gasoline additives, including MMT. They are threatening to 
increase car prices in Canada and limit the warranty coverage on 
these cars if MMT is not banned. There is as yet no hard proof that 
MMT actually harms automobile pollution control systems.
<P>
	Last, there are the oil companies. They are in favour of MMT on 
technical grounds. Processing MMT is less intensive, therefore oil 
refinery smoke stacks release smaller quantities of pollutants into 
the atmosphere.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	And finally, ethanol producers are probably opposed to MMT 
because they believe ethanol would be an excellent alternative to 
MMT. It is interesting to note that ethanol is produced mainly in 
the riding of the former Minister of the Environment, the present 
Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	Therefore the whole issue of banning MMT is resulting in 
considerable costs for the oil industry. These costs could amount to 
$7 million in Quebec alone. Furthermore, oil companies could 
spread a rumour of massive layoffs, or price increases for the 
consumer, if MMT is not accepted.
<P>
	We must not forget that Canada is facing a suit for $275 million 
from Ethyl Corporation, based on the free movement of goods 
policy included in NAFTA. Personally, I believe the Minister of the 
Environment is taking a big risk, which could have unforeseeable 
consequences, on top of all the problems this would cause for the 
Canadian affiliate of Ethyl Corporation.
<P>
	Last February, the international trade minister wrote to the 
environment minister to remind him of that fact. But it seems the 
environment minister decided to wait and see whether Ethyl or the 
American government would initiate legal proceedings against the 
federal government for breach of the free trade agreement.
<P>
	Furthermore, as I mentioned before, banning MMT would 
benefit the ethanol industry, which is well developed in Ontario and 
the West, at the expense of the ethanol industry in Quebec which is 
barely beginning.
<P>
	I would like to explain the Bloc Quebecois' position. The Bloc is 
open to the passing of a bill banning the utilisation and the 
importation of MMT, provided it is proven that this product poses a 
threat to the environment and people's health. The Bloc Quebe-
<P>

<B><A NAME="5414"> 5414 </A></B>
<P>
cois even voted in favour of Bill C-29 to allow for a more thorough 
study in order that light could be shed on the whole issue.
<P>
	However, I must admit that debate and discussions brought to 
light not the harmful effects of MMT, but the stubbornness and 
partisanship of the present Minister of the Environment and of his 
predecessor, the Deputy Prime Minister. The Liberal government is 
showing no respect for the international trade agreements it signed 
and disregards the Canadian Constitution as far as provincial 
jurisdictions are concerned.
<P>
	When it tabled Bill C-29, the federal government declared it 
wanted to regulate gasoline distribution essentially for three main 
reasons, because MMT was hazardous to the health of Canadians 
and Quebecers, because it could damage pollution control devices 
and because we should harmonize our policies with the American 
ones. Unfortunately those arguments are no longer valid. A recent 
American ruling has shown that MMT has no harmful effects on 
pollution control systems.
<P>
	In conclusion, the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to Bill C-29 and 
that is why we shall vote against it.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am sorry, but this must come to an end, is that 
not so? We will now move on to members' statements.

	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
credibility of the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party 
becomes more and more questionable as each day passes. This is 
no more evident than in the case of his failure to demand the 
resignation of the Progressive Conservative second in command in 
the Senate. This Tory senator refuses to answer a court subpoena in 
Saskatchewan based on his parliamentary privilege. He is using an 
archaic, irrelevant, obsolete section of the Constitution to avoid 
appearing in court. This Tory senator's actions demean the integrity 
of Parliament and all politicians.
<P>
	What does the Progressive Conservative leader say for himself? 
Zilch, zippo, notta, not a peep.
<P>
	Hopefully this friendly reminder will motivate the Tory leader to 
stand up for the people of Saskatchewan and demand that the 
senator come out from behind his self-serving abuse of 
parliamentary privilege. Anything short of that demand will exhibit 
the Tory leader's contempt for parliamentarians, the democratic

GST with provincial sales taxes in three Atlantic provinces appears

not benefit consumers, workers or regional economies.
<P>

wrong direction for tax reform since it shifts taxes away from 
business and corporations and applies them to the poor, middle

	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, since coming to this House three years ago, I have seen 
some notable changes. Liberals have taken shaky, tentative steps in 
trying to implement Reform policies.
<P>
	The biggest contrast between a Reformer and a Liberal is their 
vision for the future of Canada. It is appropriate during family 
week to point out that Reform is the family friendly party because 
of its concern for children. Reform's fiscal policies are designed to 
lessen the debt and tax burden on our young people and to give 
them better jobs and more opportunities.
<P>
	The Liberal-Tory policies have instead forced our children to pay 
for government excesses that occurred before they were even born. 
Overtaxation forces both parents to work outside the home. A weak 
Young Offenders Act and targeting law-abiding citizens rather than 
criminals are the Liberal's legacy.
<P>
	However, the area where the most contrast exists is the Liberal 
vision for the future, which redefines families. Social engineering 
does not work. Liberals obviously are not learning their lessons by 
attending Reform school, so implementation of the Reform vision 
will have to be left to a Reform government.

<P>
	Families are the building blocks of society. But what has this 
Liberal government done to protect them? Regarding finances, 
since the Liberals came to power the average annual family income 
has dropped by about $3,000. The old line parties structured 
income tax so that families in which one parent stays at home to 
care for children pay many thousands of dollars more in taxes than 
families that pay someone else to look after their youngsters.
<P>
	Regarding safety, the Liberals still put the rights of criminals 
ahead of society's right for safety. After all, it is the children who 
are the main victims of young offenders. And kids themselves want 
the Young Offenders Act made a lot tougher. In many cities today 
kids dare not wear a favourite T-shirt or sports cap to school for 
fear they will be mugged or it will be stolen.

<P>
	The family is the basic unit of humanity, without which society 
as we know it would cease to exist. Family means children, the 
guardians of our future. Family means unselfishly putting the 
interests of our children ahead of our own, and family means 
providing care, support and love to each other for life.
<P>
	Strong families are less likely to depend on social assistance, 
less likely to have children living in poverty, less likely to become 
chronic users of health care and less likely to run afoul of the laws 
of Canada.

and DMX's licences even though these businesses had not changed 
their programming one bit.
<P>
	Does the minister recognize that the conditions that prompted 
her to return DMX's licence to the CRTC still prevail and that 
DMX still has a major problem in terms of the Canadian and 
French language content requirements?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, both licensees the hon. 
member is referring to have agreed to comply with Canadian 
content requirements. They are also committed to increasing 
Canadian content by 25 per cent.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, </B><B>BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that may have been the case for Power, which, in any case, 
decided to put its licence on ice. But such is not the case for DMX, 
which was authorized by the CRTC to carry 17 U.S. channels out of 
a 110-channel pool.
<P>
	How can the minister claim there is no problem, since otherwise, 
the U.S. Trade Secretary would stop writing to his Canadian 
counterpart, the Minister for International Trade. There is indeed a 
problem.
<P>
	On September 27, in this House, the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage made a commitment to protect Canadian broadcasting 
interests. Can the minister confirm today that she is staying on 
course and that protecting the cultural interests of Canada and 
Quebec remains her priority?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Yes, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the U.S. government is exerting enormous pressure on the 
Canadian government to make concessions in the DMX matter. 
The Americans' goal is clear: getting rid of the cultural exemption 
clause in NAFTA.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Canadian Heritage admit today in this 
House that, if her government makes concessions in the DMX 
matter, it will be easy for the U.S. to circumvent the cultural 
exemption clause in NAFTA?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I want to stress the fact 
that, after we decided to return the licence applications filed by 
Power, DMX, Galaxy and Allegro, both Power and DMX agreed to 
increase Canadian content by 25 per cent and made a commitment 
to comply with the French language content requirements set out in 
the existing legislation.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	That is why we have protected Canadian culture and will protect 
Canadian culture. One thing is clear: a 25 per cent increase in 
Canadian content cannot be called a loss.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, to 
our knowledge, only Allegro, Galaxie and Power Music Choice 
have written to the CRTC to refuse to use the license clause 
allowing for assembly. DMX never wrote to the CRTC to say that it 
would not use this clause.
<P>
	In this context, Allegro and Galaxie are Canadian audio services 
companies whose programming will be done entirely in Canada. 
The content of their broadcast will be 30 per cent Canadian and 25 
per cent French, in accordance with the rules on Canadian content 
in the broadcasting sector.
<P>
	Does the minister recognize that Galaxie and Allegro will be the 
victims of unfair competition by DMX Music, and that DMX will 
import unauthorized American channels and, more importantly, 
will be subject to licensing requirements clearly less rigorous as 
regards Canadian and French content?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, instead of relying on the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I>, the hon. member should have waited for my 
department's press release to get the facts. These facts are as 
follows: DMX and Power Corporation have both agreed to the 
same conditions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the minister will have to make a decision in the case of DMX and 
as regards the licenses obtained from the CRTC. Does the minister 
recognize that, if she is prepared to protect Canadian content and 
the interests of the Canadian and Quebec cultures, she has the 
power, under the CRTC act, to cancel DMX's license?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, Power Corporation and 
DMX agreed to increase their Canadian content by 25 per cent, 
following cabinet interventions and decisions-
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> That is not true.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Copps:</B> The hon. member says it is not true in the case of 
DMX. I have a written commitment from DMX. This is why I 
suggest to the hon. member that he should wait for the cabinet 
decision, instead of getting his information from the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I>. He will see, in writing, that the commitment made by DMX 
is the same as that made by Power Corporation.

	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on July 27 
the Minister of Natural Resources wrote the following regarding 
the route of the Sable Island gas pipeline: ``The Government of 
Canada has no intention of interfering with the regulatory process 
in favour of one project over another and ultimately market forces 
will decide which project will succeed''.
<P>
	We note that earlier, on June 7, after a meeting with the premier 
of Quebec, the Prime Minister had stated: ``We will work toward 
supporting the Quebec proposal''. Interestingly, yesterday the 
Prime Minister said he wanted to see the gas pipeline go through 
Quebec.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Natural Resources. Is it she 
who speaks for the government when saying that the free market 
will dictate the route of the pipeline, or is it the Prime Minister who 
says the pipeline must go to Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the project will require 
the approval of the National Energy Board on matters of need, 
financial integrity, of routing and environment and other public 
interest considerations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that was 
well read.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister's comments on this issue, both on June 7 and 
on October 10 have basically compromised the object-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Volpe:</B> Come on, Jim. Let's see if you can come up with 
something.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> The parliamentary secretary and I are going to have 
a reading contest today.
<P>
	Obviously, the Prime Minister has learned nothing from the 
national energy program. I do not have to read about that. The 
Liberals will remember. That was the program which caused tens 
of thousands of Albertans to go into personal bankruptcy over the 
ill-thought out Liberal national energy program. They are doing it 
again.
<P>
	Why is the Prime Minister trying to influence the National 
Energy Board by exerting political pressure to re-route this pipeline 
through Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, additionally more of 
the projects will need the approval of the marketplace.
<P>
	For projects to proceed, they will also need the support of the 
customers to guarantee the economic feasibility of the pipeline 
project. Every project will receive the same regulatory treatment 
from the federal regulatory agencies. The principles of fairness, 
equity and efficiency will be applied to all proposals.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
reading contest is becoming fun. On one hand, I have a question, on 
the other hand, she has an answer to a question that I have not 
asked. We will have to get on to the same page.
<P>
	The author of the report on the Sable pipeline route stated that 
the building of the Sable gas pipeline to the U.S. through Nova 
Scotia and southern New Brunswick makes the most sense. This 
proposal is 100 per cent private sector funded. Gaz Metropolitan, 
on the other hand, is proposing that customers of TransCanada 
PipeLines subsidize the cost of the Prime Minister's Sable 
Island-Quebec diversion by a 3 per cent increase in price. This is a 
3 per cent tax increase on heating the homes of Canadian families, 
any way you slice it.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Natural Resources unequivocally renounce 
this 3 per cent tax increase on heating Canadian homes?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I stated before, all 
the projects are going to require the approval of the National 
Energy Board.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on Wednesday, the Minister of Finance confirmed that he 
would stick with the policy he began three years ago. While 
admitting that he found the job situation worrisome, he went on in 
the same breath to tell us that no additional measure would be 
necessary to stimulate job creation.
<P>
	This morning, the wonderful results of the minister's policy 
were announced. Statistics Canada confirmed that not only is the 
job situation worrisome, as the minister said, but that it is a 
veritable disaster, with the unemployment rate on the increase. And 
we have him to thank for it.
<P>
	I put the following question to him: Will the minister come to his 
senses and admit that his government is on the wrong track with its 
job creation policy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
there is no doubt that the figures we saw this morning are very 
disappointing. However, sight must not be lost of the fact that the 
monthly figures are very volatile. We saw this last June and we saw 
it again this morning. But we also saw that we created 82,000 jobs 
in  Canada last month, twice the number of jobs that unfortunately 
disappeared today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5420"> 5420 </A></B>
<P>
	This indicates very clearly, and I am certain that the member 
across the way will agree with me, that this is a very complex 
problem. We can see this in the discussions at the Quebec summit. 
It is a problem that will only be solved by expanding our export 
markets, and providing better manpower training. There is no 
magic formula. We are working very hard on this. Furthermore, the 
trend this year is positive; to date, 55,000 new jobs have been 
created in the private sector.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I agree with the minister that the situation is complex, but 
something must be done. We are 870,000 jobs short of what we had 
before the recession, and the minister sits back and does nothing 
but spout lofty speeches about job creation.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	I formally ask the minister, on behalf of unemployed workers in 
Canada, whether he is immediately going to implement a real 
measure to stimulate employment, in the form of a substantial 
reduction in employers' and employees' rates of contribution to the 
unemployment insurance fund. Not the measly 5 cents he told us 
about yesterday, but a substantial reduction, like the Bloc 
Quebecois has been asking him for since we first came to this 
House, and like the Canadian Chamber of Commerce asked him for 
last week, a full 60 cents less.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
have already indicated that it is certainly a priority for the 
government to reduce unemployment insurance premiums. 
Furthermore, we have suited action to word in the past. I must point 
out that, last year, the decrease in unemployment insurance 
contributions was, with one exception, the largest decrease since 
the creation of the unemployment insurance program: $1.8 million.
<P>
	Second, I told the member that unemployment insurance is not 
the only drain on payrolls. There are also provincial deductions for 
health benefits and the CSST. With your permission, I would like to 
tell you, just to show that there is no magic solution, what the 
president of the Association des manufacturiers exportateurs du 
Québec had to say this morning. A survey of its members 
concerning the decrease in payroll taxes revealed that only 4 per 
cent of them replied that this measure will lead directly to the 
creation of jobs.
<P>
	At the same time, Mr. Ponton said that lowering payroll taxes 
does not necessarily result in the creation of jobs. This is simply to 
say that there is no magic solution. Yes, premiums must be 
lowered, but there is no magic formula.

	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
direct my question to the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	Here we go again. The last time the Liberal government told 
Canadians that oil and gas should be to their benefit the natural 
resources of the west were pillaged and plundered. Now the Prime 
Minister is trying to sell this same story to the people of Nova 
Scotia.
<P>
	My question for the Deputy Prime Minister is very succinct. 
Why is the government caving in to the demands of a separatist 
government in Quebec instead of defending the rights of loyal 
people and a loyal government in Nova Scotia?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the allegations made by 
the hon. member are a disgrace.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has stated clearly throughout this process 
that he intends to respect the commercial viability of any 
agreement that might be signed. Frankly, I think the intention of the 
Reform Party to try to create another incident to cut Quebec away 
from Canada is disgraceful.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think that if this 
Deputy Prime Minister and this government were to pay attention 
they would realize that the people at the extreme ends of this 
country are dissatisfied with the way Ottawa is mismanaging our 
affairs. That is the message.
<P>
	There is a very basic principle at stake here and that is the 
independence of the National Energy Board. Twice the Prime 
Minister has publicly made statements using his position as Prime 
Minister to pressure this board. I would think his own invisible 
guidelines would have rules against that.
<P>
	Why is the government meddling in the affairs of the 
independent National Energy Board?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the member will go 
back to the response of the Prime Minister to a question of a 
student at an open meeting in Nova Scotia, he said that what is in 
the best interest of Canada is obviously to have linkages in Canada 
when it is commercially viable. That is exactly the position that he 
took in the House of Commons and exactly the position that he 
took in response to questions from the Reform Party.
<P>
	Frankly the attempt of the extremists which the member speaks 
about, the extremists in the Reform Party who want to create a fight 
with Quebec on every single issue, do not care about building a 
nation. What they care about is building obstacles to try and tear 
this country apart. That is not what this Prime Minister and this 
Liberal government is all about.

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Human 
Resources Development.
<P>
	Youth unemployment has reached unacceptable levels. The 
statistics confirmed once again this morning that young people are 
among those most severely affected by job losses. Their official 
unemployment rate has increased again and is now at 16.6 per cent. 
More than 400,000 young people are out of work, and we know that 
out there the situation is actually even worse. However, we know 
that the Department of Human Resources Development still has 
$45 million left of the $105 million announced this spring to help 
develop jobs for youth.
<P>
	I would appreciate a clear answer to the following question: Can 
the minister guarantee that the as yet unused amount of $45 million 
will be spent by the end of the year, in a serious effort to help young 
people return to the labour market?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to confirm to the 
hon. member that I will give him a clear reply. The amounts 
announced in the last budget for youth employment totalled $315 
million, to be spent in the next few years.
<P>
	The unemployment situation among young people is 
unacceptable, and we are keenly aware of this. This fall we intend 
to announce a youth initiative. But we are trying to be a responsible 
government; just because the money is there does not mean we are 
going to waste it. We will have a youth initiative, to be announced 
this fall.
<P>
	I intend to discuss this in cabinet during the next few weeks. I 
can inform you that this initiative will be used to create durable 
jobs for young people. We want to give them the kind of experience 
that will help them become better integrated in the labour market. 
Young people need experience, and we need their enthusiasm, and 
we intend to do something about this in the weeks to come.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when will the minister have some concrete 
announcements for young people, and when will young people be 
able to report to their local employment centres to get the practical 
help they need to re-enter the labour market? That is my question.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, last summer we doubled the 
amount of money available for youth employment, and we were 
delighted with the results.
<P>
	I will go to cabinet with a comprehensive youth initiative, which 
will include funding not only from the Department of Human 
Resources Development, but more, because I know that the 
Minister responsible for CIDA and the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
are ready to do their share. Young people will have a better hope of 
entering our labour market in a variety of areas. The Minister of 
Industry, who is a great fan of our young people, will urge them to 
join the technology sector.

disappeared last month. Let there be no doubt the Liberal policy of 
jobs, jobs, jobs is in the tank.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. How can this 
minister say on Wednesday that the future of Canada is fine, but on 
Friday it is clear that the future of working families is on the line?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
the hon. member had been there, he would have noticed a very 
heavy emphasis being placed on the absolute necessity of focusing 
on job creation and on the re-establishment of a whole series of 
programs which the government has brought in on trade and youth 
employment, as the minister of human resources has just set out.
<P>
	The basic difference that occurred at that meeting on Wednesday 
was that we said the deficit reduction was not as the Reform Party 
would postulate as an end in itself but it was simply a means to 
greater job creation and that the reduction in interest rates has led 
to more investment and will lead to more job creation.
<P>
	The hon. member knows there is a lag time. A year ago interest 
rates were at 8.5 per cent and are now at 3.5 per cent. There is not 
an economist across the country who does not say that is the single 
most important foundation for future jobs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, rosy 
predictions and forecasts do not put a turkey on the table this 
weekend and that is what Canadians want. Canadians have 
mortgages to pay. They have rent to pay. They have car loans to 
pay. They have student loans to pay. They have families to feed.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	On Wednesday the Minister of Finance said that if you are 
sinking below a mountain of debt you will feel better because the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5422"> 5422 </A></B>
<P>
rates are lower. When people lose their jobs they are devastated and 
this government does not seem to care.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance give Canadians the tax cut they 
need now so they can save their jobs now and create more jobs 
now? That requires no bureaucracy, no administration, and that can 
be in place this weekend.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
had the hon. member been there and had he listened, he would 
know what was said. When somebody buys a new car today it costs 
$500 less in interest. That puts money in his pocket. When he has to 
renew his mortgage it puts $3,000 more in his pocket. That helps 
the economy.
<P>
	We keep going back to this new found interest of the Reform 
Party in job creation. On September 18, 1993 in Penticton, British 
Columbia the Reform Party leader said that it would take up to 
three years before any job creation would occur under his party's 
economic plan. He went on to say that his zero in three plan would 
actually cost more jobs in the interim.
<P>
	If his plan had been followed there would be negative job 
creation in Canada. Under the Liberals there have been over 
600,000 new jobs created. We are ahead of them by a lot.

	I am pleased to report that I met with my provincial colleagues in 
Charlottetown over the last three days and we now have a new 
program, Road Safety Vision 2001, which we will implement. The 
key to the success of the initiative is that we will crack down on 
impaired driving and high risk drivers. We will work to increase

promote literacy, what is the best way to promote greater 
education. If the hon. member will look at what we did in the last 
budget, the increase in the education credits, the increase in the 
credits available to allow single mothers to go back to school and 
take care of their children at the same time, she will notice that this 
government puts great store in increased education and literacy. 
What the government is really seeking is the best method to 
accomplish it with very scarce financial resources.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I must remind the minister that the GST is still going to be 
on the books. The provinces may bite the bullet themselves and 
take the 8 per cent rebate, but the GST will still be on books and 
this government promised to remove it. If mothers have to buy a 
science or medical book which may cost $100 and they are paying 
an additional 15 per cent, that is just too much money.
<P>
	I say again the statistics find that an unemployed person is three 
times more likely to be at the lowest reading level than someone 
who is employed. I again ask the Minister of Finance to please 
address this question: When will the government help families, 
help those mothers at home, keep its election promise and remove 
the GST on books?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
the hon. member knows full well, there are  books and there are 
books. As the Minister of Industry has just said, is the member 
recommending that we basically take the tax off smut? Is it not 
worthwhile in this particular society to make sure that in fact we 
focus that money on learning materials? Is it not worthwhile that 
we enable the mothers the hon. member referred to, to be able to 
have decent care at home for their children so that they can go out 
and increase their capacity to learn?
<P>
	This government essentially has a restricted budget as indeed the 
Reform Party I think understands. What we really want to do is to 
target those moneys where we are going to get the maximum 
impact. That is what we are in the process of doing.

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	We read in this morning's <I>Le Devoir</I> that the Minister of 
Transport is using a new diversionary tactic in an attempt to 
reassure his Liberal colleagues about his favouritism for Canadian 
Airlines. As the article says, the minister's arguments do not bear 
close scrutiny. The minister does not mention that he is limiting Air 
Canada's access to Canadian's traditional market, while he is 
throwing Air Canada's traditional markets wide open to Canadian.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	Rather than referring to the policy of the former government, can 
the minister explain his own double standard policy to us, one 
which has Air Canada losing Prague after 365 days, while 
Canadian has nearly two years to provide service to India, the 
Philippines and Malaysia?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for this opportunity to speak on 
the government's policy on Canadian air carriers. We want 
travellers to be able to choose between the two carriers, and others 
in Canada, and we want the Canadian airline industry itself to be 
strong.
<P>
	Our policy will support that objective. Our policy on air 
transportation is focussed on how to make the pie bigger, not just 
on dividing it up. That is what differentiates us from the Bloc. They 
just want to divide it up into smaller portions, while we want to 
make the whole pie bigger.
<P>
	For example, in the past 14 to 16 months, Air Canada has created 
a thousand other jobs for its transborder services. Canadian has 
done the same thing, with 700 new jobs. Bombardier has just got a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5424"> 5424 </A></B>
<P>
billion dollar jet order.  What we are trying to do then, is to make 
the pie bigger, not divide it into smaller portions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, unfortunately, the minister's actions speak louder than his 
words. If the 365 day policy is as rigid as the minister claims it is, 
how can he justify waiting more than 412 days before imposing his 
rule and withdrawing the Prague route from Air Canada, on the 
very day Air Canada was setting the date for service to Prague?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the use it or lose it policy of the government, established 
by this government was that if an airline did not pick up the route 
and use it within the required period of time, which is one year, it 
would be offered to another airline. We do not wait until the exact 
second of 365 days and then say that it is over. If there was no other 
airline that wanted to come in, we would probably let the thing 
slide. But the principle of use it or lose it remains our policy.
<P>
	Under this policy Air Canada has acquired a substantial number 
of new routes. It has the majority of the routes which Canadian 
airlines overall have established with the United States since open 
skies. It has 60 per cent of the international routes and 70 per cent 
of the travellers internationally to or from Canada.
<P>
	If that is mistreatment of Air Canada, and in addition Air Canada 
has been given rights to markets it never had before, such as Japan 
and Hong Kong, and if that is mistreatment of Air Canada, I would 
like to know what the hon. member is suggesting.

	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, during this 
family week the most poignant letters I have received have been 
from families of AIDS sufferers worrying about health research 
funding. I also got letters from those with schizophrenic family 
members who are worried about health research funding. The 
Liberal solution is to bend to the loudest lobby group. Reform 
however has a better solution: clear, concise, precise guidelines for 
apportioning that medical research funding.
<P>
	Will the Liberals adopt clear, precise, specific guidelines for the 
apportioning of medical research funding?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we already have a very clear funding 
allocation formula.
<P>
	I remind the member for Macleod and other members of the 
House that currently the Government of Canada allocates some 
$40.7 million per year for AIDS research and treatment. Of this, 
$17 million is allocated for  research and epidemiological 
monitoring. That includes $5.5 million annually administered 
through the national health research development program; $1.5 
million annually in national welfare grants research; an average of 
$3 million annually for infrastructure in the Canadian HIV trials 
network. The remainder of that amount, approximately $8 million, 
is with the health protection branch. Further, the Medical Research 
Council contributes a further $2 million for AIDS research. I think 
that is pretty clear.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
parliamentary secretary makes my point. Here we have the loudest 
lobby group with a huge amount of funding and the schizophrenic 
society literally with nothing. In fact, a triathlete just this last year 
had to ride across the country to raise the profile of schizophrenia 
for funding. Researchers are actually out lobbying for funding.
<P>
	All we ask, and here is the specific question, will this 
government adopt specific, clear, fair guidelines so that all diseases 
will be able to get their fair share of funding, not just some disease 
with a loud lobby group?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have an enormous amount of respect 
for the member opposite so I am a little confused as to why he 
would ask this House to mix messages regarding one disease and 
put it in opposition to another. If people are suffering from 
diseases, then we treat them individually. We do not try to 
politicize one in opposition to the other.
<P>
	As the hon. member well knows, Health Canada is adopting a 
population health approach to treating diseases. I think he would be 
more than pleased to see that under that approach the funding for 
all diseases will be carefully allocated. There is no one sector of 
society that should be mistreated simply because of one's political 
views on the issue.

well knows what they can look forward to is a much improved 
financial instrument.
<P>
	The Canada savings bond, as I am sure all members in this

secure investment for Canadians.

	This year the government is pleased to announce under the new

those Canadians who are holding a compound CSB. That is to say 
while the rate in the first year will be 3 per cent, it will rise at 
a minimum level each and every year to 8.75 per cent over the

there is nobody who would like to see us take the tax off books 
more than I would. Perhaps there is one other person.
<P>
	The hon. member will understand that a common base is very 
important in the application of a tax such as this because it enables 
us to have substantially lower administrative costs.
<P>
	The hon. member also knows that there are exemptions on taxes 
such as this available to certain organizations. He also knows that 
the tax is not in fact the full 7 per cent, depending upon the 
institution that is buying the book. Certain institutions have 
reduced rates.

	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, B.Q.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	On June 12, in responding to a question of mine, the Minister of 
Transport refused to impose a moratorium on the closure of the 
track maintenance equipment repair and overhaul shop at Joffre 
station, in Charny, claiming that there was no increased risk from a 
safety point of view. Since then, evidence has shown that these 
risks have increased 50 per cent.
<P>
	Before the Joffre shop closes on October 30, will the minister act 
responsibly and impose a moratorium on this closure, so that a 
study to estimate the risks involved can be carried out?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I constantly get questions from the other side of the House 
claiming, quite inaccurately, that there are increases in risk in the 
railway system in the province of Quebec.
<P>
	There are from time to time minor variations among all 
provinces but essentially when we look at accidents in the various 
categories in which they are analyzed, there has been a slight 
increase in some of the derailments but not at all untoward and 
certainly not out of the ordinary with respect to the normal 
variation statistics.
<P>
	I find the question very puzzling. The changes have been made 
and efficiencies have occurred. However, we cannot continue to 
maintain exactly the previous systems and then expect to get 
improvements in the future. We have to be willing to make changes 
to the system that the railways use and in the future we can expect 
improvements. We cannot have it both ways, as the hon. member 
seems to think.

the purchase of Purolator Courier, Canada Post has become the 
largest player in the Canadian courier industry, and allegations of 
cross-subsidization, overly aggressive business practices and 
unfair competition in the marketplace are cited throughout the 
Radwanski report on Canada Post.
<P>
	The Radwanski report recommends that Canada Post sell 
Purolator Courier and get out of the courier business altogether. Yet 
the minister responsible refuses to follow this recommendation.
<P>
	Why is the minister refusing to take Canada Post out of the 
courier business?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the member for 
Lévis, I have the good fortune of having in my riding an extremely 
important business: the Ultramar refinery.
<P>
	I would like to familiarize this House with the views of its 
executives. I do not feel impertinent in the least; in the past two 
days, what have we in this House heard from Liberal members, 
especially those from Ontario? We have heard them defend 
Ontario's interests with respect to ethanol.
<P>
	In this debate, the government wants to ban the use of MMT as a 
fuel additive. I would like us to address this issue, but the 
amendment moved by my colleague, the hon. member for 
Laurentides, would defer debate for six months so that a scientific 
study can be carried out to prove that this product is indeed 
harmful. This is something that has never been clearly 
demonstrated.
<P>
	I am referring to the arguments raised by Ultramar, which is a 
member of the Canadian Petroleum Products Institute. I would like 
to put forward some arguments, since they must be heard in this 
House.
<P>
	According to the Canadian Petroleum Products Institute and the 
Ultramar refinery, car manufacturers have never proved clearly and 
factually that MMT can adversely affect the operation of catalytic 
converters.
<P>
	Health Canada formally stated in public and in writing that there 
was not a shred of evidence that MMT threatened the health of 
Canadians. This is not insignificant. This statement was made by 
Health Canada, the federal department of health.
<P>
	Another argument is that adding MMT to gasoline helps reduce 
toxic emissions. As we know, since 1976, this much safer additive 
has been used instead of lead, because something must be added to 
gasoline. Furthermore, the other elements in gasoline are known to 
be somewhat toxic. So why MMT? To reduce the impact of toxic 
emissions.
<P>
	Another argument is that two federal ministers, the Minister of 
Natural Resources and the Minister for International Trade, have 
expressed reservations in this regard. According to the Minister for 
International Trade, this bill might violate the NAFTA agreement 
signed with the U.S. This is not insignificant as we could then be 
hit by a multimillion dollar lawsuit.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-29 banning the importation and interprovincial trade of 
MMT violates NAFTA, a point of view shared also by Gordon 
Ritchie, the former Canadian negotiator for NAFTA-far from 
being a nobody, this is the former Canadian negotiator-and for the 
interprovincial trade agreement.
<P>
	Another argument we heard is that car manufacturers rejected 
the proposal of the Canadian Petroleum Products Institute to have 
an independent organization investigate and report on the issue. 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5428"> 5428 </A></B>
<P>
They formally committed to act on the conclusions of such an 
independent study. They really do want an independent study.
<P>
	The last argument is that banning MMT threatens the 
competitiveness of the Quebec refinery industry and that would not 
be in the best interests of Canadian and Quebec consumers. This 
also is important. As we well know, the government never told us 
about the costs. They are not mentioned here either, but we know 
that it adds up to several hundreds of millions of dollars, a 
significant amount in these hard times.
<P>
	As a member of the Bloc Quebecois committed to protecting the 
best interests of Quebec at all times, I want to remind the hon. 
members of this House that the Quebec National Assembly 
unanimously approved the following resolution: ``That the national 
assembly request the postponement of federal Bill C-29 concerning 
the gasoline additive MMT as long as environmental studies have 
not been conducted in a conclusive manner''.
<P>
	If Quebec was the only one to make this request, it might not be 
enough, but at a energy ministers' conference, at least six provinces 
expressed the same view. Provincial ministers are not alone, the 
Premier of Saskatchewan, Roy Romanow, send a letter to Mr. 
Chrétien on September 16, asking him the exact same thing. We 
know that, in 1982, during the Constitutional debate, Mr. 
Romanow was a very close friend of Mr. Chrétien, who should now 
listen to him.
<P>
	I will point out that the Minister of International Trade also 
wrote, on February 23, stating that he had problems with this bill, 
and yet the current Minister of the Environment is forging ahead.
<P>
	As a member of the Standing Committee on Health, I looked 
more particularly at this aspect. I read the report of a study 
conducted in 1989 for Health Canada by the University of 
Montreal. It said: ``It is difficult to assess the effects linked to the 
environmental exposure to Mn-manganese-coming from MMT 
due to the incomplete nature of toxicological data on long term 
exposure to small concentrations. Although the emission of Mn 
coming from MMT can be associated mainly with the inhalation of 
manganese oxide, a complete assessment of multiple exposure to 
manganese must take into account all means of absorption, 
including the oral route. Food accounts for over 90 per cent of all 
manganese absorbed by humans''. We routinely eat manganese and 
all of a sudden the government is concerned about what can be 
found in car exhaust.
<P>
	And this is not all: ``With regard to drinking water, although its 
manganese contribution is less than 3 per cent of that of food, its 
assessment is critical to an overall evaluation of total exposure''. 
Tests were conducted on animals, and the study points out that as 
far as they know, in humans, only one case of poisoning due to  
manganese in rain water is known. This case, involving very high 
concentrations of Mn, happened in Japan in 1941. The only known 
case was caused by water, not by an airborne pollutant. The only 
case was found in Japan in 1941.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	This should lead government members to think it over and to 
track down other cases. I will not imitate Reform members who 
had horrible stories to tell. If they had any today, they could tell us 
about them, but only one case is known throughout the whole 
world, and it happened in Japan, back in 1941. The United States 
apparently had the same problem, the very same doubts, and we all 
know how they solved it recently. The issue was appealed and 
people who, like the present Liberal Party, tried to demonstrate the 
risk of MMT failed.
<P>
	There is now an interest here in ethanol. We do not question its 
value, its importance, but we feel that, under the circumstances, a 
six month postponement would allow the government to establish 
its position more strongly, especially, as I said at the beginning, 
since the proposed amendment will lead to expenses of hundreds of 
millions of dollars for taxpayers.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion, and of the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to take part in this closing debate on the bill 
dealing with manganese-based additives.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5429"> 5429 </A></B>
<P>
	It is important to clearly understand the objectives of this bill. 
Manganese is one of the elements found in MMT, which is added 
to gasoline. The bill seeks to ensure that manganese can no longer 
be added to gasoline.
<P>
	When we hear names of chemical products like this one, our 
initial reaction is often that we must absolutely eliminate all 
dangerous elements. In this particular case, the government 
originally had three arguments to support its bill.
<P>
	First, it claimed that MMT was a threat to health. However, this 
argument was rebutted by Health Canada and is no longer valid.
<P>
	Second, the government said manganese was also harmful to the 
anti-pollution systems in automobiles. This claim is no longer valid 
either, since it was contradicted by the ruling of a U.S. court. 
Indeed, the same issue surfaced in the United States and, following 
a court ruling, it was realized there was no evidence supporting the 
claim that manganese was dangerous.
<P>
	The third claim, which is the really trickiest one, is that the bill 
to prohibit manganese would help harmonize our policies with 
those of the Americans. In fact, it will have precisely the opposite 
effect.
<P>
	The manganese currently found in gasoline is produced by Ethyl, 
a U.S.-based corporation which, following the introduction of this 
bill, instituted proceedings against the Government of Canada, 
something which could end up costing close to $300 million to the 
Canadian government, under specific NAFTA provisions. As you 
know, NAFTA is the North American Free Trade Agreement that 
binds Canada, the United States and Mexico.
<P>
	So, the Government of Canada knows that, by passing this bill, it 
will put itself in a difficult position, given this court action, which 
is definitely not frivolous in nature. This is an action being brought 
under NAFTA sections 1110, 1106 and 1102 and, moreover, 
supported by a letter from this Liberal government's international 
trade minister to the environment minister advising that it would be 
better not to follow through with this legislation because the action 
against us is very risky. Odds are that we lose in the end.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	It is obvious that if Parliament does pass this bill, that would 
amount to deciding to invest that sum of money and this would lead 
to expenditures that could have been avoided. These are mistakes 
the government should not make.
<P>
	I do not think that we are in a position to pour $300 million down 
the drain, saying odds are that we will lose but that we are going 
ahead, nevertheless. Why? Why, when the argument that this 
threatens health has been refuted by Health Canada, when the 
argument about the  antipollution systems has been dismissed by an 
U.S. court ruling on the issue, and when it has been established that 
there is no danger for pollution control equipment.
<P>
	Instead, we will have a legislation which will aggravate the 
relationships between Canada and the United States. Why then is 
the government still going ahead with this legislation?
<P>
	The answer is an old answer in Canada, it has been there for a 
very long time. This government has a strong majority from 
Ontario, and its aim is to foster the economic development of that 
province at the expense of the six other provincial governments, 
including Quebec National Assembly, which has unanimously 
called for the postponement of this bill.
<P>
	The ministers involved, the Deputy Prime Minister and the 
present environment minister, are all from Ontario, and they have 
decided, come hell or high water, to have the government endorse 
that view even if it is not a good bill for all Canadians. It is a bad 
bill, because it is going to poison relations between Canada and the 
United States.
<P>
	In the context of NAFTA, when countries have to negotiate, 
there is always give and take. When our case is not good, as with 
this bill on MMT, we have to give the Americans something in 
exchange.
<P>
	Proceedings could be initiated against us, and we would perhaps 
have something to pay if the American company maintains that 
Canada is in breach of NAFTA. We will have to pay that money and 
give something in exchange to the Americans. What will be the 
target of these concessions? Will it be like in the softwood issue? 
Will we lose as much in another area? All in all, the present 
government is not acting responsibly in pushing this bill through.
<P>
	All the arguments have been presented. They have been repeated 
in the House, and they have been made by the six provinces that 
condemn this bill. Unfortunately, there is a huge representation of 
Liberals from Ontario, who ensure that the interests of the province 
take precedence over the interests of the whole country. That also 
creates environmental concerns.
<P>
	It is important to realize that banning manganese would increase 
the emissions of nitrous oxide in the atmosphere by 5 to 20 per 
cent. This is being avoided thanks to the presence of manganese in 
MMT, but if we ban this substance, there will be a significant 
increase.
<P>
	There is something else that defies all logic; this bill will create a 
lot of problems throughout the years. The government has decided 
to go ahead with this bill even if there is no health hazard, even if it 
does not improve anti-pollution systems, even if it could cause 
trouble with the United States, even if it could cause environmental 
problems, because the Ontario Liberal majority has managed to 
impose their position on their caucus.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5430"> 5430 </A></B>
<P>
	In conclusion, we have before us a bill which, at first glance, 
did not seem to create any problems, but upon closer examination, 
we have come to realize that the Government of Canada, the 
Parliament of Canada, would, by passing this bill, make a decision 
that would undermine the Canadian economy and cost taxpayers 
a lot of money.
<P>
	The next time the people will be asked to tighten their belts for 
cuts in UI benefits, we will have yet another example of $100 
million, $150 million, $200 million, $300 million, we do not know 
how much for sure, spent on legal opinions. We have received 
opinions that clearly indicated Canada's position is not very 
tenable under NAFTA.
<P>
	For all these reasons, I will again urge the members of this 
House to vote against this bill, because it is not in the best interests 
of all Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to 
rise in debate on what I feel is a very important topic. I would like 
to add a few words of insight to this particular issue.
<P>
	This debate illustrates, among other things, what is wrong with 
this Parliament and the process. We end up with certain lobby 
groups making strong presentations to those people who are in the 
decision making loop of the government. We stand here in the 
House and debate these issues. I know that members on both sides 
have entered into the debate, but those on this side of the House 
who have tried to appeal for an independent scientific inquiry are 
really not getting anywhere. We can keep debating and putting 
words on the record, but they will not be heard because those who 
are making the decisions are not hearing the words of the debate. 
They are not paying attention and probably will not respond to the 
reasoned arguments.
<P>
	I would also like to use this opportunity to appeal once again to 
the members of the governing party, the Liberals, to simply vote 
the way they believe they ought to vote on this. Perhaps on this 
issue they should reject the party discipline to which they always 
bow down. It seems reasonable to me that what we ought to do in 
this instance is to have some truly independent scientific studies 
done and find the results of those.
<P>
	Right now, the messages we are hearing from the opposing lobby 
groups are not defensible on either side; that is, both of the sides 
are presenting data but it is very biased because it comes from 
those who have a large and vested interest in it.
<P>
	What we need is an independent study from someone who has no 
vested interest in the outcome at all to decide whether or not the use 
of MMT in fuels is dangerous to health and damaging to vehicles.
<P>
	I want to relate a story because of my own experience. I happen 
to be one who works with people all the time. In my previous life I 
was an instructor working with fellow instructors and students. My 
recreation on Saturday included putting on my work clothes and 
doing my own mechanical work. Over the years I always did my 
own vehicle servicing: oil changes, lube jobs, and some minor and 
sometimes major mechanical work. I used to love getting out my 
tools on Saturday and doing mechanical work.
<P>
	I need to tell members that two days after the vote on the 
Charlottetown accord, a day I will never forget, I was in my 
vehicle, a miniature car, and was in a bone-crunching accident. 
Fortunately all the factors came out right and I was not seriously 
injured. However, my mini vehicle was totalled. I guess I could use 
the name because I am not going to say anything bad about it. I am 
very grateful that it collapsed in the front and in the rear and 
because I was in the middle, as snug as a bug in the rug, I was 
unharmed.
<P>
	Just in case anyone thinks I am a dangerous driver, I was stopped 
at stop light in a line of vehicles and the person behind me hit my 
car at some 70 kilometres an hour and jammed my car into the 
vehicles in front of me. I was just sitting in the line and totally 
innocent of the accident. However, I was saved because of various 
factors which I will not go into.
<P>
	However, as a result of that accident I went to purchase a 
replacement vehicle. I bought a small vehicle again because of 
their economy and low fuel usage. I always argued that if I put a 
small amount of fuel into the tank because the vehicle is very fuel 
efficient, then I produce less polluting elements into the 
atmosphere and thus I am doing my part as a citizen.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	I purchased that vehicle new in the fall of 1992. I drove it for a 
long time. It was an excellent vehicle. I only changed the oil, added 
gasoline and occasionally washed it. I had 75,000 kilometres on 
that car without ever having touched the motor.
<P>
	Just as a matter of course I thought that I should change the spark 
plugs in the vehicle. I never had a vehicle that went that long 
without changing the spark plugs. I purchased a new set of spark 
plugs and on a Saturday morning I pulled out the old ones and I was 
going to replace them. After 75,000 kilometres of travel on that 
vehicle those spark plugs looked like new. I merely scraped them a 
little, regapped them and put them back into the motor and ran 
them until 100,000 kilometres at which time I did change them just 
because it was time. Even then they were not fouled.
<P>
	That is a single example, but logically speaking that example is 
sufficient. If someone makes the declaration that the presence of 
MMT fouls up spark plugs, then for spark plugs to remained 
unfouled would be an  exceptional instance. We have MMT in our 
fuel right now. In the Edmonton area we have had it for years. I 
have used that additive and this has been my experience. I know of 
no one who has complained of fouled up spark plugs. 
Consequently, I can only argue logically that if a statement is made 
it is sufficient to show but one counter example to refute the 
argument.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5431"> 5431 </A></B>
<P>
	As a result of this and because of personal experience, I have 
very serious questions about the validity of the so-called scientific 
studies which say that spark plugs will foul. I have seen the 
pictures. I have seen the same presentations where it is claimed that 
after 20,000 kilometres the plugs are so fouled up that they no long 
function. That is certainly the opposite of my experience.
<P>
	I appeal to members of the government. We are merely bowing 
to lobby and pressure groups. That is not the correct way to make 
decision. Decisions ought to be made on clearly demonstrable, 
independently provable scientific evidence. We need to get those 
with a vested interest out of it, even though they are certainly 
entitled to present their studies and conclusions. We need to make 
our decisions based on independent scientific studies. I call for 
that.
<P>
	It is most important that this bill be defeated at this time until 
there is actual reliable evidence received. At that time the decision 
can be made wisely, not just on emotional reactions based on which 
lobby group speaks the loudest. That is my submission to this 
debate. I think it is an important one. I appeal to members to hear 
what I have said and pass it along to the decision-makers who will 
soon be calling on members to stand and vote on call.
<P>
	I am speaking collectively here. Why not make our decisions 
logically instead of simply obeying, on command, what we are told 
to do.

	The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C-6, an act to 
amend the Yukon Quartz Mining Act and the Yukon Placer Mining 
Act, as reported (without amendment) from the committee.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (for the Minister of Indian Affairs and

passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to 
address Bill C-6, an act to amend the Yukon Quartz Mining Act and 
the Yukon Placer Mining Act. I am pleased to speak in support of 
this legislation.
<P>
	With this legislation we have a rare window of opportunity to 
establish environmental conditions in which mining in Yukon can 
take place. I urge hon. member to take advantage of this 
opportunity to support the bill currently before the House.
<P>
	Bill C-6 is a compromise, a made in Yukon solution to a unique 
Yukon situation. I would like to take a few minutes of the House's 
time to explain how this legislation came about and to highlight the 
extensive consultations that have resulted in a consensus to proceed 
at this time.
<P>
	I am sure hon. members of the aboriginal affairs and northern 
development standing committee would agree that consensus is the 
key word. They heard from many witnesses about the compromises 
that were reached in this bill. Witnesses included the Yukon Mining 
Advisory Committee, known as Y-MAC; the Yukon Chamber of 
Commerce; the mayor of the village of Mayo; the Yukon Placer 
Miners Association; and the Yukon Chamber of Mines.
<P>
	This bill is not being imposed on an unsuspecting public or 
industry. There is clearly a recognized need for the environmental 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5432"> 5432 </A></B>
<P>
regulation of mining in Yukon, both to ensure protection of the 
environment and to provide certainty for industry.
<P>
	Yukon is the only jurisdiction in Canada that does not currently 
have land use regulations that apply to mining claims, although the 
environmental record of the territory's mining industry is good.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	Some of the problems we have today could have been avoided 
with proper regulation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The YMAC Committee, a group created in 1990 to bring the 
stakeholders together, was asked to develop an acceptable 
environmentally friendly system. I would like to join the minister 
in congratulating the YMAC for its good work. Bill C-6 is the 
direct result of this committee's work and of the determination of 
its members to find compromises that would benefit the Yukon 
economy and environment.
<P>
	Without their dedication, we would not have reached a global 
agreement on the way to proceed. And, without such a significant 
agreement, it would have been extremely difficult if not utterly 
impossible to amend the Yukon Quartz Mining Act and the Yukon 
Placer Mining Act.
<P>
	We must also recognize the contribution of the Yukon First 
Nations to reaching a consensus. The Yukon First Nations are not 
against development; in fact, they often support it, because they 
recognize that resource development projects can benefit their 
members.
<P>
	However, the First Nations are also deeply attached to the 
environment. By taking part in the works of the YMAC, the Yukon 
First Nations Council made sure that native concerns were 
considered.
<P>
	Finally, the representatives of the federal and territorial 
governments who sat on the YMAC Committee contributed to 
ensuring a balance between the interests at stake and a land use 
system that will support mining exploration and development 
without threatening the environment.
<P>
	Bill C-6 was the result of a report prepared in April 1992 by the 
YMAC. The underlying object of this report was, and I quote, ``to 
ensure the development of a healthy, durable and competitive 
mining industry, whose operations support the fundamental social, 
economic and environmental values of the Yukon''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	When the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
received cabinet approval to draft Bill C-6, special arrangements 
were made to consult with YMAC throughout the drafting of the 
bill and the accompanying regulations. Such arrangements are 
extremely unusual, however, without them it would not have been 
possible to reach the general consensus on this legislation.
<P>
	Beginning in early 1994, YMAC initiated a series of meetings to 
discuss drafts of the proposed legislation and regulations. The 
committee met as a group more than 10 times during 1994 and 
1995 specifically to discuss this issue. Also over the past years, 
these legislative proposals have been reviewed and discussed at 
such mining industry forums as the Geoscience Forum in 
Whitehorse, the Cordilleran Roundup in Vancouver, the 
Prospectors and Developers Convention in Toronto and the Gold 
Show in Dawson.
<P>
	In July 1995 with the endorsement of this government, YMAC 
took its consultation to another level by mailing out a summary of 
the legislative proposals and regulations to more than 600 
individuals, organizations and companies. Public information 
sessions were subsequently held in four Yukon communities: 
Dawson City, Mayo, Watson Lake and Whitehorse.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Close to 150 people attended the hearings announced in the 
newspapers, on the radio and on posters in the offices of the mining 
companies and other public buildings. The committee as well as 
the federal government and the government of the Yukon also 
received a certain number of written comments on the proposed 
statute.
<P>
	We especially tried to get the First Nations to participate, at the 
grass roots level, in the consultation process.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	In addition to being represented on the YMAC, the 14 First 
Nations of the Yukon received a summary of the bill and the related 
regulations before public information meetings were held in July 
1995.
<P>
	The hon. members of the House should know that the minister 
initiated discussions on an even broader range of issues regarding 
First Nations during the consultations conducted by his department 
on the regulations on the use of mining property, which is being 
developed.
<P>
	In October 1995, two dozen First Nations groups and 
organizations received a copy of the summary of the bill and the 
proposed regulations with a request for comments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Officials of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development have contacted these groups directly to arrange 
meetings to discuss the proposals and receive feedback. At least 
one meeting has been held with representatives from each Yukon 
First Nation. The minister is very interested in hearing aboriginal 
people's views on the proposed regulations, in particular whether 
the First Nations want their own legislation or this act to apply to 
their settlement lands.
<P>
	Once the draft regulations are finalized, the government will 
follow the normal process of publishing them in the <I>Canada </I>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5433"> 5433 </A></B>
<P>
Gazette at least 60 days prior to their proclamation. This will 
provide a further opportunity for public input into the mining land 
use regime.
<P>
	Also, in close consultation with the full range of stakeholders, 
separate regulations are now being developed for hard rock 
production and mine site reclamation. These will be brought into 
effect after the land use regulations are promulgated, which is 
expected to occur at the same time or shortly after Bill C-6 is 
proclaimed.
<P>
	Based on the wide ranging and extensive consultation that has 
been undertaken, we have before us a bill which reflects a broad 
consensus of the key stakeholders connected to the Yukon mining 
industry. Although there are some issues on which YMAC could 
not reach an agreement, all stakeholders have demonstrated 
flexibility and a willingness to compromise. Hon. members should 
be aware that Bill C-6 is very much in keeping with the YMAC 
report of April 1992.
<P>
	As recommended by the committee, the government is 
proposing to establish a multi-tiered classification system for land 
use operations. The government has also accepted the committee's 
recommendation for a completely separate set of regulations from 
the territorial land use regulations so as to better reflect the unique 
operating requirements of the mining industry in Yukon.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Another characteristic of the proposed program is the short 
delays given the government to make decisions concerning mining 
activity applications. This is in accordance with a committee 
recommendation taking into account the short placer exploration 
and development season in Yukon.
<P>
	The bill also proposes a well defined responsibility and 
accountability framework. The chief of placer land use will 
administer the regulations and will make decisions concerning 
most of the projects. The only exception will be for projects 
concerning hard rock, which will require a permit issued by the 
minister. The decisions of the chief of placer land use will be 
subject to appeals to the minister.
<P>
	Inspectors will have clear, reasonable and effective powers 
allowing them to give regulatory approvals. They will have the 
power to enter any mining site or building, except dwelling places.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	They will also have the power to take samples and to examine 
books, records or documents and make copies thereof.
<P>
	The inspectors will also have the power to order the cessation or 
modification of any activity, when it results or may result in danger 
to persons or the environment. The inspectors' orders will be 
subject to an appeal to the chief of placer land use.
<P>
	Hon. members will be pleased to learn that this bill should not 
increase costs for operators using approved mining practices that 
are safe and respectful of the environment. In fact, the additional 
administrative costs that could result from the regime will be only 
minimal.
<P>
	Bill C-6 also provides for mechanisms to ensure maximum 
harmonization and co-ordination with other statutes, such as the 
Yukon Waters Act and the Territorial Lands Act. Hon. members are 
aware that the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act contains 
provisions for co-ordinating the efforts of all federal bodies taking 
part in an environmental screening and assessment. This would 
have the effect of further reducing duplication and overlap in the 
administration of the regime.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The mining industry has a long and proud history in Yukon, a 
history of contributing to economic development, income 
generation and job creation. By putting in place environmental 
regulations that have already been accepted in the rest of Canada, 
this legislation will ensure that the industry can continue to make 
these vital contributions for many years to come.
<P>
	Bill C-6 is the latest in a series of initiatives undertaken by this 
government to ensure the viability of the mining industry and 
economic growth and security in Yukon. In February 1995 the 
Yukon First Nations Land Claims Settlement Act, the Yukon First 
Nations Self-Government Act and the Yukon Surface Rights Board 
Act were proclaimed.
<P>
	These acts were required to implement the Council for Yukon 
Indians umbrella final agreement and the four Yukon First Nations 
final agreements that have been negotiated to date. These acts 
establish certainty of land ownership and rights so the resource 
development can go forward. Decades of uncertainty concerning 
land title and rights will continue to disappear as each one of the 
outstanding claims is resolved.
<P>
	Bill C-6 will add to the legal certainty that has been put in place 
through the land claims settlement process. These amendments are 
consistent with the umbrella final agreement and will compel 
decision makers to ensure that projects are properly reviewed and 
assessed and that mitigative measures are in place.
<P>
	The development assessment process, DAP, legislation which 
we intend to introduce to the House in 1997 is now being developed 
in consultation with Yukon First Nations. Bill C-6 which fills a gap 
in the regulatory system will facilitate the objectives of the 
development assessment process.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Already, we are seeing the positive results of the land claims 
settlement process. The signing of definitive agreements has raised 
new interest in the Yukon's mineral resources. Some 13,000 mining 
claims were staked in 1995, raising the number of duly registered 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5434"> 5434 </A></B>
<P>
claims in the area to over 55,000. The amount spent on exploration 
should exceed $40 million this year, and spending on development 
could exceed $60 million, a high for the decade.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	At least five companies have expressed their firm intention to 
open, re-open or expand mining sites in the Yukon in the next two 
years. Several others have indicated that they would be interested 
in operations if they would come up with the necessary capital and 
if feasibility studies are favourable.
<P>
	The introduction of the amendments in Bill-C-6 will allow us, 
where necessary, to put these proposals for mining sites through a 
complete environmental screening, and to ensure that these sites 
are operated using safe environmental practices, in accordance 
with the regulations for the sound and effective use of mineral 
lands. In the long term, this should be in the best interests of the 
industry, of all Yukoners and of all Canadians.
<P>
	Given the opposing points of view on mining and the 
environment, it is quite remarkable that we have achieved such a 
degree of consensus and reached such a compromise, as evidenced 
by Bill C-6. We must not miss this opportunity to regulate the 
development of mineral lands in the Yukon and I urge hon. 
members in this House to vote in favour of this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to begin by mentioning the extraordinary 
participation by a variety of organizations during the hearings of 
the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs on the Act to amend 
the Yukon Quartz Mining Act and the Yukon Placer Mining Act.
<P>
	Through their testimony and their involvement in the 
consultation process, they defended their interests against the 
government and thus the merits of this legislation.
<P>
	I am referring to the Sierra Legal Defence Fund, the Council of 
Yukon First Nations, the Government of the Yukon, the Klondike 
Placer Miners, the North Slope Wildlife Management Advisory 
Council, the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, the village of 
Mayo, Wesmin Resources Limited, the Yukon Chamber of Mines, 
the Yukon Conservation Society, the Yukon Fish and Wildlife 
Management Board, the Yukon Mining Advisory Committee, the 
Yukon Prospectors Association, the Yukon Chamber of Commerce, 
the Yukon Outfitters Association, and finally the Teelit Gwich'in 
Council.
<P>
	That made a rather long list, but I needed to demonstrate that Bill 
C-6 is a general reflection of the concerns expressed in committee. 
Of course, some wanted more, some, less. The bill we have before 
us now in third reading is characterized by a series of technical  
details on the environment and natural resources. It brings mining 
operations in line with today's concerns.
<P>
	What is more, it confers upon the Yukon territorial government 
and the First Nations the responsibility for proper resource 
management, and for implementing standards in keeping with their 
lifestyle and with respect the environment.
<P>
	As you are aware, this is not a bill that dropped out of the blue, or 
just appeared overnight. We took the trouble to find out what type 
of consultations had gone before. In 1990, an advisory committee 
on the Yukon mining industry was set up, and we in the standing 
committee recently heard comments from people in the north, as 
well as from some fifteen different organizations.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	No one in this House will be able to accuse us of saying: ``This is 
the way it is going to be''. Not only does this bill amend legislation, 
which dates back to 1906, in the case of placer mining, and to 1924, 
in the case of quartz mining, but it also provides the Yukon 
Territory with new regulatory powers.
<P>
	Perhaps we should know more about this territory, which seems 
so far away.
<P>
	The name Yukon was used for the first time in 1846 by a 
Hudson's Bay Company trader, John Bell, from the Indian word 
<I>Yuchoo</I> which means ``the biggest river''. The Yukon river is the 
fifth longest river in North America.
<P>
	The first European visitors in modern times were Russian 
explorers, who sailed up and down the coast in the 18th century and 
traded with the Indians. The Hudson's Bay Company penetrated 
into the interior in the 1840s. With the discovery of gold near 
Dawson City in 1896, the Klondike became one of the most 
populated regions in the Canadian Northwest. The sudden 
population explosion during the gold rush led the federal 
government to give the Yukon more political power. In 1898, the 
Yukon was officially constituted to ensure Canadian jurisdiction. 
The Yukon Act provided for the appointment of a commissioner 
and the creation of an elected legislative assembly.
<P>
	As a territory, Yukon does not have provincial status, although it 
did acquire a similar form of government in 1979. This means the 
Canadian government maintains its authority over bodies of water, 
land, forests and non-renewable resources.
<P>
	How could someone be against a bill which reduces the 
paternalistic authority of the federal government and provides for a 
partial decentralisation and environmental standards which, by the 
way, were almost or totally non existent before.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5435"> 5435 </A></B>
<P>
	How could we disagree, knowing that the Act to amend the 
Yukon Quartz Mining Act and the Yukon Placer Mining Act is 
the result of a long negotiation and consultation process?
<P>
	Our only comment is that this act will have to be reviewed in a 
few years from now in order to adjust its environmental standards 
to those of other provinces, such as Quebec and Ontario. However, 
we are fully confident that the Government of the Yukon and the 
native communities are capable of establishing their own standards 
according to their needs.
<P>
	The present population of the Yukon is close to 28,000, of which 
23 per cent are natives and 60 per cent live in Whitehorse.
<P>
	Mining, which accounts for 30 per cent of the Yukon's economic 
activity, is by far its main industry. Tourism, which offers an 
opportunity to live in a wild area with a unique and relatively intact 
environment, is an equally important source of jobs and services. 
Fur trade is practised by about 3 per cent of the population, mainly 
native people. Dawson City also has a small fishing industry, 
exporting salmon and selling other species of fish to local 
consumers.
<P>
	In short, the consensus, or should I rather say the compromise, 
proposed by the Act to Amend the Yukon Quarts Mining Act and 
the Yukon Placer Mining Act will allow the territory greater 
autonomy in the management of its resources.
<P>
	The Bill under consideration is rather like a collective 
agreement, in the sense that if a new amendment or a new change to 
this bill was to be approved, another group would ask for more or 
would totally disagree with it.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	This is why we support the implementation of this bill in its form 
at second reading. I have been talking to you all this time about Bill 
C-6 without having explained what it is about. I am sure a brief 
summary of the different parts of this bill will benefit the 
honourable Mps here in this House and the audience.
<P>
	The Act to amend the Yukon Quartz Mining Act and the Yukon 
Placer Mining Act, Bill C-6, is the result of representations made 
by the Government of the Yukon in order to find a solution to the 
environmental problems generated by mining activities.
<P>
	The Yukon government wanted this solution to be developed and 
implemented by the Yukon community. This new bill now provides 
for environmental protection since, in addition to the requirements 
applicable to licenses and to levels of activity, it will also be 
subject to the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act.
<P>
	By the way, it should be understood that, in the past, 
environmental concerns came far behind economic concerns. At 
the time, gold mining was almost a cottage industry. People would 
enter the streams, shake their sieves, collect a nugget and throw the 
gravel over their shoulders.
<P>
	The countryside there is extraordinary. As you know, it is the 
land of the midnight sun. However, when you look down you also 
see a lunar landscape around the Midnight Dome. It was caused by 
reckless development. Piles of earth were left there and completely 
spoil the scenery. It is easy to see that, at the time, the environment 
was not at all a concern, unlike today.
<P>
	The bill before us seeks to promote a behaviour that is more 
respectful of nature than in those days. At the time, people were 
just not concerned about the environment. They were concerned 
about finding gold. The land was so vast and so sparsely populated 
that people did not care. Today, we have to care. But we would 
certainly say that on the whole, this piece of legislation is a 
worthwhile effort. There is a system to approve various classes.
<P>
	I mentioned that there was no environmental protection, but 
there are indeed now various classes which will require some 
approval and help discipline the operation as such for a better 
protection of the environment.
<P>
	Thus, class I activities require no preliminary approval but must 
comply with existing regulation. So the principle is the following: 
when you go from class I to class II, the regulations get a little 
stricter. Also, class II activities require prior notification being 
given to a federal authority.
<P>
	As for class III activities, they require the advance submission 
and approval of an operating plan. So, as you can see, the bigger the 
operations are, the stricter the regulations become.
<P>
	Class IV is certainly the more stringent because not only is an 
operating plan required to be presented and approved, but it must 
be subjected to public consultations. For those who are less 
environment-orientated and more economy-orientated, this has 
become something of a pain, because it only takes a couple of 
people opposed to the project to jeopardize it.
<P>
	In class IV, we will certainly be dealing with large scale projects 
requiring public consultations, therefore a lot more preparation on 
the part of those who want to develop the resources, to provide 
environmental data to the groups and individuals who will 
scrutinize class IV projects.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	According to the minister, the regulations under the proposed 
legislation define various levels of activity. The result of 
compromises in committee, and the subject of many observations, 
these levels relate to the size of mining exploration projects, in 
terms of how many people will be in a camp, how many square 
meters of  trenches will be dug, how many square meters of top soil 
will be removed, how many kilometres of road will be built, how 
heavy 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5436"> 5436 </A></B>
<P>
vehicles will be and how many kilometres will they cover, how 
many litres of fuel will be stockpiled, etc.
<P>
	For example, a camp for five individuals for 150 person-days 
could be in class I and one for the same number of people but for 
more than 150 person-days could fall into class II, III or IV. The 
digging or the ditches could not exceed 400 cubic metres per claim 
per year in class I, whereas the number of cubic metres could reach 
1,000 in class II, 5,000 in class III and more than 5,000 in class IV. 
All terrain vehicles would be allowed depending on the period of 
the year, the weight of the vehicle and the distance to be covered. 
During summertime, only low ground pressure vehicles would be 
in class I, a 30-tonne vehicle covering a maximum distance of 15 
kilometres could be in class II and if the distances were to exceed 
15 or 40 kilometres, the project would then fall into classes III or 
IV respectively. No road construction would be allowed in class I 
and the class would depend on the number of kilometres of road or 
trail built.
<P>
	If all activities in a project qualify for class I except one, for 
example a fuel stockpile of 30,000 litres, then the project will be 
put in class II.
<P>
	The proposed legislation will require all applicants to supply a 
security that could equal the approximate cost of redressing all 
adverse environmental effects. It also provides for the modification 
and transfer of operating plans and licenses.
<P>
	It establishes an application and inspection system for the 
provisions of the legislation itself and of the related regulations, 
and it defines offences and penalties.
<P>
	Naturally, the legislation grants powers to make regulations for 
its enforcement. The regulations on the utilisation of mineral lands 
for quartz mining and placer mining will take effect whenever the 
proposed legislation is passed or shortly thereafter. Regulations on 
the reclamation of quartz mine sites that are already in operation 
under the Quartz Mining Act will be made at a later date. 
Regulations development is in consultation with interested parties.
<P>
	In a different connection, officials did everything in their power 
to reassure us by saying: ``Indeed, what we are looking at in terms 
of the environment, categories and operations, is not in 
contradiction with what has already been granted to Yukon's first 
nations in connection with self-government or land claims''.
<P>
	So, we must say this act is the result of a great compromise 
among highly varied groups, from environmentalists to mine 
operators. Furthermore, we can also say we did our utmost in the 
consultation process so that native bands had their say.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development set up teleconferences in Whitehorse, Ottawa and so 
on.
<P>
	Speaking of consultation, I would like to define for the 
government what consultation really is, something it often 
confuses with what may be called the ``lobby power''.
<P>
	Indeed, consultation is really effective when, first of all, the 
people affected by this bill also have equal opportunity to express 
their opinions and defend their rights.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	Second, when the government does not put the people before a 
<I>fait accompli</I> and tell them at the last minute: ``You can always 
talk, but it will not change much''. Lastly, when the government 
clearly indicates what it intends to do as a legislator and provides 
all the appropriate information to the public so that the people can 
make up their own minds about the bill.
<P>
	Before supporting this bill, we checked if every individual and 
every organization who wanted to give evidence had the 
opportunity to do so. In fact, I gave you the list earlier on. Also, we 
support Bill C-6 because the situation in the Yukon is quite urgent. 
Estimates for 1995 show that mineral production in the Yukon 
generated $185 million, an increase of around 115 per cent over 
1994. Production from more than 200 placer deposits increased in 
value by 38.2 per cent to reach some $78 million.
<P>
	According to the Yukon Chamber of Mines, exploration 
expenses in the Yukon came to a little under $40 million in 1995, 
almost double the $21 million reported in 1994. Expenses for 
development purposes rose from $11 million in 1994 to $57 
million in 1995, reflecting the development of new gold mines in 
Brewery Creek and Nansen Mount. For a fourth consecutive year, 
exploration and development expenses have gone up in the Yukon.
<P>
	Six other mining projects are currently the subject of 
environmental impact studies. If the results are positive, 
development on these projects should start in 1996 or 1997.
<P>
	Upset because the Yukon Mining Advisory Committee was 
taking too long to make environmental changes to the Yukon 
Quartz Mining Act and the Yukon Placer Mining Act, the 
environmental community challenged the Department of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development's environmental assessment 
and licensing process. In December, the courts ruled in favour of 
the department.
<P>
	This is a matter of urgency for the environment. Area wildlife, 
which is important not only to the aboriginal people but also to 
hunters, tourists and the population at large, includes moose, 
caribou, mountain goats, bighorns,  bears and other furbearers. The 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5437"> 5437 </A></B>
<P>
passing of Bill C-6 is essential to the conservation of these 
resources.
<P>
	Finally, I wish to reiterate my support and the support of the Bloc 
Quebecois for Bill C-6, an act to amend the Yukon Quartz Mining 
Act and the Yukon Placer Mining Act, which, I remind the House, 
reflects a broad consensus among the various stakeholders. This is 
why I propose that this bill be adopted as is by the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I note the hon. member for 
Okanagan-Shuswap is seeking the floor. I will make a suggestion 
to the member and to the House. Almost every time, members are 
reluctant to speak when there are only a few minutes left in the 
debate. I will leave it to the member if he wishes to speak for the 
remainder of the five minutes before we go to private members' 
hour or, if he wishes, I can ask the House if there is unanimous 
consent to see the clock as 1.30 p.m. and to go to private members' 
hour.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SENIORS'BILLOFRIGHTS">SENIORS' BILL OF RIGHTS</A></H3>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.)</B> 
moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That in the opinion of this House, seniors play a vital role in our country, and 
therefore the government should direct that the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Legal Affairs proceed with the drafting of a Seniors' Bill of Rights, aimed at 
acknowledging the rights of seniors to live full and protected lives in Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased and proud to speak to my 
Motion No. 265 which calls on the standing committee on justice to 
draft a seniors' bill of rights.
<P>
	While I am disappointed that this is not a votable motion, I 
remain optimistic that this effort will raise awareness of seniors 
issues in Guelph-Wellington all across Canada.
<P>
	In a recent Ottawa <I>Sun</I> article, reporter Jacki Leroux posed as a 
senior. She offered this observation about the experience: ``Perhaps 
most annoying were the assumptions that were made about my 
mind. Whether it was buying something in a store, giving 
directions to a cab driver, ordering lunch or using a bank machine, 
the message from most people was clear. All people with grey hair 
must have Alzheimers''. Those comments are frightening.
<P>
	I hope the discussion that begins today with this motion helps to 
eliminate those assumptions and reminds each and every Canadian 
that seniors play an active role in our society and deserve our 
support and our appreciation.
<P>
	We are all aware that our population is aging. In Ontario, for 
example, it is expected that there will be a 55 per cent increase in 
the senior population in the next 15 years. That includes a 132 per 
cent increase in the 85 and up age group. An obvious question 
comes to mind. Are we prepared for an aging population? 
However, I think there is something even more profound. How we 
treat our seniors today will be the road map for how they are treated 
tomorrow. Ignoring issues that are important to our seniors will not 
make them go away. Instead, as our population ages those issues 
will become more intense.
<P>
	In preparation for this debate I asked my constituents and other 
Canadians to provide their suggestions, their insights and concerns 
regarding seniors' issues to me. Not surprisingly, personal finance 
and health were the two biggest concerns. This corresponds with a 
survey published in <I>Today's Seniors</I> in June of this year. Cuts to 
health care, the future of the Canada pension plan, concerns 
regarding increased costs of prescription drugs and the future of 
public pensions were discussed most often.
<P>
	But many seniors face concerns that go beyond discussions of 
public policy. They face problems every day. Rita Lovelock wrote 
to me a few weeks ago: ``I live in a house and think about everyday 
bills, hydro, gas, cable, telephone, the daily newspaper. My 
husband worked long hours for low wages. We never received any 
government handouts. We raised our six children to be upright 
citizens. Why make things so tough for the people who helped 
build this country?'' That is the question that needs our response.
<P>
	Guelph-Wellington is fortunate to have many volunteers and 
agencies which help make it the best community in Canada. From 
individuals like David Ing who manages Norfolk Manor, to John 
O'Connor, president of Senior Peer Advisory Group, to Carrie 
Fisk, editor of the newsletter published by the Evergreen Seniors 
Centre, we are truly fortunate for the many people dedicated to 
making the lives of our seniors richer and more fulfilled.
<P>
	They are joined by St. Joseph's Hospital, Eden House facility, 
the Guelph-Wellington Seniors Association and many others who 
assist seniors in living in today's society. All of these organizations 
and the countless volunteers cannot do it alone. We must work to 
improve attitudes and stereotypes and protect those most in need.
<P>
	I am grateful to a number of national and provincial 
organizations which have offered their support for this initiative. 
The Canadian Association of Retired Persons has offered these 
suggestions for a seniors' bill of rights. A general statement 
guaranteeing the rights of liberties of seniors against 
discrimination based on their age. A guarantee to the right of a safe 
and secure old age. A guarantee of public pensions for seniors. A 
guarantee of equal access to health care and social services 
regardless of income or geographical residency. Freedom from 
elder  abuse in all of its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5438"> 5438 </A></B>
<P>
forms including physical, financial, economic, psychological, 
emotional and social, including neglect. CARP has called this a 
starting point and I am grateful for their suggestions.
<P>
	I want to share with this House the suggestions offered by the 
Prince Edward Island Seniors Federation: The right to be treated as 
important human beings with unique feelings, ideas and desires. 
The right to a sense of security and belonging derived from a loving 
safe environment. The right to a continuing relationship with their 
children, grandchildren and other family members. The right to 
live and be content in an atmosphere free of abuse, neglect and 
exploitation. The right to have a relaxed secure relationship with all 
family members and to not be placed in a manipulative 
atmosphere. The right to participate in their own destiny. The right 
to good and appropriate health care. The right to comfortable, 
affordable and secure housing. The right to clean air and a clean 
environment. The right to dignity in life and in death. The right to 
religious freedom. The right to freedom from violence.
<P>
	Finally, there are the observations from Seniors Power in 
Regina, Saskatchewan: The right to be heard on all matters of 
general public interest. The right to have freedom from want in old 
age, to live independently as one chooses. The right to a fair share 
of the community's recreational, educational and medical 
resources. The right to obtain decent housing suited to the needs of 
later years. The right to live and to die with dignity. The right to be 
able to access all knowledge available on how to improve the later 
years of life.
<P>
	Some have argued that a seniors bill of rights is not necessary. 
Some people believe that seniors enjoy all the rights guaranteed to 
all Canadians. Ray Snowdon of Guelph wrote to me: ``I doubt 
whether there are many seniors who want special interest. We are 
being systematically robbed of the benefits we worked, paid and 
fought for, and only ask for what was promised''.
<P>
	I cannot argue with Mr. Snowdon and others who have told me 
that seniors enjoy the rights and privileges of all Canadians. 
However, I must ask these fundamental questions: What good are 
rights if they are ignored by others around you? If Jacki Leroux is 
right about the observations she experienced while posing as a 
senior, what good are privileges when they are forgotten by 
members of society because a person is judged by their age and not 
their ability?
<P>
	Jo Zettle, a constituent, wrote to me and reminded me that 
seniors should not be treated as second class citizens because of 
their age. She said: ``Many seniors love to talk about the past but 
they are also very now people''.
<P>
	It is true that there are a good number of seniors that have 
worked hard to enjoy their retirement. They have the ability to 
travel and while they are concerned about provincial cutbacks to 
the number of days that they can remain abroad, they are free from 
many of the concerns facing other seniors. They are concerned 
about property taxes, increases in the cost of living and crime.
<P>
	There are also many seniors living in difficult and sometimes in 
dangerous situations. Many of these seniors worked hard also but 
could not enjoy company pension plans or worked with little 
income or benefits. Many come from families where the woman 
stayed home to care for the children and therefore benefited from 
only one income.
<P>
	From Guelph, Cal Christie wrote: ``Older people have a feeling 
of vulnerability. Since most senior people are no longer able to earn 
their income through work, they need protection against wild 
swings in factors that have an effect on their income, such things as 
low interest rates on investment certificates, sharp rises in property 
tax on their dwelling places, legislation that claws back their 
pension and or removes health care benefits''.
<P>
	This sense of vulnerability was echoed by Mrs. Jean Marshall 
also from Guelph who wrote: ``When people are old and ill and less 
able to deal with illness, it is sad that it is more difficult to get the 
care needed''. She also wrote: ``There is a growing fear among 
older people regarding safety''.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	Many people who wrote to me or spoke with me on this idea also 
suggested the idea of a list of responsibilities and obligations that 
should be included along with a bill of rights. These 
responsibilities include: preparation for retirement; reporting of 
any abuse; and maintaining relationships with family and with 
friends. Those who suggested these are concerned that with rights 
also come obligations. This is an interesting argument, and one that 
deserves our attention as well.
<P>
	As elected representatives, we are responsible to the people of 
our community. Most important, we have an obligation to those 
who need our help the most.
<P>
	Governments across Canada are currently debating the division 
of powers, levels of responsibility, savings in administration and 
cuts to programs and services. There is probably no group more 
supportive of deficit reduction efforts than seniors. However, in 
discussing the future of public policy, we must always remember 
that the decisions we make here and those made in provincial 
legislatures and in town and city councils affect first and foremost, 
people. Often it is those most in need, those less able to speak for 
themselves who are affected the most and are hurt the greatest.
<P>
	We must remember that seniors remain a group which is often 
affected by changes in social policies. We must always keep in 
mind those who need us the most. As A.A. McIntosh of Guelph 
wrote: ``We do not want any elaborate window dressing, just the 
basics''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5439"> 5439 </A></B>
<P>
	I often talk here in the House and elsewhere about how all of 
us in this great country are connected. Lower interest rates are 
welcomed by the young couple buying their first house. They are 
good news for the car dealer in Guelph-Wellington. They help 
our economy. But for those seniors who live on investment 
income, lower interest rates mean doing less with less. That does 
not mean we should raise interest rates, but it is a reminder that 
what benefits some of us hurts others.
<P>
	Cuts to health care may make the system more efficient. They 
may end duplication and waste, but this probably means longer 
waits for seniors who because of their age require more medical 
attention than they did when they were younger.
<P>
	We need to remember that all of our decisions as public policy 
leaders have implications. We cannot forget that our seniors are 
often most affected by even the smallest change. We owe it to them 
to be ever watchful, that not even one segment of society is 
forgotten while we do what we are here to do: balance the budget 
while never forgetting the human element.
<P>
	As I said earlier, I am grateful to the hundreds of constituents 
and other Canadians who have offered advice and suggestions. Not 
all comments were supportive of this initiative. However all 
brought home the need to encourage, respect and protect Canada's 
seniors.
<P>
	There were many heart warming comments. Elma Loeb from 
Bradford, Ontario shared with me this comment she read from a 
70-year old Canadian woman in 1980: ``Being old means shopping 
at the discount table for the mouldy fruits and vegetables wrapped 
in cellophane''. Mrs. Ivan Morphy from Pembroke, Ontario stated: 
``Any Canadian citizen has earned the right in their senior years to 
live in peace and safety and be protected from violence''. Her 
husband added: ``The cost of living is the cost of keeping you from 
dying''.
<P>
	The main themes that have arisen from this consultation are 
fairness, understanding and dignity. We know the Prime Minister 
often referred to the dignity of work during the last campaign. We 
know when an individual earns a salary and provides for his or 
herself and their family, there is a satisfaction which is difficult to 
describe.
<P>
	So too when a person reaches their senior years, these should be 
enjoyed because they have been earned. The very least that society 
can provide is respect, freedom from abuse and concern. The very 
most we can do is to ensure that the senior years are spent with the 
dignity that is deserved for the individuals who have contributed to 
help make this the very best country in the world. Many seniors just 
want the basics. Vic Galliford of Guelph offered the simple 
comment of ``the right to food, health, housing and dignity''.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	The reason for this bill of rights is not complicated. Many 
seniors face poverty, violence, fear and lack of financial resources. 
I hope this discussion raises awareness to these concerns. Most 
important, I hope we can also raise sensitivities. Many Canadians 
lack concern because they do not understand the issues which face 
many of our seniors. Government cannot and should not do it 
alone.
<P>
	In this House on October 25, 1951, almost 45 years ago, the Hon. 
Paul Martin Senior spoke these words which I hope summarize 
what we are attempting to do with this bill of rights: ``This measure 
marks our resolute determination to give new meaning and value to 
cherished concepts and to press forward toward our ideals of social 
betterment''. He went on to say: ``Our objective is to build for our 
people a secure and free way of life, which will enable them to live 
with their neighbours in peace and enjoy the fruits of their own 
industry''. Mr. Martin was speaking to a motion which would give 
Canadians reaching age 70 a pension of $40 a month.
<P>
	Since those words were spoken, we have faced the challenge of 
debt and deficit reduction. This has caused us to also challenge 
some of the principles of universality but not of protection. 
However, I am proud that our new seniors benefit provides support 
and protection for those most in need. As Mr. Martin said about the 
old age security in 1951, I believe that our seniors benefit is 
``manifested in the formulation of legislation responsibly 
conceived and designed to meet the social needs of the times in 
which we live''.
<P>
	John O'Connor of the Senior Peer Advisory Service in Guelph is 
quoted in the Guelph <I>Mercury</I> as saying about this initiative: ``We 
would like to be recognized as vital human beings at an age when 
we can give back to society the things society has given to us''. 
And at the very least, he says that the opportunity to talk about 
seniors is good.
<P>
	I believe that a seniors bill of rights should be enacted by 
Parliament if only to remind us that seniors have rights and 
obligations. I cared for my parents as they grew older and I now 
understand how much life changes for people who can no longer 
look after themselves. It is our obligation as leaders in Canada to 
look after those who need our help. Seniors need our care and 
protection. They need our help to live their lives with dignity, 
respect and peace.
<P>
	Some day we will look back to see what we could have done to 
make our situations better. It has been said that a society is judged 
by the way it treats the most vulnerable of its citizens. It is what the 
Liberal Party stands for. Let us work together for those who need 
our help now, and for us, and for our children who will need our 
help in the future. For some day we will be them.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to support Motion M-265 standing in 
the name of my colleague for Guelph-Wellington, which reads as 
follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That in the opinion of this House, seniors play a vital role in our country, and 
therefore the government should direct that the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Legal Affairs proceed with the drafting of a Seniors' Bill of Rights, aimed at 
acknowledging the rights of seniors to live full and protected lives in Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Our society's dominant values focus primarily on productivity 
and the importance of youth. Older people are, unfortunately, often 
vulnerable. Solitude, isolation, financial insecurity, and various 
types of dependency make them so. They are most certainly 
entitled to lead full and protected lives. It is absolutely vital to do 
away with prejudices about seniors.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	Although there is a broad range of programs and benefits for 
seniors, there are many challenges which need to be overcome if 
they are to enjoy those full lives.
<P>
	Being a retired teacher myself, I have represented seniors' 
organizations on a number of occasions, defending seniors and 
protecting their rights. I have been particularly involved in working 
to gain recognition for Grandparents Day.
<P>
	Recently, I brought to the attention of this House that the United 
Nations had designated October 1 as international senior citizens 
day. In fact, the UN General Assembly has already drafted 
principles specifically designed to help senior citizens live better 
during the years they have gained.
<P>
	These principles are as follows: independence, participation, 
care, personal development and dignity. The United Nations 
believes, for instance, that senior citizens should be able to live in a 
secure environment which can be adapted to their personal 
preference and their changing capabilities.
<P>
	Furthermore, there is general agreement that senior citizens 
should be able to live in their own homes as long as possible. As for 
participation, it is desirable that senior citizens be able to join 
movements or associations for senior citizens.
<P>
	In Canada, there are many senior citizens associations, and their 
opinions are important. They have at times influenced, and often 
have the power to influence, controversial political decisions.
<P>
	There are several associations for senior citizens in Quebec, and 
I will name a few: l'Association québécoise de défense des droits 
des retraités (AQDR), le Regroupement des personnes à la retraite 
(CTM-FTQ), la Coalition des aînés du Québec, la Fédération de 
l'Âge d'or du Québec (FADOQ), l'Association des retraités en  
enseignement du Québec (AREQ), of which I am also a member.
<P>
	These associations represent a host of senior citizens who stand 
up for their rights while finding ways to improve their quality of 
life.
<P>
	I am always delighted to be a guest speaker at meetings of these 
associations, because I support their desire for and their interest in 
having an active and rewarding life.
<P>
	Recently, at the beginning of September, I was invited to be the 
guest speaker by a senior citizens group in the riding of Bourassa in 
Montreal North. At this meeting, I quoted some excerpts from the 
Pelletier report, <I>Vers un nouvel équilibre des âges: Rapport du 
groupe d'experts sur les personnes âgées</I>, tabled at the end of 1991. 
Here is excerpt: ``The most important part of any strategy and 
action aimed at improving the well-being of senior citizens is that 
they should have a chance to go on living in the manner to which 
they have become accustomed during most of their lives, if that is 
what they prefer''.
<P>
	Obviously, making constant cuts in the social programs that 
protect the most vulnerable, including senior citizens, is not the 
way to achieve the objective of a full and rewarding life.
<P>
	A seniors' bill of rights is valid as such, but it is not the only way 
to improve their quality of life. All the criteria established by the 
United Nations should be applied. These criteria will be discussed 
later on.
<P>
	Recently, the third international seminar of the Petits frères des 
pauvres was held, organized jointly with the centre Berthiaume-Du 
Tremblay and l'Association québécoise de gérontologie in 
Montreal, under the theme: The courage to age.
<P>
	Seniors found original ways of expressing themselves, using 
short plays for inter-active theatre, workshops, discussion groups 
and intervention groups. In this way they expressed their views on 
aging and tried to find new ways of coping with old age.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	Another example shows how important it is to form associations 
or committees. In Montreal, mayor Pierre Bourque used the 
occasion of international seniors day to announce the setting up of 
a seniors committee which will make sure that seniors are listened 
to and respected and that they have a say in the way the affairs of 
the city are managed.
<P>
	He mentioned that Montreal has the highest percentage of 
seniors in all of Quebec, and that the worst is yet to come, since the 
average age in Quebec, which was 29 in 1981, is now 35.
<P>
	Another criterion mentioned by the United Nations involves 
health care. Seniors should have access to the kind of health care 
which will help them maintain or recover optimum physical mental 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5441"> 5441 </A></B>
<P>
and emotional well-being, which in turn will prevent or delay the 
onset of disease.
<P>
	The other criterion mentioned by the United Nations deals with 
personal growth. Seniors should be able to fully develop their 
potential, and have access to the educational, cultural, spiritual, 
and leisure resources society has to offer.
<P>
	The last criterion is also very important. Seniors should be able 
to live with dignity and be safe from exploitation, as well as 
physical or psychological abuse. They should be treated fairly, 
regardless of their age, sex, race, religion, ethnic origin, handicap 
or other characteristics, and be appreciated regardless of their 
contribution to the economy.
<P>
	Through these criteria, we realize seniors have their place in the 
world. However, for them to live full and protected lives, we must 
change attitudes by not considering them as a burden anymore.
<P>
	Canada also took a stand to protect them. For instance, in section 
15, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms forbids 
discrimination based on age. Thus, the Supreme Court has already 
indicated that some forms of discrimination may be justified by 
higher considerations. The government also abolished mandatory 
retirement more than ten years ago.
<P>
	However, the government seems to be casting some doubt on 
this by imitating the American policy, whereby, for purposes of 
security benefits, the age of retirement will go from 65 to 67 years 
in 2024.
<P>
	We must first eliminate prejudice against seniors by educating 
the public in order to change negative attitudes on aging. Seniors 
are not a burden on society but a great wealth. I have indicated the 
main criteria underlying approaches taken by the United Nations 
because seniors make a substantial contribution on a global scale.
<P>
	I will continue to defend seniors' interests and endeavour to 
always intervene so they can live full and safe lives throughout 
Canada and in Quebec, as Motion M-265 provides.
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to congratulate all seniors on their 
contribution to our society.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the member for Guelph-Wellington is very sincere in 
putting forward this private member's bill. I know she has senior's 
issues at heart and she wishes nothing but the best for them.
<P>
	In recognizing me, Mr. Speaker, I would like to let you and 
members know that I have been speaking on senior's issues since I 
came to this House. In fact, I have spent the last three years talking 
to more seniors probably than anyone else in the House. My time 
has been mainly spent working for their rights.
<P>
	As many members here know, I took up the cause of access of 
grandparents, our seniors, to their grandchildren shortly after I was 
sworn in as an MP. The issue had been the subject of private 
members' bills in previous Parliaments. In fact, the member for 
Nepean had a bill which basically made similar changes to the 
Divorce Act as the one I proposed.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	My bill, having been chosen as votable, gave me the opportunity 
to meet and talk with many of Canada's senior citizens from all 
parts of Canada. I have often marvelled at the tenacity of this 
group, our seniors, and their ability to organize in support of issues 
of which they approve.
<P>
	I have enjoyed every minute of my contacts with grandparents' 
associations across the country. I have had many conversations 
with them about seniors' issues and how they should be 
approached. This is a segment of our society which is very 
vulnerable: vulnerable to abuse, vulnerable to poverty and 
vulnerable to poor health. These are the issues we should be 
addressing. This vulnerability will be neither addressed nor 
resolved by a bill of rights. The seniors of our country need to have 
these issues addressed in a positive fashion by the government. 
They need legislation and they need laws.
<P>
	Quite frankly, after the way the members of the government 
voted against a private member's bill which would put in place a 
mechanism to allow easier access for grandparents to their 
grandchildren, I have no faith in the government to address seniors' 
issues. Liberal members opposite had the chance in the justice 
committee just a few weeks ago to support the seniors of Canada by 
voting in favour of a grandparents right of access to their 
grandchildren. It was a special bill. They voted against each and 
every clause and then they voted not to return it to the House of 
Commons for third reading.
<P>
	The member for Guelph-Wellington spoke of the right to food, 
health, housing and dignity. A very major part of the equation is 
missing: the right of access to one's family. I have visited a number 
of care homes and hospitals. Each Christmas I go to the hospitals, 
unannounced, no press or anything, and I visit the terminally ill. 
What I notice most is the absence of family members.
<P>
	If we in the House of Commons really care about our seniors and 
if we really want to address their rights, a bill of rights is not the 
way to do it. Make people more aware of how important it is for 
seniors to have family members visit them when they are sick and 
dying. Let members of the House realize and support how 
important it is that they see their grandchildren before they die.
<P>
	The government had a chance to help seniors and its members 
took the opportunity to heap more abuse on our seniors, on our 
grandparents, by defeating that bill. All the bill asked for was the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5442"> 5442 </A></B>
<P>
right to go to the courts to ask to see their grandchildren. What a 
terrible thing to have to ask for.
<P>
	How dare members of the government propose a seniors' bill of 
rights when in the committee rooms of this place they voted against 
the legitimate aspirations of our seniors, of our grandparents.
<P>
	What else have government members done for seniors? Have 
they resolved the CPP problem so those collecting it now can look 
forward to collecting it in the future? The answer is, of course, no. 
Have they looked seriously at the problems of old age security 
payments and the income supplement? The answer again is no. 
There was a promise in the last budget that these issues would be 
addressed, but only after the next election. What has been done 
with health care for seniors? Again, the answer is nothing.
<P>
	If the seniors of Canada needed a bill of rights it would only be 
to protect them from the arrogance and the inaction of this Liberal 
government.
<P>
	What do our seniors need? What are the issues that we should be 
addressing? In June 1993 the subcommittee on senior citizens' 
health issues of the House standing committee on health and 
welfare issued a report entitled ``Breaking the silence on the abuse 
of older Canadians: Everyone's concern''. It starts with the phrase: 
``Abuse thrives in secrecy''. If you can break the silence you can 
often break the abuse. Let us try to break this silence.
<P>
	This report breaks abuse down into four categories. Physical 
abuse includes the wilful, direct infliction of physical pain or 
injury, rough handling, shoving, slapping, pinching, hitting, 
kicking, restriction of freedom of movement and sexual abuse.
<P>
<B>(1400 )</B>
<P>
	Let us look at psychological abuse, which refers to socially 
isolating, threatening, yelling at, infantizing or withholding 
affection or denying privileges to a person. That happens often.
<P>
	Financial or material exploitation is another abuse. It is involved 
in the theft or conversion of money or objects of value belonging to 
the senior by a relative or caretaker. How often do those pension 
cheques go into the hands of some member of the family? Once a 
month they come to visit the elder, pick up the pension cheque and 
are gone. That is happening in Canada today all too often.
<P>
	Neglect is another abuse. It involves failing to provide the 
necessities of life including adequate heat, clothing, hygienic 
conditions and the denial of social interaction. For those seniors 
whom I see so much on their own, there is no social interaction 
unless they are in a seniors' home where they can interact with each 
other. That is the only opportunity.
<P>
	I believe these categories of abuse can be addressed in many 
varied ways. Financial abuse, which also means uncertainty of 
income would be addressed through the Canada pension plan, old 
age security and income supplement; real legislation to make real 
laws, not a plaque to hang on the wall. That is not going to help 
them at all in their old age and when they need money. Let us 
ensure that the elderly of our country who need assistance from the 
state get it. It is not any more complicated than that.
<P>
	With regard to neglect, let us look at our health care system to 
ensure that it meets the needs of our seniors. We must ensure that 
inequities in the system do not appear and rob seniors of needed 
care. We must look at prevention of illness rather than just treating 
the sick. We must look at enhancing people's capacity to cope.
<P>
	In this regard emphasis should be placed on treating our elderly 
where they live, home care that takes place in surroundings that are 
familiar to our seniors. We all know that when seniors leave their 
own homes often they die much quicker.
<P>
	We should also address the issues that confront those who 
provide care to the elderly. We all can recite stories of families we 
know who are stressed to the limit as they look after their own 
children as well as aging parents. The demands on this type of 
family situation are enormous. They must be addressed as part of 
our health care issues.
<P>
	We also should do more to educate all members of the public, 
but especially seniors, that elder abuse is a crime. It should be 
punished. Whether somebody is 20 years old or 80 years old, theft 
is theft. We should tighten the rules by which powers of attorney 
are obtained from seniors. We should make sure by passing laws to 
make it more difficult to get a power of attorney. We should ensure 
that their consent is given freely and legitimately.
<P>
	Physical abuse or assault, or sexual assault is punishable under 
the Criminal Code and should be treated as such. Psychological 
abuses could be addressed by sections of the code on assault by 
means of threats and intimidation. Neglect could be provided for 
by the section imposing a duty to provide necessities of life to a 
person under one's charge if that person is disabled by virtue of 
age, illness or other cause.
<P>
	The issues affecting our seniors are many and they are serious. 
They will be solved by action, not by writing a bill of rights, not by 
putting another piece of paper on the wall. Discrimination on the 
basis of age is protected under the charter of rights and freedoms. 
Action is needed on the fronts that I have listed, action which I am 
afraid will not be forthcoming from this government, given its 
track record to date.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the House for the opportunity to speak on the 
motion M-265, the seniors' bill of rights.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5443"> 5443 </A></B>
<P>
	Since the origins of the baby boom, the number of prospective 
seniors has been increasing. Our population is aging. As a country 
we must face new concerns and new issues regarding the care and 
the management of an increasing aging population.
<P>
	In light of these new concerns, Canadians must seriously 
consider the implications that a greatly increasing number of 
seniors will have on our country. This concern is manageable so 
long as proper planning and thought are initiated in order to protect 
the quality of life of seniors in Canada as more baby boomers enter 
the retirement age.
<P>
	As a management tool or guideline my colleague, the 
hon.member for Guelph-Wellington, has drafted motion M-265 
detailing a seniors' bill of rights to acknowledge the rights of 
seniors to live a full and proactive life. I congratulate the member 
for Guelph-Wellington on this initiative and I assure her of my 
support in order to move this initiative forward.
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	Today seniors are concerned about health care, personal 
finances, discrimination based on age and abuse. Many feel 
overwhelmed with the new information technology and the fast 
pace today's society maintains. However, seniors are a wealth of 
information and knowledge, particularly due to the fact that most 
of their insights are based on firsthand personal experience.
<P>
	There must be a balance between the vigour, the enthusiasm and 
the vitality of today's youth and the firsthand experience and 
knowledge of our seniors. While our society expands and grows 
through technology, it is still only as good as the knowledge, the 
insight and the expertise of those operating it. An ideal community 
would have a balance between the technical training of youth and 
the knowledge and wisdom of our seniors.
<P>
	The issues seniors face today will not be foreign to any of us at 
some point in our lives. Whether we like it or not, we are all aging. 
We can all look forward to seniorhood, in many cases in the not too 
distant future.
<P>
	When I think of seniors, a well known individual in my riding of 
Carleton-Charlotte comes to mind. I often refer to him as my 
fisheries historian. His name is Floyd Hawkins. Mr. Hawkins has 
contributed a great deal to Carleton-Charlotte and to the fishing 
industry through his experience and his expertise working in the 
fishery.
<P>
	Throughout his senior years he has continued to provide a vast 
amount of helpful direction, input and wisdom, all based on 
firsthand experience. From issues detailing fish stocks to species 
behavioural patterns to the mentality behind a traditional fishery, 
Mr. Hawkins' knowledge, based on firsthand experience, cannot be 
matched.
<P>
	Canadians must recognize the contributions seniors can make to 
society on every level. Seniors must not be overlooked simply 
because they have become older. They have too much to offer 
Canada.
<P>
	In conclusion, Motion M-265, the seniors' bill of rights, is a step 
in the right direction. It is necessary to create awareness of the 
needs of an aging population and for all of us to enjoy the 
advantages of the knowledge and experience of our Canadian 
seniors population.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too am 
pleased to speak to this motion concerning the drafting a seniors' 
bill of rights. You know, seniors represent three phases in our lives. 
The first one is when they are our grandparents. The second one is 
when they are our parents. And finally, if you and I are lucky, the 
third one is when we ourselves become grandparents one day.
<P>
	In my riding, there are people who work very hard. They have 
reached a certain age, an honourable age, have retired and have 
been working for all kinds of organizations ever since. For 
example, in Granby, the Club du lundi is chaired by Marcel Maheu, 
who is over 70 years old. He has also founded a group called 
Civisme Granby, which tries, through various means, to bring 
people to be more civil. Mr. Maheu has also been co-chairman of 
the committee for the monument that was unveiled last week in 
memory of Horace Boivin, former mayor of Granby who remained 
the city's ambassador until he was 89.
<P>
<B>(1410)</B>
<P>
	I would also like to mention Jeannot Tremblay-Bergeron, a 
woman who for a number of years has served meals to people in 
need in Granby. She is in her sixties and, everyday, with a group of 
volunteers, she serves meals to the disadvantaged. There is also 
Roger Charbonneau. If the Bloc Quebecois is doing well in my 
riding, it is thanks to the chairman of the Bloc association, who will 
turn 75 on his next birthday.
<P>
	When I was first elected, a group of seniors came to see me. 
They were led by Léonard Viens, chairman of the seniors 
association in Granby. They wanted to build a centre where they 
could get together. During the last election campaign, the Liberal 
candidate had promised them a hefty grant.
<P>
	Shortly after I was elected, these people came to my office and I 
had to tell them that unfortunately there were no longer any grants 
for this type of construction. They were not discouraged, although 
perhaps a little disappointed. They rolled up their sleeves and they 
built their centre. And it is a very fine centre. I had the pleasure of 
attending the opening, and there were over 500 people present. All 
this is to say that when senior citizens have the health and the 
means, they have the time and they can achieve great things.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5444"> 5444 </A></B>
<P>
	The situation now is that there are over 500,000 older Canadians 
living in poverty. Most of them are women. Some studies show 
conclusively a link between poverty and health in old age. 
Documentation submitted by seniors groups says, and I quote: 
``We question the appropriateness of placing more restrictions on 
seniors in the next federal budget, such as an old age security 
clawback based on family income rather than on individual 
income. This last proposal is an attack against senior women and 
violates all principles of gender equality''.
<P>
	We know there have been battles in the history of Quebec and 
Canada. Women have asked for and even demanded equality and I 
believe we would regress if we were to talk about family income 
rather that individual income. Those women are among the poor in 
our society.
<P>
	Just because one has spent a life time raising children and 
working very hard sometimes for not much money, that is no 
reason to have to be poor as one grows older. We only have to think 
of our parents and grand-parents, who worked very hard to raise 
their family and may have lived in poverty all their life.
<P>
	If the government wants to be consistent with the motion, it must 
make sure that seniors in our society live with dignity till the end of 
their days.
<P>
	I want to pay tribute to my colleague, the member for 
Argenteuil-Papineau, who is the seniors critic for the Bloc 
Quebecois. He does a fantastic job and is forever making us, in the 
Bloc Quebecois, aware of how important it is to take seniors into 
account and to treat them well.
<P>
	In the last budget and in the finance minister's proposals, it is 
mentioned that, until the next election, pensions will be left alone.
<P>
<B>(1415)</B>
<P>
	If we really believe in the distribution of wealth, I think we are 
not giving enough to the have nots. These people have worked all 
their lives, and have earned the right to some financial security.
<P>
	Let me tell you about an incident that took place in my riding, 
which I am sure you have seen in your riding too, Mr. Speaker. An 
elderly woman came to my office. I would say she was 70 although 
it is hard to know exactly. She had not filed an application to 
receive increased benefits. She was there, sitting in front of me and 
I was deeply touched. We often see cases like that in our offices 
and, even though people think we are heartless, you will agree that 
this is not the case. I was deeply moved when this lady showed me 
her bank book and said: ``Look, this is all I have left''. She had 
practically nothing left in her bank account. She had not received 
her cheque.
<P>
	Of course, we fixed the problem, but it took a few days, perhaps 
even two weeks. This very poor woman-and there are many like 
her in each of our ridings-was feeling insecure, which is a 
frequent cause of illness.
<P>
	We must simplify procedures and cut as much red tape as 
possible so that when these people forget to fill out a form, for 
example at the beginning of the year, they are not left out in the 
cold.
<P>
	As the hon. member who put forward the motion was saying, a 
society is judged on how it treats its poorest and weakest members, 
that is to say, its young people and its senior citizens. I think 
starting out in life is an extraordinary thing. But, as a people, we in 
Quebec are working hard to achieve this goal, and in Canada, too, 
to allow these people to maintain their dignity.
<P>
	I support the motion and I think there should be a seniors' bill of 
rights. This government should be a little more generous with these 
people so they can enjoy full lives in our society.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too want to state my firm support for 
the intent of this motion, namely that we acknowledge the vital role 
that seniors play in the life of our families, our communities and in 
society.
<P>
	It is important for us to keep in mind the government's 
commitment in this area as well. The government has demonstrated 
this commitment and maintains it to ensure that federal programs 
and services both meet seniors' changing needs and are 
co-ordinated across government.
<P>
	First and foremost in this regard is the development of a national 
framework on aging which will deal with the current and future 
needs of seniors in an aging society. The national framework is 
based on a vision statement and a set of principles to guide policy 
development. The vision statement and principles were approved 
by the federal, provincial and territorial ministers responsible for 
seniors at a recent meeting in June.
<P>
	At that same meeting, ministers responsible for seniors also 
directed their officials to collaborate on several other issues of 
immediate concern to seniors. These included the provision of 
continuing care for seniors, support for caregivers of persons with 
Alzheimer's disease, palliative care and the risks involved in the 
inappropriate use of medication.
<P>
	At the federal level we have established an interdepartmental 
committee on seniors issues comprising 15 departments and six 
agencies that serve seniors directly or for whom seniors are a major 
client group. The committee meets to review policy directions 
relating to seniors issues and to act as an early detection device for 
emerging trends and pressures. It builds on some of the input that 
members, like my colleague from Victoria-Haliburton who has 
been anxious to intervene  on this debate and who has ceded his 
position to me, have been promoting in our caucus.
<P>

<P>
	We are also focusing our attention on seniors in situations of 
risk, those who are already at risk and those who are likely to 
become so through our New Horizons: Partners in Aging program. 
Through this program, the federal government has supported many 
community based projects which are attempting to address risk 
situations related to care giving, abuse, neglect, isolation and 
palliative care.
<P>
	Improving the health outlook for Canadian seniors is also a key 
priority for Health Canada. With regard to one of the fundamental 
rights of seniors of all age groups, the right to quality health care, I 
want to assure this House of the government's commitment to 
maintaining the principles of the Canada Health Act and renewal of 
the health care system so that it remains responsive to the health 
needs of seniors.
<P>
	For example, the federal government contributed $2.5 million to 
the Canadian multi-centre osteoporosis study. This study will 
provide better insight into the causes and prevention of this disease 
which affects some 1.4 million Canadians over the age of 50.
<P>
	In addition, the National Advisory Council on Aging reports 
directly to the minister of health and responds to expressed 
priorities and concerns related to aging and seniors by providing 
policy advice based on research and consultations with seniors 
across Canada.
<P>
	I want to assure all members in the House that this government is 
taking a proactive approach to addressing the priority concerns of 
seniors. As our society continues to evolve, I hope we can 
remember the increasingly important role that senior Canadians 
play.
<P>
	In closing, let me say that this government has moved to 
acknowledge and underscore the vital role played by seniors in our 
country. It is undertaking activity on a number of fronts to ensure 
that government policy is sensitive to seniors issues.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I want to thank the parliamentary secretary for shortening his time 
in order to allow me to speak on Motion No. 265 of the member for 
Guelph-Wellington on the seniors bill of rights. This motion to 
direct the justice committee to draft a seniors bill of rights is very 
timely.
<P>
	My riding of Victoria-Haliburton is very influenced by the 
constant rise in the number of seniors, some very young seniors by 
the way, who are retiring in beautiful rural ridings to enjoy the 
tranquil settings, pristine lakes, nature trails and the many 
advantages to living in rural Canada. The riding of 
Victoria-Haliburton is experiencing a boom from the Toronto 
area in the  seniors market. The growing market is a knowledge 
based group with much to offer the communities they retire in.
<P>
	Bobcaygeon village situated on three islands between Sturgeon 
Lake and Pigeon Lake with the busiest lock on the Trent canal 
system and about 750 miles of inland fresh water is experiencing 
the fastest growth in the seniors market in Ontario.
<P>
	The residents of Bobcaygeon and area lead all other areas in 
responding to my surveys of constituents. The advice they forward 
to me and my colleagues is based on a very thorough understanding 
of the issues of the day and a great understanding of history.
<P>
	With this in mind, the seniors bill of rights would be very 
welcome in my riding and other areas of similar nature, like 
Guelph-Wellington.
<P>
	The Canadian Association of Retired Persons sent suggestions. 
We all agree with them.
<P>
	I want to support the member for Guelph-Wellington in her 
efforts to establish a seniors bill of rights and encourage all 
members to lend their support.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, may you and all members and staff of the House of 
Commons have a joyous Thanksgiving.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. The 
order is dropped from the Order Paper.
<P>
	I also join in in wishing everyone a happy Thanksgiving.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Happy Thanksgiving weekend to all of you.
<P>
	It being 2.25 p.m., the House stands adjourned until Monday, 
October 21, 1996, at 11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Orders 28 and 
24.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 2.27 p.m.)
<P>
