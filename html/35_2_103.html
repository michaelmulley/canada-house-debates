	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
Thursday the Waterloo Region Community Safety and Crime 
Prevention Council released its report on making Waterloo region a 
safer and more secure community. The report is the result of 14 
months of hard work by over 80 members of the task force who 
represent a cross-section of my community.
<P>
	The report states that crime prevention is everyone's concern and 
challenges the community to imagine a community in which all 
members can be safe and feel safe. The report notes that while 
Waterloo region has a low relative crime rate, residents have an 
increased fear of crime.
<P>
	The 50 recommendations of the report challenge the community 
to fight crime and be involved in crime prevention by dealing with 
the root causes of crime. The report notes that the offender of 
tomorrow is the vulnerable child of today, and that physically 
abused children are five times more likely to be violent adults.
<P>
	I salute the council for its valuable work. It will help in 
maintaining Waterloo region as one of the safest and most secure 
communities in Canada.

	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the mining 
industry plays an important role, not only in my  riding of Abitibi, 
but also in the whole economy of Quebec and Canada. I am pleased 
to welcome the delegates of this industry, who are here in Ottawa 
on the lobbying day of the campaign to support the mining 
industry.
<P>
	This industry unquestionably plays a key role in Quebec. It 
employs over 17,500 people, pays $889 million in salaries, and 
generates over $3 billion in mining shipments.
<P>
	The scheduled meetings with members of Parliament will 
provide these delegates with an opportunity to clearly state their 
needs regarding the regulatory reform that is required to promote 
investments in the mining sector. So far, the federal government 
has made nice promises, but taken little concrete action. I hope the 
representations made by industry officials will prompt the 
government to quickly take action.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today I welcome the Keep Mining in Canada group to 
Ottawa. Today has also been declared National Day of the Child.
<P>
	Some of the most important factors in a child's life are: whether 
their parents have a well paying job; whether children grow up in a 
stable community with adequate health care and education; and 
whether they can look forward to getting a good job when they 
finish school. Keeping the successful mining industry flourishing 
in Canada will help provide all those things: good jobs for today 
and tomorrow; a sound tax base to pay for hospitals and schools; 
and stable communities, especially across rural Canada.
<P>
	Therefore, I urge the government to deliver quickly on its many 
promises to streamline environmental regulations and other red 
tape which affects mining. If mining industry dollars are to remain 
in Canada, this government needs a fresh start to convince 
international investors that Canada once again wants mining jobs 
with their many spin-offs that benefit every sector of this nation's 
economy.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
federal NDP caucus is pleased to congratulate Dr. Herb Dickieson, 
the leader of the Prince Edward Island New Democrats. On 
Monday Dr. Herb became the first New Democrat to be elected in 
P.E.I. We are confident that his presence in the legislature will 
make a big difference for the people of P.E.I. I first met Dr. 
Dickieson when I spoke at his nomination meeting in 1995 and 
sensed at that time that he was going to make history for the NDP.

	<B>Mr. Raymond Bonin (Nickel Belt, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, over the 
last decade the Canadian mining industry has become an example 
to the world in making sustainable development an essential part of 
its activities.
<P>
	The Mining Association of Canada was the first mining body in 
the world to develop a national environmental policy based on the 
concept of sustainable development. In addition, Canadian mining 
companies spend hundreds of millions of dollars on environmental 
related projects, more than $300 million in 1993 alone.
<P>
<B>(1405 )</B>
<P>
	One key example of the mining industry's commitment to the 
environment is its accelerated reduction and elimination of toxics 
program. Already Canadian mining companies have come close to 
meeting their emission reduction targets for the year 2000. This is 
almost five years ahead of schedule.
<P>
	On behalf of all members of the House, I congratulate the 
Mining Association of Canada and its member companies on this 
outstanding achievement. I encourage them to expand upon their 
commitment to sustainable development with new and innovative 
initiatives.

Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I did not take this opportunity to 
tell you about the government's new policy on minerals and metals, 
and the renewal of the federation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This government is committed to a flexible and dynamic 
approach to federalism. The new minerals and metals policy is 
based on a fundamental recognition by this government of 
provincial ownership and management of mineral resources. The 
policy describes a sharply focused role for the government in 
minerals and metals that is tied to core federal responsibilities such 
as international trade and investment, science and technology and 
aboriginal affairs. Through the policy the government commits 
itself to building effective and durable partnerships with the 
provinces and territories.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	By promoting the establishment of partnerships, the new policy 
on minerals and metals will help renew the federation and make 
sure the industry continues to make a major contribution to the 
economic and social well-being of Canadians, right into the 21st 
century.

	If Canadian Airlines fails, it will cost the taxpayers almost $1

<P>

	This exclusion act can only exacerbate tensions, erode social

trying to polish its image by promoting the province as a tolerant

<P>
	The rights and freedoms of all Quebecers should not be held 
hostage by the governing party in its appeasement of some of its

	This week, Canada signed a free trade agreement with Chile. In 
1995, trade between the two countries was worth $666 million.

agreement with a country with which trade is worth more than $60

Speaker, the best interests of children should be a benchmark 
against which government policies are measured. There is no better 
way to ensure the well-being of children than to make families a 
priority in our society and in our decision making starting right 
here in the House, this home of Canadian values, if you will.
<P>
	Today is National Child Day. I remind this House that in 1989 
the United Nations passed the convention of the child which gave 
children around the world access to their families. Canada 
recognized that convention in 1991, so why do Canadian children 
not have access to their families?
<P>
	The best interests of children reside in the family. The first step 
was taken in October when the House supported my motion to 
recognize the family as a building block of society and then 
unanimously agreed to protect and enhance family interests.
<P>
	Now is the time for the government to fulfil this commitment on 
behalf of children, to commit to a fresh start for children. Surely on 
National Child Day it is not only time to acknowledge each child's

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TAXATION">TAXATION</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the Bloc Quebecois released its analysis of the 
federal government's corporate tax expenditures. Of the $9 billion 
to $10 billion the federal government sacrifices annually in taxes 
not collected from major corporations, primarily, we estimate that 
the Minister of Finance could easily recover some $3 billion to be 
used in promoting job creation.
<P>
	With the government going after the unemployed, cutting 
transfers for social assistance, transfers for health care and 
transfers for post-secondary education, how can the Minister of 
Finance justify still failing, after three years in power, to 
systematically evaluate all corporate tax expenditures, which have 
not been reviewed in years, and keeping them as they stand.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the Bloc Quebecois tabled a sober report yesterday. I consider it a 
very professional one. I thank the Leader of the Opposition and the 
members here for their work.
<P>
	There are many things in the report we agree with. They are 
either things we are looking at or things that we are in fact currently 
working on. There is certainly material for debate, and this is a 
good start.
<P>
	To my understanding, in response to the Leader of the 
Opposition's specific question, it is not $3 billion that we can 
recover, if I understand the report correctly, but $3 billion that can 
be put into job creation, which is the very aim of the Mintz 
committee currently looking at the situation from the same point of 
view.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I in turn would thank the Minister of Finance for his 
objectivity in recognizing that the work of the Bloc represents a 
very substantial contribution to public finances. Certainly, it is the 
most substantial contribution made by an opposition party, 
especially in opposition.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	Despite these kind words for my friend, I am nevertheless 
obliged to say to the Minister of Finance that he is hiding behind 
his committee because everyone  knows the report will be released 
only next year, after the federal elections. People want to know now 
what the government will do.
<P>
	Should the Minister of Finance, who seems to recognize reason, 
not make substantial changes in tax expenditures right now, as we 
are suggesting he do and use this money for other tax measures that 
would help create jobs in small and medium businesses, for 
example? That is what it means to be proactive in creating jobs. 
This is what the people are expecting and not getting from the 
government.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
received the report favourably first, because the reports of the Bloc 
Quebecois have changed in the past three years. Second, I must say 
the quality of the report is very similar to what the Liberal Party 
submitted on the environment, the economy and other areas when it 
was in opposition.
<P>
	That said, the aim is to ensure that the basic impact of 
government spending, be it tax credits, tax exemptions or other 
incentives is to promote job creation. This has been our philosophy 
from the start. This is why we have eliminated a list of loopholes 
three pages long. These loopholes did not promote job creation. We 
are going to continue the job, I hope with the co-operation of the 
Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have to say once again to the Minister of Finance that we 
will of course co-operate with him when he is reasonable. When he 
wants to save taxpayers' money, of course we will work with him. 
When he repents and finally is prepared to collect taxes from those 
who should be paying, of course we will co-operate and we will 
co-operate with him. He may rest assured, the Bloc will co-operate.
<P>
	Since he is in good humour, I will go a step further. In our 
document, we established that a sample of 27 major Canadian 
corporations with profits of $7 billion in 1994 paid income tax at a 
rate barely above 6.5 per cent, whereas the corporate rate is usually 
around 30 per cent.
<P>
	This does not concern the minister of defence, so I would ask 
him to allow me to ask my question of his colleague.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Let us ignore him in any case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> He is well versed in defence matters, but not in 
things financial, unfortunately. Can the Minister of Finance set up a 
mechanism guaranteeing Quebecers and Canadians that business 
and especially big business will pay the government the taxes it is 
supposed to within a reasonable period of time, while maintaining 
intact the concept of deferred income tax? Some simple 
adjustments need be made. We would like to know from the 
Minister of Finance whether he would agree to act quickly in this 
matter as the Bloc asks him to?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6488"> 6488 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
as regards deferred taxes, I think the Leader of the Opposition is 
going a bit beyond his report, which was more subtle. In the report, 
the Bloc acknowledged there were advantages to having taxes 
deferred. This is our position exactly.
<P>
	On the other hand, this is why there is a tax on major 
corporations. We want to be sure they pay their fair share, and this 
is the case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I too will have to accept the congratulations of the 
Minister of Finance. It must, however, be admitted that the official 
opposition does some good, as the minister admitted today.
<P>
	But enough polite remarks directed at the Minister of Finance, 
for I have no congratulations for him. With all the resources at the 
disposal of the finance department, he could, in three years, have 
conducted the same in-depth study done by the Bloc Quebecois 
with its meagre resources and realized that he was wasting $3 
billion a year in tax revenue.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Speaking of deferred taxes, when the auditor at 
Consolidated Bathurst was asked ``When will you pay your 
company's deferred taxes?'', he replied ``Never''. Right now, 
deferred and accumulated taxes represent a total of $36 billion, 5 
per cent of the Canadian GDP, and nobody in the finance 
department, starting with the minister himself, seems to be 
concerned.
<P>
	Given the size of this tax expenditure and its unwarranted use by 
certain large corporations that are making a profit, will the Minister 
of Finance not admit that he should immediately issue rules so that 
one day these corporations will pay their fair share?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
unfortunately the finance critic for the Bloc Quebecois is raising 
his voice; gone are the measured and professional tones of 
yesterday. In addition, he is also misrepresenting the report.
<P>
	I can tell you that as far as the notion of deferred taxes is 
concerned, we have looked, and will continue to look, for 
loopholes.
<P>
	I would just like to quote one other person with almost the same 
philosophy: ``As for taxing corporations more directly, as 
recommended by the Bloc Quebecois's finance critic, this cuts their 
profits, reduces their interest in investing and results in fewer jobs. 
Furthermore, the higher Quebec's tax burden, the less foreign 
companies will be interested in investing in that province and 
creating jobs there''. This statement was made by Bernard Landry, 
Quebec's finance minister. He is right, and the Bloc Quebecois's 
finance critic is wrong.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the finance minister is taking the Canadian public for a 
ride. What we are saying in our document is that the majority of 
Canadian SMEs are paying their fair share of taxes. But a few are 
taking advantage of tax loopholes, with the knowledge of the 
Minister of Finance, to avoid paying taxes.
<P>
	We humbly ask him this: Will he, or will he not, assume his 
responsibilities and demonstrate professionalism as Minister of 
Finance, by looking out for the interests of all Canadian taxpayers, 
and not just those of large Canadian corporations?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there are times when debate in this House takes on a form that does 
Canadians proud, particularly when we deal with issues in a 
fundamental and profound way.
<P>
	No doubt the question of taxation, which is in constant 
evolution, is something that should not lend itself to partisan 
speeches, but should lend itself to real study.
<P>
	Under those circumstances I did say to the Bloc Quebecois that 
their report which came out yesterday will make a valuable 
addition to the debate, as did a great number of the reports done by 
the Liberals in opposition help advance the yardstick.
<P>
	All I would suggest to the Leader of the Opposition is that he ask 
his members to continue in the same vein, so that the debate can be 
responsible, can advance the yardstick and not simply play politics 
with a very important subject.

Canada are used in new and innovative ways, in new partnerships

<P>
	If the hon. gentleman is suggesting that we should not pursue the

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister very much but he did not answer 
the question. This $216 million to Bombardier is for the CF-18 
maintenance contract.
<P>
	On October 31, 1986 Brian Mulroney gave this very same 
contract to Bombardier even though Bristol Aerospace of 
Winnipeg had the best bid. In opposition these very same Liberals 
cried blue murder over that contract. Now that they are in power, 
the Liberals have done exactly what the Tories did.
<P>
	How can the Liberals justify giving this lucrative $216 million 
contract to Bombardier without tender? Even the Tories tendered 
the contract before they rigged it.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to make 
sure because the hon. member and members of his party have been 
very careful and responsible in dealing with a number of issues that 
relate to the military elements we have to deal with at this time.
<P>
	I want to make sure I understand what the hon. member is 
saying. Is he saying that he wishes to begin again the process of 
trying to determine how we can strike a deal with our allies from 
western Europe who require training facilities in Canada? Does he 
want us to start from scratch when we are into a tough competition 
with other parts of the world to get the very same contract?
<P>
	My information is that people in western Canada hope we can 
conclude this deal. Our allies hope we can conclude this deal. What 
is good for western Canada is very good for the military forces of 
this country. It is also very good for Bombardier which not only 
operates in Quebec, as the hon. member seems to think, but also in 
many other parts of the country with which he may not be familiar.

Mr. Speaker, the minister's answers are very interesting.

Foreign Affairs accused the government of saying one thing and

	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Liberal government's policy of high taxes and big 
government means that more and more Canadian families need a 
second income just to make ends meet. The average Canadian 
family will have to pay $27,000 this year in taxes alone. Too many 
Canadians are working for the government instead of their 
families.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Reform will give 
Canadian families a $2,000 tax break by the year 2000. What does 
the government have to offer to Canadian families?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Reform will withdraw $4 billion from the Canadian health and 
social transfer. We will not. We will protect the Canada Health Act. 
We will protect health care in this country. Reform will not.
<P>
	Reform will gut equalization payments to those provinces which 
require them. What Reform is saying, according to its philosophy, 
is that there are families in Newfoundland and Saskatchewan who 
are not worthy of receiving government help. We do not believe 
that is the fabric of this country. It is not the philosophy on which 
this country was built.
<P>
	I have a list of measures that the government has brought in to 
help Canadian families, to help Canadian children. Reform voted 
against every single one of them. Stand up and defend your record, 
not what you do in the future, but what you have done in the past.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, may I say that the government has nothing to brag about 
with respect to transfers to the provinces.
<P>
	Today is national child day. Reform's fresh start directly helps 
families and their children by reducing taxes dramatically. We will 
reduce taxes by 89 per cent for families with incomes of $30,000 
and free over one million Canadian families from the tax rolls 
altogether.
<P>
	In recognition of the importance of our children, will the 
Liberals commit today to increase the spousal deduction and 
extend the child care deduction to all parents, including those who 
care for their children at home?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
perhaps the member of the Reform Party could explain, given her 
interest in child care, that when the government broadened the 
eligibility for the child care expense deduction and when we 
extended the age limit for children, why did Reform vote against 
it?
<P>
	When the government increased the working income supplement 
for working families, why did Reform vote against it? When the 
government enriched the tax credit for infirm dependants, why did 
Reform vote against it? When the government improved child 
support awards, why did Reform vote against it? When the 
Minister of Justice brought in the new guidelines, why did Reform 
vote against it?

question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	Yesterday, the minister announced on behalf of the 
government-for the second time, given that the Minister of 
Finance had made the same announcement earlier-a five cent 
reduction in unemployment insurance premiums. Perhaps he thinks 
that by announcing a five cent reduction twice, people will think 
the total reduction will be ten cents. But no, five cents it is. In fact, 
he is maintaining the special deficit reduction tax on workers 
earning under $39,000 and their employers.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	How can the minister ignore the disastrous situation of the job 
market and be content with announcing marginal measures that 
will have very little effect on employment?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would suggest to 
the hon. member for Mercier that the announcement was not made 
twice; the Minister of Finance and I did it jointly, in front of the 
same cameras.
<P>
	We did announce-and the Minister of Finance may want to 
comment on this later-a five cent reduction. For the third 
consecutive year, our government has reduced employment 
insurance premiums, which is absolutely remarkable since they had 
risen for years.
<P>
	I would also submit to the hon. member for Mercier that another 
program, a program for small business, was announced yesterday. 
Some 900,000 eligible small businesses will not have to pay any 
employment insurance premiums on behalf of new employees in 
1997. This means that any small business in Canada that hires a 
new employee will not pay employment insurance premiums in 
1997 and only 75 per cent of the premiums in 1998 for that 
employee. That is what we are doing to promote employment. That 
is what we announced yesterday.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the same 
government will, for the first time, this coming January, impose 
a payroll tax on all the employers who hire part time employees 
working fewer than 15 hours per week.
<P>
	Since premium rates represent in fact a tax on jobs-and we are 
not alone in thinking so-and since the employment insurance fund 
is forecast to grow from $5 billion this year to $10 billion next year, 
what is the minister waiting for to substantially reduce premium 
rates, as requested by the official opposition, the business 
community, and the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, instead of 
using the fund to artificially reduce the deficit?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
the Minister of Human Resources Development just said-for the 
third time-we have reduced employment insurance premiums, 
after a decade of increases by the previous government.
<P>
	To give you an idea of the philosophy behind this, I would like to 
quote the response of Quebec finance minister Bernard Landry to 
the same question. He said: ``Pursuant to the commission's 
regulations, but also in response to repeated requests from several 
socioeconomic partners, the government plans to lower payroll 
taxes. We will do this, however, with the expectation that real job 
creation will ensue''.
<P>
	That is precisely why we have targeted small and medium size 
businesses, since they are responsible for the vast majority of new 
jobs created in Canada.

<P>
	I quote the president of the company: ``Somebody needs to 
listen. These are real people in New Brunswick with real jobs that 
are going away''.
<P>
	The Reform Party is listening. Why are Liberal MPs not 
listening?
<P>
	My question is to the finance minister. Why is the government 
insisting on pushing through this insane legislation that is killing 
jobs in Atlantic Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
far from insisting, what we are doing is co-operating with the 
provincial governments of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and 
Newfoundland whose major  purpose is to make sure that 
employment is created in their own provinces. That is why the 
three premiers are going across Canada, across North America, 
explaining what has happened, the tremendous reduction in taxes 
for their small and medium size businesses.
<P>
<B>(1445 )</B>
<P>
	That is not the issue. The real issue is why is this member of 
Parliament so against Atlantic Canada's benefiting itself? Why is 
this member of Parliament so against small and medium size 
businesses in Atlantic Canada being able to compete? What kind of 
vision does the Reform Party have when it cannot understand the 
legitimate ambitions and desires of an important part of the 
country?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
amazing to me that the finance minister can be so callous about the 
loss of 79 jobs in Atlantic Canada. However, this is just the 
beginning. This one company alone says that at least another 71 
jobs are on the line, and this comes after repeated warnings to the 
finance minister from the Canadian Real Estate Association, the 
Retail Council of Canada, the Halifax Chamber of Commerce and 
even Nova Scotia finance officials. They are saying that these 
changes will cost hundreds of millions of dollars and will kill even 
more jobs.
<P>
	Will the finance minister please set his pride aside for a moment, 
for the sake of saving some jobs in Atlantic Canada, and kill this 
legislation before it kills even more jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let 
us be very clear. The Reform Party recommended harmonization. 
The Reform Party at the finance committee came out full score in 
favour of harmonization. Why is the hon. member standing up here 
now and arguing against harmonization? There can be only one 
reason. It is an abysmal lack of knowledge of Atlantic Canada. It is 
the fact that he does not understand the ability and the desire of 
Atlantic Canadians to take control of their own future. That is the 
problem.
<P>
	The Reform Party supported harmonization but it is against it for 
Atlantic Canada. What are its real motives?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.
<P>
	We are a government that acknowledges that primary 
jurisdiction over mining rests with the provinces. However, we are 
also a government that acknowledges the increasing globalization 
of the mining industry and consequently there is a role for the 
federal government as it relates to the mining industry.
<P>
	Industry respects that, most provinces and environmental 
stakeholders respect that position.
<P>
	The issue of regulatory reform was specifically raised, avoiding 
regulatory overlap and duplication. I was very pleased to receive 
the final report of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources, 
of which the hon. member is a member. My department and I will 
be reviewing that report. The hon. member knows that we

society and they do not want it from coast to coast.

	Given the recent poll results that show that even Liberals do not

<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, today the support for the distinct society clause is 
about 40 per cent in polls. It is lower in this poll because it was 
connected with a kind of question that looks like a threat: ``If you 
don't recognize Quebec, then Quebec may leave''. Instead of 
increasing support, it decreased it.
<P>
	I urge the hon. member to look at the recognition of Quebec on 
its own merit, why it is good, why it is bad. I think it is good. It is 
good for our country. It is good for Canadian values. It would not 
endanger the charter of rights and freedoms. It would not endanger 
equality between citizens. It would be a great thing to recognize 
Quebec distinctiveness as a fundamental characteristic of our 
country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
idea was wrong in the Meech Lake accord, it was wrong in the 
Charlottetown accord, it was wrong when the Prime Minister 
promised it last year, it was wrong when the government pushed it 
through the House of Commons, it was wrong when it was adopted 
as policy at the Liberal convention. The Tories of course followed 
suit but they just do not get it.

put other proposals that affect all the provinces on the table if need

as credit cards and interest rates on credit cards is by the consumers 
to indicate whether or not they wish to accommodate such an 
industry.
<P>
	When interest rates were high, generally consumers in other 
areas did not borrow money and did not make purchases, and 
recently we had it in the housing industry. When interest rates were 
reduced through the very fine policy of our finance minister, then 
consumers gained confidence and started to buy houses.
<P>
	The same can apply in the credit card industry. It is best to leave 
it to the marketplace. Already there are changes by some of the 
lending institutions where in certain cases they are instituting 
credit cards with lower rates. It is best to leave it for the 
marketplace and Canadian consumers. If the consumers do not like 
the policy and the high interest rates, they do not have to use the 
cards.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NATIONALCHILDDAY">NATIONAL CHILD DAY</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in making this statement I am also speaking on behalf of 
the hon. government House leader and solicitor general who had to 
leave the Chamber for personal business.
<P>
	I am here today on behalf of the government to mark the fourth 
anniversary of National Child Day. This day is designated to raise 
awareness and to help Canadians celebrate the special meaning that 
children bring to our lives. It is also a day to reflect on the special 
needs of children and to think of ways we can improve their 
well-being.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Again this year, the United Nations announced that Canada has 
the best quality of life in the world. We are proud of this, but it 
must not lead to complacency.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Where child poverty exists in a country as rich as Canada, it 
must be a concern for our entire society. The Government of 
Canada is acting on a number of fronts to address this problem. For 
example, we have doubled the working income supplement 
provided to low income families, and the new employment 
insurance program contains measures to enable Canadians to get 
back to work and to provide a basic income guarantee for low 
income families.
<P>
	We also want to see children grow up in the most secure and safe 
environment we can possibly make. All too often children fall prey 
to criminal victimization and exploitation. As members know we 
are now discussing in a parliamentary committee Bill C-27 which 
provides major protection against child prostitution. It also attacks 
the horrible scourge of sexual exploitation of children by tourists 
abroad and gives us the right to prosecute Canadians who engage in 
these practices.
<P>
	Another area of special concern to many families is the plight of 
children who are reported missing. At any given time there are 
about 1,500 to 2,000 reported cases of missing children across 
Canada. Most are runaways but a considerable number of these 
children are victims of parental abduction. Child abductions are 
difficult and complex to deal with when they occur in Canada. 
They become even more difficult when other countries are 
involved.
<P>
	Since 1986 the RCMP's missing children registry, Revenue 
Canada and Citizenship and Immigration Canada, which form our 
missing children initiative, have come together to become a 
powerful force in returning missing children to their homes. This 
partnership has resulted in a significant increase in the recovery 
and safe return of missing children in Canada and abroad.
<P>
	I am pleased to inform the House today on National Child Day 
that the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade is 
joining the RCMP's missing children registry and its partners in 
our missing children initiative.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Along with the Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade in the <I>Our Missing Children </I>program, we are able to trace 
missing and abducted children throughout the world. This 
co-operation is vital to our efforts to ensure the safety of our 
children within their families, in the home and on the streets.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6496"> 6496 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For example, the RCMP's missing children registry, in operation 
since 1986, is a major source of computerized information on 
missing children in Canada. In 1995 alone the registry assisted in 
the safe recovery of almost 400 missing children.
<P>
	With the help of Canada Customs and Immigration, critical 
border points are alerted when a child is reported missing. This 
alert system has reduced the chances of children being taken out of 
the country where their recovery may become much more difficult.
<P>
	With foreign affairs officers in Ottawa and in embassies and 
consulates around the world bringing their considerable expertise 
to this program, Canada has the strongest national system in the 
world to return missing or abducted children to their parents or 
guardians.
<P>
	I must stress however that the government is not alone in this 
partnership. Without the help of private sector partners, police, 
searching agencies and non-government partners, our success rate 
would not be where it is today. In fact, every part of society has an 
important role to play in this partnership.
<P>
	The Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade and 
the our missing children program have prepared a booklet and fact 
sheet to provide the most accurate and current information on what 
to do in cases of child abductions, especially for cases involving 
out of country abductions.
<P>
	Members of Parliament are often the first point of contact when 
constituents do not know where to turn when faced with a problem 
that requires the help of these specialized services. That is why I 
am pleased to inform you, Mr. Speaker, that these information 
documents will be distributed today to all members of the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Together, we can do something to ensure that our children are 
safe at home and elsewhere.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I call on all members of this House to join me in applauding the 
efforts of the men and women of our police, customs, immigration 
and consular services for their daily efforts to combat the problem 
of missing children.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to speak on behalf of the official opposition on this, 
the fourth anniversary of National Child Day. I would like to take a 
few moments to point out that the minister may have been 
requested at the very last minute to speak on this issue in the 
House, but I would like to remind him that every time a minister's 
statement is made with just a few minutes' notice, it is  very hard 
for us to prepare an appropriate response. I just wanted to make the 
minister aware of the situation.
<P>
	Having said this, I want to take this opportunity today to say how 
much the Bloc Quebecois is concerned about this issue.
<P>
	Let me digress for a moment. On this National Child Day, I 
cannot help but think about the thousands and thousands of 
children who live in poverty right here in Quebec and in Canada. It 
is appalling to see such a disturbing number of children go to 
school hungry, unable to learn in suitable conditions.
<P>
	The minister is asking us to address the issue of missing children 
today. Can you for a moment imagine what the parents of missing 
children go through? Can you for a moment imagine all the distress 
these children have to face?
<P>
	If more than 1 million children are sexually abused throughout 
the world every year, how many children have to go through this 
same ordeal right here in Canada? True, the 1989 bill of rights for 
children condemned child sexual abuse, but it ignored its 
international dimension.
<P>
	The Dutroux scandal, in Belgium, gave a graphic example of the 
horror of this situation. Right here in Canada, just a few days ago, 
major pedophile networks on the Internet were dismantled. This 
represents a huge challenge at the legislative level. I think we need 
to develop an appropriate legislative framework to take efficient 
measures in this area.
<P>
	As everyone knows, it is hard to gather evidence against sexual 
tourists, which means that very few of them get convicted.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	We therefore feel that one of the government's priorities should 
be to establish information centres and data banks on victims and 
those exploit them, in order to improve co-operation among 
countries and specialized agencies. We must look for concrete 
solutions to the problem of missing children and those who are 
victims of sexual exploitation.
<P>
	Belgium is not the only country where the justice system fails to 
apprehend dangerous criminals. As the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
said earlier, between 1,500 and 2,000 children are reported missing 
in Canada at any given time. And among these are many complex 
cases of abductions involving other countries, since the children 
are simply taken abroad, where the Canadian government can do 
nothing at all. Canada will therefore have to take a long hard look 
at this situation and act accordingly.
<P>
	We must have mechanisms for tracing Canadian and Quebec 
children who have disappeared abroad. That being said, we can 
only applaud the minister's decision to have his department join the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6497"> 6497 </A></B>
<P>
missing children registry of the RCMP and its partners in the our 
missing children program.
<P>
	As I said just now, we must set up information centres and data 
banks. Since the missing children registry is an important source of 
computer data on missing children in Canada, I think its 
association with the Department of Foreign Affairs cannot be other 
than positive. The next step is to connect with computer data in 
other countries and co-ordinate our activities with these countries. 
Where are we now in that respect? I would like to know.
<P>
	I realize it is always reassuring when the minister is optimistic. I 
am quite prepared to believe him when he says that Canada will 
have the most powerful system in the world to bring missing and 
abducted children back to their parents or guardians.
<P>
	I agree that the program will benefit from expertise provided by 
Foreign Affairs officers in Ottawa and in our embassies and 
consulates. However, abroad, in spite of all the expertise of our best 
officers, Canada cannot act alone. Hence the vital importance of 
the role played by all partners involved, both in the public and 
private sectors.
<P>
	Canada should, for instance, put pressure on those international 
partners who have not yet signed The Hague convention that would 
provide for close co-operation between the judicial and 
administrative authorities of the contracting states.
<P>
	We therefore urge the government to continue to work on all 
these fronts. We must ensure that our collective determination is 
converted into concrete action.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a privilege to be able to speak on national child day on 
behalf of Canada's children.
<P>
	It is not an exaggeration to say that for most Canadians children 
are our greatest and our most precious resource. Children are an 
investment. In the short term they are an investment in dollars and 
cents; in the long term in the very future and success of our country.
<P>
	According to the Canadian Council on Social Development, the 
total monetary cost of raising a child from birth to age 18 is 
$157,000, and that only represents the short term financial 
commitment.
<P>
	One cannot think about the commitment of time and energy or 
the emotional commitment involved in raising children without 
recognizing how important these young people are in our lives. For 
many families they are indeed what makes life worth living. They 
are our future and we want the very best for our children.
<P>
	We commend a good initiative like the attempt to return 
abducted children to their homes, as announced by the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs today.
<P>
	In my riding the threat of unaddressable fears of child abduction 
became only too real just this year. A parent there was faced with 
the reality of having no assurance that a child, under a Canadian 
court order to join a parent overseas, would be returned or could 
return to Canada. As the custodial parent he faced the uncertainty 
of the cruel reality of international child abduction.
<P>
	For the sake of all parents and children in Canada, I urge the 
foreign affairs department to press forward and actively encourage 
all countries to sign on to The Hague convention.
<P>
	The stresses and fragility that exist in families are reflected in 
the tragic statistics of runaways today. Too often these kids run 
from a home barely coping with increasing pressures and they run 
right into situations of danger, abuse and violence.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	Today on national child day we must underline the importance of 
addressing not just the symptoms but the causes of such tragedy.
<P>
	The tragedy in Canada in 1996 is that government policy today is 
constantly working against children and their families. Child 
poverty, which is a reflection of family poverty, has not improved 
under today's tax and spend Liberal government. How can it if 49 
per cent of the average family's income is taken from it in taxes? 
Canadian families need tax relief.
<P>
	Canada's low and middle income families need to keep more of 
their own money that will be used to alleviate their financial 
pressures, money that will be used on behalf of their children.
<P>
	On the weekend we read another report about the tragic increase 
in suicides among Canada's young people. That rate has 
quadrupled in the last three decades. Experts say that one of the 
primary reasons for this increase is hopelessness and fear of the 
future. And that we see in our present economic situation.
<P>
	The unemployment rate is hovering around 10 per cent while it is 
half that in the United States. The government has cut transfers to 
provinces dramatically without offering any substantial strategy for 
securing the access of Canadians to higher education and health 
care over the long term.
<P>
	Despite the fact the government can no longer offer the security 
it once did, this same government refuses to allow Canadian 
families to keep more of their own income so that parents can fill 
this gap by making their own provisions for the security of their 
families and especially their children.
<P>
	Presently there are about 30 federal programs which target 
spending toward children or issues that impact children most. The 
government has never done a substantial evaluation of those 
programs to see if they are producing the desired outcome. Yet its 
philosophy is  simply to create more programs and throw more 
money at the problems.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6498"> 6498 </A></B>
<P>
	What is needed is for Canadian families to keep more of their 
own earnings and use those earnings on behalf of their own 
children.

leave to introduce Bill C-350, an act to provide for a national 
referendum to authorize the government to negotiate terms of 
separation with a province that has voted for separation from 
Canada.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, polls of the participants in the Quebec 
referendum showed that many were unsure what a yes vote meant. 
This government's sole response has been to ask the supreme court 
to rule on a unilateral declaration of independence.
<P>
	I therefore want to table my private member's bill aimed at 
reducing the uncertainties surrounding Quebec's separation by 
spelling out the consequences of a yes vote, including becoming a 
foreign country with resulting loss of rights to travel and work 
freely in Canada and to elect representatives to Parliament.
<P>
	My bill also protects the rights of areas where the majority of 
people vote to remain Canadian. This bill challenges separatists to 
agree on basic rules before any future vote.
<P>
	In the terrible event that 50 per cent plus 1 of Quebecers say they 
want to become a foreign country, my bill requires Parliament to 
authorize a binding national referendum within a year on 
negotiating terms  of separation. My bill would ensure this issue is 
decided by the will of the people and not the decision of the courts.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ)</B> moved that 
the Fourth Report of the Standing Committee on Finance, tabled 
Thursday, October 31, 1996, be concurred in.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing 
Order 43(2), I want to advise the House that my colleagues of the 
official opposition will share their time in two periods of ten 
minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will share my time with the hon. 
member for Saint-Jean.
<P>
	I am happy to discuss the Fourth Report of the Standing 
Committee on Finance, which was submitted on October 31, 1996, 
particularly the dissenting opinion tabled by the official opposition 
in this regard.
<P>
	It is unacceptable that the Liberal majority of the Standing 
Committee on Finance even thought for one moment, after 
analyzing all the arguments for and against federal interference in a 
matter of provincial jurisdiction, to basically recommend that a 
national securities commission, a Canadian securities commission, 
be established.
<P>
	We debated this issue in committee, we received briefs, we 
solicited the views of various parties across Canada, in particular 
the Quebec government, the players in the Quebec securities field, 
and we found that there was a consensus to the effect that a 
Canadian securities commission should not be established, for 
three reasons.
<P>
	First, pursuant to the Constitution Act, 1982, which Quebec 
never signed and was forced to swallow, even against the will of the 
great majority of the members of the National Assembly, the area 
of securities is exclusively under Quebec's jurisdiction. The federal 
government is violating its own Constitution Act. Is this normal?
<P>
	The second reason is that, if the government creates a national 
securities commission, it will cause all the expertise in the area of 
taxation, accounting, portfolio management and stock exchange 
management to move from Montreal to Toronto and also from 
Vancouver to Toronto.
<P>
	If the federal government's vision is to centralize all financial 
activity in Toronto, it must tell us. We need to  know because the 
decision to create this national securities commission would make 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6499"> 6499 </A></B>
<P>
Toronto the financial and securities capital of Canada, to the 
detriment of other regions.
<P>
	In Quebec alone, we are talking about the survival of 15 000 
registered dealers and advisors. We are talking about an annual 
trading volume of 2.9 billion shares. We are talking about $39 
billion worth of shares that are traded each year.
<P>
	It is unacceptable that, because of a decision based on the Liberal 
Party of Canada's bad habit of wanting to centralize everything at 
all cost within the federal government or through federal 
regulation, all that will be abandoned in order to meet the partisan, 
political and incomprehensible objectives of the Liberals. There is 
unanimity in Quebec with regard to the securities sector.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	I would like to quote some excerpts from the five-year report 
tabled by the Quebec government in December 1993 regarding the 
implementation of the Securities Act. It was a Liberal government, 
and the minister responsible for securities was Mrs. Louise Robic, 
a good Liberal without a doubt.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Liberal, yes; but good?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> A true Liberal. That is what I meant to say. 
History will tell if she was good or not.
<P>
	I would like to quote some excerpts from the five-year report 
tabled by Mrs. Robic in 1993. On the topic of federal regulation of 
the securities sector, she said, and I quote: ``Regulation in this 
sector, if it ever comes about, would be completely ill advised for a 
number of reasons, with effectiveness topping the list. It will lead 
to a duplication of rules and monitoring, as well as the inevitable 
increase in administrative and financial costs for issuers, investors 
and brokers. The competitiveness of institutions, their fair 
treatment under regulation, and the quality of monitoring of the 
securities sector would suffer''.
<P>
	This is Mrs. Robic, a Liberal, speaking. She has just told us that 
if the federal government were to interfere in the securities sector, 
it would be completely inappropriate constitutionally, but it would 
also be completely ineffective, because the provinces have already 
developed the expertise, they already have the networks and the 
institutions to manage the securities sector.
<P>
	I have often heard the Minister of Finance come up with ideas so 
ridiculous they verge on the surreal. When he talks to us about the 
Canadian securities commission, Picasso comes to mind, it would 
be so chaotic. And for some time now, we have been getting used to 
this sort of fuzzy thinking from the finance minister.
<P>
	Basically, this is what he said: ``No problem, we will establish a 
Canadian securities commission and if a  province does not want to 
join it, it will keep its own provincial commission and we will have 
our federal commission''. This reasoning is so ridiculous that I 
cannot make head or tail of it.
<P>
	How can you improve efficiency by increasing the number of 
players in an area that is already heavily regulated? How can you 
improve the economic efficiency of sucirities management if you 
add one, two or three players, because there are other institutions 
apart from the Canadian securities commission? How can you 
create certainty and stability, which the securities sector has an 
urgent need of?
<P>
	You know as well as I do that the financial community is very 
sensitive to any sudden change. So you can imagine how the 
financial community will react if faced with two players in Quebec: 
a Canadian securities commission and a Quebec securities 
commission. The financial community would no longer know 
where it stands. With whom would it deal? Faced with two 
contradictory decisions regarding an application to issue shares, 
which one would they accept?
<P>
	Everything the government is doing will increase inefficiency, 
bickering and court challenges.
<P>
	The only winners in such a situation, sadly, would be lawyers 
because the establishment of a Canadian commission would create 
a mess.
<P>
	Speaking about a consensus in Quebec, recently the Commission 
sur le travail et l'économie of the Quebec government took a close 
look at the future of the securities industry. One of its mandates 
was to evaluate the appropriateness of the federal plan to establish 
a Canadian securities commission.
<P>
	Some very serious and qualified experts on securities came 
before the commission, and every one of them voiced opposition to 
the establishment of such a Canadian securities commission. The 
president of the Montreal Exchange said no, as well as the 
president of the Commission des valeurs mobilières du Québec.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	The representatives of the Barreau du Québec said no. The 
Mouvement Desjardins said no. Ogilvy Renault said no. The 
Investment Dealers Association of Canada questioned the 
appropriateness of establishing such a commission, as did various 
groups, such as the Investors Group.
<P>
	Recently, to the great embarrassement of the Minister of 
Finance, in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> or in the <I>Financial Post</I>-I think it 
was in the latter-some players in Ontario and in British Columbia 
also voiced their opposition to the establishment of a Canadian 
Securities Commission. What a blow.
<P>
	There are no two ways about it, since the speech from the throne, 
the Minister of Finance has repeatedly said that there is a broad 
consensus in Canada for establishing  such a commission. That is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6500"> 6500 </A></B>
<P>
not true. The minister or his advisers are ill informed, very much 
so. Nobody wants this Canadian securities commission.
<P>
	Why? Because the decision to establish one would be totally 
illogical. Provinces have total jurisdiction over this area and are 
used to working together, without the tutorship of the federal 
government, without the paternalistic attitude of a federal Liberal 
government. They have improved relations, they have improved 
SEDAR, which stands for System for Electronic Document 
Analysis and Retrieval.
<P>
	They have improved and continue to improve the system so that 
someone issuing securities in Canada does not have to file three 
different prospectuses, one in Vancouver, one in Toronto and one in 
Montreal. With this improved system, only one prospectus will be 
automatically issued from coast to coast. This would increase 
efficiency, instead of adding another player.
<P>
	Above all, what needs to be said on this is that the federal 
government should mind its own business. If it had done so in the 
last three years, our tax losses would not add up to $9 billion. 
Because of the federal government's indulgence, all Canadian 
taxpayers had to pay higher taxes to make up for this $9 billion in 
lost revenue.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I thank you for allowing me to participate in the 
debate on this issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Bloc 
Quebecois finance critic has very eloquently just stated the 
government's motivations for creating a new Canadian securities 
commission.
<P>
	This raises the same old debate. Later on I will ask him to 
elaborate on this. The Bloc Quebecois has always called for an end 
to administrative duplication. The federal government claimed it 
was willing to look for ways to reduce duplication. This time, 
however, there is no duplication.
<P>
	In Quebec, we have our own securities commission. The federal 
government has decided, according to its own logic, to create a 
Canadian securities commission, thus creating a duplication which 
did not exist before. The federal government will then say: ``Since 
we agree that duplication should be avoided, the solution would be 
to eliminate the Quebec Securities Commission. Since duplication 
is to be avoided, there should be only one commission''.
<P>
	This is what the federal government's centralizing policy is all 
about. This is what will happen. Whenever there is duplication, the 
province, especially Quebec, is asked to withdraw from this area of 
jurisdiction, and duplication is created where there was none 
before. Then the federal government tries to justify its action by 
saying that the province should withdraw in order to avoid 
duplication.
<P>
	I believe this is a red herring, and we join with the official 
opposition critic in demanding that the federal government 
withdraw from this area of provincial jurisdiction. I would like my 
colleague to add something on this matter, if time permits.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, the member 
for Joliette, for his excellent comments and his remarkable analysis 
and I also want to congratulate him for his speaking skills.
<P>
	You are quite right dear colleague. How peculiar it is that 
whenever the federal government talks about eliminating 
duplication, overlap and inefficiency, it never looks in its own back 
yard, but always in the provinces' back yards.
<P>
	It is quite amazing. On the one hand, it creates inefficiency. On 
the other hand, it says that we, as sovereignists, should respect the 
Canadian Constitution, but it does not even do so itself. In 1982, 
when the Prime Minister imposed the Canadian Constitution on 
Quebec, the present Prime Minister was there. He was one of those 
who forced Quebec to accept this unacceptable Constitution.
<P>
	He tells us we should respect the Constitution, but when the time 
comes for him to respect the jurisdictions stated in that 
Constitution, he pays no attention whatsoever to it. Double 
standards. Whenever it suits him, he goes ahead, and when it does 
not, he puts aside all his beliefs and his constitutional convictions.
<P>
	As I said earlier, it seems the government is annoyed whenever 
the provinces agree on something and live in harmony, whenever 
they implement a sophisticated system, which is constantly 
improving, an efficient protocol for the issuance of securities.
<P>
	It seems the federal government does not like that and feels it has 
to interfere. But when it does, the quarrelling goes on. It is easy to 
understand. If things are so wrong, if it is so hard for us to agree in 
so many areas, very often it is not our fault. It is often due to 
provocation from the other side. We were used to a system which 
constantly provoked Quebec, something that is still going on under 
this Prime Minister, who was an important player in 1970 and 
1980, one of those who forced Quebec to fall back into line.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, first of 
all, I would like to congratulate my colleagues from La Prairie, 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot and Trois-Rivières. As you know, being 
the Indian affairs critic, I am not well-versed in economic matters. 
Having read the dissenting opinion of my colleagues, I told myself 
that I had to speak on this issue. That is why I asked my 
parliamentary leader to put my name on the list.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6501"> 6501 </A></B>
<P>
	The first thing I must say, after reading the dissenting report 
and seeing what the finance minister was getting at-and I take 
over from my colleague from Joliette-is that the federal 
government is once again intruding in areas of provincial 
jurisdiction, especially in Quebec.
<P>
	Members on the other side of the House say all kinds of things 
and use all kinds of words to redefine the Canadian Confederation. 
They are constantly talking about decentralization and using many 
terms like ``flexible federalism''. These fine words are inconsistent 
with their proposals.
<P>
	It seems to me that the federal government is once again being 
inconsistent because it is promoting a certain decentralization, a 
certain flexibility, while at the same time advocating the creation of 
a national commission that would oversee all other securities 
commissions. Naturally, that was quite obvious to me right from 
the beginning.
<P>
	What the finance minister is suggesting, with the support of his 
government colleagues on the Standing Committee on Finance, is 
that the federal government take over some of what the Quebec 
securities commission is doing in Montreal. As you know, this 
commission is located in Montreal. I believe this is another attack 
against the great city of Montreal. Montreal is already grappling 
with many problems. Some of them were pointed out in 
discussions, speeches and questions.
<P>
	We notice, among other things, that the unemployment rate is 
always higher in Montreal than anywhere else in Quebec and in 
Canada. Montreal has become the capital of unemployment. 
Finally, the minister's proposal would aggravate the 
unemployment problem by transferring to Toronto the financial 
resources associated with securities.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	This is unacceptable. The poverty rate is also quite high in 
Montreal. This is terrible. The waiting lines at food banks are 
getting longer and longer and the only thing the minister does is try 
to cripple a provincial commission located in Montreal, in the 
Province of Quebec. What city stands to benefit? Toronto.
<P>
	Naturally, Toronto is always chosen for the establishment of a 
national securities commission. We in the Bloc Quebecois must 
oppose this measure proposed by the finance minister.
<P>
	I was telling you that it is an important economic lever for 
Montreal. Here are some statistics that prove it. The Quebec 
Securities Commission means 120 permanent jobs in Montreal, 
15,000 registered brokers and advisers, an $8 million annual 
budget, and the issuance of some 1,570 prospectuses and visas per 
year. Moreover, $2.9 billion in shares and $39 billion in securities 
were traded there in 1995.
<P>
	One can easily understand our eagerness to stand up for 
provincial securities commissions, including the Quebec 
commission. We often hear about Quebec's financial and other 
resources being siphoned off in favour of large municipalities, of 
major centres like Toronto, and of Ontario, but this is not the first 
time we are being unfairly treated.
<P>
	We have often denounced injustices in research and 
development. The situation is the same. It is the same thing for 
National Defence. I keep reminding the House that, in the case of 
armoured vehicles, the minister unilaterally decided to give the 
whole contract to London, Ontario, while Oerlikon, which is 
located in Quebec and which is a centre of excellence for turrets, 
got absolutely nothing.
<P>
	Contracts are very often awarded directly to Ontario companies 
as well as to western concerns, but rarely to Quebec companies. 
Quebecers never get the equivalent of what they contribute as 
regards these lines of activity.
<P>
	The same goes for Public Works Canada. We mention it 
regularly. There are hundreds of millions of dollars that should go 
to Quebec but are allocated elsewhere in Canada. The minister 
keeps following the same pattern, which is to yield to the pressures 
of Toronto's major financiers, even though he is from Quebec. It is 
sad to see that he approves this measure, which will undermine 
Quebec's efforts and those of its securities commission.
<P>
	The minister uses an argument which I find somewhat fallacious 
when he says: ``Listen, if provincial securities commissions want 
to remain in place, so be it. Let them remain in place''. However, 
we know that the national commission will take precedence over 
any other securities commission. This will result in an exodus of 
financial advisers and brokers, who will all move to Toronto. This 
is why I think the government's argument is fallacious.
<P>
	We will definitely not let the federal government interfere in a 
field that comes under Quebec's jurisdiction, and we will do our 
utmost to make sure this does not happen. The Minister of Finance 
should commit himself to other pursuits than trying to drain off 
Quebec's own resources.
<P>
	My colleague from Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot has tabled an 
excellent paper on corporate taxation. I find it abnormal that the 
middle class and the disadvantaged are always the ones who have 
to foot the bill in Canada. There are 29 large corporations that pay 
only 6.5 per cent tax on their profits. Normally, the rate should be 
much higher. They should play a part in putting government 
finances on a healthier footing. However, it is always the same 
people who end up paying: the disadvantaged through cuts and the 
middle class through excessive taxes.
<P>
	Also, they rarely talk about closing the tax loopholes enjoyed by 
high income earners. These people continue to take advantage of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6502"> 6502 </A></B>
<P>
loopholes, and those making over $100,000 often shirk their 
responsibilities.
<P>
	As for family trusts, the Minister was slow in tackling this 
problem. Can we believe today that he has solved it? I doubt it very 
much.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	Instead of going after performing Quebec institutions like the 
Commission des valeurs mobilières du Québec, the minister should 
tackle the real problem, that of taxpayers who still use loopholes in 
the tax system, of companies that still escape paying taxes, and of 
family trusts that are still in existence. The finance minister 
himself has admitted he has a family trust, so he does not want to 
touch that, but the middle class and the underprivileged are still the 
ones who foot the bill.
<P>
	I wish to move an adjournment motion. I move, seconded by the 
hon. member for Laval Centre:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House do now adjourn.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the 
motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those in favour of the motion will 
please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those opposed will please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> In my opinion the yeas have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Call in the members.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<I>Before the taking of the vote:</I>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Frazer:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point order. It may be my military 
background but I do believe that we should abide by dress 
regulations. I believe we have a member in the House who is 
improperly dressed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Without forcing the poor Speaker to have 
to go down every row, the member might indicate who is the 
improperly dressed member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Frazer:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member for Davenport.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, my eyes can barely see but I 
gather that the member for Davenport is not wearing a tie. There is 
a ruling, surprising as it may sound to a number of members, that a 
member not wearing a tie is not in fact entitled to vote. Nobody 
gets  thrown out but the member for Davenport accordingly will not 
be able to vote.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Cohen:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like some clarification. I am 
not wearing a tie. Will I be entitled to vote?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Yes. With my having three daughters, you 
are putting the Speaker in a very bad position. In fact, I think the 
unfortunate answer is that if a member is of one gender she does 
not need to wear a tie, but the other gender does.
<P>
	Somebody can challenge that or take an action for a declaratory 
judgment in one of the courts.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the member for Medicine Hat be now heard.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The motion is not debatable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Mr. Speaker, you called debate and since we are 
going back to debate, the opposition had its turn and it is now our 
turn. You should have recognized the parliamentary secretary to the 
House leader.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> Mr. Speaker, all members of this House know that 
there is no list of speakers and that the first member to stand up is 
the one who gets to speak. No one stood up on the government 
majority side. I recognized and saw it was indeed a Reform 
member who stood up.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> Mr. Speaker, I humbly submit to you that you may 
remember I did stand and I was recognized on debate. You 
indicated that under a point of order it would not be appropriate to 
move a motion so you moved to debate. When you moved to 
debate, I stood and you recognized me. I was about to speak on 
debate. You then took a motion on a point of order which you said 
was not appropriate when I had done it. Therefore, I would submit 
to you, Sir, that I am on debate and I have the floor. I respectfully 
request the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would ask that you call the 
question on the motion that I put forward.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, this will seem like Greek to 
many people. In fact what happened, the parliamentary secretary 
quite correctly points out that he was recognized on debate. He was 
not able to move the motion on a point of order. In fact, there is 
only one motion that can be made on a point of order and that is the 
motion that was made by the member for St. Albert.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6504"> 6504 </A></B>

<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> He did.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair did not hear him say a single 
word. Because he had not spoken, the motion put on a point of 
order by the member for St. Albert is in order. Accordingly, we will 
now have to vote on that motion.
<P>
	Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sorry to be a nuisance, but I 
came in late. I would not want you to think ill of me. This is the 
first time this has happened since I have been in the House, but I 
did not feel well. I was feeling weak. I apologize, Mr. Speaker.

	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I wonder if you 
would find agreement from the parties that we now would take the 
deferred divisions on Bill C-66, the Canada Labour Code, and Bill 
C-42, the Reform amendment on the Judges Act.

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
question of privilege.
<P>
	I feel that my parliamentary privileges are in the process of 
being breached, notwithstanding this afternoon. It is a serious 
question of privilege. Mr. Speaker, I have not been able to give you 
the normal advance notice of one hour, but we have to raise these 
issues at the first available opportunity, and that is now.
<P>
	I have been advised that tomorrow members of Parliament will 
not be given a copy of the report by the royal commission on 
aboriginal affairs. It will be given to the press, to the media, but not 
to members of Parliament.
<P>
	The royal commission was created by this House and therefore I 
would ask the government to ensure that all parliamentarians have 
access to that report.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would submit to you that this is not a point of order or a question of 
privilege but in fact is total fabrication and speculation at this time.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I think the hon. member will appreciate 
the word inchoate. It will not happen until tomorrow. If the matter 
does not happen tomorrow, as he indicates, please let the Chair 
know.

	The House resumed from November 19 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-66, an act to amend the Canada Labour Code 
(Part I) and the Corporations and Labour Unions Returns Act and to 
make consequential amendments to other acts, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The House will now proceed to the taking 
of the deferred recorded division on Bill C-66.

propose that you seek unanimous consent that members who voted 
on the previous motion-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kilger:</B> If it is helpful to the House, it is the government's 
intention that after we have dealt with the recorded divisions we 
would move to private members' hour. We are only trying to 
facilitate everyone's work here. There are committees still pending 
and while members are here I thought we could possibly be 
efficient and effective by taking the recorded divisions now, 
moving to private members' hour after.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think applying the votes may work. 
We will have to be careful because there was voting in different 
parties in different ways, but we can apply the vote as long as that is 
taken into account.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EXPORTOFARMS">EXPORT OF ARMS</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider the 
advisability of amending Canada's system of arms export controls by requiring that 
export permits for military products be granted only after the Department of Foreign 
Affairs has conducted and tabled in the House of Commons a Security Impact 
Assessment determining that the proposed export will enhance international security.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I rise today to ask the House to support 
Motion No. 290 which calls on the government to consider 
improving Canada's regime for controlling arms exports. I am 
proposing that the government should be required to determine that 
a particular export of military equipment would improve 
international security and table that security impact assessment in 
the House of Commons before granting an export permit.
<P>
	This motion addresses the continuing threat that the international 
arms trade poses to international security over so much of the 
developing world. The persistence of the trade in arms at 
unacceptable levels in the aftermath of the cold war is creating a 
residual harvest of death that must not be overlooked in the sigh of 
relief that comes from not being as close as we were for years to the 
nuclear abyss. The arms trade today is fueled both by the hangover 
of the cold war and by the unabated addiction of the developed 
economies to the economic spin-offs of military spending.
<P>
	The hangover is the need to get rid of stockpiles of outdated 
weapons and equipment while retrieving some economic benefit. 
In Canada we have seen this aspect of the problem in the 
government's attempts to peddle Canada's fleet of CF-5s, first to 
Namibia and now reportedly to the Philippines through some 
American broker that wants to barter the planes for a gold mine.
<P>
	Elsewhere, as highlighted recently in a Veterans Against Nuclear 
Arms newsletter, the American government has recently sold off 
large quantities of inventoried advanced weaponry to more than 60 
countries at bargain basement prices, worsening arms races 
between Turkey and Greece, Israel and Egypt and Chile and 
Argentina.
<P>
	Equally ominous, the Russian arms industry is reported by the 
International Institute for Strategic Studies to be accumulating 
large stockpiles of military equipment and supplies that were 
ordered by the Russian armed forces but for which the Russian 
state is now in no position to pay.
<P>
	The arms industries resist the shrinkage of military spending in 
the wake of the cold war through attempts to persuade governments 
they still need the ``baroque arsenals'' of the cold war, to borrow a 
term from the prominent British disarmament expert, Mary Kaldor, 
or that they need to continue to invest large sums of money in R and 
D for new weapons.
<P>
	They also resist the shrinkage in their opportunities by 
cultivating new markets in developing countries. In a report 
released earlier this month, the International Institute for Strategic 
Studies has shown that the post-cold war decline in the 
international arms trade has reversed this year as arms suppliers 
eagerly seek out growing markets in the Middle East financed by 
rising oil prices and in east Asia, where there is a nascent arms race 
beginning to spiral into dangerous proportions.
<P>
	As Oscar Arias, Nobel peace prize winner and former president 
of Costa Rica, has recently pointed out, there is something perverse 
in the fact that the five permanent members of the security council 
who are supposed to be promoting peace are also the five largest 
arms exporters and hence promoters of war and insecurity.
<P>
<B>(1750 )</B>
<P>
	In Canada, we certainly conform to the perverse trend that Arias 
points out. There seems to be little indication of a fundamental 
rethinking of Canadian security policy. At the same time, as 
reported in recent issues of the <I>Ploughshares Monitor</I>, Canadian 
exports to non-NATO countries are going up with aggressive 
marketing in the east Asian region.
<P>
	Potentially the most dangerous component in the cold war's 
harvest of death is the continued threat posed by the existence of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6509"> 6509 </A></B>
<P>
stockpiles of nuclear weapons and weapons grade nuclear material. 
Our cautious optimism about the steps taken recently toward a 
comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty should not lead us to 
underestimate the scale of the dangers that will persist until the 
nuclear genie is put back in the bottle.
<P>
	There is the environmental problem of storing plutonium which 
remains highly toxic for thousands of years, a problem that directly 
affects Canada because the Liberal government has expressed 
support for the idea of burning the world's weapons grade 
plutonium in Candu reactors and presumably burying the waste 
somewhere in the Canadian shield.
<P>
	There is the possibility of nuclear terrorism, either through the 
theft of a nuclear weapon or through the construction of a nuclear 
device by a terrorist organization or rogue state.
<P>
	I found Walter Lequeur's conclusion in a recent article in 
<I>Foreign Affairs</I> that such an event, far from a remote possibility, 
was better described as ``apocolyse soon'', to be highly unsettling. 
Not to mention that if Candus in Canada begin to use plutonium it 
will only be a matter of time before other Candu possessing 
countries argue that they too could have access to plutonium, with 
all the danger that such a development would involve for nuclear 
weapons proliferation.
<P>
	The Liberal government's decision to go ahead with the sale of a 
Candu reactor to China, with no environmental assessment or 
public consultation, and in the full knowledge of China's 
willingness to help some countries develop a nuclear capability, 
gives Canada little moral authority to preach to the world about 
nuclear responsibility.
<P>
	The flourishing of the arms trade and the persistence of the 
nuclear threat, despite the end of the cold war, has been a matter of 
immense disappointment, if not surprise, to those who thought that 
there were grounds for optimism at the end of the cold war in 1989.
<P>
	For one thing, the collapse of the communist regimes came 
about in large part as a result of the mobilizing of popular 
democratic movements. If people power could bring down the 
military industrial complex in the east there was the prospect that 
the much more developed democracies could so in the west, 
especially since the military contest which had legitimized 
grotesque levels of public expenditures on the military had 
disappeared.
<P>
	There were, therefore, high expectations that the end of the cold 
war could bring a large peace dividend to the former contestants in 
the cold war and to the international community at large. Military 
budgets could be greatly reduced and public spending could be 
redirected to more socially useful ends. International assistance 
could be given over entirely to legitimate development programs 
rather than military assistance.
<P>
	This optimism rested on the assumption that with the end of the 
cold war and its horrifyingly surreal definition of international 
security as residing in the nuclear balance of terror, it would open 
up some political space for an authentic conception of international 
security as residing in the elimination of poverty, respect for the 
environment, respect for basic human and political rights and the 
notion of common security as opposed to collective security based 
on nuclear terror.
<P>
	Governments could spend on international development and 
engage constructively in the political development of many 
developing societies as a way of achieving genuine international 
security rather than propping up authoritarian regimes as cold war 
stooges and militarizing their regional conflicts.
<P>
	This assumption has not proved true. In the first place, the 
madness of the nuclear arms race and balance of terror has not 
given way to the hoped for conception of common security based 
on strengthening the international community through poverty 
reduction and environmental protection. It has instead been 
replaced by a vision of international society in some powerful 
circles which attaches no meaning or value to the international 
community at all, and which prefers a world where the U.S. plays 
the role of global policemen picking and choosing what merits 
intervention and concern. The jobs can sometimes be contracted 
out to countries like Canada as long as there are no vital strategic 
interests at stake.
<P>
	In this dominant, neo-liberal vision of the world as a giant, 
unified marketplace, a playground for the few hundred 
multinationals that dominate international trade and where states 
are increasingly becoming marginal actors, the idea of common 
security is as scarce as the idea of the common good.
<P>
	Globalization usually figures centrally in criticisms of the drift 
of the world economy. However, it must also be of great concern to 
those concerned about international conflict and the arms trade.
<P>
	The proponents of globalization offer no prescription for the 
deep poverty and social and institutional underdevelopment of so 
many societies rooted in the accelerated polarization that is taking 
place as the market becomes the only forum for the international 
community. The resulting poverty and environmental degradation 
will be the main source of international conflict in the coming 
years.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	A second danger posed by globalization is the complete absence 
of a moral compass for public policy generally and foreign and 
defence policy particularly. The growth of the notion that states do 
not have responsibilities that may interfere with the commercial 
interests of companies has led to the neutering of the state as a 
morally proactive agent in the arms trade as in so many other areas 
of public policy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6510"> 6510 </A></B>
<P>
	When the president of the Aerospace Industries Association of 
Canada says, as quoted in the June issue of the <I>Ploughshares 
Monitor</I> that ``it is not for those who manufacture or assemble 
weapons to grapple with the moral issue of who the arms should 
or should not be sold to'', we are not surprised.
<P>
	However, it is outrageous for the Liberal government to adopt 
such a position. When the Minister of Industry says, quoting again 
the same issue of the <I>Ploughshares Monitor</I>, that ``We need to 
recognize that there are and always will be conflicts-that we have 
Canadian defence firms with expertise, we have Canadians who are 
employed in these businesses, and we want them to succeed''. 
When we hear that kind of quote we know that the moral handicap 
which I talked about is now epidemic and metastasizing throughout 
the body politic.
<P>
	The ethos of globalization has not offered a new vision of 
international security. It not only offers no solutions to the 
development problems that fuel international conflict and hence 
the arms trade, it offers no moral regime in the context of which 
governments could regulate the arms trade, which like all other 
human endeavours in the dominant market paradigm is seen as a 
market opportunity rather than as an ethical challenge.
<P>
	Let me now turn to the particular problems of Canadian 
involvement in the international arms trade and propose a way 
forward to meet the challenges of developing a responsible public 
policy in response to the arms trade.
<P>
	The Canadian defence industry is, according to the 1995 report 
of the United States Arms Control and Disarmament Agent, the 
10th largest exporter in the world. Since the end of the cold war it 
has experienced a loss of American orders and has become 
proportionately more dependent on Canadian government orders. 
However, it has managed to catch the international trend and 
capture a growing export market in non-NATO countries.
<P>
	One of the defining characteristics of Canadian exports is its role 
as a supplier of parts and components to American suppliers, a trait 
that led a recent <I>Ploughshares Monitor</I> article to label the Canadian 
industry as a bit player.
<P>
	These exports are unregulated and unreported, making it 
difficult to trace the end user of parts. This has not stopped others 
from reporting on how often Canadian exports end up in the hands 
of regimes with appalling human rights records or who are engaged 
in destabilizing defence policies.
<P>
	It also means that the policy decisions about where our military 
exports should be permitted is handed over to the Americans, not a 
very reassuring situation. When the Pentagon advises the Clinton 
administration, as it recently has, to lift the ban on exporting high 
technology weapons to Latin America, Canada becomes a silent  
partner to such a disastrous policy. To allow Latin American 
militaries access to high tech weapons threatens to turn back the 
clock on the process of democratization. It will reinvigorate the 
military establishments, whose past excesses are contained only 
under very fragile truces with civilian authorities in many Latin 
American societies, and will siphon moneys badly needed for 
social development into the sinkhole of growing military budgets.
<P>
	What needs to be done to improve this situation? At the most 
fundamental level, Canadians need to insist on at least a little 
intellectual consistency in Canadian defence and foreign policy 
from the Liberal government.
<P>
	The government cannot take a leading role in the movement to 
abolish anti-personnel mines, a commendable course of action, and 
turn a blind eye to the export of arms or components through 
American intermediaries to human rights abusers.
<P>
	The government cannot take pride in the peacekeeping 
operations of the Canadian Armed Forces and at the same time 
allow Canadian arms exporters to supply arms to the same local 
conflicts which the peacekeepers might be sent to address.
<P>
	Look at Canadian military exports to Turkey, which totalled 
close to $26 million from the years 1990 to 1993, and may include 
a potential sale of CF-5s to the Turkish air force. Why should a 
government that otherwise professes to be seeking a peaceful 
solution to the conflict between Turkey and Greece, or the Turkish 
government and the Kurdish community in Turkey for that matter, 
be arming the Turkish government?
<P>
<B>(1800 )</B>
<P>
	The same could be said of the dramatic cuts in Canadian 
development assistance under the Liberals. They are part of the 
international trend to abandon the poorest of the poor to the 
mercies of the global market, a policy which will only engender 
more international and civil conflict and the need for even more 
peacekeeping missions.
<P>
	You should not boast of your skills as a firefighter if in your 
spare time you are an arsonist, or at the very least play a lot with 
matches.
<P>
	The motion I am putting forward today is a proposal for a 
concrete improvement to the Canadian regime for arms export 
controls. It is inspired by Ernie Regehr's proposal published 
recently in the <I>Ploughshare's Monitor</I>.
<P>
	The proposal set out in the motion would require the government 
to prepare a security impact assessment before granting any export 
permit. It would have to table the report in the House of Commons. 
This measure would bring two major improvements to the current 
regime.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6511"> 6511 </A></B>
<P>
	First, it would place an onus on the government to show not 
only that the receiving party met certain standards of not being 
on a particular blacklist of sanctioned states, but the government 
would have to demonstrate that a particular export would enhance 
international security. This would force the government to pause 
before allowing an export to a country or region that might 
otherwise have an acceptable bill of health in terms of human 
rights performance or not being in a particular conflict at the 
present time but which in any case could be destabilized by an 
emerging arms race.
<P>
	For instance, the government would be forced to demonstrate 
how particular arms exports to east Asia or the Middle East, where 
destabilizing arms races are now escalating, would serve the 
interests of regional or global security.
<P>
	The second benefit would of course be increased transparency, a 
chronic problem in the international arms trade which is habitually 
conducted under the table. The tabling of the security impact 
assessment in the House of Commons would in itself add to the 
transparency of this secretive trade. Greater transparency will in 
and of itself assist in the task of building responsible behaviour in 
the arms industry.
<P>
	This proposal is not of course the only improvement needed to 
our public policies on arms exports. One of the main problems 
remains the export of components to American manufacturers of 
weapons systems and other military equipment. Because there is no 
export control or even reporting at all for the export of arms or 
components to the United States, Canadians have no way of 
knowing who the end users of Canadian exports are, or more to the 
point, who is killed or terrorized by such weapons and by whom. 
Without some regime to bring this problem under control, 
Canadians remain in the hands of American policy makers for the 
moral decisions about to whom lethal instruments made in Canada 
should be sold. Clearly this is not an acceptable situation.
<P>
	This motion, had it been chosen to be votable and debated and 
voted on, would have been an opportunity for the House of 
Commons to have expressed itself on what I regard as a morally 
urgent matter. Unfortunately it was not so chosen, so we only have 
this hour of debate before us today and we are not really in a 
position to seek unanimous consent for the passage of the motion at 
this time.
<P>
	I hope this might be one small step toward moving the 
government in this direction. I recall when the Liberals were in 
opposition many suggestions were put forward in the spirit of this 
private member's motion, in particular by the member who is now 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs for the Liberal government.
<P>
	I am hoping for a sympathetic hearing from the government on 
this. It is an opportunity to follow up on the goodwill created by the 
government through its actions with respect to the banning of 
anti-personnel land  mines. If that stands alone, if it is not followed
<P>
up by meaningful action on the arms trade, then certainly the 
community within Canada which concerns itself with the arms 
trade will not be deceived. It will not think that the government's 
actions will suffice if the government does not go beyond the land 
mines strategy which it has now and seeks to do something about 
something we can do right here in Canada now.
<P>
	We do not have to wait for an international consensus on how 
Canada regulates its exports of arms. This is something we can do 
ourselves. The Minister of Foreign Affairs is very good at creating 
international discussions. He is very good at creating the image of 
something being done or something about to be done. We wish him 
well in all that.
<P>
	However here in our own backyard, here in our own regime with 
respect to how we regulate the export of arms, the government can 
act now. It could have acted today by facilitating the passage of this 
motion. Certainly many Canadians are with me at this time in 
hoping that the government will soon act on this issue.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I welcome 
the opportunity to participate in the debate on the motion of the 
member for Winnipeg-Transcona.
<P>
	We share his concern for the need to reduce global arms and the 
need to prevent as much as possible arms from entering the hands 
of people in countries that systematically abuse human rights and 
which use the arms to terrorize populations, and to proceed on the 
whole scale of the arms reduction agenda. However, the proposal of 
my hon. colleague would make major alterations to Canada's 
export control system. I remind the House that Canada's export 
control system is already one of the strictest in the world.
<P>
	Also our government is constantly reviewing regulatory 
restrictions such as export controls and making adjustments when 
needed to ensure that we maintain the strictest possible system. I 
would like to explain to the House what makes our system of 
military export controls the strictest in the world.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canada was one of the first countries to set precise criteria for 
arms export permits. It remains one of the few countries to include 
the respect of human rights among its criteria. We played a lead 
role in this, setting an example for other countries.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our criteria enable us to: protect the national security of Canada 
and its allies; abide by all UN economic sanctions; avoid situations 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6512"> 6512 </A></B>
<P>
involving hostilities or threat of hostilities; and take into 
consideration the human rights conditions of the recipient country, 
including the  possibility of goods proposed for export being 
involved in cases of human rights abuse.
<P>
	Last June 18 the Minister of Foreign Affairs addressed the House 
on this very issue. He reaffirmed his commitment to strict, tough 
controls. In fact he told the House that he had further tightened the 
implementation of export permitting to ensure that Canada's 
policies were fully met.
<P>
	The new measures put in place in 1996 include more rigorous 
analyses of security issues and threats of hostilities, fully 
considering (a) the regional stability and security relationships; (b) 
relations between neighbouring states; and (c) internal conflicts 
such as civil wars. Also included is a stricter interpretation of 
human rights criteria, including increased requirements of end use 
assurances to minimize the risk that Canadian equipment would 
fall into the hands of those who might use it to abuse human rights. 
They also include even stricter controls where firearms are 
concerned, including examining the gun control laws and practices 
in recipient countries to satisfy ourselves that Canadian firearms 
would not slip into the illegal arms trade or fuel local lawlessness 
or violence.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canada's export control system includes one other aspect which 
makes it one of the world's best. I refer to its transparency. Every 
year we issue a detailed report of our military exports to countries 
other than the United States, and have done so since 1990. This 
report shows the value of our military exports in 21 separate 
categories of goods for each country except the U.S.
<P>
	Canada was one of the first to be in favour of such detailed 
reports and played a significant role in creating the U.N. Register 
of Conventional Arms in 1992. Today, we are taking further steps 
toward ensuring better compliance with reporting requirements by 
all countries, as well as the exchange of more detailed information 
in this area.
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In its level of detail, Canada's annual report on military exports 
goes far beyond the public reporting done by even our closest 
friends and allies internationally.
<P>
	Most Canadian made military goods go to the U.S. under 
defence production sharing agreements which date back to the 
second world war. Of the rest, over 87 per cent support close allies 
in NATO and those with whom we have defence research, 
production and security arrangements, such as those on the 
so-called automatic firearm country control list.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It seems to me that Canada, however modest its role, is already 
highly successful in supporting its allies where  security is 
concerned, while severely curtailing its exports in situations which 
might give rise to strategic concerns of one kind or another. In 
addition, by declaring our exports, both large and small, we are 
demonstrating more transparency than any other country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Our government has worked tirelessly for peace, international 
security, and to support social development. We will continue to do 
so.
<P>
	I would like the House to note the following Canadian 
initiatives: to bring about a worldwide ban of antipersonnel land 
mines, which is currently gathering very good momentum 
internationally; to gain world recognition of the problem of 
excessive military spending in some less developed countries that 
might leave little public funding for education, health and other 
social needs.
<P>
	There is the initiative to help found a new export control regime. 
The Wassenaar arrangement is dedicated to increasing 
responsibility and transparency in conventional arms, an 
organization that for the first time embraces former cold war 
adversaries and new industrial economies in Asia and Latin 
America.
<P>
	Another initiative is to direct large proportions of our 
development assistance expenditure to building institutions that 
promote human rights and democratic development, including a 
free media and civil policing.
<P>
	This government has taken an extremely active role 
internationally in peace building, in conventional arms control and 
in ensuring that Canadian military trade is conducted at the highest 
level of responsibility and transparency, a model for the rest of the 
world. We will continue to expand these efforts and will keep 
looking at ways to update and enhance our export control systems 
to ensure they fully adhere to Canadian values of international 
peace and security.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity today to speak to Motion M-290 
presented by the hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona.
<P>
	If the Canadian government were to agree to make export 
permits for military goods conditional on a security impact 
assessment, there is no doubt that military goods produced in 
Canada could no longer be used for inhuman and immoral 
purposes.
<P>
	This motion could make a vital difference to many people who 
today are suffering the horrors of war, a war that is often, too often, 
waged with weapons produced here in Canada.
<P>
	The last review of the current legislation, the Export and Import 
Permits Act, dates back to September 1986, when the Conservative 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6513"> 6513 </A></B>
<P>
Party was in power. One wonders why this policy has not been 
revised and amended for  more than ten years, although the world 
situation has changed considerably during that time. Consider, for 
instance, the fall of the Berlin wall, the breakup of the former 
Soviet Union and of course the drastic shift in the geopolitical 
balance.
<P>
	Does the Liberal government truly believe that this legislation 
does not have to be adjusted to the current situation? Actually, a 
praiseworthy attempt was made in 1992. At the time, the Standing 
Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade had 
appointed a sub-committee to examine more specifically the issue 
of arms exports.
<P>
	This study produced some 20 recommendations which are now, 
unfortunately, gathering dust. This is because the Conservative 
government at the time decided that arms export controls were 
already strict enough and it was unnecessary to tighten up the 
regulations. The most troubling aspect here is that the current 
Minister of Foreign Affairs was among those who signed this 
report.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	Furthermore, in a speech he had noted that Canada was moving 
more and more towards a peacekeeping role. Arguing in favour of a 
much tougher control register that would contain a list of the 
countries to which Canadian arms were sold, the present minister 
said this: ``We want to make sure there is a system in which there 
could be a clear requirement that exports would only go to 
countries on the list and that there would be a transparency to that 
list so we would know who they are. We want to make sure that it 
would not be decided inside the bowels of External Affairs and all 
of a sudden an announcement would be made and before anything 
could be done it would be over. Furthermore, and it is a very 
important principle, we felt it crucial that Parliament should have a 
role and that the elected representatives of the people of Canada 
should be given some opportunity to determine whether we want to 
sell arms to country A or country B. Therefore, there is a 
requirement for tabling the name of any country that would go on 
this list to be reviewed by Parliament if we so decided''.
<P>
	The current minister concluded by saying: ``The point of the 
matter is that we believed it was time for Canada to take some 
leadership''. You will agree with me that, if the current Minister of 
Foreign Affairs wants to be consistent with the position he held 
when he was the opposition's critic on foreign affairs, he has no 
choice but to support Motion M-290.
<P>
	The official opposition, that is the Bloc Quebecois, believes the 
Liberal government is once again using double talk. Indeed, it 
announces, in an official speech, that it is calling for restrictions 
and for the non-proliferation of weapons considered to be a source 
of instability but, at the same time, it refuses to tighten controls 
over exports of Canadian military products.
<P>
	In a speech delivered in June, when the sixth annual report on 
Canada's military exports was tabled, the minister said he would
<P>
tighten exports of military products even more. How can we 
believe the minister considering that, so far, there has been no 
concrete proof of any tighter control. There is no conclusive 
evidence that measures were actually taken by the government 
since that speech.
<P>
	Will the minister give us concrete guarantees about the measures 
he truly wants to implement? We even read in the newspapers that 
the OECD was going to hold an international symposium in Canada 
next winter, and that several studies were planned as background 
papers for discussion about stepping up control of sales of arms to 
third world countries.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois thinks it would be ridiculous if these studies 
served only for discussion purposes. Action is long overdue. With 
each passing day, more innocent people die, too often women and 
children, killed by these arms, which have been bought by dictators 
or militia bent on imposing their rule by force.
<P>
	Canada has, or should have, enough political maturity that it can 
now stop producing studies on this issue. It has now reached the 
stage where it should be able to take action.
<P>
	Why does the government not simply take the opportunity of the 
upcoming symposium to table and have adopted, during a House of 
Commons debate, a new policy on arms export control. It could 
then show leadership by proving to all participating countries that 
it is possible to implement a law that has teeth but that also has a 
moral component, something which is too often missing in today's 
world.
<P>
	Recent events in Haiti, Rwanda, Burundi, Zaire and Afghanistan 
show once again how true it is that military products can be used 
for the wrong reasons.
<P>
	It is distressing to see how the western world too often forgets 
the use to which these arms can be put. We read yesterday in the 
newspapers that, just between April and July 1994, a British 
company sold $7.3 million worth of arms to Rwanda. Now we 
know to what use they were put.
<P>
	What is the Canadian government waiting for to take, without 
further delay, the lead of the international community and 
introduce tougher regulations on arms sale to very unstable parts of 
the world?
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	I repeat, the Minister of Foreign Affairs would waste no time 
taking action if he acted in a way that is consistent with what he 
said in 1993, and I will quote him again: ``We must do a better job 
than we are doing to give a message to the world that the 
proliferation of arms must come to a halt. That is the reason for the 
recommendation to have a much tougher munitions control 
register. It was designed to say that we would not be party tosending arms to any area, region or country in which there are
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6514"> 6514 </A></B>
<P>
human rights abuses, civil conflict, or dictatorships using those 
arms to suppress people or create violence or conflict''.
<P>
	However, Canada has knowingly sold arms to countries where 
respect for human rights is no more than an illusion. The 
Vancouver <I>Sun</I> reported last September that Ottawa had approved 
sales of military equipment to Indonesia for a total estimated at 
more than $362 million. This, although it is common acknowledge 
that Indonesia has occupied East Timor for more than 20 years and 
that more than 200,000 Timorese have been killed.
<P>
	As far as China is concerned, Canada has apparently sold more 
than $50 million worth of military goods to that country in the past 
three years. Does the minister really believe that the Chinese 
government would never use those arms against opponents to the 
regime or against the Tibetan people who are now under Chinese 
occupation?
<P>
	Yes, the Bloc Quebecois supports this motion and believes that 
the motion presented by the hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona 
is a sensible one and should be an incentive for the Canadian 
government to review the Export and Import Permits Act. We hope 
that the Liberal government will be of the same opinion, even if all 
it can say is trade, trade, trade, in the process forgetting about the 
most elementary notions of human rights.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
a privilege to speak to Motion No. 290, the motion proposed by the 
member for Winnipeg Transcona dealing with military exports.
<P>
	The motion has been read already, but for the benefit of those 
just joining us I would like to read it again. It is quite a mouthful:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider the 
advisability of amending Canada's system of arms export controls by requiring that 
export permits for military products be granted only after the Department of Foreign 
Affairs has conducted and tabled in the House of Commons a security impact 
assessment determining that the proposed export will enhance international security.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I suppose my concern is whether there is a demonstrated need for 
what the hon. member is proposing. I question whether there is.
<P>
	I would like to approach this question by comparing the motion 
to what the process is for export permits currently. Presently every 
exporter of a military product must apply to the Departments of 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade for an export permit. The 
procedure is handled by the export's control division of the 
department and takes anywhere from a few days to a few  weeks. 
The division consults with other areas of the department such as the 
geographic region to which the sale is being proposed and the 
Canadian embassy in that country. It also consults with other 
interested government departments such as the Department of 
Industry and the Department of National Defence.
<P>
	The consultation process, from the information I have received, 
is a fairly careful one. It is done in such a way as to protect the 
commercial confidentiality of the proposed sale. Making this 
process public in any way could result in the loss of that sale not 
only to another Canadian company but to a foreign competitor.
<P>
	If there were public money involved, if this were a crown 
corporation, maybe the need for that type of transparency would be 
necessary, but we are talking about private companies here.
<P>
	I am not sure what information the member for Winnipeg 
Transcona intends to be divulged when a security impact 
assessment is tabled in the House of Commons. After being tabled 
in the House of Commons, such an assessment would be part of the 
public record. It would be information out there for any competitor 
to use.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	Even after sales have taken place the department has been 
careful to group all sales into categories. This is done so that 
precise information regarding the product and destination cannot 
be linked back to one particular company. This has to do with 
commercial confidentiality.
<P>
	I have often had problems dealing with the department's hiding 
behind a veil of commercial confidentiality, but this particular case 
involves Canadian companies that are not receiving export 
subsidies on credit, unlike some of the ones that we have going 
through organizations like the Export Development Corporation. 
This is one of the ways in which the motion differs substantially 
from what is occurring presently, and I have not heard anything this 
evening which would justify making company information public.
<P>
	Another way that this motion differs from the present procedure 
is the objective of the security impact assessment. The motion 
states that the assessment should determine that the export will 
enhance international security. The consultation which presently 
takes place only establishes that the sale will do no harm and will 
not have any negative impact.
<P>
	We need to examine what we are exporting. Our military exports 
are mostly in the area of parts and components for aircraft vehicles 
and electronic equipment. We sell things like aircraft simulators 
and landing gear for military aircraft. We are careful not to sell 
military goods and technology to certain types of countries. For 
instance, we do not sell to countries which pose a threat to Canada 
or to our allies. We do not sell to countries involved in or under 
threat of hostilities. We  do not sell to countries under UN security 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6515"> 6515 </A></B>
<P>
council sanction. Furthermore, we do not sell to countries whose 
governments have a persistent record of serious human rights 
abuses. We are attempting to determine what an export sale will not 
do in terms of harming. Therefore I believe we have met the 
qualifications necessary.
<P>
	I am not convinced there is a demonstrated need for flipping the 
criteria on their head and asking that it be proven that the sale will 
actually enhance international security. I would assume that many 
of the companies that produce military parts, components and 
technology for export are also furthering Canada's capabilities in 
producing goods and technology for civilian use. This is often the 
case. As long as our military exports are doing no harm, I believe 
their production and sale should be allowed to continue in the 
present format.
<P>
	The Minister of Foreign Affairs, in a speech delivered on June 18 
of this year, stated that Canada's controls are among the toughest in 
the world. We have heard that stated a couple of times this 
afternoon. Nonetheless, he said that he was tightening up the 
controls further to ensure that exports did not end up in the wrong 
hands and were not used for unacceptable purposes. He instructed 
his officials to carry out more rigorous analyses of the regional, 
international and internal security situations of the countries where 
these exports were destined. Furthermore, we are applying a 
stricter interpretation of human rights criteria. We are also 
exercising strict controls to ensure that Canadian firearms do not 
end up in the illicit arms trade and that they do not fuel local 
violence.
<P>
	Some people might argue that there is no need to be selling 
military parts or exporting them at all. I would make the case that 
many of these military exports that Canada develops and sells end 
up in things like CF-18 jets which Canada buys back from the 
United States. We use those jets to enhance our internal security. 
We use those jets as part of our NATO forces and NORAD forces to 
deliver security in regions such as Bosnia, Somalia and areas where 
Canada is asked to be police persons for the world. We could make 
the argument that these military parts which are being developed 
and exported actually enhance world security and Canada's 
security.
<P>
	I want to deal for a moment with the ironic situation which we 
heard about this evening from the hon. member for Winnipeg 
Transcona as well as the hon. member for Verchères. They talked 
about what the position of the present Minister of Foreign Affairs 
was when he was the critic for the Liberals when they were in 
opposition. They said that he has certainly flip-flopped on his 
position. I believe he has probably discovered, in much the same 
way the Liberals did when they opposed free trade in opposition, 
that now that they are in power it is a pretty good deal for the 
country. I believe they found in this area of security for the export 
of military  parts that things are not as bad as they seem. We have a 
pretty fair process in place and unless there is a demonstrated need 
to change it, it should not be changed.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	Like most Canadians, I want to ensure that our military exports 
are not destroying property or injuring people. I believe that our 
government's export permit system balances the need to ensure 
that our military goods and technology do not end up in the wrong 
hands while protecting the commercial confidentiality of our 
companies and allowing them to advance their capabilities and 
know how. There needs to be a much stronger demonstration of this 
balance before that can be undone.
<P>
	I would be the first one to say that if that need can be 
demonstrated, that Canada should review this and have a more 
open process and have it reported to the House of Commons, if that 
need can be demonstrated, we would fully support it. But I do not 
believe the case has been made here this evening by the 
presentation that I have heard that would cause us to look at this 
and change the system. I would invite the members who have 
brought this forward that if they can show us convincing evidence 
otherwise, we would be prepared to have another look at it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, our government shares the concern of the member 
for Winnipeg Transcona about peace and international security.
<P>
	As my colleague for Cape Breton Highlands-Canso has 
outlined, we have taken many concrete steps in this direction. We 
have also taken our responsibilities very seriously to ensure that 
Canadian military exports are helpful in supporting our allies and 
do not fall into the hands of those bent on disrupting peace and 
security in other parts of the world.
<P>
	I would like to take a few moments to outline for this House 
some of the steps that are taken behind the scenes to fully meet this 
commitment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	All applications for arms export permits, unless they involve 
NATO countries or a few other similar countries, are subject to an 
exacting consultation process within the department and with other 
departments. This primarily involves assessments of each specific 
situation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Officials look at a range of factors affecting international and 
internal peace and security. First of all, are the goods in question of 
similar, lower or higher technological level than the recipient 
country already has? This closely helps determine whether a sale 
would have a destabilizing affect on a region.
<P>
	Would the goods help the recipient contribute positively to 
security arrangements in the region in question or to existing or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6516"> 6516 </A></B>
<P>
planned UN peacekeeping activities? Are there any risks that the 
goods proposed for export would threaten any UN or other peace 
efforts in or near the recipient country or any Canadian or friendly 
military peacekeeping or humanitarian effort?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These assessments are made by the Department of National 
Defence and the Regional Security and Peacekeeping Division of 
the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, in 
conjunction with some of the geographical divisions. This averts 
any risk of diversion or deception concerning use or final 
destination.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As this House can see, we take our responsibility to protect 
peace very seriously. A second part of this same process is our 
strict policy against military sales to countries with less than 
perfect human rights records as well. In the area of human rights, 
the Department of Foreign Affairs human rights division and the 
country desks with their political, economic and social 
development experts perform a thorough analysis. They look at 
annual reports prepared by our embassies abroad on the human 
rights performance of each country for the proceeding year, 
including areas of deterioration as well as improvements.
<P>
	They look at reports from such eminent international human 
rights watchdogs as Amnesty International, the UN human rights 
commission as well as reports received from like minded 
governments including the U.S. They look at, on a country by 
country basis, reports of Canadian and foreign based 
non-governmental organization offering factual or anecdotal 
information on human rights conditions in different countries.
<P>
	They also look at concrete steps being undertaken by the 
Canadian government and by Canadian NGOs to improve the 
country's democratic and good governance institutions such a free 
press, democratic political institutions and an independent 
judiciary and civil police force.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Together, these elements give us a good idea of the human rights 
and security situation virtually anywhere in the world. If any doubt 
persists, because our information is incomplete or contradictory, 
our embassies investigate and report back to us. All of this is done 
prior to any recommendation concerning an application for an arms 
export permit. What is more, when the proposed recipient is a 
country with a potential for strategic concerns, the Minister of 
External Affairs himself looks at the situation in detail and decides 
whether to issue the permit or to deny it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It can be seen that we already undertake a lengthy procedure to 
vet military exports. It is difficult to see how the member's 
proposal would enhance this analysis and scrutiny, but it is quite 
easy to see that the proposal would make a good system 
unworkable and make export control permits subject to unrealistic 
criteria. How could one possibly prove that a given export would 
enhance international security?
<P>
	I think it is worth noting the common misconception that 
military exports are all arms or lethal weapons that figure centrally 
in conflict. Nothing could be further from the truth.
<P>
	Canadian so-called military exports are made up almost 
completely of parts and components, electronic elements, repair 
and overhaul and protective and support systems.
<P>
	Let me provide the House with a few illustrations. Canada is one 
of the world's foremost manufacturers and suppliers of bomb 
disposal suits and helmets used for disarming terrorist bombs and 
dangerous anti-personnel land mines. We also make and export to 
many countries bullet proof clothing and armour plating often to 
protect civilians.
<P>
	Canada's aerospace industry is composed mainly of repair and 
overhaul and electronic subsystem manufacturers. We make no 
combat military aircraft in Canada at all. Yet aerospace makes up 
roughly 70 per cent of Canada's defence exports.
<P>
	What else do we make and export? Devices to help land 
helicopters on to the heaving decks of ships at sea and radios and 
optical sights and flight simulators and even pellets used for target 
practice. Though misnamed as arms, these Canadian defence goods 
are vital to supporting Canada's own armed forces and to pulling 
our fair share internationally in our military alliances with the U.S. 
and NATO. The companies that make these goods also employ a lot 
of Canadians, between 60,000 and 80,000 directly and indirectly, 
independent studies tell us.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our government is committed to peacebuilding and 
peacekeeping. Also, through various positive measures, we have 
encouraged the Canadian defence industry, including the aerospace 
sector, to gradually convert to civilian uses. Our initiatives in this 
respect were designed to maintain quality and highly paid jobs in 
Canada, while doing everything we could to support the conversion 
of goods and services in the areas of aviation, transportation and 
telecommunications to commercial uses.
<P>
	The technological partnership program announced last year by 
my colleague, the Minister of Industry, ensures that the risks 
associated with research and development are shared with the 
industry, especially where businesses convert to new civilian 
applications.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6517"> 6517 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Canadian government is taking all responsible steps to 
prevent Canadian made military goods from being sold to 
destinations and end users that threaten peace and security 
internationally. In fact, our current level of in depth study and 
analysis is equal to any in the world. But we are doing more. We are 
supporting industry in its efforts to strengthen the civil commercial 
side of its business when converting from traditional military 
production and in this way retaining companies, jobs and 
invaluable high technologies in Canada.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TAXATION">TAXATION</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, on 
November 4 I asked the finance minister if he was aware of the fact 
that thousands of jobs in the Atlantic provinces are in jeopardy 
because of his harmonized sales tax.
<P>
	The minister responded by saying that retailers will be able to 
take advantage of the input tax credit. Their costs would be lower 
and they would be in a position to pass their savings on to 
consumers.
<P>
	Contrary to what the minister has stated, retailers will not pass 
along any savings to consumers because there are no savings to be 
had. Jobs are already being lost.
<P>
	Today in my local paper in Saint John, New Brunswick, the 
MMG Management Group which operates Greenberg and MetMart 
stores announced the closure of 12 stores and the loss of 150 jobs as 
a direct result of the HST in New Brunswick. Seventy-nine people 
have been told that they will be laid off and the stores closed by the 
end of 1996, that is at the end of next month.
<P>
	MMG's New Brunswick stores face over $1 million in annual 
costs to accommodate the harmonization. The input tax credit the 
minister spoke of amounts to $495,000 but this still leaves the 
company with a shortfall of $563,000.
<P>
	The HST is nothing more than a blatant attempt by our present 
government to fulfil an election promise. I have to say that the only 
reason it went through was because of the three Liberal premiers in 
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland. None of the 
other provinces have agreed to this.
<P>
	It is not good for Atlantic Canada and puts the three Atlantic 
provinces out of sync with the rest of Canada. It is being forced on 
us to pad the Liberal version of a red book promise kept.
<P>
	Under the agreement New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and 
Newfoundland must include or hide the 15 per cent HST in the 
ticket price of the item, known as in-pricing. However in the rest of 
Canada the provincial sales tax and the GST must still be added at 
the cash register.
<P>
	The incentive for New Brunswick was a $364 million pay-off 
which the province has already received from the federal 
government despite an April 1 deadline for harmonization. This 
money already is being used by the provincial government and this 
was their incentive to sign this agreement.
<P>
	The main problem is the patchwork approach to harmonization. 
The retail sector came here to see me. The Retail Council of 
Canada representing Sears, Eaton's, Canadian Tire, Shoppers Drug 
Mart and Hudson's Bay has stated these stores can operate with a 
single rate sales tax system either tax inclusive or tax extra across 
Canada. The retailers cannot manage a tax inclusive in a partially 
harmonized system.
<P>
	A report prepared by Ernst and Young for the Retail Council of 
Canada makes reference to the Department of Finance 
announcement of April 23. The announcement promised that 
partial harmonization would bring about a simpler tax system for 
both consumers and business, lower costs and less paper work. 
Further it promised harmonization will also help lower prices 
through a reduction in the cost of doing business.
<P>
	The retailers state the exact opposite will happen. The system 
will not be simple and the costs will increase. The software used by 
many companies will have to be altered to accommodate the 
regionalized pricing system and in the six major retailers this 
means changing over 132 software systems.
<P>
	All of those retailers rely on catalogues and their catalogue 
business will now be forced to print an English and French 
catalogue for New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and 
then an English and French catalogue for central Canada and the 
western provinces. National TV and radio advertising will also cost 
more. The Ernst and Young report states that the annual cost to 
retailers in the harmonized provinces is expected to be in excess of 
$100 million. I have to ask what all this means to the consumer. It 
means that we will pay more. Why? In order to remain profitable, 
businesses and retailers must recover their conversion expenses.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	The pride of this government is going to cost Atlantic Canadians 
dearly. It will hit us in our wallets and it will-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The hon. 
member's time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her 
question. Hon. members will know that Canadians have expressed 
a strong preference to know the full price of goods and services in 
advance of making their purchases.
<P>
	I had the privilege of travelling with the finance committee on 
the GST consultation. If there was one refrain we heard from one 
end of the country to the other it was: ``We want to know what 
things are going to cost. We don't want sticker shock, counter 
shock''.
<P>
	Tax inclusive pricing under the harmonized sales tax agreement 
with the three Atlantic provinces responds directly to the 
preference that has been expressed by Canadians across this 
country.
<P>
	With tax inclusive pricing consumers in New Brunswick, Nova 
Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador will know before they get to 
the cash register what their intended purchases will actually cost, 
and as such they will make better informed purchasing decisions.
<P>
	As noted in the HST technical paper-
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Wayne:</B> They're going to close the stores.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Madam Speaker, I am responding to the hon. 
member's question. I did not interrupt as she asked her question, 
tempted though I was. I would ask her to respect the answer.
<P>
	As noted in the HST technical paper, beginning April 7, 1997, 
businesses in the three provinces will be required to price their 
products on a tax inclusive basis. The participating governments 
have consulted extensively with business in this respect and 
recognize it will require some operational adjustments. 
Accordingly, rules have been developed that will minimize 
disruption for business while still addressing the desires of 
consumers.
<P>
	That being said, we must bear in mind that removing embedded 
provincial sales tax from business inputs and moving to a single 
administration will entail significant economic benefits for 
businesses in the participating provinces, benefits which they can 
pass on to consumers.
<P>
	The participating governments believe consumers will benefit 
which is why they have moved to tax inclusive pricing.
<P>

	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The motion to 
adjourn the House is now deemed adopted. Accordingly, this 
House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to
