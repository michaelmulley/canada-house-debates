<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from October 27 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-54, an act to support and promote electronic commerce 
by protecting personal information that is collected, used or 
disclosed in certain circumstances, by providing for the use of 
electronic means to communicate or record information or 
transactions and by amending the Canada Evidence Act, the 
Statutory Instruments Act and the Statute Revision Act, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
have this opportunity to speak to Bill C-54, the personal 
information protection and electronic documents act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to modernizing federal legislation for the digital 
age and building the environment for electronic commerce to 
flourish, this act also addresses one very particular need in the 
information society in which we now live:  the right of 
individuals to have some control over their personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rapid development of information and communications 
technology such as the Internet has brought about new 
opportunities for individuals, businesses, communities and 
governments.  But to realize those opportunities there are some 
challenges that must be resolved.  One of the most significant of 
these is the issue of privacy and the protection of personal 
information.  New technologies provide new capabilities to 
collect and manage personal data.  Canadians want to be confident 
that any information concerning themselves is accurate, up to 
date and, most importantly, secure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-54 provides that assurance and much more.  It will make 
private sector organizations responsible for the security and 
accuracy of the personal information they collect.  For federal 
statutes it will introduce a degree of equivalency between 
electronic and paper formats and improve the ability of the 
federal government to conduct its business electronically.  An 
opting out process would allow government bodies sufficient time 
to prepare for the impact of updating and re-engineering their 
business functions for the age of the Internet.  It will assist 
the courts in evaluating the reliability of electronic records 
presented as evidence and it will give official status to 
electronic statutes and regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically regarding security, the legislation proposes ways 
to remove legal roadblocks to using electronic technology as a 
secure option for doing business with the federal government.  It 
contains provisions for the development of secure electronic 
signatures for people doing business with the federal government. 
These will provide a model for electronic commerce in general. It 
will make federally regulated private sector organizations 
responsible for the security and accuracy of the personal 
information they collect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions of the act for privacy protection are based on 
the model code for the protection of personal information which 
was developed by the Canadian Standards Association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as exemplary as this code is, it has been voluntary. 
Now we are enshrining its principles in law and we are making 
significant improvements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be successful any legislation regime which safeguards 
personal information must provide effective oversight and 
enforcement, and foster awareness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As other hon. members have noted in previous debates, Bill C-54 
is the result of a great deal of broadly based consultations.  In 
those consultations Canadians made their point over and over 
again that individuals must have the right to launch complaints 
and to challenge an organization when they think its compliance 
with protection requirements has been inadequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation before us gives individuals the right to 
complain and to challenge compliance with any part of the law. 
Thus it affords Canadians a key role in monitoring the 
organizations which hold personal information about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The private sector also has an extremely important role to play. 
There was strong agreement in the consultations that businesses 
should take an active role in monitoring their own practices and 
should co-operate with consumers in resolving problems.  The 
first step in a normal complaint process should involve an 
individual complaining to the organization. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1010"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The organization should then look into the complaint and attempt 
to resolve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, Bill C-54 makes organizations accountable for the 
information they collect, use or disclose. Furthermore, it 
requires that organizations put in place procedures to receive 
and respond to complaints or inquiries about their information 
policies and practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, an individual might not always be able to obtain 
satisfaction through the organization.  In such cases there must 
be a second avenue for redress.  This legislation provides that 
avenue.  Throughout the government's consultations Canadians 
expressed broad support for giving the Privacy Commissioner of 
Canada the authority to investigate complaints, issue 
recommendations, mediate disputes and conduct research on issues 
related to the implementation of the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-54 individuals will be able to complain to the 
commissioner regarding any aspect of an organization's compliance 
with the legislation, including improper collection and use or 
disclosure of personal information.  The commissioner may also 
initiate complaints if there are reasonable grounds to do so. 
The commissioner will have the power necessary to investigate 
complaints, including the ability to enter the premises of any 
organization, examine any records, administer oaths and interview 
an organization's staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, as part of the complaint resolution process the 
commissioner may suggest mediation or other forms of dispute 
resolution.  When an investigation has been completed the 
commissioner will provide a report outlining the findings of the 
investigation together with any recommendations the commissioner 
deems appropriate to both the individual and the organization. 
The commissioner may follow up to ensure that the organization 
deals with the identified issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our consultations consumers indicated that it was important 
that the legislation provide a watchdog who can ensure that the 
law is being respected.  When the commissioner has reasonable 
grounds to believe that an organization is not complying with the 
law the legislation gives the privacy commissioner the power to 
conduct audits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumers and businesses have also made clear their view that 
legislation to protect privacy in the private sector will be most 
effective if it includes measures to address emerging privacy 
issues proactively through consumer education.  The government 
agrees that consumer education is absolutely key to ensuring that 
citizens are well informed about their privacy rights and are 
vigilant in protecting them.  Therefore, the legislation gives 
the privacy commissioner an explicit mandate to educate the 
public.  It also gives the commissioner powers to research and 
comment on any issues that affect the privacy of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These various powers of the privacy commissioner are designed to 
ensure compliance with the law and to give consumers somewhere to 
turn when there is a problem.  The commissioner will also serve 
as an important source of expertise and advice for organizations 
that are trying to comply with the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian citizens and consumers are rightly asking that personal 
information be adequately protected in the new digital economy. 
Experience has shown that industry self-regulation has not been 
up to the task.  As a result, international data laws have to be 
developed that might restrict the flow of information to 
countries with inadequate privacy protection standards.  With 
this legislation the government has done so, with privacy 
protection that will be simple yet effective, consumer friendly 
and not overly burdensome for the industry, especially for small 
and medium size firms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is made in Canada legislation that strikes the right balance 
for our conditions and it will help ensure that technological 
innovations will be able to serve our economic needs while not 
infringing on our fundamental rights.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  On debate, the hon. member for 
Edmonton—Strathcona. 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House as the industry critic 
to address Bill C-54. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of those who have just joined the debate, Bill 
C-54 is an act to support and promote electronic commerce by 
protecting personal information that is collected, used or 
disclosed in certain circumstances, by providing for the use of 
electronic means to communicate or record information or 
transactions and by amending the Canada Evidence Act, the 
Statutory Instruments Act and the Statute Revision Act. The bill 
is referred to as the personal information protection and 
electronic documents act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is part of Industry Canada's broad and ambitious plan 
to create a legal, regulatory and tax regime in which electronic 
commerce will flourish. It is fair to say that under the 
direction of the Minister of Industry, Canada has become a world 
leader in electronic commerce, at least as far as public policy 
is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the case of big brother in Industry Canada going 
high tech.  The specific purpose of Bill C-54 is to create a 
legal and regulatory framework for electronic commerce by 
introducing measures to protect personal information in the 
private sector by creating an electronic alternative for doing 
business with the federal government and by clarifying how the 
courts assess the reliability of electronic records used as 
evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports in principle the government's efforts 
to create a legal and regulatory framework to allow legitimate 
electronic commerce to flourish which is why we are supporting 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it should be understood by all members of this House 
and by the public that Bill C-54 goes beyond the scope of 
electronic commerce in that it creates a legal and regulatory 
framework that will be applied broadly to the commercial use of 
sensitive and private information in all areas of business. When 
this bill is examined more closely in committee, it must be 
examined with this in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-54 will also work to replace electronic documents on the 
same legal footing as paper documents.  As part of this endeavour 
to bring legal legitimacy to the electronic business world, the 
government has empowered itself to regulate the concept of secure 
electronic signatures through the use of encryption.  This is a 
necessary part of the bill but I would caution the government to 
work with the private sector as it deals with the issue of 
encryption every day when providing security of data to its 
clients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must whenever possible borrow from the work being done in the 
private sector and whenever possible allow these industries to 
regulate themselves.  Private sector co-operation and 
self-regulation should guide us as we examine the issue of 
electronic commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was created in co-operation with the private sector 
which speaks to the quality of the legislation and which is why 
my concerns are limited.  However, when this bill is discussed in 
committee, there are issues we must be aware of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Direct Marketing Association supports Bill C-54, 
while warning that any amendments that would change the rules 
governing positive consent should be examined carefully as they 
have the potential of creating a business environment that is 
unduly restrictive for direct marketers.  In essence, the CDMA 
argues that there is often implied consent for the use of 
personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provision in the bill allowing for implied consent ensures 
that once private information is lawfully acquired it can be used 
repeatedly by the same company unless the consumers instruct 
otherwise. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1020"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT4"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT4"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1020

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If direct positive consent were required before information 
lawfully collected is used, it would be cumbersome and would hurt 
the direct marketing industry. Furthermore, the direct marketing 
industry would prefer that a greater reliance be placed on 
negative consent.  That is, customers would be given an 
opportunity to remove sensitive personal information from lists 
before those lists were used or sold.  However, if they chose not 
to take this action, the direct marketer with impunity could then 
use the information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also some debate regarding the use of information 
collected by the government but then made part of the public 
record.  If only the government can use this information in a 
commercial manner, namely by selling it to private sector 
businesses, it amounts to unfair government competition for 
information trading, which is a large part of what many direct 
marketers do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has very recently created legislation that 
brought positive changes to the direct marketing operations, 
changes that were supported by the CDMA.  We should be cautious 
to ensure that this work is not undermined by a subsequent piece 
of legislation that may hurt this industry if we do not act 
judiciously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to bring to the attention of the House the 
concerns put forward by the Canadian Medical Association. 
Physicians are very concerned about their ability to protect the 
confidential information of patients who confide in them.  In 
response to this, the CMA has created the Health Information 
Privacy Code which it hopes will become a standard for the 
medical profession. This is an example of industry 
self-regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also brings forward a very serious concern regarding the 
patient-doctor relationship. We do not want to create legislation 
that will create blanket policies for electronic privacy 
protection when there are clearly different needs in different 
sectors of the economy calling for different policy solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports limited government and free 
enterprise, but recognizes the important role of government in 
creating an economic climate in Canada with fair and transparent 
rules that protect both consumers and business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is well within the proper function of government to create a 
legal and regulatory framework to allow electronic commerce to 
flourish in Canada.  For this reason Bill C-54 should be 
supported. However, care must be taken at the committee stage to 
ensure that concerns put forward by the Canadian Medical 
Association, the Canadian Direct Marketing Association and others 
are addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close by encouraging the government to continue to make 
electronic commerce a priority and to work to create a regulatory 
environment that stabilizes trade but that does not become a 
barrier to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also encourage the government to pursue taxation policy 
that encourages businesses to take their operations into the 
electronic business world.  If this happens, I am confident 
Canada will become a leader in electronic commerce.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great pleasure that I rise this morning to speak on Bill C-54 as 
one who had close ties with the communications industry during 
15 years. I was involved in broadcast media at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout this period, I had an opportunity to witness changes 
as they occurred: the arrival of fax machines, satellite dishes, 
computers and, finally, the Internet. All these changes have 
always served the public at large, the general public, well. 
However, a closer look at electronic commerce and this 
technology that is increasingly becoming a part of our daily 
lives raises concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the millennium approaches, in this era of communications, 
with communications occupying an ever-increasing place in our 
lives, the federal government has deemed it appropriate to 
legislate in this very complex area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give a little background on Bill C-54, an act to 
support and promote electronic commerce. The purpose of this 
legislation is to support and promote electronic commerce. How? 
The title goes on to say: by protecting personal information 
that is collected, used or disclosed in certain circumstances, 
by providing for the use of electronic means to communicate or 
record information or transactions and by amending certain acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, Quebec is at the cutting edge, since it has had 
legislation protecting personal information in the private 
sector for four years now. Bill C-54 introduced by the federal 
government deals only with commerce. 
It does not extend to any other activity and has some serious 
deficiencies.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In its 1997-98 annual report, the Quebec access to information 
commission is unequivocal on the issue of privacy on the 
information highway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission examined the consequences of introducing 
Canada-wide standards and legal principles regarding privacy on 
the information highway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the terms of a proposal submitted to the ministers 
responsible for setting up this highway, this protection will be 
based on the voluntary code of practice developed by the 
Canadian Standards Association, and adopted in 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the commission's contention that, if implemented, this 
proposal would represent a setback for the privacy issue in 
Quebec.  This contention is based on a comprehensive review of 
the CSA code. There is good reason to be pleased with the 
Canadian industry adopting such a code. This marks quite a 
breakthrough, stemming from an interesting analysis of the OECD 
guidelines on protection of personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the CSA code does not meet the objectives of the 
personal information protection systems established under the 
two Quebec laws, namely to guarantee all citizens an impartial 
and fair solution to any problem or dispute that may arise with 
regard to the protection of this increasingly important aspect 
of one's privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the Commission suggested to the Quebec Minister of 
Culture and Communications that she remind her counterparts that 
Quebec has such a statutory system in place.  According to the 
Commission, the Quebec system is the only response to the 
challenges of the information highway that respects the rights 
of citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Discussions of e-commerce become a little complicated.  First of 
all, for the benefit of this House I am going to use general, 
easy to understand terms. 
We are talking about making purchases or conducting transactions 
with banks, with suppliers, with manufacturers, or with clients 
electronically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These types of transactions have been in existence for quite 
some time. Telecommunications have been with us for 30 years or 
so. They have been relatively well structured in terms of 
standards for 25 years. As for electronic data interchange, it 
has been governed by international standards for more than 10 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, electronic data interchange is used relatively often by 
many businesses. 
For the past 10 years or so, large businesses have been using it 
in their dealings with suppliers. This means that a supplier 
does not send a written bill to his client, but rather an 
electronic bill that is received on the computer of the client, 
who will then authorize payment after verifying that the goods 
or services have actually been delivered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what is happening in this era of communications is an 
acceleration of this process. Electronic data interchange is no 
longer restricted to large corporations or governments. It is 
now accessible to the average person through the Internet, among 
other means. The Internet is becoming increasingly popular at 
home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to discuss into greater detail how this government is 
once again getting involved in issues that are under Quebec's 
jurisdiction. 
The bill introduced by the Minister of Industry to protect 
personal information was of course anxiously awaited. It is, as 
the federal privacy commissioner pointed out, the most 
significant step taken to protect personal information since 
1983. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, instead of introducing a real bill to protect privacy 
in the private sector, in a technological world that challenges 
this fundamental right, the government, through its Minister of 
Industry, is proposing this weak legislation, whose fundamental 
part is found in a schedule to the bill, and in which the 
commissioner does not have real powers. 
The wording lends itself to a broad interpretation.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, when this government wants to get involved in areas 
of provincial jurisdiction, it always goes for a broad 
interpretation, so that it can justify its actions to the 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context, there is a risk that Bill C-54 may infringe on 
the privacy rights of Quebeckers. This bill may not meet the 
expectations of Canadian and Quebec consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the Minister of Industry is introducing a bill which, 
on the face of it, seems to provide less protection than in the 
federal public sector. 
Whereas, at the moment, harmonization of legislation on the 
subject across the country seems to be an important criterion in 
ensuring constant protection of personal information, it might 
be reasonable to expect the government to draw on the 
experiences of Quebec in protecting personal information.  It 
has had a law for four years. Not so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois regrets that the government has chosen not to 
give the privacy commission power to issue orders.  This lack of 
power, which currently prevents him from fulfilling his 
responsibilities in the public sector, should have been remedied 
in proper form in the bill before us.  This shortcoming will 
affect the bill's credibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois fears that these weaknesses in the bill will 
make the Prime Minister's objective of promoting consumer 
confidence in order to develop electronic trade unattainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is no surprise.  The Bloc Quebecois is sure the government 
will not give the privacy commissioner the resources he needs to 
do the additional work given him in the bill.  The copyright 
board, a body making quasi-judicial decisions, had no increase in 
its resources following the passage of Bill C-32, which doubled 
its workload. Today, the Minister of Industry is obliging it to 
examine the cost recovery formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another method frequently used by our friends opposite. 
The government hands out responsibilities, but not the resources 
or the money to fulfil them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, this means, very clearly, that the Bloc Quebecois 
does not support Bill C-54 as drafted.  The minister should go 
back to the drawing board and look much more carefully at the 
importance of personal information.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to join with my hon. colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois to 
strongly condemn Bill C-54, the Personal Information Protection 
and Electronic Documents Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill does not accomplish what it set out to do, which is to 
protect citizens. Instead of a bill to really protect privacy in 
the private sector, in a technological environment that puts 
this fundamental right at risk, let us examine what the minister 
is proposing in this piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a flimsy and confused piece of legislation whose central 
feature is a schedule containing the Canadian Standards 
Association code without changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation grants huge discretionary powers to the 
governor in council, but none whatsoever to the privacy 
commissioner; it focuses on e-commerce and places the fundamental 
notion of privacy on the back burner; it ignores the unique 
experience of Quebec in the area of protecting privacy in the 
private sector; finally, it could undermine the legislation in 
effect in the province of Quebec.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before dealing directly with the shortcomings of the bill before 
us today, I would like to talk about the central concept of this 
bill, which is privacy, and to examine it in the Canadian and 
Quebec legislative context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The right to privacy is a human right just like the right to 
equality and justice. 
The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which 
is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year and to which 
Canada is a signatory, specifies that “Everyone has the right to 
life, liberty and security of person” and that “No one shall be 
subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, 
home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and 
reputation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, this protection is implied in sections 7 and 8 of the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Also, the Canadian 
government implemented in 1983 a Privacy Act that applies to 
more than 100 government organizations under its jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has since promised a framework 
legislation to ensure the private sector complies with the 
obligation of protecting privacy. Bill C-54 is the unfortunate 
result of that promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, the right to privacy is explicitly recognized in the 
Quebec charter of human rights and freedoms and in the Quebec 
civil code. More importantly, the Quebec government is the only 
government in North America to have developed legislation 
governing personal information protection in the public sector 
in 1982 and in the private sector in 1994. Some experts even 
agree that the Quebec legislation applying to the private sector 
is reportedly one of the best in the world, which is remarkable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will point out some of the weaknesses in Bill C-54. This is a 
weak bill whose centrepiece is its schedule. Most provisions 
that will govern personal information protection are in the 
schedule to the bill. 
Moreover, this schedule is not the model code on personal 
information protection that was developed by the private sector 
and by consumers to serve as a framework for the protection of 
personal information on a voluntary basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By limiting himself to this text, the minister ignored the 
recommendations made by consumers and by privacy commissioners 
who recognized that the model code of the Canadian Standards 
Association was a good basis for reflection, but that it had to 
be reviewed before being incorporated into the legislation. The 
minister did not do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This undoubtedly shows that the minister has put economic values 
before social values, when this fundamental right is so fragile 
in the development of electronic commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is said also that this legislation gives tremendous 
discretion to the governor in council. 
Paragraph 27(2)(<I>b</I>) gives the federal government the right to 
amend the act by order in council, without having to come back 
to parliament. Therefore, the act could easily be amended in 
accordance with the wishes of lobbyists representing large 
companies that contribute to the election funds of Canada's 
traditional political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another criticism we have is that this bill does not give any 
powers to the privacy commissioner. Despite the fact that the 
other Canadian provinces have followed Quebec's model by giving 
the commissioner the power to issue orders, the federal bill 
does the exact opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commissioner will not have the power to issue orders, which 
means that this act will not be easily accessible to consumers 
and will have no effect on businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We say that this bill ignores Quebec's unique experience; 
therefore we cannot support it. 
It also ignores Quebec's unique experience with regard to the 
protection of personal information in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give you a few examples: the objectives are 
better set out in the Quebec act, since it deals with the 
protection of privacy, irrespective of any commercial 
considerations. The Quebec act clearly covers all profit and non 
profit organizations, whereas the federal bill provides for the 
protection of personal information only in the context of 
commercial transactions.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec act provides that a group of persons may designate a 
representative in a common cause, but there is no equivalent 
provision in the federal bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of all these shortcomings, there is an even greater 
concern. The only guarantee Quebec has that it will exempted 
from this legislation is a timid statement by the Minister of 
Industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This mistrust is largely motivated by certain formal commitments 
to Quebec that the federal government has too often ignored or 
reneged on. For example, may I remind the government of the 
promises the Prime Minister made a few days before the 1995 
referendum at the Verdun auditorium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues are clear. For the Minister of Industry, the 
important thing is that Canada participate fully in the 
lightning fast progress of electronic commerce. Concerns 
expressed by Canadians with regard to their right to privacy are 
a minor consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry does not hesitate to take a 
centralizing position that, in many respects, goes against 
something that was very well done in Quebec and in the other 
provinces, something that he could have used as a model, 
particularly the Quebec model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois is calling for the 
immediate withdrawal of Bill C-54. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
delighted to enter into the debate on electronic commerce.  As 
most people know, the rapid change in communications in just a 
little over a decade has been dramatic.  There is no doubt that 
we will see further growth of gigantic proportions in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a number of concerns with Bill C-54.  I am not sure that 
I will be nearly as kind on the government as my colleague who 
spoke earlier.  My concerns have to do with identification and 
security of information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could, if I so chose, create a web site and identify myself as 
a deputy speaker of the House of Commons, as some other member of 
the House, or even as a senator if I wanted.  I could put on the 
site anything I want and people accessing that web site would 
have no way of knowing it is not a legitimate site unless there 
is good publicity.  I think there would be if I did that.  I have 
no intentions of doing that, but it is an electronic possibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It used to be that people recognized voices on the phone. 
Certainly in talking with people face to face there is the 
recognition factor with respect to the physical appearance of the 
person.  For many decades a hand signature on documents of either 
the individual or the person authorized to sign on behalf of a 
company or organization was an identifiable marker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not yet have an adequate means of defining the source of 
electronic information.  Part of the legislation includes 
development of electronic signatures.  One could argue that an 
electronic signature is more than just a duplication of a hand 
signature.  However it is one thing that could be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a computer data file a scan of the actual signature could be 
stored, but anyone else who would pick up the document could then 
paste it into any other document.  It would be a perfect forgery, 
bit for bit as we say in the computer world.  A physical 
signature is inadequate to identify a document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another way of doing it is as is done now in electronic commerce 
with banks.  We are all familiar with automatic teller machines, 
ATMs, where people put in a card to identify themselves and to 
prove it is not a stolen card they enter in a four digit ID 
number or PIN number. 
How can we do that if we are sending something to an 
organization?  The only way it would work is if the other 
organization knows what our PIN is so that when they receive it 
they know it is a legitimate individual sending the information. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1045"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the banks this works perfectly fine.  Most of us have PINs 
on our bank card or on our MasterCard. When I put my card into 
the machine and enter my PIN, that number goes down the 
electronic pipeline to the financial institution handling that 
transaction and it matches it at the other end with a PIN it has 
on file electronically.  If it does not match, it says “wrong 
pin number, try again”.  If someone enters the wrong PIN two or 
three times, it says “you're the wrong guy, we are keeping your 
card”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we do that electronically?  If I am going to put 
something to another organization, I would have to by some means 
send it what my electronic signature is so that it can identify 
me.  If I send it in the same document, it is useless because if 
someone else gets it, they immediately can use it.  So I need 
some method of saving with the recipient of that information my 
personal signature, my PIN, my electronic signature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a digression. This has nothing to do with the bill but I 
think we are permitted to do that in the House from time to time. 
Many members here know that I spent a fair amount of time in my 
previous life teaching and working with mathematics and 
computers.  One of the fun things I do, while other people who 
are real boring go out and play golf, is solve mathematical 
problems as a mental exercise and as a recreation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Scintillating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Exactly.  It is a very interesting process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I developed an encryption algorithm which unfortunately got 
sidelined because I got into this wonderful world politics.  I 
never got around to marketing it.  But I really thought the 
method I developed was very good because of the encryption method 
which I used being very unique, and no two successive encryptions 
of the same document ever came out the same.  One of the inputs I 
used was the computer's clock in changing the way it encrypted. 
Besides that there is an upfront ID number which a person can 
use. But it is very important in this case that the person 
receiving the message at the other end knows what that encryption 
password is. The way I did it, it was nowhere included in the 
document but in fact formed part of the formula for the 
decryption of the message.  Without even transmitting it, it was 
an integral part of actually encrypting the message 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of the things that has to be dealt with very 
severely, identification.  I am thinking of someone making a bid 
on a government contract by electronic means.  It would be real 
dastardly but it could happen that an impostor could submit a 
bid, pretending their so and so company was applying for this bid 
with the government when in fact it is one of the competitors 
which is simply throwing in a phony bid to try to throw people 
off track.  We need to be very careful that identification of 
individuals is securely handled and this is one of the things I 
would really urge the committee to look at when examining this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other considerations which I think are also very 
important.  Not the least of these is we need to gear up to 
having a very good climate for this type of commerce to occur in 
Canada.  We hear over and over again that in this country we are 
taxed to death.  We hear it from businesses. We hear it from 
individuals.  We have a brain drain problem where people can move 
to among other places the United States.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They earn more money.  They pay less tax.  Their take home pay 
is much superior to what it is in Canada.  That includes all the 
necessities of life, including health care.  When we factor it 
all together it is still a disadvantage to stay in Canada.  That 
has to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am distressed with this government.  It talks about reducing 
unemployment, improving the economy and changing spending and 
borrowing patterns.  It has had some success.  It has resisted 
the temptation to spend what nominal surpluses there are.  But it 
will not move off its position of keeping the money that has been 
taken from only one sector of our economy, employers and 
employees.  If we took that away we would not have a balanced 
budget.  The government has done that on the backs of those 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to electronic commerce, the government needs to 
make sure that the taxation will not drive Canadians out of the 
country.  Otherwise we will have them out of the economic loop. 
With computers and virtual store fronts now, a person can live in 
this country but virtually move out of the country without 
physically moving out.  There is no way of identifying the source 
of files once they are on the Internet.  They can be sent 
anywhere around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to make sure the tax system is such that people in this 
country can engage in electronic commerce without a tax penalty.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
after the failure of the Meech Lake accord in 1990, the 
federalist premier of Quebec said, and I quote from memory: “No 
matter what, Quebec is and always will be a distinct society”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-54 gives the opportunity to reaffirm this loud and clear. 
When it comes to protecting personal information, Quebec's laws 
is unique in North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has had a law protecting privacy in the public sector 
since 1982. 
The federal government and every province enacted similar 
legislation. In 1994, the Quebec law extended the protection of 
personal information to the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And to conclude my preliminary remarks, Quebec is the only 
government in North America to have a law protecting personal 
information in the private sector. It has had it for over four 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite acceptable for the federal government to once again 
copy things we get right and do well in Quebec. We have no 
objection to that. What we do object to is the wording of this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party's position is very clear, namely this half-baked piece 
of legislation is basically poorly drafted. I will get back to 
our position in my conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the goal of Bill C-54 is to promote electronic commerce; 
the right to privacy in the private sector is a minor 
consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had the minister wanted to show leadership, as he 
claims, he should have adopted these principles, not because 
they are our principles or because Quebec is involved, but 
because this is the sort of protection the people of Quebec and 
of Canada are entitled to expect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, Quebeckers' rights are being diminshed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think this bill does not provide adequate protection for 
Canadians.  A number of its provisions fall short, but one 
involves the reduction of Quebec's rights and that is the one 
concerning all the provincial provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Quebec law at the moment an individual working in Quebec 
can access his record, wherever it is, or a person having a 
medical examination can see his records, wherever they are. 
From now on, it will no longer be the case, since all the 
provisions that go beyond provincial jurisdiction will be 
subject to federal legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might wonder whether federal legislation will provide the 
same protection. The answer is no. 
When it comes to information that is not of a commercial nature, 
the act is vague, to say the very least.  It is worse than that. 
The core of Bill C-54 is a standard, a CSA national standard that 
bears a number and that was approved in a totally different 
legislative context by the standards association in consultation 
with the telemarketing board and another body, as well as with 
consumer representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this self-regulating project is commendable, particularly 
since it originated with the private sector, it is also full of 
conditionals.  This is what I was saying earlier when I spoke of 
the wording of the bill.  A could or a should essentially 
means perhaps instead of shall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My lawyer colleagues in this House will recall that, in law, 
there is a significant difference between may and shall, and

is very humbling for me to rise today and pay tribute a 
constituent of mine, Mr. Ryan Hureljack. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last January Ryan became aware of how desperate many third 
world countries were for clean drinking water.  Ryan used money 
from working odd jobs to pool an initial $70 for the cause. After 
meeting with officials from WaterCan, as well as the ambassador 
from Uganda, Ryan redoubled his fundraising efforts and at 
present has raised over $5,000 that when matched with CIDA funds 
now represents over $15,000 for water projects in Uganda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the beginning of Ryan's quest he has received a real 
education on the needs of third world countries, specifically 
Uganda, saving money and the importance of determination and hard 
work.  Ryan's school has now taken on the fundraising challenge 
in support of what they call Ryan's Well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 20, national child day, Ryan will visit Parliament 
Hill to receive a You Made a Difference award for 1998 from the 
Our Kids Foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should mention that when Ryan began this project less than a 
year ago he was six years old.  I think our country is in good 
hands because people like Ryan will be helping to shape our 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I salute Ryan for his kind and caring contributions to his 
family, his school, his community, our country and for countries 
that are less fortunate than ours.

a party with very little thought for human rights.  That is not 
likely to change in the very near future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time again Reform Party members' statements have 
revealed their utter disregard for human rights.  For example, 
with reference to the charter, the member for Wild Rose said in

should scrap the whole thing”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this very place the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca went

and freedoms”.

premium has been reduced by this government by $5 billion or 
more.  Our payroll taxes are the lowest, lower than those in the 
United States.  We will continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I really want to point out is the incredible fact that the 
Reform Party changes its mind on what to do with the EI surplus 
more than the Conservatives actually change leaders or have 
leadership votes. First the Reform Party wants to apply it to the

Watching the Reform Party is like getting policy whiplash.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the fact of

insurance. He has broken that promise. We have had no hearings.

Prime Minister today commit to a full and open debate in this 
House to change the law?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

participating in the prebudget consultation debate.  He was with 
the committee when we were in parts of western Canada. The member 
has been here in Ottawa participating in the debate. Who do we 
hear from in that debate? We hear from Canadians who come forward 
and talk about Canadian priorities.  Canadians talk about the 
employment insurance program, about investment in health care and 
reduction in personal income taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate is ongoing.  I encourage the hon. member to continue 
to participate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I guess 
the Prime Minister thinks he is above the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there was an honest public debate on what to do with the 
employment insurance overpayment, it would be in parliament.  It 
would be a formal debate and at the end of it there would be a 
vote.  Every MP would have to go on record saying who they 
thought the money belonged to.  The Prime Minister thinks it 
belongs to him.  Everyone else in the country knows the money is 
theirs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the Prime Minister not allow for a vote on the EI 
overpayment, or has he already made up his mind to steal it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think the hon. member knows that 
that remark is unparliamentary.  The member should withdraw the 
word steal and I would ask him to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the word is withdrawn but 
the question still stands.

recently come to this place, in 1997 I believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do want to inform the hon. member that unless the rules have 
been changed, a House committee is an extension of parliament. 
Another Reform member is attending the committee.  Perhaps I 
could encourage the member to attend.  Instead of being the hired 
heckler that he was in the United States, perhaps he could 
contribute to the debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it was the Liberal government that established the

There is a process in place right now that will be followed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The director of investigations will be looking at this takeover, 
if it goes ahead, to ensure that all aspects of the deal reflect

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>SHEEP PRODUCTION IN QUEBEC

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the day before 
yesterday, in response to one of our questions, the agriculture 
minister hid behind legality to justify the unfair treatment 
given to Quebec sheep producers who are in dire straits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the minister hide behind the legal aspect of the issue, 
while in western Canada the federal government used ad hoc 
programs to retroactively compensate grain producers? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK95"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have told the hon. member and the 
industry over and over again that the money in farm safety nets 
to assist in the farm income situation, after we have played our 
full and complete role and even recently increased the 
compensation caps for sheep, is in the hands of the provincial 
Government of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have written to the minister of agriculture of the province of 
Quebec saying that I will sit down with him if he wishes to 
discuss some readjustment of those moneys to assist farmers who 
feel that they need more assistance in recovering from this 
situation.  He has written back to me and said that he was not 
interested.

<P><A NAME="LINK96"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister 
knows that the federal government is to blame. In the past, 
several billion dollars were retroactively given to western 
grain producers through ad hoc programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that something that was possible for western grain 
producers is not possible for Quebec sheep producers?

<P><A NAME="LINK97"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will repeat again.  The farm safety net 
money to support the income of Canadian farmers is distributed 
equitably for producers in the provinces across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other provinces the producers the hon. member is referring to 
could have drawn on NISA.  In the province of Quebec the industry 
and the government decided to put it on price support.  That was 
their decision.  Unfortunately it was a decision made by their 
industry and by their provincial government that will not assist 
its producers in this situation.

Mr. Speaker, I do not know where my hon. friend has been for the 
last couple of years.  We just passed Bill C-9 which establishes 
Canada port authorities across the country with one federal 
nominee, one provincial nominee and one municipal nominee along 
with four nominees selected in consultation with users.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Halifax port authority will be treated like all other port 
authorities.  Consultation has been going on.  We have formed an

It is representative through a selection of nominees that 
reflects user concerns.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, more 
than 20,000 future jobs in the region may be at stake if the full 
potential of the port of Halifax is not maximized.  We need 
changes that reflect the economic needs of Atlantic Canada, not 
the control needs of the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The joint proposal to alter the port authority is consistent 
with the new Canada Marine Act. In 1997 the predecessor of the 
Minister of Transport promised to provide local interests with a 
strong voice in the port's direction.  This voice would make 
Halifax a panamax player instead of a port that unloads the top 
layer of containers on ships headed for New York.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, once again the hon. member has his facts wrong.  All 
the local interest groups in Halifax have been consulted as to 
the selection of members for this board.  They will reflect a 
broad range of interests dealing with users. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should go back to Halifax, talk with those 
individuals and generate a good selection of candidates so we 
will be able to have a first class board that will lead Halifax

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: On behalf of tens of thousands of Canadians who have

introducing my private member's bill to strengthen property 
rights in federal law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, property rights were intentionally left out of 
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms leaving Canadians 
highly vulnerable to the arbitrary taking of property by 
government. My bill would fix this by making it more difficult 
for the government to override the property rights of its 
citizens by requiring a two-thirds majority vote of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nor does the Canadian bill of rights provide any protection of 
our right to be paid any compensation, let alone fair 
compensation for property taken by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My bill strengthens the property rights provisions of the 
Canadian bill of rights by providing protection of our right to 
have compensation fixed impartially, protection of our right to 
receive fair and timely compensation, and guarantees every 
Canadian their right to apply to the courts when the government 
has violated their property rights.

allow Canadians to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the signing

rights in federal law that the United Nations declaration called

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start the second part of my speech with another quote 
from Mr. Bourassa, the former Liberal Premier of Quebec who said 
on Wednesday, March 4, 1992, in reaction to the Beaudoin-Dobbie 
Commission's report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we find in the Beaudoin-Dobbie report is some kind of 
domination reflex, of dominating federalism. They think they 
must be involved in all sectors and that, for all intents and 
purposes, they could have the last word. We do not think this 
approach respects the Canadian Constitution. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what former federalist premier Robert Bourassa said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, I should draw a parallel with this bill, which 
is a very good example of the dominating federalism to which we 
are constantly subjected in this Chamber and to which Quebeckers 
want to put an end. We in the Bloc Quebecois say, and many in 
Quebec agree, that the only way to get rid of this dominating 
federalism is to have a sovereign Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the defence of consumers and the public, 
governments should sit up and take note. Many have said so. I 
was pleased to hear the Canadian Federation for Independent 
Business say 
how important it is to remember that consumers are not only 
individuals or citizens, but also small businesses that do not 
have the same financial means as the large corporations and that 
find themselves in the position of David versus Goliath, and 
this has nothing to do with the Bible as things currently stand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to remember that small business is a large part 
of Quebec's social and economic fabric. True, there are some 
large corporations, but there are also small businesses and we 
in the Bloc Québécois are trying to represent their interests as 
best we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is extremely disappointing. It fails to give citizens 
the protection they expect. The Internet is not just for 
commerce and cannot be isolated from civil society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a debate on telemarketing in the House.  The government 
wanted to deal firmly with companies engaged in misleading 
telemarketing, by requiring them to sat very clearly at the 
beginning of the call who they were and what the purpose of the 
telemarketing was.  I am in favour of this approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois sought to introduce an amendment extending 
that to the Internet. Now we have a bill on electronic commerce 
which says nothing on that score.  Yet, more and more people 
would like to use this medium—which is only a medium and not 
another universe, as the OECD acknowledged—but they will do so 
only if they have real protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first step is a full protection, extending not only to 
electronic commerce, but also to personal information and 
privacy.  This is what the bill is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who speak after me will come back on that, but it will 
probably require international agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, I will say that that we, in the Bloc Quebecois, 
expect the country to which we will belong for a few more years, 
Canada, to show leadership, the kind of leadership that will 
reassure the public.  Based on the promises of this Liberal 
government and the previous ones, we were expecting real 
legislation, legislation that would protect privacy in the 
private sector.

I begin by saying that I was somewhat astounded by the comments 
made by members opposite in the Bloc Quebecois.  Their 
misinformation on this very important matter is disturbing. 
Perhaps they do not understand what is being proposed in Bill 
C-54, but I think that is probably not the case.  I believe they 
are deliberately trying to misrepresent the facts.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take this opportunity to set the record straight on 
this very important matter.  Let us do so by reviewing the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Quebec was the first jurisdiction to adopt 
comprehensive privacy legislation for information held in and by 
the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 the province passed an act representing and respecting 
the protection of personal information in the private sector. 
This act grants individuals the right of access to personal 
information held by private sector businesses operating in Quebec 
and regulates the collection, use and disclosure of personal 
information.  The legislation is overseen by the Commission on 
Access to Information which is responsible for conducting 
investigations and settling disputes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to point out that the Quebec Charter of Human Rights 
and Freedoms which came into force in 1975 enshrines the right to 
privacy for residents of Quebec.  Amendments to the civil code 
providing extensive rights of privacy were enacted in 1991. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because it has legislation which is substantially similar to the 
proposed personal information protection and electronic documents 
act, Quebec in fact will be exempted from its application.  That 
is important to note. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the Quebec legislation, the federal legislation will have 
two basic components:  a set of fair information principles and a 
mechanism for overseeing the implementation of the law. The 
federal bill is based on the Canadian Standards Association code 
which, like the Quebec law, is based on the 1980 Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development “Guidelines on the 
Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear here because it is important. First of all, 
Quebec will not lose any type of protection as a result of our 
legislation.  Moreover, our legislation will not force Quebec to 
do anything or to not do anything. Finally, Bill C-54 will 
complement Quebec's legislation. To suggest otherwise is 
misleading, false and quite frankly, incorrect.  It is important 
that Quebecers and all Canadians know this.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I 
rise today I cannot help but think about the importance of this 
bill's title: An Act to support and promote electronic commerce 
by protecting personal information that is collected, etc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have to remember is that this bill was introduced by the 
Minister of Industry, who is being asked to fulfill a twofold 
mandate, namely to protect the industry and consumers at the 
same time.  We know that both the industry and consumers have 
powerful lobbies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should then come as no surprise that, in the dilemma that the 
minister is facing, having to choose between protecting the 
industry or protecting consumers, the Minister of Industry, who 
has been holding this position in the Liberal government since 
1993, has so far always favoured the industry to the detriment 
of consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a long list of projects he has pushed aside under 
pressure from lobby groups. I am thinking in particular of the 
Ginn Publishing case, in which consumers got the short end of 
the stick. I will give more examples later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset, when the Department of Industry was created, the 
Bloc Quebecois asked the government not to give the same 
minister two mandates that were so different from each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 4 of the Act to establish the Department of Industry and 
to amend and repeal certain other acts states: 
<UL>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois was opposed to the same minister defending 
the interests of consumers and those of industry since it is 
clear, for those who have eyes to see, ears to hear and most of 
all a mind to think, that the interests of business, represented 
by lobbies and large cash contributions to the campaign coffers 
of federal political parties, would prevail over those of 
consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill proposed by Industry Canada is tailor made for this. 
The Bloc Quebecois has already seen the opposition between the 
interests of consumers and those of the industry. It has also 
seen the Minister of Industry's clear preference for industry 
rather than consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the House of an interesting case, direct 
broadcasting satellites, better known as DBS. The government did 
not take the necessary steps to inform consumers that 
technological changes were occurring and it allowed consumers to 
acquire analog parabolic antenna systems, while the industry was 
converting to digital transmission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry intervened on behalf of the Prime 
Minister's relatives to make sure that the Canadian policy on 
DBS would suit their interests. The Minister of Industry waited 
a long time before warning consumers against buying parabolic 
antennae connected to the American broadcasting system and he 
asked the industry to circulate the warning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Bloc Quebecois intervened and asked the minister to 
launch a broad information campaign on this issue.  On December 
19, we wrote the Minister of Industry a letter along these 
lines: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you are aware, almost half a million Canadians and Quebeckers 
now own satellite dishes that will soon be obsolete, because 
digital mode will soon be the only method used for broadcasting 
radio signals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more, the Department of Industry is also responsible for 
technological development in Canada.  You therefore played a 
role in developing the unregulated grey market of satellite 
dishes. 
You were aware that there would soon be a major technological 
change in satellite signal transmission methods but you did not 
inform consumers of these changes on the horizon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel you were remiss in your responsibilities towards 
consumers who bought satellite dishes during the past year.  Had 
you truly been interested in protecting their interests, you 
would have launched a full-scale information campaign to inform 
them about the technological changes just around the corner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore call on you, Mr. Minister, to take the necessary 
action to have your department immediately inform consumers and 
retailers, among others, by placing announcements in newspapers 
pointing out that satellite dishes are becoming obsolete as a 
means of capturing analog signals, so that sales of this kind of 
equipment cease; to launch an information campaign regarding DTH 
broadcasting so that consumers, whose interests it is your 
responsibility to defend, know exactly where they stand: the 
incompatibility of technologies, subscription required for basic 
service, the risks of purchase, given that the CRTC does not use 
the viability of businesses as a criterion for issuing licences 
to businesses, DTH— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 22, Quebec's Minister of Culture and Communications 
wrote the federal Minister of Industry on the same subject. 
She said:  “There are two ways around this problem:  require 
applicants to offer consumers mutually compatible technologies, 
or have them rent the antenna, the decoder and the remote 
control from a DTH satellite service or from one of its 
accredited retailers until the technology is ready for market.”

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 26, the minister answered my letter of December 19. 
He said that he understood my disappointment and the 
disappointment of the consumers. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with you that it is unacceptable for some retailers to 
still be selling parabolic antennas to receive signals in analog 
mode without warning their clients that, soon, these signals 
will no longer be sent out. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the minister sympathizes with the public, but he is 
doing nothing to protect them. The hon. member who spoke before 
me said that there was no risk for people in Quebec. 
I would like to quote here, in full, a comment on this bill made 
by the Commission québécoise de l'accès à l'information. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the commission's contention that, if implemented, this 
proposal would represent a setback on the privacy issue in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This contention is based on a comprehensive review of the CSA 
code. There is good reason to be pleased with the Canadian 
industry adopting such a code. 
This is a sensible breakthrough which results from an 
interesting analysis of the OECD guidelines relating to personal 
information protection. However, the CSA code does not begin to 
respond to the objectives of personal information protection 
systems established by both Quebec laws, that is, ensuring 
citizens an objective and equitable settlement of problems and 
disputes that can arise in the growing area of the respect of 
this dimension of private life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, the Commission suggested 
to the minister of Culture and Communications that she remind 
her counterparts in other governments that a legal system had 
been put in place by Quebec. The Quebec system is, in the eyes 
of the Commission, the only answer that respects citizen's 
rights, considering the challenges of the information highway. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The draft bill the Minister of Industry and the federal 
government are proposing for personal information protection 
really is another reason for Quebeckers to achieve sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every day, we discover something about this government. When the 
session is over, the record will be full and Quebeckers will 
know what choice to make. 
<P><A NAME="LINK179"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
federal government must be really ashamed of its bill on 
personal information protection in the commercial sector to have 
decided late yesterday afternoon, in spite of parliamentary 
tradition, to put it on the order of the day for second reading 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government thus hoped to avoid a real public debate on its 
bill. For those who do not know about parliamentary conventions, 
I recall that on Mondays and Fridays half the members are not in 
the House so that they can have a little time to meet with their 
constituents. That is why parties usually agree on the coming 
business so that the members interested in the matters on the 
order of the day can be here to discuss them. But yesterday, the 
government unilaterally changed the order of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I partly understand it. If I were in the industry minister's 
place, I would be ashamed of the tricks he pulled to make us 
believe that personal information will be protected in this 
country. Before introducing this bill, the government should 
have recalled that a parliamentary committee had looked into the 
issue of personal information in a technologically changing 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote from the committee report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not believe that Canadians want ground rules to protect 
only their informational privacy— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As is the case in the bill under consideration, which only 
protects personal information inasmuch as it is collected, used 
or disclosed in the context of a commercial transaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I resume the quotation: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—leaving the rest of their privacy rights to languish in a 
lawless frontier.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its report entitled “Privacy: Where do we draw the line?”, 
the Standing Committee on Human Rights and the Status of Persons 
with Disabilities also wrote, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Privacy is one of the most comprehensive of all human rights—broad, 
ambitious and valued around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Traditionally 
understood as the “right to be left alone” in this technological 
age, privacy has taken on new dimensions. To experts, privacy is 
the right to enjoy private space, to conduct private 
communications, to be free from surveillance and to respect the 
sanctity of one's body. 
To the average Canadian, privacy is a question of power—the 
ability to control one's personal information and to remain 
anonymous by choice. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a human right, privacy belongs to everyone. The Members of 
this Committee have listened to as many voices across this 
country as possible. Canadians have never approved of peeping 
Toms or unauthorized wire-tapping, and our criminal laws reflect 
this. We know now that this same disapproval extends, for 
example, to hidden video cameras in the workplace, genetic 
testing for insurance purposes— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the subtitle “Privacy as a Commodity”, the committee 
writes on page 10: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the use of technology not only affects individuals; it also has 
an impact on the commercial activity of the community as a 
whole. Many townhall participants feared that privacy has become 
a commodity that people are prepared to trade off for either a 
better level of service or product or the minimization of 
penalties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paul-André Comeau, the Privacy Commissioner of Quebec, 
warned against a debate about privacy that focused solely on the 
commercial value of information. This was, he said, “the 
slippery slope we are lured onto by the new technologies in 
their attempt at putting a dollar figure to each piece of 
information.” 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is onto this very slope that the Minister of Industry is luring us 
with his bill aimed at protecting personal information that is 
collected, used or disclosed in the course of commercial 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee then quotes Darrell Evans, on page 21 of its 
report. I will do the same, as a bit of philosophy will not hurt 
this government, which has focused exclusively on trade and its 
own visibility: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the vanishing of privacy would be a victory of 
materialism over the human spirit. I find it very hard to 
picture what kind of room there would be for creativity on the 
part of human beings in such a world. I feel the virtual bars 
closing in faster and faster in a world like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are constantly told it is a more secure world, of course, a 
more efficient world, a world that catches fraud much better, 
but to me, that is the victory of bureaucracy over human 
creativity. An old phrase comes to mind here, that we know the 
price of everything and the value of nothing— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is our goal 
in all this? What do we seek for individuals in this? We want 
to put individuals in a place of causation rather than being a 
complete effect of technologies and of a gradual erosion of their privacy. 
If we are to maintain human freedom, I think that's what we have 
to do. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, when Human Resources Development and Canada Customs match 
their records to check the forms completed by all travellers 
entering Canada to make sure no EI claimant has left the country 
while receiving benefits, the federal government itself violates 
human rights and privacy by wrongly placing under suspicion all 
Canadians and Quebeckers who have left the country until they 
have proven their innocence.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will follow closely the proceedings currently 
before the Federal Court in the matter of the Canadian 
government vs the privacy commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House committee also suggested some fundamental principles 
that should guide the government in its bill on personal 
information protection: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone is entitled to expect and enjoy: physical privacy; 
privacy of personal information; freedom from surveillance; 
privacy of personal communications; privacy of personal space. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone is guaranteed that: these privacy rights will be 
respected by others adopting whatever protective measures are 
most appropriate to do so; violations of these privacy rights, 
unless justifiable according to the exceptions principle—will 
be subject to proper redress. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the basic duties owed to others to ensure their privacy 
rights, the committee included: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The duty to secure meaningful consent; the duty to take all the 
steps necessary to adequately respect others' privacy 
rights—the duty to be accountable; the duty to be transparent; 
the duty to use and provide access to privacy enhancing 
technologies. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the committee recognized the following rights for 
citizens: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone is the rightful owner of their personal information, no 
matter where it is held, and this right is inalienable. Everyone 
is entitled to expect and enjoy anonymity, unless the need to 
identify individuals is reasonably justified. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To fully understand the scope of the problem, I would now like 
to quote Justice Gérald La Forest, of the supreme court: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can only be sure of being free from surveillance today if we 
retire to our basements, cloak our windows, turn out the lights 
and remain absolutely quiet. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation that the Minister for Industry is proposing 
today for the protection of personal information that is 
collected for the purpose of commercial transactions is not a 
legislation aimed at protecting the privacy of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec government passed similar legislation in 1994 to 
uphold the right to privacy of Quebecers guaranteed by the 
Quebec charter of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of the Canadian privacy commissioners and consumers 
associations have pointed out to the minister how important it 
is to have strong national legislation on the protection of 
privacy, as this legislation will serve as a model for English 
speaking provinces that do not yet have a law for the protection 
of privacy in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By being so permissive, the Minister for Industry has shown how 
sensitive he is to the business lobby which, in any case, 
finances the Liberal Party's election fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by reading the following extract of the 1997-98 
annual report of Quebec's access to information commissioner: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Commission examined the consequences of the adoption in the 
Canadian federation as a whole of legal standards and principles 
to regulate the protection of personal information on the 
information highway. Under the terms of a project that were 
conveyed to the ministers responsible for the implementation of 
the information highway, protection would be provided within the 
framework of the voluntary code developed by the Canadian 
Standards Association. 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK180"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to address Bill C-54, an act to support and promote electronic 
commerce by protecting personal information that is collected, 
used or disclosed in certain circumstances, by providing for the 
use of electronic means to communicate or record information or 
transactions and by amending the Canada Evidence Act, the 
Statutory Instruments Act and the Statute Revision Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This long awaited bill introduced by the minister does not meet 
the objective stated at the outset, namely to protect privacy in 
a technological world that challenges this fundamental right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have before us is a bill whose content is to be found in 
a schedule, a bill that gives no real powers to the 
commissioner. This is a bill whose form and content will both 
create confusion. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT32"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT32"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1240

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bill whose wording lends itself to broad interpretation, 
a bill that includes a provision allowing the governor in 
council to amend the act without any parliamentary debate and 
democratic consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not likely, therefore, that the bill will meet the 
public's expectations, because it is too flawed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, most of the provisions governing protection of personal 
information are to be found in a schedule of the bill. Such a 
structure—which is unusual, to say the least—could result in a 
number of problems, since the schedule will have to be read in 
conjunction with the rest of the bill. 
This will only make it harder for businesses to figure out their 
obligations and consumers' rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the schedule is merely a model code for the protection 
of personal information drafted by the private sector and by 
consumers, as a framework to protect personal information, but 
strictly on a voluntary basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister did not follow 
through on the recommendations made by consumers and the privacy 
commissioners, who stated that the code provides a good starting 
point, but needs to be reviewed and amended if it is to be 
included in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This shows how anxious the minister is to see electronic 
commerce develop in Canada, and it also shows the priority given 
to economic values, rather than to social values and the right 
to privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the legislation is muddled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conditional is frequently used in Schedule 1, for example, 
“should be specified”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may well wonder whether the use of the conditional in Bill 
C-54 means that the legislation is simply making recommendations 
without imposing obligations, particularly since the answer is 
not obvious.  In clause 5(2), the bill provides: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2) The word “should”, when used in Schedule 1, indicates a 
recommendation and does not impose an obligation. 
</UL>
<However, a few clauses later, clause 11 says the opposite: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>11.(1) An individual may file with the Commissioner a written 
complaint against an organization for contravening a provision 
of Division 1 or for not following a recommendation set out in 
Schedule 1. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly this confusion and these contradictions will make for 
happy lawyers and unhappy consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 4.3.2 in Schedule 1, which sets out the CSA code, 
provides: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organizations shall make a reasonable effort to ensure that the 
individual is advised of the purposes for which the information 
will be used. 
</UL>
<The text is open to considerable interpretation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind you as well that Quebec is a unique model in 
North America for its legislation regarding the protection of 
personal information. It has had this legislation for four 
years.  Like the charter of human rights, Quebec's laws consider 
the protection of personal information a basic right.  Article 5 
of the 1975 Quebec charter of rights and freedoms provides that 
every person has a right to the respect of his or her private life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, Bill C-54 has as its sole objective to promote 
electronic trade while the right to protection of privacy in the 
private sector is relegated to the background.  Its title alone 
makes this clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse yet, this bill will reduce, in some cases, the rights of 
Quebeckers acquired under Quebec law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider an example.  Under section 17 of the Quebec 
legislation, an employee in a department store would be entitled 
to see his personal file, even if kept outside Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-54, he would not necessarily be able to view his 
file, because his request would be subject to legislation that 
ignores the right to privacy when the access to information 
request is made under labour relations provisions and is not of 
a commercial nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, as I said earlier, Bill C-54 is based on a voluntary 
model code prepared by the CSA.  Let us see what the access to 
information commissioners of Quebec and British Columbia think 
of that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1245"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT33"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT33"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1245

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On page 15 of his Annual Report for 1997-98, the Quebec access to 
information commissioner says “going along with this proposal, 
the CSA standard, would be a step backward from the current 
situation in Quebec as far as protection of personal information 
is concerned”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The British Columbia commissioner, David H. Flaherty, compared 
the BC legislation, the European Union legislation and the CSA 
code which is the foundation of Bill C-54. 
He came to the conclusion that the purpose of the CSA code is 
not to protect the right to privacy; that the concept of 
personal information is most poorly defined; that there is no 
reference to data banks; and that the definition of consent is 
evasive compared to what can be found in other legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the tools provided in Bill C-54 are ineffective, since the 
commissioner cannot issue orders. In fact, Canadians will have 
to go to the federal court to solve disputes, but only once the 
commissioner has issued his opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on about this bill, but I am running out of 
time. However, I support the request of my hon. colleague, our 
industry critic, and urge the government to immediately withdraw 
Bill C-54 concerning electronic commerce and personal 
information protection in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill as it now stands will not provide consumers with the 
level of confidence they need to ensure the development of 
electronic commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three facts that surface when one reads this bill: the 
bill allows the federal government to subject huge sections of 
the economy currently under Quebec jurisdiction to federal 
legislation; the bill is so confused that it could be 
interpreted any which way; and last, it is extremely weak, since 
it does not grant the federal privacy commissioner the power to 
issue orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we think about it, we once again wonder why the federal 
government did not rely on the four years of positive experience 
Quebec has in this area. 
<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
read the title of Bill C-54 once again because it is important to 
remember what the government is trying to do with this bill. 
This bill is designed to support and promote electronic 
commerce. We are in an era of expansion, an era of constant 
electronic evolution, and developments in this field are faster 
than in any other field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote the title of the bill: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An Act to support and promote electronic commerce by protecting 
personal information that is collected, used or disclosed in 
certain circumstances, by providing for the use of electronic 
means to communicate or record information or transactions and 
by amending the Canada Evidence Act, the Statutory Instruments 
Act and the Statute Revision Act 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the issues related to this bill? The issues are 
different, of course, for the various stakeholders. For the 
Minister of Industry, the issue is clear: making sure that 
Canada participate fully in the global economy, more 
specifically, as I said earlier, in the extremely rapid growth 
awaiting electronic commerce. The figures, which are just 
astronomical, speak for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is estimated that the global electronic market could reach 
$200 billion by the year 2000, compared to an estimated $2.6 
billion U.S. in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, at the last OECD conference, which was held in Ottawa, the 
minister acknowledged that the main barrier to the development 
of electronic commerce is consumer confidence. Everything must 
be based on the confidence of those on whom this technology will 
be used or who will be using this technology, namely, the 
consumers. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1250"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT34"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT34"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1250

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must first establish confidence in the digital economy. Here, 
in North America, less than one netsurfer out of five is 
prepared to buy products on-line. This reflects their crucial 
concerns about the safety of transactions, the respect for 
privacy and the remedies offered to consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must reinforce throughout the world confidence in the 
electronic market by guaranteeing the security as well as the 
protection of consumers and personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the challenge for the industry minister. But for 
consumers' rights advocacy groups, for consumers themselves and 
for the people's right to privacy, what is the challenge? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these people, the challenge is also quite clear. It is to 
provide an international agreement and national legislation that 
will effectively protect privacy and consumers' rights. We 
cannot accept any technological change, whether it is 
economically desirable or not, that leads to systematic and 
uncontrollable intrusion into people's privacy. We must thus 
ensure that consumers will be protected in their daily private 
lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other people who will be involved in this, for 
example, the privacy commissioners in all the provinces. 
They have to protect a human right, the right to privacy and 
thereby protect democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In testimony before the human rights standing committee on 
November 21, 1996, Bruce Phillips gave the following examples. A 
direct marketing firm sells the list of about 80 million 
American households organized by ethnic origin. Let us suppose 
that a marketing firm sells such a list and says: “Out of the 80 
million names that I am providing you, there are <I>x</I> million 
people from Germany, <I>x</I> million from Romania, <I>x</I> million from 
Israel”, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In organizing the list by ethnic origin, let us say that among 
the 35 groups identified, we find Armenians and Jews. The 
information provided gives both the number of children and the 
age ranges. 
It is easy to imagine how glad a terrorist organization would be 
if it could get its hands on this kind of information and use it 
for its own violent purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another example. In Canada, the Department of Human 
Resources Development and Customs Canada are currently matching 
their data bases in order to track cheaters—people who are 
supposed to be available for work and who travel to Florida 
during the winter because they cannot find a job. The human 
resources development minister matches his data with those of 
Customs Canada to spot people who may be cheating the EI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the ruling of the privacy commissioner condemning this 
procedure, this information is being used. Under the system 
implemented by the government, all travellers are presumed 
guilty unless they can prove otherwise. 
This is computer technology at work. This kind of operation 
would not be possible without the power of communication and 
data processing technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another case. In BC, Pharmanet has a register containing 
all prescriptions being given out in the province. The purpose 
of this system is to avoid the prescription of incompatible 
drugs, but the content of this data bank can be made available 
to law enforcement organizations. It is far from certain the 
privacy of people is being protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still another example. The number of hidden cameras is on the 
rise. In 1996, there were 200,000 hidden cameras in the U.K. 
alone. We are told daily how wonderful it would be to have 
cameras on street corners, near red lights or just about 
anywhere.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As invasion of privacy becomes increasingly commonplace, it is 
extremely important to find ways to protect privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically those are the issues raised by the various 
stakeholders who made representations about this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the bill? Does it meet the expectations it created? 
Does it meet the expectations of consumers and privacy 
commissioners, both in Quebec and in the rest of Canada? The 
answer is far from clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ethics in Bill C-54 are quite different from those in the 
Quebec law as revealed by their respective titles. 
The Quebec legislation is entitled An Act respecting the 
protection of personal information in the private sector, 
whereas the title of the federal legislation starts with “An Act 
to support and promote electronic commerce” and then goes on to 
say “by protecting personal information”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member has only one minute left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would ask the House for 
unanimous consent to complete my remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Does the hon. member have leave to complete 
his remarks? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, the question I was asking is: Does 
this bill meet our expectations? As I said, the answer is far 
from clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the legislation has different titles at the federal and 
provincial levels. The provincial legislation's main goal is to 
protect personal information and privacy whereas the thrust of 
the federal bill is to support and promote electronic commerce. 
The protection of personal information comes second. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas the Quebec legislation is aimed at protecting privacy 
and applies to every organization, the federal legislation only 
applies to commercial transactions. 
Electronic commerce is the main object of the bill. Personal 
information also means businesses' trade information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal act should not hamper the very same trade activities 
it seeks to promote. English newspapers talk about this bill in 
terms of a “lightheaded government approach to cyberspace”. One 
can reasonably state that the Quebec bill is stricter and more 
encompassing both in its form and its definitions, its clear 
wording and the power to issue orders it gives the commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will immediately move on to my conclusions, because I will not 
have enough time for all my remarks in the five minutes at my 
disposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What impression do we get from a more careful examination of 
Bill C-54? 
First of all, this is a jumbled and shaky bill, full of ifs and 
whens, whose central feature is a schedule that includes without 
any changes the voluntary code of the Canadian Standard 
Association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a bill says that an organization should do this or that, we 
cannot be sure it will do it, because it is not necessarily 
required to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, this legislation will make federal-provincial linkage 
extremely complex, at least in Quebec. Our legislation being 
stricter and more specific than the federal bill, we will end up 
once more with legal wrangling over the interpretation of both 
pieces of legislation, and lawyers will make a fortune out of 
this.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, this bill grants new discretionary powers to the governor 
in council. Indeed, he will be able to amend schedule 1, the 
core of this legislation, simply by passing regulations.  He can 
amend it as he sees fit to take any change to the CSA standard 
into account.  As a result, the industries normally subject to 
the legislation will be in a position to amend the legislation 
without parliamentary debate and with the minister's consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the pressures that some companies can exert on the 
governing party through their contributions to campaign funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I would like to underline the fact that this bill is 
mainly concerned about electronic commerce, relegating people's 
fundamental right to privacy to second place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Democracy is under constant siege, as we have seen in other 
countries. Some of the people visiting Canada tell us that, in 
their countries, democracy is trampled on a daily basis. Because 
Canada is a democratic country, as Quebec will be when it 
becomes independent, it is important that we do everything we 
can to protect people's privacy and not let any legislation 
weaken the mechanisms in place to protect this privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No matter how important new technologies are, they should never 
take precedence over the protection of privacy, which is the 
very foundation of the democratic society we all value.

<A NAME="LINK186">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-54, an 
act to support and promote electronic commerce by protecting 
personal information that is collected, used or disclosed in 
certain circumstances, by providing for the use of electronic 
means to communicate or record information or transactions and by 
amending the Canada Evidence Act, the Statutory Instruments Act 
and the Statute Revisions Act, be read the second time and

<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I find it interesting that the Bloc Quebecois makes 
the statement that the minister has dropped consumer interests 
over industry interests with this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that the Bloc voted against government 
legislation like that of Bill C-20, amendments to the Competition 
Act intended to fight deceptive telemarketers.  This legislation 
was intended to protect Canadians from coast to coast.  Our 
seniors are a particularly vulnerable population who are targeted 
by telemarketers and consumers in general. The Bloc voted against 
that legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Bill C-54 I remind the House and the hon. member from across 
the way, and the divide is pretty big on this legislation between 
the two sides of the House, that without consumer confidence in 
electronic commerce industry that industry cannot grow. Canada 
has an interest in seeing that it is one of the players in the 
electronic commerce industry nationally, across North America and 
internationally.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government understands that the key to successful electronic 
commerce is to establish trust with consumers. That is one of the 
main objectives of this piece of legislation. It will do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation will create the condition so that there will be 
consumer confidence in this budding electronic commerce industry 
in Canada and will then allow us to become a major player 
internationally.  We have to put the person back into personal 
information, and this legislation does that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me inform the hon. member from that wide divide across the 
other side of the House that there are quite a number of 
organizations that promote consumer interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those consumer organizations, to name a few, are the Public 
Interest Advocacy Centre, La Fédération nationale des 
associations des consommateurs de Québec, the British Columbia 
Civil Liberties Association and Option consommateurs from Quebec, 
my native province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the use, collection and disclosure of personal 
information this bill represents concrete action, something this 
government is known for doing.  We take concrete action.  We deal 
with issues one at a time but we deal with them. We do not let 
them live on, destroy confidence of investors, of Canadians, of 
Quebecers like the PQ government does in Quebec with the 
referendum issue.  But I digress.  Let me come back to the main 
point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a Quebecer.  Quebecers already have good legislation in 
Quebec on this issue.  This legislation is not impeding on that 
legislation.  It complements that legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition, particularly the Bloc, does not want to say that 
because, as the PQ, it wants to muddy the waters in order to push 
its agenda forward, whether or not that agenda is in the best 
interests of the people of Quebec and the people of Canada. We 
see it again here.  It is muddying the waters, distorting 
information.  If I were a journalist and those members were 
journalists we would call it yellow journalism.  But they are not 
journalists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments will create consumer confidence in Canada in 
our budding electronic commerce industry.  This legislation 
complements the legislation which exists already in the province 
of Quebec, my home province, my place of birth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation will also complement the actions which are 
already being taken by community organizations and public 
interest groups.  This legislation will allow them to do their 
job better.  This is concrete action to ensure Canada has the 
real opportunity of becoming a leader in the electronic commerce 
industry today and tomorrow.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protection of personal information is a fundamental issue, 
which warrants our constant attention.  This attention must be 
increasingly sharp, as our society is becoming more and more 
electronic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years ago, my colleague from Lotbinière talked about the 
upcoming invention of fax machines.  We had phones, now we have 
fax machines, cell phones, which are easy to tap into, and the 
Internet. Who knows what tomorrow will bring? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore this House should take into account what the future 
has in store, even if we cannot know what that might be. 
This is why the bill that will eventually be passed must protect 
personal information as much as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a curious government opposite, with its Prime Minister, 
who makes jokes about the respective merits of baseball bats and 
pepper spray.  The listeners of the radio station 93 FM in the 
Quebec City region awarded him the “bolo” prize.  I mention 
this, because with the bill before us, the government should get 
a second “bolo” award. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill totally ignores what is happening in Quebec.  Contrary 
to what my Liberal colleague was saying before me, the proposed 
bill does not complement the legislation in Quebec.  It is a 
step backwards from it.  The legislation in Quebec, known as the 
act respecting the protection of personal information, has been 
widely praised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as protecting personal information is concerned, Quebec 
sets an example. Quebec is the only government in North America 
to have such an act. Unfortunately, the federal bill does not 
seem to have be sufficiently inspired by the Quebec law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of talking nonsense, like members opposite, I would like 
to quote three independent, impartial and non political 
authorities, who are very clear on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there is the MacKay report tabled not so long ago. The 
MacKay report, and in particular the Owens report on the 
protection of personal information carried out for the MacKay 
committee, that said that a literal interpretation of the Quebec 
legislation shows that it applies to banks as well as other 
financial institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Owens also indicated and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec legislation includes a whole list of duties that are 
stricter than what is stipulated in the codes. 
In particular, the standard concerning consumer consent is more 
severe than the standard found in voluntary codes. A file must 
be opened to record the information and only the necessary 
information can be collected; finally, the legislation specifies 
a process to be followed to transfer to a third party lists 
containing the names, addresses and phone numbers of 
individuals. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Bill C-54 is based only on the CSA code. So, we would 
be backtracking compared to what is being done in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I would like to quote from the 1997-98 annual report of 
the Quebec commission on access to information, an independent, 
non partisan organization that has a lot of credibility in 
Quebec. The annual report says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission has examined the consequences of introducing 
Canada-wide standards and legal principles regarding privacy on 
the information highway. Under the terms of a proposal submitted 
to the ministers responsible for setting up this highway, this 
protection would be based on the voluntary code of practice 
developed by the Canadian Standards Association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the commission's contention that, if implemented, this 
proposal would represent a setback on the privacy issue in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This contention is based on a comprehensive review of the CSA 
code. There is good reason to be pleased with the Canadian 
industry adopting such a code. 
This marks quite a breakthrough, stemming from an interesting 
analysis of the OECD guidelines on privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the CSA code does not meet the objectives of the 
personal information protection system established under the two 
Quebec laws, namely to guarantee to all citizens an impartial 
and fair solution to any problem or conflict that may arise with 
regard to the protection of this most important aspect of one's 
privacy. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report says also: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the Commission suggested to the Quebec Minister of 
Culture and Communications that she remind her counterparts that 
Quebec has such a statutory system in place. According to the 
Commission the Quebec system is the only response to the 
challenges of the information highway that respects the rights 
of citizens. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This needs to be stressed, for the benefit of my hon. colleague 
who had her head in the sand. In the commission's view, the 
Quebec system is the only response to the challenges of the 
information highway that respects the rights of citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the PQ or Bloc members, or even separatist, 
speaking, but the Commission de la protection des renseignements 
personnels, an independent organization. Once again, we see that 
the government does not listen to what anyone says in Quebec, 
except the sheep in the Liberal government. Even completely 
independent organizations do not have that ear of this 
government that could not care less about the situation in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote for the benefit of my colleagues another person, 
one who is not a Quebecker this time. The government is more 
likely to be sensitive to these arguments. 
The federal privacy commissioner, Mr. Bruce Phillips, said, and 
I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Building Canada's Information Economy and Society” is revealing 
in that it lends priority to economic issues over social issues. 
As such, the focus on electronic commerce precedes the goal of 
protecting personal information; the paper also indicates that 
the federal government wants to engage Canadians in a variety of 
network activities first and then develop protection of privacy 
later. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this government's own creatures recognize that Bill C-54 
does not protect personal information at all, not at all, 
perhaps an alarm bell should sound in the heads of our leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to conclude by saying that the purpose of this bill 
is to promote electronic commerce, not to protect privacy. This 
is a fundamental flaw in the legislation, and we look forward to 
this government taking into account the general consensus 
reached in Quebec, and even outside Quebec, on this issue. The 
government should reconsider and amend the bill to ensure that 
it provides real protection of privacy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK189"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with great pleasure that I rise following the excellent speech 
made by my colleague from Charlesbourg, who has two great 
qualities. He is a lawyer and a humanist, and I think being a 
humanist makes him prouder than being a lawyer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to dedicate my speech to the charming member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, but first, I want to wish all the best 
to the Bouchard government. As we all know, that government is 
headed for an election and will be re-elected with an 
overwhelming majority, although we are not taking anything for 
granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That government will be re-elected because it has done a good 
job. 
Spontaneously, when reflecting on the outgoing government, one 
obviously thinks of how it defended Quebec's interests at every 
turn, but one also thinks of a whole series of very important 
measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the $5 day care program. I think many people in the 
riding of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine benefited from that program. 
There is also the work the CLDs are doing on employment.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I could provide numerous examples of a dynamic government that 
has protected Quebec's interests and paved the way to 
sovereignty, always keeping in mind the need to implement a 
social democratic project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am taking it upon myself to prepare the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, who, as we know, is a sensitive woman, 
to the inevitable fact that, if we all do our part, it will be 
re-elected, because it was a good government. I invite my 
colleagues to take part in a show of exuberance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Today, we must deal with the bill before us. 
Members can imagine the paradox. This started as an ordinary 
Friday, like any other. However, the Bloc Quebecois—under the 
great leadership of the hon. member for Mercier, and since there 
is far too little leadership from the government across the 
way—changed everything and will do its utmost to block this bill, 
when it could have passed very easily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Let us talk about this bill. The hon. member 
for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine should pay attention, to the extent 
of course that she can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with a bill that goes against one of our human 
rights, namely personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone with a bit of common sense would have thought that the 
Minister of Justice would be the one to rise in this House, 
since we are dealing with human rights, the Canadian Human 
Rights Act, the human rights declaration, the Canadian charter of rights 
which is, in many respects, mediocre, but which nevertheless has 
the merit of providing some protection for one's privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because this government is warped, because its thinking is 
muddled, it is attempting and proposing to deal with the whole 
issue of the protection of privacy, an area which is of 
paramount importance, as pointed out by the hon. member for 
Charlesbourg. Today, with computers, new technologies and 
electronic data processing, there is a considerable flow of 
information in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very title of the bill is unbelievable.  Any law student at 
UQAM, Université Laval, University of Ottawa or wherever who 
handed in a draft with a title as convoluted as the one I am 
about to read would be immediately and roundly criticized by the 
professor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members to brace themselves—again, I urge the member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine to listen—and take a look at the title. 
They will understand the Bloc Quebecois' objections.  Had it not 
been for the Bloc Quebecois, this government of sheep, this 
blind and insensitive government, would once again have tried to 
pull a fast one on Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The title says it all.  It goes like this: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An act to support and promote electronic commerce by protecting 
personal information that is collected, used or disclosed in 
certain circumstances, by providing for the use of electronic 
means to communicate or record information or transactions and 
by amending the Canada Evidence Act, the Statutory Instruments 
Act and the Statute Revision Act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talk about confused.  What blatant dishonesty—I think the word is 
parliamentary—telling us that the bill we are debating today is 
an attempt to respect people's privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that the member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, who has a 
law degree, if I am not mistaken, will remember her introductory 
course— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings:</B> With high marks on the bar exam. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> What do they say in introductory law?  They say 
that the best legislative texts are the shortest ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the law maker is unable, in one sentence—subject, verb, 
object—to express an idea, the public is in trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out, and we can never do so often enough, that 
what we are seeing today is not a desire to protect personal 
information originating with private organizations, but a basely 
mercenary attempt to make it easier for business to access 
private information.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not let that happen. Clearly, it is not too late.  If 
the government, which as members know belatedly included the new 
elements, wants to co-operate with the opposition, we can have 
the bill withdrawn.  We could ask pages immediately to go from 
desk to desk to collect the copies of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, that will not happen, because the government is stubborn. 
As my grandmother used to say it is “hardheaded”.  Fortunately, 
the Bloc Quebecois is here and we will not allow the government 
to move unchallenged toward dictatorial powers.  That should be 
made clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hasten to say, to the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine 
in particular, that there is a Quebec model in the area of 
co-operation and respect for human rights, a model enacted by the 
Parti Quebecois which, as we all know, will be re-elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That model has been endorsed by the people of Quebec.  A few 
years ago, Quebec passed a bill that protects privacy in the 
public sector, which goes without saying, and another bill 
passed in 1994 by the National Assembly, the only assembly in 
North America controlled by francophones and other Quebec 
residents.  In 1994, the National Assembly extended the 
protection of the act to personal information in the private 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the government members to name one organisation in 
Quebec that did not applaud this excellent measure, that not 
only did not applaud it, but that also did not wish it applied 
throughout North America? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not have been wiser for the government to learn from 
this and to propose a bill including principles similar to those 
found in the Quebec legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see that my time is almost up. However, in the spirit of true 
co-operation that exists on both sides, I wonder, Mr. Speaker, if 
you would be so kind as to seek the unanimous consent of the 
House to extend my allotted time by 10 minutes or so, to share 
with the information I have with the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would appreciate this extension and I would ask the hon. 
members to be co-operative in this regard, because I worked 
really hard to prepare this speech, and I have things I wish to share 
with the House. The responsibility of the opposition is to 
ensure that the government always improves itself. As everyone 
knows, it is a full time job. It is also an exhausting job.

is surely no doubt that electronic commerce is here.  Ensuring 
increased confidence in this process is without question a good 
idea, but is it not of equal importance that all Canadians have 
the same opportunity to this new technology? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Mr. Speaker, I ask the unanimous 
consent of the House to extend the time allotted to the member 
for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve. I think that you do have to ask the 
House whether it agrees or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would appreciate it if you could take the time to ask the 
House whether it gives its consent, and I am sure that you will 
do it with class. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Lee):</B>  I would be happy to put the 
request of the hon. member to the House.  Is there unanimous 
consent?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I 
was wondering why the government would refuse the hon. member a 
bit of extra time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Lee):</B>  The hon. member realizes 
that unanimous consent was not accorded at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is surely no doubt 
that electronic commerce is here.  Ensuring increased confidence 
in this process is, without question, a good idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, is it not of equal importance that all Canadians have 
the same opportunity to this wonderful new technology?  The 
government is forever talking about advancement in technology and 
computer training, how we will not keep up with the rest of the 
world if we do not support these efforts.  I agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and my colleagues in the New Democratic Party believe that all 
Canadians should have that opportunity.  Seventy per cent of 
Canadians are without Internet access.  One of the greatest 
barriers is cost to the individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Churchill River during question period today 
raised the concern that in northern communities we do not even 
have adequate road access. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding there are communities that are just now getting 
single line phone access.  There is one community where there are 
three phone lines:  one in the school, one in the council office 
and one in the health centre.  There was one pay phone which was 
removed when those three phone lines went in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken before of the town of Lynn Lake which lost banking 
services and had to fight for an ATM.  I know this same situation 
will apply in rural as well as northern remote communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a former school trustee I recognize that districts, with the 
huge cuts that governments have made in education and transfer 
payments, are fighting to keep technology within the schools. 
Tech costs and the Internet on-line costs are very prohibitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we had a publicly owned telephone service in Manitoba, I at 
least felt that we all had relatively equal access.  Of course, 
that is no longer the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Larger centres may benefit, but rural remote areas are paying 
the price.  Smaller businesses will be hard pressed to survive 
because of the prohibitive cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was just in Chile and I can say that the majority of its 
citizens cannot afford what should be a basic service, let alone 
electronic commercial banking.  Is this what we want in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If government is not willing to ensure that access is available 
to the majority of Canadians, it is not acceptable.  What it is 
doing is putting in place the foundation for greater disparity 
between the rich and the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect, of course, is job loss.  There must be 
consideration given to alternative training, job opportunity and 
support for affected workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think there are very many Canadian workers or 
businesses who trust the employment insurance and human resources 
department to be there on their behalf.  Most believe it is only 
the finance minister who controls those dollars.  Do we need more 
unemployed in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The privacy of health information is, without question, another 
concern to many Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we hear of computer hacks breaking into all types of 
programs, it is not unreasonable to worry about other personal 
information being made available to outside interests:  banks, 
insurance companies, employers or the man or woman down the 
street. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill fails to protect the privacy of Canadians and it fails 
to ensure equal opportunity for all Canadians.  I will not be 
supporting it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe 
taking the floor after my colleague, the member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, who spoke eloquently, will not be an easy 
task. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say it once more, this bill reflects Canada's two 
solitudes, as the saying goes, two different visions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, Bill C-54's thrust is quite different from the thrust of 
Quebec's legislation. The titles of both laws give us an 
important clue. 
Quebec's legislation is entitled an act respecting the 
protection of personal information in the private sector, and 
the federal legislation is entitled an act to support and 
promote electronic commerce by protecting personal information 
that is collected, used or disclosed in certain circumstances. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1335"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT43"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT43"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1335

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Quebec's law provides for the protection of privacy and 
applies to all organizations, the federal law applies only to 
commercial transactions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of presenting a real bill that would be aimed at 
protecting privacy in the private sector, the Minister of 
Industry is promoting electronic commerce, as his good friend at 
the OECD, Donald Johnston, is asking him to do, and he is again 
challenging the fundamental right to privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Broadly speaking, the Minister of Industry is proposing a weak 
bill; the body of the law is to be found in its schedules and it 
does not give the commissioner any real power. Moreover, its 
form as well as its content will cause confusion; its wording 
will be wide open to interpretation; it will have a Henry VIII 
type clause, whereby the governor in council can amend the law 
without parliamentary debate and without democratic 
consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This last point is crucial because its deprives us of a large 
part of our sovereignty as parliamentarians. One could talk a 
lot about all the changes made to parliamentary structures 
during the last few years. Let us mention, for example, the 
millennium scholarships that will be managed by a private 
foundation, as well as all the other organizations and 
foundations that are being created by the government and which, 
ultimately, with transfer political power to private institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the use, I wonder. of electing people if those who form 
the government keep giving away powers to institutions that will 
manage certain programs without be accountable to the public. 
This really concerns me. Once again, that is what we will see 
with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 27 says that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Governor in Council may make regulations to amend Schedule 1 
to reflect revisions to the National Standard of Canada entitled 
Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This clause fully gives the federal government the right to 
amend the bill by order in council without having to come back 
to parliament. 
It will thus be able to amend the legislation as a result of 
pressure from large Canadian corporations, since we know that 
neither consumers nor citizens organizations contribute to 
campaign funds of Canadian political parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The nationwide harmonization of legislation on this issue seems 
to be a major criterion for ensuring some consistency in the 
protection of personal information, but we were entitled to 
expect that the federal government would build on the four years 
of experience in Quebec in the protection of personal 
information. This is not what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois deplores that the government decided not to 
give the privacy commissioner the power to issue orders. This 
power, which is sadly missing from his capacity to carry out his 
responsibilities in the public sector, should have been formally 
provided for in the bill before us today. 
The absence of this provision will affect the credibility of 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, we fear that, with these weaknesses in the bill, the 
minister will never be able to reach his primary objective, 
which is to promote consumers' confidence in the development of 
electronic commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the Bloc Quebecois has no confidence whatsoever that 
the government will provide the privacy commissioner with the 
resources he needs to do the additional work that has been given 
to him in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know, for example, that the Copyright Board, an organization 
that makes quasi judiciary decisions, did not get additional 
resources after passage of Bill C-32, that doubled its duties. 
Today, the industry minister is forcing it to consider cost 
recovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I mentioned that the federal government did not seem to 
have been inspired by the Quebec government's experience. What 
about that Quebec legislation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, this right to privacy is explicitly recognized in the 
Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, which was enacted 
in 1975. There is nothing ambiguous about section 5: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every person has a right to the respect of his or her privacy. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The right to privacy is also recognized in chapter III of 
Quebec's Civil Code entitled “Respect of Reputation and 
Privacy”, from which I will quote the following sections: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>35. Every person has a right to the respect of his reputation 
and privacy. No one may invade the privacy of a person without 
the consent of the person or his heirs unless authorized by law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>36. The following acts, in particular, may be considered as 
invasions of privacy of a person: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(4) keeping his private life under observation by any means; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(5) using his name, image, likeness or voice for a purpose other 
that the legitimate information of the public; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(6) using his correspondence, manuscripts or other personal 
documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>37. Every person who establishes a file on another person shall 
have a serious and legitimate reason for doing so. He may gather 
only information which is relevant to the stated objective of 
the file, and may not, without the consent of the person 
concerned or authorization by law, communicate such information 
to third persons or use it for purposes that are inconsistent 
with the purposes for which the file was established. In 
addition, he may not, when establishing or using the file, 
otherwise invade the privacy or damage the reputation of the 
person concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>38. Except as otherwise provided by law, any person may, free of 
charge, examine and cause the rectification of a file kept on 
him by another person with a view to making a decision in his 
regard or to informing a third person; he may also cause a copy 
of it to be made at a reasonable cost. 
The information contained in the file shall be made accessible 
in an intelligible transcript. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>39. A person keeping a file on a person may not deny him access 
to the information contained therein unless he has a serious and 
legitimate reason for doing so or unless the information is of a 
nature that may seriously prejudice a third person. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the Quebec government is the only government in North 
America which legislated personal information protection in the 
public and private sectors. Experts state that the Quebec 
legislation governing the private sector is among the best in 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To have a better idea of the benefits of the Quebec law, here 
are a few of the provisions that could have been used as a model 
for the federal legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the objectives of the law are better defined in the 
Quebec law, since privacy has to be protected regardless of any 
commercial concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the Quebec law clearly covers all businesses, either 
profit-making or non-profit-making, while the federal legislation 
provides for personal information protection only within the 
framework of commercial transactions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the Quebec commissioner has the power to issue orders 
while the federal commissioner has no power whatsoever, as has 
been already demonstrated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 45 of the Quebec law provides that a group of persons 
may appoint someone to represent them in a class action suit. 
There is no such clause in the federal legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Minister of Industry, the stakes are clear: to ensure 
that Canada fully contributes to the global economy, 
particularly to the spectacular growth awaiting electronic 
commerce. The figures are astronomical: it is estimated that the 
global electronic market could skyrocket to $200 billion by the 
year 2000 from $2.6 billion U.S. in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, the minister recognized at the last OECD conference in 
Ottawa that the main stumbling block to the development of 
electronic commerce was consumer confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I see that I have a few minutes left and I deplore 
having to conclude my speech in what seems to be a very empty 
House. Is there not a provision in the Standing Orders of this 
House that requires a quorum?

when you said that we had a quorum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I counted 20 members.  Members are

colleagues count for two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry, but when I looked in the House

in Beauchesne's, we would find that only members in their seats 
can be counted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that you have too long an experience in this place to 
think that rules could dictate otherwise; we know for a fact 
that we did not have quorum.  We are asking you to reconsider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> If the hon. member considers the precedents, 
he will realize the Chair can see members anywhere in the House, 
and even in the gallery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I counted 20 members present. I can see them in the House here. 
This decision is final, and I cannot hear any more points of 
order on this. The Chair has ruled and the matter is closed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. Could you 
quote from Beauchesne's? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We maintain that you cannot count members that way, and

matter of integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You cannot check the quorum the way you say it can be done. I am

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have quorum. As I indicated to the House, I made my decision

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I did not think I would have a couple of minutes to 
address this topic.  I do not have a lot to express, but I have 
had constituents come to me and I would like to raise a matter 
with the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The primary concern that people have had with the bill that is 
before the House and the regulations of the Internet and so on is 
that this is simply the tip of the iceberg.  The concern is that 
these regulations are the beginning of an attempt to regulate 
commerce over the Internet in such a way as to discourage 
entrepreneurs in Canada.  That is a key point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are really concerned that when we begin to meddle in this 
the intention may be good at the beginning, but these regulations 
will discourage entrepreneurs in Canada.  It will somehow force 
those who want to do business over the Internet to establish 
themselves outside Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need the assurances of the government that it is not heading 
in this direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the other concern they express is that when we 
begin to regulate, at some point we may begin to tax.  This may 
be the tip of the iceberg.  There may be taxes coming down the 
pike that would tax the various transactions that are going to 
take place over the Internet, especially economic transactions. 
This is a concern of people and I have to raise that concern.  I 
am glad I have had a few moments to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the debate is about to collapse, but my 
constituents would not want to see trade and commerce over the 
Internet hampered by what might be at this point an innocuous 
attempt to bring in a tax that would begin to discourage 
entrepreneurs from using the Internet to transact all kinds of 
transactions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-54 seeks 
to promote electronic commerce, while protecting personal 
information, so that consumers can engage in electronic commerce 
with confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of this House, let me first explain in general, 
easy to understand terms what this legislation is all about. 
When we talk about electronic commerce, what exactly are we 
talking about? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about making purchases or transactions—bank 
transactions, transactions with suppliers, with manufacturers, 
with clients—electronically.  These types of transactions have 
been in existence for quite some time. Telecommunications have 
been with us for thirty years or so. 
They have been relatively well structured in terms of standards 
for 25 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for electronic data interchange, it has been governed by 
international standards for more than 10 years.  In fact, 
electronic data interchange is used relatively often by many 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the past ten years or so, large businesses have been using 
it in their dealings with suppliers. That means that a supplier 
does not send a written bill to his client, but rather an 
electronic bill that is received on the client's computer, 
allowing the client to authorize payment after verifying that 
the goods or services have actually been delivered.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening today is an acceleration, and I was going to 
say a democratization of this process. Electronic data 
interchange is not longer restricted to large corporations and 
government. It is now accessible to the average person through, 
among other means, the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far so good. However, if I give my credit card number when I 
make such a transaction, I want to be sure that this number will 
not be used for other purposes than those for which I wrote it 
on the electronic form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be sure that somebody will not use my credit card 
number to travel around the world. 
Of course, I would only find out about it when receiving my 
statement at the end of the month. It would be terrible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>True, particularly well equipped hackers might be able to get at 
that information. But we have the tools to make it very 
difficult for them. One should not generalize and panic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to recognize that in everyday life, you and I and a lot 
of other people are using their credit cards in a lot of 
establishments, restaurants, clothing stores, to subscribe to a 
magazine. Our credit card number is handled by strangers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I go to the restaurant and I pay with my credit card, the 
waiter takes it away for a while to pass it through a mechanical 
device or a magnetic tape reader to charge the check on my 
account at my credit card provider. During those few minutes, he 
or she could take note of my number to use it improperly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in 99.99% of the people are honest and that kind of 
fraudulent use of credit card simply does not happen. But it is 
true that there are fraudulent uses of credit cards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Monique Guay:</B> Mr. Speaker, could you, please call the House 
to order? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Yes, this is ridiculous. And it is such a great 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sure that all hon. members would want 
to hear the speech by the hon. member for Laurentides. 
I, for one, can hear it very distinctly. I would ask her to 
continue without being interrupted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Monique Guay:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I personally listen 
to my colleagues with great pleasure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying, if a dishonest person wanted to get some credit 
card numbers to use it for his or her own profit, that would be 
perfectly possible unless protective measures are taken. That is 
where all the question of electronic commerce facilitation kicks 
in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I feel that my purchasing something on the Internet might 
reveal things I do not want to be known, such as what I am 
buying, how much I paid for it, what my credit card number is or 
other confidential information I might give, if I am not 
convinced it will all remain confidential and will be used for 
the intended purpose only, I will be very reluctant to engage in 
any electronic transaction. I would not do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, if the legislation were to require businesses to take 
the appropriate steps to ensure that all electronic transactions 
are secure, confidential and protected, then we would feel much 
more at ease and e-commerce would blossom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the two problems that can arise in terms of protection 
of personal information? First, there is the illegal access to 
the information by someone who is not entitled to see the data. 
Of course, none of us would like information about us to fall 
into the hands of people who should not have access to it. That 
is the first problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, there is also the misuse or illegal use of the 
information. Someone who should not even have had access to your 
information is using it to harm you or for some other illegal 
purposes. So, it is important to ensure that the information can 
only be accessed by the people who are entitled to see it, by 
the final recipient, and used  for the purposes for which the 
information was made available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this area, Quebec has been fully protected for four years now 
through its Act respecting the protection of personal 
information in the private sector. The bill before us today, 
Bill C-54, only deals with businesses. 
It does not extend to any other activity and has some serious 
deficiencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is extremely important because, whether we like it or not, 
electronic commerce is bound to expand. It is here to stay.

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have nothing against the fact that the rest of Canada is 
passing legislation. It makes sense to do so. However, we want 
to make sure that the act in effect in Quebec will remain in 
effect, and we do not want yet another imbroglio after all the 
ones we have had in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can make a judgment on how the Canadian federation has worked 
in the past. We can condemn duplication. We can say that things 
should have been done differently. We can propose ways other 
than those used in the past. 
If there is one area where the industry does not want two 
levels of legislation, and does not want to get dragged into 
problems relating to the constitution and to the interpretation 
of the act, it is definitely that of electronic commerce which, 
in any case, will be significantly affected by the need for 
international agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill opens the door to several interpretations, and it also 
provides a discretionary power to the governor in council. But 
the governor in council is really the cabinet. It is the 
government which, under clause 27(<I>d</I>) can decide to change the 
application of the act, without having to go back to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That principle is not often found in legislation and, under the 
British tradition, is avoided as much as possible so there is no 
abuse of power, particularly in areas as contentious as the 
protection of personal information, where the government itself 
could be involved while having the power to change the law if it 
did not want it to apply in the way it was intended when it was 
adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can also wonder if the bill meets the expectations of 
consumers and of Canada's and Quebec's privacy commissioners. 
The respective titles of both the Quebec and the federal act are 
very explicit. While the Quebec act is designed to protect 
privacy and governs all organizations, the federal act applies 
only to commercial transactions. 
We can see right there that the ideology is totally different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we, of the Bloc Quebecois, find this bill totally 
unacceptable because it is confused, because it uses the 
conditional, because its main component is a schedule and 
because it can be amended by the governor in council without 
debate. This bill will make federal-provincial relations 
extremely difficult for Quebec and will open the door to more 
federal interference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill focuses on electronic commerce, giving second billing 
to the fundamental concept of privacy, to the protection of 
privacy. This bill, in its present form, gives no power 
whatsoever to the commissioner, has no teeth and ignores the 
unique experience of Quebec with regard to protecting personal 
information in the private sector.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
very important as we enter the 21st century and as we are poised 
to participate in a global knowledge based society that we 
debating the issue of e-commerce and the issues of the Internet 
in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to create in Canada domestic policies that provide an 
opportunity to Canadians not only to compete globally but to 
succeed globally.  That means more than simply changing our 
approach to e-commerce.  That means creating domestic economic 
policies that succeed and allow Canadians to succeed.  That means 
effecting change in the structural barriers we have to 
competitiveness and productivity in the Canadian economy, 
eliminating interprovincial trade barriers, reducing the tax 
burden, reducing the regulatory burdens and allowing Canadians to 
grasp the levers of the free market in a global sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new world of globalization that has been demonized as of 
late due to some failures in domestic economies represents more 
opportunities to Canadians than threats.  But we have to ensure 
that the policies we create and the legislation we pass in this 
House are able to guide Canadians and this very important 
industry for Canadians into the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is particularly relevant if we consider the very sparse 
population over a large country. We have already demonstrated 
because of that situation and the position Canadians are in an 
ability to succeed in e-commerce.  My part of the country, Nova 
Scotia, has one of the fastest growing high tech industries in 
the country. 
We are succeeding because of the quality of life issues, the 
death of distance as a determinate in the cost of 
telecommunications and our proximity to markets like New York and 
Boston.

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we, as legislators, have to work with our provincial 
legislatures to ensure that we create policies that allow 
provinces like Nova Scotia, Alberta and Manitoba to succeed in 
this environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the principles of trying to at least come to grips 
with regulating the Internet.  It is extremely important that we 
come to grips with this challenge.  It is not a matter of whether 
we come to grips with the challenge but it is how we will do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>the Internet is a lot like an adolescent in some ways. 
Governments are seeking to treat the industry as an adolescent, 
to try to create rules to control this adolescent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are parenting or creating regulations for adolescents we 
have to realize that adolescents are in a period of change and 
transition.   This industry is in a period of change and 
transition. It is important that we do not create rules and 
regulations that reflect the realities today but that are not 
adaptable to the realities of tomorrow because this industry is 
changing extraordinary quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to balance this whole privacy issue.  Privacy versus 
consumer protection is going to become increasingly important. 
They need not be mutually exclusive in what we do.  There will be 
stresses to  make it very difficult, particularly if we consider 
the global consequences of what we do relative to the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can look at something on the Internet from Finland, for 
example. Finland may be guided by completely different rules than 
Australia.  If we look at something from Finland, we may as 
Canadians be looking at a medium that is controlled by completely 
different legislation from something from Australia. It is very 
important that we do not deal with this complex global issue in 
isolation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has an opportunity, I would argue an obligation, to 
pursue this on a global basis through the OECD perhaps and to 
demonstrate the type of strength that Canada has been able to 
demonstrate in the past as a middle power as being very effective 
in guiding the changes necessary to ensure we balance privacy 
versus protection in this industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was interested in hearing the comments of my colleague in the 
Reform Party.  It is interesting because the Reform Party is 
averse to regulation in this area because it may lead to tax. 
It is kind of a difficult position in some ways for some members 
of the Reform Party.  In a sense as the party of social 
enslavement and economic freedom, it brings the whole 
contradiction of its policies into line because effectively it 
wants to give people all kinds of freedom with their cheque books 
but it wants to control what they do in their own homes. There is 
an inherent contradiction in those policies, in particular when 
we are dealing with issues like the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point that out because as the party of economic and social 
freedom, our party will be consistently vigilant in defending the 
rights of Canadians to succeed in a free market and to also enjoy 
freedoms in their own homes and with their families and in their 
country, the types of human rights absolutely necessary to the 
quality of life in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extraordinarily important that we address the fundamental 
economic issues as well as the tax issues relative to e-commerce. 
I received recently a briefing on some of the e-commerce tax 
issues.  These are becoming increasingly difficult, in particular 
with complex financial instruments like derivatives.  How are we 
as regulators going to track these increasingly complex financial 
instruments?  How can we tax these financial instruments and 
these exchanges through commerce?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I do not have all the answers I probably have more than 
some members opposite.  We need to work collectively, not only 
within the House but with all our provincial counterparts and in 
a global sense with other countries, to ensure we are creating 
regulations for the Internet that will grow and will not inhibit 
our opportunities in this extraordinarily important area in which 
Canadians can prosper and succeed in protecting the privacy of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this juncture we are debating the MacKay task force and 
discussing changes in the Canadian financial services sector.  No 
other sector has been as dominated by technology as the Canadian 
financial services sector.  We are grappling with the idea of 
trying to control the Canadian financial sector.  We are trying 
to create a balance between competitiveness, consumer protection 
and the success of our financial services sector into the 21st 
century.  We must recognize that this industry is controlled 
largely by changes in technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people have bank branch myopia.  They somehow think the 
prevalent provider of banking services is still the bank branch. 
It may be now but in 10 years we will find it difficult to 
explain to a new generation that we used to go to a bank branch 
to withdraw money and to talk to a loans officer.  More and more 
of these functions will increasingly be done in front of a 
computer terminal.  That is why any legislation debated in the 
House needs to consider the incredibly dynamic risks and 
opportunities of this new medium of e-commerce through the 
Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will miss the point if we ignore the impact of technology on 
sectors like the financial services sector and if we pursue 
policies and procedures like the Liberal witch hunt on the 
banking industry that was conducted last summer.  The Liberals 
are wont to sacrifice good public policy at the pyre of political 
palatability.  That is the Liberal way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend my colleagues opposite.  There has been a 
proselytization that should be commended.  As we debate 
e-commerce in a global environment, we should remember that it 
was not that many years ago that many members opposite fought 
vociferously against the free trade agreement which paved the way 
to allow Canadians to compete and succeed in the 21st century. It 
was our party that was proud and steadfast in defending the 
principles of free trade and in defending the opportunities for 
Canadians to compete in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest David Orchard would find a more natural home among the 
social and economic Luddites opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  Do I not get a chance to reply to that vociferous attack 
on Reform about—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak today on Bill C-54 concerning electronic 
commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, let me read the title of the bill. It is highly 
important in this debate, because it sets out the main goals of 
Bill-54. The title reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An Act to support and promote electronic commerce by protecting 
personal information that is collected, used or disclosed in 
certain circumstances, by providing for the use of electronic 
means to communicate or record information or transactions and 
by amending the Canada Evidence Act, the Statutory Instruments 
Act and the Statute Revision Act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will have realized that this bill promotes the 
development of electronic commerce instead of the protection of 
personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings:</B> What is the short title? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Mr. Speaker, I truly appreciate 
comments from the members opposite, it shows that they are 
listening, but maybe they could listen carefully. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1420"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill should deal primarily with the right to privacy. It is 
ironic however that the Minister of Industry should have chosen 
to include the privacy provisions in a schedule of the bill. But 
what is a schedule? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A schedule should contains additional or secondary provisions. 
And in this case, we can see where the minister has put what 
should be considered as the main element of the bill, the key 
element. He has put it in the schedule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the provisions contained in this extraordinary 
schedule are vague and open to interpretation, excessively so. 
Let me simply give a few examples of some of the unclear wording 
of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 4.2.3 of schedule 1, says on page 41: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The identified purposes should be specified—to the 
individual from whom the personal information is collected. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 4.2.5 of the same schedule says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Persons collecting personal information should be able to 
explain to individuals the purposes for which the information is 
being collected. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on like this at length since I know of at least eight 
of those conditional clauses in schedule 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One does not need a Ph.D in linguistics to understand that the 
use of the conditional has nothing to do with an order to do 
something. There is a world of difference between shall and 
should. However, fearing nothing except, of course, the business 
lobby, the minister even specified in clause 5 of the bill, and 
I will quote because it is really worth it— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphon-Guiral:</B> It seems that for some hon. 
members, the difference between the present and the conditional 
has no meaning. This might explain why things are so bad here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Is there no whip on the other side? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Obviously, there is much enthusiasm for the 
speech of the hon. member for Laval Centre, but I would ask 
enthusiastic members to be a little more restrained so that we 
can understand what the hon. member for Laval Centre is saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will speak about 
the use of the conditional, for the benefit of the many people 
who are following this debate. The use of the conditional points 
to a recommendation rather than an obligation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who still had a doubt about the good faith of the minister 
are now forced to recognize that the provisions of schedule 1, 
which provides for the repeal of provisions relating to the 
protection of privacy, have no imperative or mandatory 
character. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While reading the bill, I stumbled onto clause 11 relating to 
complaints. It floored me. I suggest that members listen 
carefully to my reading of this clause and hold on to their 
seat, because it could a rough ride. 
This clause reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An individual may file with the Commissioner a written complaint 
against an organization for contravening a provision— 
</UL>
<Members should note the conditional. 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—of Division 1 or for not following a recommendation set out in 
Schedule 1. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a major problem. How can recommendations that are not 
real obligations be binding? I am at a loss to interpret these 
provisions, but I would like the minister to explain this 
masterpiece of ambiguity and confusion to me.  This does not 
augur well for citizens' rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is more. Paragraph 4.3.2 of schedule 1 stipulates: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—Organizations shall make a reasonable effort to ensure that the 
individual is advised of the purposes for which the information 
will be used. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The words “shall make a reasonable effort” can be interpreted 
many ways. It would have been clearer to say that organizations 
shall ensure that the individual is advised. Obviously, this 
government is not very good at creating obligations to protect 
real people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Schedule 1 says “Organizations are encouraged to indicate the 
source of this information”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were to accept as an obligation every invitation extended 
to me, my life would be very unhappy indeed. The provisions in 
this bill show to what extent this legislation is inadequate and 
does absolutely nothing to protect personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However with the development of the Internet and electronic 
commerce, more than ever it is of the utmost importance to 
protect personal information collected by the private sector. 
This bill meets the expectations of neither Quebeckers nor 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Protecting personal information is all the more important as the 
right to privacy is a fundamental right just like the right to 
freedom and justice. 
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted 50 years ago, 
states that no one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference 
with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks 
upon his honour and reputation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec the right to privacy is protected under section 5 of 
the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, which says 
clearly “Every person has a right to the respect of his or her 
privacy.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The right to privacy is also recognized in chapter III of 
Quebec's Civil Code entitled “Respect of Reputation and 
Privacy”. Section 35 provides, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every person has a right to the respect of his reputation and 
privacy. No one may invade the privacy of a person without the 
consent of the person or his heirs unless authorized by law. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 35 goes even further: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every person who establishes a file on another person shall have 
a serious and legitimate reason for doing so. He may only gather 
information which is relevant to the stated objective of the 
file, and may not, without the consent of the person concerned 
or authorization by law, communicate such information to a third 
person or use it for purposes that are inconsistent with the 
purposes for which the file was established. In addition, he may 
not, when establishing or using the file, otherwise invade the 
privacy or damage the reputation of the person concerned. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with pride that I point out that the Government of Quebec 
is the only government in North America to have passed 
legislation, as early as 1982, governing the protection of 
personal information in the public sector. As for the private 
sector, it was dealt with in 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to privacy, Quebec clearly has all the tools it 
needs to ensure that personal information concerning Quebeckers 
is protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the federal level, there is legislation respecting the 
protection of personal information in the public sector, but one 
concerning the private sector was long overdue. In 1982, then 
communications minister Francis Fox announced his intention to 
legislate on privacy in the federally regulated private sector. 
In 1987, the Standing Committee on Justice and the Solicitor 
General endorsed this recommendation in a report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his 1996-97 annual report, the privacy commissioner saluted as 
a fundamental and highly significant event the undertaking by 
then justice minister Allan Rock to enact before the year 2000 a 
bill protecting privacy in the private sector in a real and 
effective fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has recognized that technology makes it 
impossible to provide adequate privacy if the legislation does 
not apply to both the private and the public sector. Bill C-54 
does not meet the requirements, because its topic is indeed 
electronic commerce, with privacy as a side issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite clear that the minister is focusing on the expansion 
of electronic commerce at the expense of privacy. But what 
matters to the privacy commissioner and to all our fellow 
citizens is that the fundamental right to privacy be protected. 
In fact, it is about protecting democracy.

express some concerns regarding how much regulation the bill 
might result in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the biggest problems that business faces in Canada today 
is regulation from government.  Past Tory and Liberal governments 
have both functioned on one guiding principle. 
Now they wish to extend this principle to the electronic commerce 
world.  It seems the principle is: if it moves, regulate it; if 
it happens to stop moving, tax it; and if it is on the verge of 
going under, subsidize it.
