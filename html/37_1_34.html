documents is simply to table a document with a very short

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, under 
Standing Order 36, I have three separate petitions to introduce 
and table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first petition was signed by a group of Winnipeg people who 
call upon government to intervene and do something in the matter 
of spiralling, out of control energy costs.  This group of 
Canadians is calling upon government to set up an energy price 
commission that would hold the oil companies accountable for the 
energy prices that they charge.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
second petition I would like to introduce is a very thick one. 
Literally thousands of Canadians have signed this petition which 
calls on the federal government to increase the amount they pay 
into health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They point out that currently the federal government only pays 
13.5% of the total health care costs and the provinces have to 
deal with the rest.  These people feel that this opens the door 
to a two tier, American style, privatized health care.  They plead 
that the government stops that possible trend and direction.

a group of residents of various communities throughout British 
Columbia who are calling upon government to change the 
relationship or to change the law that pertains to rural route 
mail couriers.  This is the only group of workers in the country 
who are specifically denied the right to free collective 
bargaining.

to present another petition on behalf of thousands of citizens of 
Peterborough who believe that a Via Rail link between Toronto and 
Peterborough should be re-established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They point out that Canada signed the Kyoto protocol and that 
Canada has undertaken to reduce greenhouse emissions.  They 
suggest that developing sustainable transportation, such as 
commuter rail services, is one way of meeting those objectives.

and Peterborough would be environmentally most acceptable.  They

them.

third petition is yet another petition from citizens of 
Peterborough who are interested in re-establishing the VIA Rail 
route. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners point out that there are dramatic cost savings 
in terms of highway costs as compared with rail costs if there 
were a commuter service in the greater Toronto area between 
Peterborough and Toronto, that it would be economically 
beneficial by enhancing employment mobility for Peterborough area 
residents and by making the greater Peterborough area more 
accessible as a tourist and educational destination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These petitioners call upon parliament to authorize the 
re-establishment of VIA service between Toronto and Peterborough.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>QUESTIONS ON THE ORDER PAPER 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I ask 
that all questions be allowed to stand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Is that agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise with regard to questions on the order paper.  I 
put a number of questions on the order paper, two of them a year 
ago.  They will be celebrating their first birthday within 30 
days of the House. This is two parliaments without answers to 
those questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a personal basis, I know the parliamentary secretary is 
trying but the government refuses to answer very important 
questions put there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to Erskine May and Marleau and Montpetit in terms of 
order and substance of those questions.  It has been confirmed by 
the table and the clerk that they meet all the rules and 
procedures of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is, what is the government trying to hide?  This is 
very important because it relates to the sale of military 
equipment to other nations, 40 helicopters and 10 Challenger 
jets.  It is important that we know the answers to those 
questions. Again, what is the government trying to hide?  Why 
does it not answer those questions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an abuse of parliament.  I should be up on a question of 
privilege.  I have four questions on the order paper.  All 
members, regardless of party affiliation, can only put four 
questions on the order paper.  It is a contempt of parliament in 
the sense that members who do have their roster filled on the 
order paper with four questions are then restricted and cannot 
put any further questions on the order paper.  That is not right. 
Technically, it silences members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the government tell me why those questions after one year 
have yet to be answered?  Is there any logical reason why members 
are not entitled to answers to which the Canadian public is 
demanding answers?  It is as simple as that.  When will the 
government cough up the answers to those very important 
questions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am sure all members will 
agree that we consider written questions very important. 
The member opposite's characterizations of what has gone on here 
are perhaps a little inaccurate, and I think he is being overly 
dramatic.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any event, the procedure followed here is not materially 
different from the procedure ordinarily followed for written 
questions.  I explained yesterday and on previous occasions that 
we are working to develop the answers that would be most suited 
to the hon. member.  That customization and extra effort, which I 
have asked the government to put forward, will probably serve the 
member and all the members in the House if he could just allow 
the customary few days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is not an 
exaggeration.  Those questions are there and, in terms of form 
and substance, they have been approved by the Clerk of the House. 
They have been sitting on the order paper for one year.  We are 
demanding answers to those questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, what is the government trying to hide in terms of selling 
military equipment to rogue nations and maybe terrorists groups? 
We do not know.  We are entitled to answers to those questions. 
It is as fundamental as that.  We are following the rules of the 
House.  We want answers to questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  We are getting into 
debate here.  I can still give the floor to the hon. 
parliamentary secretary if he wishes to address the issue 
briefly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is a routine proceeding. 
I think you have been overly generous with the hon. member.  He 
has made his point.  He is waiting for answers to his written 
questions and I have indicated that those answers will be 
forthcoming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member suggests that there has been a year of a 
collection of time here.  I just want to point out to the House 
that this parliament has been in existence for only a couple of 
months.  This is a new parliament.  The member may wish to look 
back into a previous parliament and at another procedure, but 
what we are dealing with here is a relatively new parliament.  In 
good faith, I have indicated to the member that his answers will 
be coming in due course in the appropriate procedure. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
further on that point, I feel very strongly as well that the hon. 
member has a very valid point.  One year is an absolutely 
unacceptable period of time.  It not only spans one year, but it 
spans two parliaments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point raised actually affects me personally.  Frankly, 
my questions are not languishing in some question limbo or in 
some government pool of unanswerable questions.  What bothers me 
and affects me as a member of parliament is that we are limited 
to only four questions.  We cannot ask a fifth.  We have now 
rendered this particular member of parliament impotent, if we 
will, in the matter of putting questions on the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  I am sorry to interrupt 
the hon. member, but I have been advised by the table that those 
questions that were asked during the last parliament cannot be 
carried over into this parliament.  Rules and procedure tell us 
that if hon. members do want their questions answered, they have 
to resubmit the same questions to the government.  I hope this 
explanation serves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
clarity.  I appreciate the member for Winnipeg Centre helping me 
out on this, but in terms of the clarity of this issue, those 
questions were resubmitted.  We have gone through two 
parliaments.  They were put on the order paper last June. 
Following the election, they were re-entered into the system and 
deemed to be in order by the Clerk of the House.  The 
parliamentary secretary— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  I can understand the 
hon. member's frustration, but technically those questions die at 
the same time as the writ is issued.  I will repeat that if the 
hon. member wants to resubmit those questions, he can submit 
those questions again to the government.  In the end, the two 
interventions that I have heard will certainly pass on the 
message that if the government needs to be more effective, it 
will be.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, for my own information and 
so that all members here know what the rules really are, the hon. 
member for New Brunswick Southwest already pointed out that he 
did resubmit the questions since the election to this new 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I understand from the Speaker right now is that if the 
member is serious about getting his questions answered, he should 
resubmit his questions.  Have the rules changed to such a point 
where if we really want a question answered, we have to keep 
resubmitting it over and over again?  How many times can we ask 
the same question or resubmit it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just for the information of the members here, in a situation 
like this, once we have submitted the question and we are not 
getting an answer, is the only way to get an answer to resubmit 
the question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  As I see the situation, 
the questions have been resubmitted and of course they are then 
subject to a timetable.  Like I said, the member's message is 
quite clear and I take it that the government will make the 
effort to respond timely to those questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shall the remaining 
questions stand?

equalization program for the 1999-2000 fiscal year. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister also asked the Minister of Finance to consult 
with provincial and territorial finance ministers on how best to 
follow through on this commitment.  The finance minister has 
recently completed his consultations. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before discussing Bill C-18, let me take a moment to set the 
legislation in context.  I want to briefly explain how the 
federal system of transfer payments works and the importance of 
the equalization program itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government, in partnership with the provinces and 
territories, plays a key role in supporting the Canadian health 
system and other social programs.  The provinces and territories 
deliver their own health care, education and social services, 
while the federal government provides them with financial 
assistance through transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the federal government transfers approximately $40 billion 
to the provinces and territories.  It does this through three 
major programs: the CHST, equalization and the territorial 
formula financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of transfers, all Canadians can expect:  equal access to 
public health care; a safety net to support those most in need; 
the freedom to move throughout the country to seek work; higher 
education and training available to all who qualify; and 
reasonably comparable services wherever one lives.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take a moment to look at each of these federal transfer 
programs individually because there has been some confusion and 
misinformation in the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I will speak to the Canadian health and social transfer. 
The CHST upholds the five medicare principles of the Canada 
Health Act: universality, comprehensiveness, accessibility, 
portability and public administration.  It also ensures that no 
minimum residency period is required to receive social 
assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This block fund is provided on an equal per capita basis to 
provinces and territories in the form of cash and tax transfers 
for health care, post-secondary education, early childhood 
development and social programs. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new funding legislated last fall is the fifth enhancement in 
the CHST since 1995.  CHST cash transfers to the provinces and 
territories will now rise to $18.3 billion in 2001-02, 
$19.1 billion in 2002-03, and $21 billion in 2005-06—at which time 
CHST cash will be 35% above its current level of $15.5 billion. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak briefly about tax transfers.  This is one of the 
least understood aspects of the CHST despite the fact that tax 
transfers are fundamental to how the program functions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1977 under established programs financing, one of the CHST's 
predecessor programs, the federal government transferred tax 
points to the provinces.  The federal government decreased its 
personal income tax by 13.5% and its corporate income tax by 1% 
so that the provinces could raise taxes by an equivalent amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The net impact of tax points on taxpayers was zero.  It was 
totally transparent.  However the impact on the federal and 
provincial governments was very real.  Indeed, tax point 
transfers represent increased revenues to the provinces and 
foregone revenues for the federal government.  It was done so the 
provinces and territories would have direct access to revenues to 
fund health care, post-secondary education and social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 2001-02 the value of transferred tax points will account for 
nearly $16 billion, about half the total amount provided to 
provinces under the CHST.  That point is often forgotten by 
members opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second federal transfer program, equalization, provides 
extra funds to less prosperous provinces to enable them to offer 
comparable programs and services to their residents.  Payments 
are unconditional and provinces can spend them as they see fit. 
In 2000-01 seven provinces are projected to receive equalization 
payments totalling $10.8 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Territorial formula financing or TFF, the third transfer 
program, recognizes the higher costs of providing public services 
in the north.  In 2000-01 payments provided under this program 
are forecast to be $1.4 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the federal government's three major transfer programs 
and, as I mentioned, they provide approximately $40 billion 
annually to the provinces and territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-18 specifically deals with equalization, a program that 
in many ways expresses the generous spirit of Canada. 
Equalization has been in existence since 1957 and has played an 
important role in defining the Canadian federation.  It is unique 
among federal transfers in that its purpose was entrenched in the 
Canadian constitution in 1982. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As stated in the Constitution, “Parliament and the Government of 
Canada are committed to the principle of making equalization 
payments to ensure that provincial governments have sufficient 
revenues to provide reasonably comparable levels of public 
services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation”. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Phrased another way, its purpose is to ensure that less 
prosperous provinces can provide reasonably comparable public 
services without their taxes being out of line with those of more 
affluent provinces.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, seven provinces qualify for federal support under 
equalization:  Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, 
New Brunswick, Quebec, Manitoba and Saskatchewan.  Ontario, 
Alberta and British Columbia are not eligible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that equalization was one of the few programs exempted 
from restraint measures during the mid-1990s illustrates the 
importance the government attaches to it.  The government clearly 
understands what equalization means to receiving provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization has increased faster than anticipated.  It has 
grown by 33%, or $2.7 billion, since our government took office. 
Equalization estimates are updated twice a year as newer data 
become available regarding economic developments and their 
impacts on provincial revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Estimates show that equalization is at its highest level ever. 
The latest official estimates released by the finance minister in 
February show that payments to receiving provinces will be about 
$1.8 billion higher than estimated last October. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These higher figures are not due to the poor economic 
performance of receiving provinces.  On the contrary, payments 
are increasing immediately by an estimated $1 billion due in 
large part to the exceptionally strong economic growth in 
Ontario over the last two years. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of this amount, $52 million is for 1999-2000 and $955 million is 
for 2000-01.  The other $800 million is the additional funding 
that will be provided to receiving provinces through passage of 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me a moment to explain how the equalization program 
operates.  It is quite technical and misunderstood.  Equalization 
is the most important federal program for reducing differences in 
the abilities of provincial governments to raise revenues. 
Federal and provincial officials review the program on an ongoing 
basis to make sure the differences are measured as accurately as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the legislation is reviewed every five years.  The 
last renewal was in 1999.  Payments are calculated according to a 
formula set out in federal legislation, and adjust automatically 
in response to economic developments in the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a province's economy is booming relative to other 
provinces, its equalization payments automatically decline under 
the formula in proportion to the increased wealth of the 
province.  Conversely, when a qualifying province's fiscal 
capacity declines due to a slowdown in its economy, its 
equalization transfer automatically increases. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this way, the program acts as an automatic stabilizer of 
provincial government revenues.  Equalization payments are 
subject to “ceiling” and “floor” provisions. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ceiling provision provides protection to the federal 
government against unexpected increases in equalization payments. 
In other words, the ceiling prevents changing economic 
circumstances from driving equalization payments through the 
roof.  The ceiling thus ensures the program remains sustainable 
in the long run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The floor provision is the other side of the coin.  It provides 
protection to provincial governments against sudden large 
decreases in equalization payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ceiling for 1999-2000 was set at $10 billion and, except for 
the provisions in this bill, will grow at a rate equal to the 
growth of GDP in subsequent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now turn specifically to Bill C-18, which lifts the 
equalization ceiling only for the 1999-2000 fiscal year.  As I 
explained earlier, lifting the ceiling fulfils a commitment made 
by the Prime Minister last September at the first ministers 
meeting. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The communiqué issued at the end of the meeting clearly states 
that “the Prime Minister agreed to take the necessary steps to 
ensure that no ceiling will apply to the 1999-2000 fiscal year. 
Thereafter, the established Equalization formula will apply, 
which allows the program to grow up to the rate of growth of 
GDP”. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the final cost of removing the ceiling will not be known 
until the fall of 2002 when the final estimates for 1999-2000 
become available, the cost is projected to be $792 million. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1040"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That amount will be allocated among the seven eligible provinces 
on an equal per capita basis.  Each will receive the same amount 
of money per person because the ceiling affects all provinces in 
the same way.  Removing the ceiling for 1999-2000 means that each 
receiving province will receive $67 per person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The total breakdown per province is as follows:  Newfoundland 
will receive $36 million.  Prince Edward Island will be eligible 
for $10 million.  Nova Scotia will qualify for $62 million.  New 
Brunswick will receive $50 million.  Quebec will get $489 
million.  Manitoba's payment will be $76 million, and 
Saskatchewan will receive $69 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to clarify an issue relating to the new equalization 
estimates released in February.  The recent announcement of an 
additional $1.8 billion in equalization payments has generated 
reaction among some people.  Some see the funds as a slap in the 
face if their own province's allocation is small, or they 
complain of favouritism if the allocation to other provinces is 
large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization payments are based on a formula that measures the 
relative performance of provincial economies.  That formula is 
applied the same way to all provinces. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All provinces that have a revenue-raising capacity below the 
standard receive payments from the federal government.  Why? 
Because the federal government is committed to the 
idea that all provinces should be able to provide comparable 
levels of service to their residents. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provinces do not receive the same amount of equalization because 
they do not have the same economic circumstances.  This year 
Saskatchewan needs $230 per person to be brought up to standard, 
while Newfoundland needs $2,000 per person.  Per capita figures 
are multiplied by the total population of a province to arrive at 
the total equalization payment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec, despite the second lowest per capita equalization 
entitlement, generally receives the highest total payment because 
of its large population.  At the other extreme, P.E.I., with its 
second highest per capita entitlement, generally receives the 
lowest total payment because of its small population.  I hope 
these explanations will help clarify the issue for my hon. 
colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will review a few points.  All parts of the country cannot 
generate the same revenues to finance public services.  Federal 
transfers, therefore, help ensure that important programs are 
adequately funded.  Transfers also help ensure that all Canadians 
receive reasonably comparable levels of public services no matter 
where they live in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result is that we all benefit from knowing we live in a 
country where health care, education and basic public services 
are provided at roughly comparable levels of quality in all 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In considering the legislation I urge all hon. members to keep 
in mind that federal transfers have increased significantly in 
the last few years.  Over $35 billion has been added to the CHST. 
Equalization entitlements are up $2 billion annually since 
1995-96 and are expected to increase.  Removing the equalization 
ceiling for 1999-2000 will add almost $800 million to transfers 
alone for that year. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to impress upon this House that, through this bill, we 
are fulfilling the Prime Minister's commitment to lift the 
equalization ceiling for 1999-2000, which means more money for 
the receiving provinces.  Bill C-18 underscores the priority the 
government places on equalization and helps ensure that the 
receiving provinces continue to have resources to provide the 
services their people need and want. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude with a quote from the finance minister.  After 
his meeting with the Atlantic finance ministers a few weeks ago, 
he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government in the end always has to act in the 
national interest, and part of that acting in the national 
interest is ensuring that every single province is treated 
fairly. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is exactly what Bill C-18 does.  It continues the tradition 
of fairness with which equalization has been delivered for over 
40 years.  I urge all hon. members to pass this legislation 
without delay.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C-18. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition, the Canadian Alliance, supports the 
principle of equalization payments, but we do have certain 
concerns relating to this particular bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition does support in principle the 
constitutional obligation of equalization but has particular 
concerns with respect to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just heard a fairly comprehensive overview of this 
legislation from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Finance.  We also heard him set it within the larger context of 
federal fiscal transfers to the provinces.  However, the bill is 
quite narrow in its scope, much narrower than my hon. colleague's 
comments would suggest.  It is strictly limited to increasing or 
lifting for one particular fiscal year the ceiling for 
equalization payments.  It does so for the fiscal year 1999-2000, 
now nearly two years past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset, my colleagues and I are bound by the 
democratically approved policy of our party to support the 
principle of equalization.  Our manifesto states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that different provinces and regions of Canada have 
different levels of wealth but all wish to provide similar 
services to their residents.  Therefore we are committed to the 
constitutional principle of making equalization payments to 
ensure that provincial governments have sufficient revenues to 
provide the residents with reasonably comparable levels of basic 
services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do support the notion that in a large and complex federation 
with fairly significant disparities in wealth, income and 
standards of living the federal government ought to play some 
function to equalize access to core public services at reasonably 
comparable levels of taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, we do believe that the current formula and 
structure of equalization should be open for serious debate and 
review.  Most provinces have called for such debate.  We in the 
official opposition would like to be on the record as embracing 
that.  We believe there are many problems with the current 
system, many unintended consequences that have the effect of both 
penalizing those provinces that are successful in terms of 
economic development and growth and penalizing taxpayers in the 
so-called have provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is often observed that in a country as wealthy as Canada it 
is inappropriate to suggest that we have seven provinces out of 
ten that are perpetual have not provinces.  The mentality of the 
current equalization system perpetuates an attitude among some 
which is contrary to economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One point we in the opposition have raised and hope to explore 
is the idea of opening negotiations to look at allowing provinces 
that are now bringing on stream certain non-renewable resource 
revenues to not be penalized in their equalization payments from 
the federal government for those new revenues for at least a 
period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the system is currently designed, there is what many 
economists refer to as a welfare trap phenomenon, where earning 
incremental income, or in this case developing incremental 
revenues to the provincial treasury, results in a proportionate 
reduction in federal transfers to the equalization program.  This 
is a perverse incentive against domestic economic development 
among the so-called have not provinces. 
That is one of the many areas that ought to be explored.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ought to explore whether indeed the formulae are applied or 
calculated on a fair and equitable basis and whether all 
provinces rather than some provinces should be included in the 
calculation of the equalization formula, as some provinces have 
suggested.  We ought to take a hard and close look at the 
application of both the floor and the ceiling of equalization. We 
should see whether this program is really working to equalize 
access to core public services across the country at comparable 
levels of taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been observed by academic economists including, for 
instance, those at the C.D. Howe Institute, that perhaps a better 
way of equalizing access to quality public services across this 
broad nation is through income sensitive transfers to persons as 
opposed to insensitive transfers from one government to another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These economists have asked us to reflect as policy makers on 
the paradox, for instance, that there are members of, say, my 
constituency, a western riding in Alberta that is the largest 
contributor to equalization, who earn below average incomes. They 
are from modest families with modest means who are nevertheless 
obliged to pay a very large share of federal taxes. A portion of 
their taxes goes to finance the equalization program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of my constituents would not object to the general 
principle of sharing opportunity and wealth across the nation. 
However, these economists ask us to reflect on how efficient this 
transfer of wealth is from government to government and from 
taxpayer to taxpayer in a way that is not sensitive to income. 
When the lower middle income family in my riding pays more taxes 
to finance equalization, it may have the impact of improving the 
road system, or the health care system which, for instance, is 
used by, among others, higher than average income people in other 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some economists have suggested that the current way the program 
is designed is perhaps not the best way to maximize the 
equalization of opportunities across the country.  They suggest 
that instead the best way to do that is to redistribute wealth 
from higher income people, wherever they live and in whichever 
province they happen to reside, to lower income people, the 
working poor, who need a hand up.  That is an interesting 
observation by academic economists, which I think ought to be 
included in the broader and more thorough review of the principle 
of equalization and its application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also think that this larger debate unfortunately has not been 
engaged by the government.  Instead, the government tends to 
approach the issue of equalization on an ad hoc basis and in the 
crucible of very political negotiations with the provinces.  That 
is not necessarily the best way to make good public policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out, for instance, that the bill brings to us an 
amendment that lifts the ceiling on equalization payments for the 
fiscal year 1999-2000, pursuant to an agreement struck between 
the Prime Minister and his provincial counterparts on September 
11 of last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will no doubt recall that the date, September 11, 
2000, was about a month before a federal election was called. 
Certainly the Prime Minister had the electoral timeline in mind. 
All of the premiers and public commentators were certainly aware 
of the very distinct possibility of a federal election on the 
horizon.  It was in that very politicized context that this 
agreement was reached.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some commentators have said that what we have before us today, 
this lifting of the ceiling, was a political demand put on the 
table in a horse trading session with the premiers and that the 
Prime Minister agreed to lift the ceiling for at least one year. 
That is not exactly how we ought to make serious, sober public 
policy decisions regarding hundreds of millions of taxpayer 
dollars, in this instance increasing equalization payments by 
some $792 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ceiling is there for a reason:  to protect the federal 
government from unforeseen increases in these payments.  It is 
matched by a floor as well so that provinces are protected from 
an unforeseen reduction in equalization payments.  For some 20 
years now, I think, we have had this system that precludes wild 
variations or aberrations in the payments, either too much or too 
little, to the provinces.  For the Prime Minister to simply 
politicize this very important part of the equalization structure 
in the crucible of an election campaign shows that he is not 
really committed to a serious, sober review of equalization and 
its application.  That is something we would call on the 
government to engage in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to say that my hon. colleague from Portage—Lisgar, 
who is the official opposition critic for regional equity, will 
be speaking to the bill later today and will perhaps outline some 
of the principles he thinks should be included in a general 
review of equalization and the federal-provincial transfer 
arrangements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party did support certain elements of the accord reached 
between the premiers and the Prime Minister in September of last 
year, particularly with respect to the restoration of funds 
stripped out of the Canada health and social transfer fund since 
the 1995 Liberal budget.  I know I do not need to remind this 
place that in that budget and since that budget, the federal 
government removed some $23 billion in real hard cash dollars 
that were designated to the provinces to finance the highest 
priority program areas of Canadians, namely health care, higher 
education and other social priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In poll after poll Canadians register health care as their 
single highest public spending priority.  Yet when the government 
was given an opportunity to demonstrate its fiscal priorities, 
what did it choose?  It chose to slash, gut and eviscerate health 
care funding to the provinces, a decision that had a very clear 
and tangible impact on the delivery of care to Canadians in need 
of health care.  My colleagues and I for several years now have 
been consistent in saying that this was the wrong choice to make, 
a choice which the Prime Minister sought to undo in the September 
accord of last year, from which this bill derives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the wrong choice to make because it reflected the wrong 
priorities.  Between 1993 and 1999 the deficit was eliminated. 
About two-thirds of that deficit elimination came about through 
increased revenues to the federal government, in part because of 
higher tax rates imposed by it and in part because of automatic 
tax increases through the then deindexation of the tax code and 
various other revenue measures.  Basically because Canadians were 
working harder and working longer hours, they were paying more to 
the federal government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>About two-thirds of the so-called deficit elimination is 
attributable to higher taxes which are now at the highest level 
in Canadian history as a percentage of our gross domestic 
product.  It leaves us with the highest income tax burden 
relative to GDP in the G-8 and, further, the highest corporate 
income taxes in the OECD, the 23 principal industrialized 
economies of the world.  That is the legacy of the fiscal policy 
of tax increases over the past decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other third of the deficit reduction can be traced to the 
so-called spending restraint.  It is the government's worst 
spending cuts.  Three-quarters of the spending cuts involved in 
the deficit elimination exercise came about in the $23 billion 
reduction in transfers for health care to the provinces.  Another 
very large chunk came about through gutting the capacity of the 
Department of National Defence to provide the resources for our 
men and women to defend our sovereignty and meet our 
international obligations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we take out national defence and the CHST, the rest of the 
federal government averaged a spending cut of only 3%.  That 
reflects the fiscal priorities of the government.  It was willing 
to cut health care transfers by one-third, by about 33%, and to 
virtually gut the capacity of our defence forces; but when it 
came to the myriad of other wasteful Ottawa bureaucratic spending 
programs they remained virtually untouched. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give some examples of wasteful programs: the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage with free flag giveaways, multimillion dollar 
handouts, grants to Liberal special interest groups, subsidies to 
bloated crown corporations, and the Minister of Industry with 
billions of dollars wasted on corporate welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the general waste of mismanagement, duplication 
and misadministration of the federal public sector.  It was 
virtually left untouched because the easier choice for the 
government was to pass the buck on to the provinces rather than 
fixing its own problems in its own backyard.  They in turn had to 
pass the buck on to health care consumers.  That is a synopsis of 
the fiscal choices of the government during the past several 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-18 has come before us as part of a package.  It was a 
sweetener to have the provinces accept less than a full loaf in 
terms of restoration of the CHST transfers to 1993 levels.  In 
the September accord last year the governments agreed to increase 
those health transfers to only $21.1 billion.  The money taken 
out since 1993 was at least $23 billion.  The government was 
still about $2 billion short on its CHST cut in the accord that 
it negotiated with the provinces last September.  In order to 
make up for this continued shortfall in critically needed 
health care funding, it offered to raise the ceiling on 
equalization.  That is why the bill is before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like Canadians and my colleagues to understand the 
political and fiscal context of the bill.  In other words, had 
the government not made the wrong choice to slash health 
transfers by a third in 1995, had it not stubbornly stuck by 
that, and had it instead made different choices and reduced 
wasteful spending in Ottawa programs that do not affect real 
people, we would not have Bill C-18 before us today.  The 
provinces would not have been so short of revenue that the poor 
ones would have demanded this aberrant lifting of the ceiling on 
equalization.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its frantic pre-election effort to cover up the enormous 
mistake it made in terms of slashing the health care transfers, 
the government decided to make a change in the pre-existing, 
longstanding arrangements with the provinces with respect to 
equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not quibble for one moment with certain provincial 
governments and premiers for seeking any way they possibly could 
to get more federal transfers into their provincial treasuries to 
reinvest in the health care and other social spending which had 
been stripped by the CHST.  I do not object at all to their 
principled and effective advocacy on behalf of provincial 
taxpayers and health care consumers in this respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure all my colleagues would agree that it would be in the 
best interests of the administration to have predictability and 
stability in the application of equalization agreements.  We 
ought to try to play by the rules.  Surely we could all agree 
that it is good public policy not to make exceptions from year to 
year.  However the reason the government made the exception it 
did in the bill before us today with respect to the ceiling on 
equalization was to cover up for its own political mistake, its 
enormous policy blunder in its 33% cut in health transfers to the 
provinces since 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not feel the government has much moral authority to come 
before us and say that it has decided out of the kindness of its 
heart for one particular fiscal year to raise the ceiling on 
equalization payments to the provinces to account for unexpected 
economic events two fiscal years ago.  That is nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance knows as 
well as I do that bureaucrats in the Department of Finance are no 
doubt rolling their eyes today as they watch the debate go 
forward.  They know this is undermining the overall integrity of 
their program.  In a way it, politically it had to 
happen in order to reinvest the money that had been taken out of 
the health transfer which the government refused to put back in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without a doubt the bureaucrats are standing there knowing that 
it may be good politics but it is awfully bad public policy.  I 
would just say that we see over and over again this pattern of 
misplaced priorities leading to bad policy outcomes and then the 
government trying to wiggle its way out.  That is what it is 
doing with the bill today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also say, lest the government try to paint itself as the 
great dispensary of Liberal generosity to the provinces, that 
this is a one time, one year deal.  It does not intend to 
continue lifting the ceiling in perpetuity.  If I had an 
opportunity to ask the finance minister's parliamentary 
secretary, I am sure he would be opposed to lifting the ceiling 
in perpetuity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He would probably argue that it would contravene the rules set 
out in the agreements and that if we lift the ceiling, we should 
lift the floor and so on and so forth.  I am sure he would make 
that argument, but somehow he avoided that question.  He avoided 
mentioning why exactly this deal happened and why it applies to 
one year and one year only. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point I would like to add is that the practice of 
retroactive legislation in general is not a good one for 
parliament to pursue.  When we consider fiscal matters, 
estimates, spending authorizations, ways and means motions, 
authorizing tax measures or any form of legislation, a principle 
of parliament ought to be that it ought not to try to 
go back and change history, as it seeks to do in this bill.  We 
should make things right the first time.

the ham-fistedness with which the government administers its 
legislative program.  We will be making so-called housekeeping 
amendments to correct mistakes that were made in the bill some 
time ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An enormous amount of parliament's time is consumed with 
correcting the mistakes the government makes in its legislation. 
Today we are seeking to change an agreement with the provinces 
from two fiscal years ago to help save the Prime Minister's hide. 
It was a deal he made at the last minute before a federal 
election to make up for his callous and irresponsible 33% cuts in 
health care transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that point I express my disappointment with the government 
for the manner in which it has handled its fiscal relationships 
with the provinces over the past number of years.  I express my 
hope, although not my expectation, that it will begin to get 
things right in terms of long term stable and predictable cash 
transfers, tax points and equalization to the provinces so that 
we do not have these last minute deals and we do not need this 
kind of retroactive corrective remedy in legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to join the debate on behalf of our finance critic and on 
behalf of the other members of the NDP caucus to share our views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am one of the many Canadians who believes that the 
redistribution of wealth through the federal transfer payments 
and through the federal equalization payments is probably the 
single greatest achievement of the Canadian federal state.  It is 
a concept that finds its origins in a generosity of spirit and 
what is a very real belief that most Canadians share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They believe that even though all regions of the country are not 
equal we should be striving for equal treatment in all areas.  We 
should be guaranteeing at least some constant minimum standards 
in social programs throughout the country no matter what the 
economic situation of the region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should make it abundantly clear that the NDP has always 
supported the many incarnations of transfer payments and 
equalization payments throughout history.  It is interesting to 
note that the change in the distribution programs indicates a 
fundamental policy shift on behalf of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many years ago we had the EPF, the established programs 
financing. It was equal 50:50 funding for established programs 
within the various provinces.  My political party always believed 
in a widely shared view that there was a far greater ability for 
the federal government to control and to implement some national 
standards when the funding formula was 50:50.  It was simple.  If 
one of the provinces chose not to comply with the national 
standards put in place they were jeopardized in that 50:50 
funding formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The established programs financing worked very well.  We then 
saw the CAP, Canada assistance plan, come in, followed by the cap 
on CAP.  Then came the CHST.  Now we are seeing a removal of the 
cap of the new ceiling imposed in a temporary way.  I will deal 
with that in greater detail later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say at the outset for those whose interest I will 
probably lose in the next few minutes that we are very critical 
of the bill.  Speaking on behalf of many of the provincial 
finance ministers, even though the cap is to be lifted for one 
year, when the cap is reinstated one year from now it will be at 
a lower level than most of the finance ministers understood it to 
be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provincial finance ministers thought that they had an 
agreement on a certain set of circumstances.  They are now 
finding that what is being announced today, the newly imposed 
ceiling, will be lower than what they thought they agreed to on 
September 11, 2000.  That is a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is certainly a problem in the province that I come from.  I 
have spoken about established programs financing and the history 
of the CAP, the cap on CAP and the CHST.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad that previous speakers have pointed out the 
devastating impact of the CHST on social programs in the country. 
It should be stated clearly and abundantly by the opposition 
members, so that the public hears it over and over again, that 
the government stripped 33% of the funding out of the federal 
social transfers with the CHST.  I believe the total figure since 
1995 has been $23 billion or $24 billion.  The government went 
from $19.1 billion to $11 billion in social transfers.  Slowly it 
has been inching it back up.  It went to $12.5 billion to $14.5 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In these figures, and from what sense I can make of them, we 
will be at $15.5 billion.  With some other features the amount 
will be close to $18 billion.  It is still below what it was in 
1995, in spite of all that has occurred since then, including 
greater revenues and a surplus for the government.  We are not 
getting any government largesse, we are getting the restoration 
of some of the money it stripped away from the federal transfers 
in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the Canadian public is not buying this line that the 
government had this fabulous meeting on September 11, 2000, that 
the provincial finance ministers convinced it to be more 
generous, so the government agreed and now it is more generous. 
The government is still as miserly and as shortsighted as ever in 
its commitment to try, what I believe to be the single greatest 
achievement of Canadian federalism, to redistribute the wealth 
through federal transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was pointed out that we have to look at some of the other 
origins of the money the government is claiming to share through 
its great largesse right now.  Let us not forget the cuts in 
programs worth $23 billion or $24 billion.  The cuts to the EI 
program accumulated a surplus of $35 billion to $37 billion, 
depending on who we talk to.  Much to the government's discredit 
this money went into the consolidated revenue fund to be used for 
whatever it saw fit.  It did not go into any kind of an 
insurance fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing that has almost blown over, and I cannot believe 
it does not get raised in the House of Commons more often, was 
another great pool of dough or source of revenue that the 
government stumbled upon which was the public service pension 
plan surplus. It took $30 billion out of the of that surplus. 
Rather than negotiating some deal so that some would go to 
benefits and some would go to offset future premiums, every 
single nick of it went into the consolidated revenue fund to be 
used for whatever it sees fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dribs and drabs of it are going back to actual Canadian citizens 
in the regions in which we live.  Little bits and pieces are 
being sliced off scrap by scrap.  Then with some great fanfare 
the Liberals announced $23 billion or $24 billion in extra 
spending.  I think of the members of the House of Commons know it 
is a myth, it is an illusion and it borders on a cruel joke being 
perpetrated on the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government can fool some of the people some of the time, et 
cetera.  This is not going to wash.  The jig is up on this 
particular funding formula because there is going to be a hue and 
cry with the growing realization of where this money really is. 
The government cannot take our money away from us, then give it 
back slowly and try to pretend that it is some kind of great 
largesse on behalf of a benevolent government.  That is simply 
not going to fly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the equalization program was renewed in 1999, the ceiling 
was reduced by roughly $1 billion per year, in spite of the broad 
objections from virtually every finance minister in the various 
provinces, to an arbitrary level of $10 billion in 1999-2000.  It 
was then indexed by GDP growth in subsequent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program ceiling is now lower as a proportion of GDP than the 
entitlements have ever been under the current five province 
standard.  The program was at the lowest level ever at that point 
in time.  At the time the ceiling was reduced the federal finance 
officials indicated that this level would provide ample room to 
accommodate entitlements over the present renewal period.  Recent 
estimates have proved them wrong.  This is the source of 
frustration on behalf of the provincial finance counterparts.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current estimate of equalization entitlements for the 
1999-2000 fiscal year, the very first year of these new 
arrangements, exceeds the ceiling by close to $800 million.  That 
is the origin of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact on my home province of Manitoba is presently 
estimated at about $76 million.  This amount has been agreed to 
now but as the ceiling gets lifted Manitoba will, in the coming 
fiscal year, get about $76 million.  This is very welcomed and 
necessary money.  Manitoba has places to spend that money because 
God knows it has been coping with the shortage of funding over 
all these years.  Many of its programs have been cut, hacked and 
slashed to the point where they are barely functional.  It is 
critical that my province get the restoration of some of that 
equalization money to put back into the programs that it finds 
necessary for our people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary told us that we could not just look 
at the CHST transfers.  He told us that we had to look at the tax 
points as well.  It is not just the $18 billion or so total CHST 
payments, but we have also transferred the ability to tax to the 
provinces.  Let us look at that as a fundamental policy shift too 
and who that benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government only pays 13.5% of health care funding 
which is below the 50:50 ratio in the good old days.  It has 
reduced it to the point where it is only paying 13.5%.  It is now 
letting the provinces do the taxing.  How does the general public 
like that?  The general public does not like anybody who is 
responsible for deducting money off their pay cheques.  The 
government has off-loaded the burden of the collection of taxes 
to the provinces through a tax point transfer.  It has withheld 
money to the point where the funding relationship is 87% paid by 
the provinces and 13% paid by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a flawed concept now.  It is a system that had its 
origins in a very noble concept, which was the redistribution of 
wealth through federal transfer payments to ensure some national 
standard of quality social programs for all Canadians, no matter 
where they live.  This is the kind of thing that nations are 
built on.  This is the kind of thing that does more to hold 
Canada together than any 10 constitutions.  This one aspect of 
the Canadian Constitution probably does more to keep the country 
together, even more than Peter Gzowski and the CBC, which is a 
very bold and dramatic statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see a familiar pattern as we look at the details surrounding 
what has been introduced today and what the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Finance outlined.  We hear talk of 
the equalization ceiling which is the maximum payment that the 
federal government will make to the provinces under the 
equalization program.  That ceiling is set in the upper limits on 
the growth rate of equalization entitlements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the goal should be to protect the federal 
government from rapid and unaffordable year to year increases in 
payments.  That is all very well and good but that is also based 
on the premise that there will be some stability and 
predictability out there.  Need does not always follow convenient 
budget lines in a budgetary plan.  I argue that the need is great 
in many parts of Canada.  We cannot have economic development and 
independence and the type of economic growth in areas until all 
come up to a base level starting point.  We are then talking true 
equality within the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing more unfair in the world than treating unequal 
parties equally.  This happens in all kinds of applications.  I 
hear that sometimes in the speeches made by Canadian Alliance 
members who want all the provinces treated equally.  That means 
recognizing that not all provinces are equal.  Some are quite 
unequal in terms of their opportunity and the resources they 
enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the provinces and the territories called for the removal of 
the ceiling on equalization payments as recently as August 2000. 
They were demanding that this ceiling be lifted because they 
believed that the ceiling acted as a barrier for them to get 
their fair share of the wealth that should have been 
redistributed, money that was taken from the provinces in cuts to 
program funding over the years which amounted to 33% or $24 
billion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is inherent financial protection for the federal 
government on the growth of equalization payments through 
population adjustments and shared revenue fields.  When it comes 
to population adjustments, some provinces are going to do better 
than others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at it on a per capita increase, if the dollar 
figure is approximately $67 per head, the obvious impact on 
provinces showing a net population growth, by ratio and 
proportion, is they are going to enjoy more of the money being 
shared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current distribution of the extra federal transfer payments 
just took place.  We saw the province of Manitoba getting only $3 
million which really was not much to celebrate or write home 
about.  We saw the province of Quebec get $1.4 billion out of $2 
billion.  The rest of us divided up what little was left over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the way these things happen.  It is a formula we have 
all agreed to.  I do not think anyone resents that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In dealing with shared revenue fields, the majority of the 
equalization entitlements stem from tax revenues that are jointly 
shared with the federal government.  For example, during the 
fiscal year of 1998-99, the federal government increased the 
equalization entitlements by $368 million respecting personal 
income taxes, and then by $259 million respecting corporate 
income taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same period the federal revenue was increased by $2.7 
billion from personal income taxes and $1.5 billion from 
corporate income taxes.  This is quite a disparity.  Certainly a 
great deal of the revenue that we felt could have been 
transferred to the provinces, or could have raised that ceiling, 
failed to go into the hands of the provinces.  We presume it was 
put to other priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent federal surpluses have exceeded the size of the entire 
equalization program.  That is something to remember.  Again I 
ask the House to look at where those surpluses came from.  They 
did not just sprout out of the ground.  They did not grow on 
trees.  They were taken from cuts to program funding in the 
amount of $23 billion or $24 billion.  They came from surpluses 
in the EI fund which meant denying benefits to workers so that no 
one qualifies anymore.  The House may be shocked to hear that the 
surplus figure in the EI fund is $750 million a month.  That is 
where some of the extra revenue came from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another pot of dough to which I alluded earlier in my 
speech, something we do not hear enough about in the House of 
Commons.  It is the public sector pension plan.  The public 
sector pension plan had a surplus of $30 billion, partly because 
of layoffs and wage freezes in the public sector.  Actuarial 
people had made the projections of what needed to be in the pot 
based on 1985 and 1987 figures.  Obviously when one-third of the 
public service was cut and when wages were frozen for eight 
years, the actuarial figures were no good to anyone anymore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wound up with a $30 billion surplus and the federal 
government took every penny of it away from where it should have 
been.  We would argue it should have gone to benefits or at least 
some combination of benefits to people in the program or possibly 
reducing the premiums or a premium holiday for those who made 
contributions to the program.  Neither of those were 
contemplated.  The President of the Treasury Board simply seized 
the entire amount and applied it to whatever was seen fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the three sources of revenue.  Now the government is 
faced with a surplus which is larger per year than the entire 
equalization transfer.  That should be alarming to Canadians.  It 
is our money.  People have to keep in mind that it is our money 
to serve the needs of our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal contention was that the 1999-2000 decision to rebase 
the equalization ceiling to $10 billion was appropriate, 
independent of the Prime Minister's commitment.  The way we look 
at it is that the federal government tries to defend the ceiling 
in terms of making the equalization ceiling affordable.  It 
really makes us question the concept when the surplus is bigger 
than the entire payout.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The largest downward rebasing of the ceiling, to $10 billion in 
1999-2000, occurred in the year of the highest ever recorded 
federal surplus of $12 billion, so in the same year that the 
Liberals had never made so much money in their lives, they cut 
the ceiling to the lowest it had been since the history of the 
program.  These are inconsistencies that need to be pointed out. 
These are things that need to be exposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As noted by the federal auditor general, the equalization 
ceiling was rebased downward as a per cent of the GNP in the 
program renewals of 1987 and 1992, but not in 1994.  In those 
program renewals the ceiling went from—and I will read this 
out—in 1982, 1.34% of the GNP.  In 1987 it went down to 1.24% of 
the GNP.  In 1992 it went down to 1.17% of the GNP and then in 
1999 we were down to 1.08% of the GNP or 1.04% of the GDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine what a trend we are showing there.  If we could 
illustrate that as a chart or a graph on a wall, it would show 
this going down and down as a percentage of the gross domestic 
product or the gross national product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can hon. members imagine the purchasing power and the progress 
that communities could have made in the provinces had we remained 
constant at 1.34% of the GNP, which is where we were in 1982? 
Those were kinder, gentler times, I suppose, back in the times 
when we had federal governments that had some vision and some 
willingness to create strong national standards and strong 
regional economic development in other parts of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had we maintained that, the total cumulative amount of money 
that could have been transferred to the provinces would have been 
in the order of $80 billion more during that period of time.  Can 
we imagine that?  For the total transfer today the Liberals are 
talking about a ceiling of $10 billion.  We, by design, willingly 
let successive federal governments reduce their commitment to the 
provinces by that incredible amount of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $10 billion ceiling figure we are dealing with now was based 
on an early federal forecast of final entitlements for the 
1999-2000 year, with an allowance for the transitional adoption 
of new technical changes in 1999-2000.  It was not adjusted when 
equalization entitlements began to rise in 1999.  This led to the 
contradiction, to the gap that the government was forced to deal 
with by lifting the ceiling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the $10 billion ceiling was not adequate to allow for 
the 1999-2000 entitlements, it will be additionally strained as 
the technical adjustments of another $240 million incrementally 
enter the formula.  Imagine the strain on the system and the 
strain on the relationship at that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Returning to the federal auditor general's direction regarding 
the establishment of a ceiling, the federal government did not 
establish criteria for the ceiling beyond it being an estimate of 
the 1999-2000 entitlements, plus an allowance for the adoption of 
the technical changes.  It is as simple as that.  As such, it 
appears that the ceiling level of $10 billion would not satisfy 
the federal government's internal rules established in 1997. 
There is just a host of inconsistencies and problems inherent in 
what we are being told. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the key points that have come to mind as the 
provincial finance ministers are reeling with the growing 
realization that in regard to what they agreed to on September 
11, 2000, even though they called for and welcomed the lifting of 
the ceiling, they will in fact wind up with a ceiling even lower 
than they thought they were agreeing to when the cap is 
reinstated one year from now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This whole situation raises the issue of and really does 
challenge and question the long term viability of the 
constitutional fiscal relationship we have with the provinces. 
There will come a time of growing unrest and growing discontent 
in the regions of the provinces that rely on the federal transfer 
payments.  They will want to revisit the entire structural 
relationship of the transfer of funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said from the beginning, I believe that is a tragic 
mindset, a point of view that I find very threatening and 
disturbing as we look at the long term viability of this tenuous 
federation.  The federal government has to bear some of the 
burden of responsibility for adding that tension to the federal 
state.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly the growing discontent and the growing distrust 
between the feds and the provinces in terms of the fiscal 
relationship is going to exacerbate the whole growing unrest with 
the other general discontent.  There was a time when the 
provinces did feel that there was a commitment on behalf of the 
federal government to regional economic development, to national 
standards within the country and to some commitment that we 
should all enjoy at least some basic level of health, education 
and social welfare funding, no matter where we lived, frankly, 
and no matter what the state of our provincial treasury was. 
Those things should not be considered.  Some things are too 
important to be subject to those regional vagaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am fond of using the story that Reverend Jesse Jackson of the 
United States used when he was talking about our view of 
equalization.  He had a great way of trying to explain what I am 
trying to get my mind around here.  He said that if one has five 
children and only three pork chops, the solution is not to kill 
two of the children, but neither is it a solution to cut the 
three pork chops into five equal pieces, because then all of the 
kids go to bed hungry and nobody gets enough to eat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  And he had an extra child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  The hon. member points out that he had an 
extra child as well.  I may have to alter the story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The social democratic point of view, the way Jesse Jackson would 
have recommended to deal with the problem, is to challenge the 
whole concept that there are only three pork chops. In the 
richest and most powerful civilization in the history of the 
world, neither I nor he can be convinced that we cannot afford to 
provide for the basic needs of Canadians to enjoy decent national 
standards.  It just simply is not on.  It is a myth.  It is an 
illusion.  It is a cruel hoax.  It has been foisted upon the 
Canadian people for far too many years now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the wealth is there.  We have just seen how the Liberal 
government chose to deal with $100 billion worth of surplus.  It 
chose to squander the money on tax cuts, in my opinion.  People 
are always trying to accuse the NDP of seeking to squander things 
on social programs, of squandering money on poor children, of 
squandering money on better health care and education.  I put it 
to the House that the Liberal government has just squandered $100 
billion of our surplus on tax cuts to people who probably need it 
the least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the 1% drop in corporate tax cuts, from 17% to 
16%, what has corporate Canada really done lately to deserve a 
reward like that?  Just that one seemingly innocuous percentage 
point amounts to $75 million to $100 million a year.  Whether it 
makes Canada more competitive, as our right wing colleagues would 
have us believe, I do not really know, but I can tell the House 
that the money could have been better spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are dealing with an era of record surpluses, it is 
galling that we are dealing with an era of record low transfer 
payments to the provinces.  I come from a province that has 
benefited from and still enjoys the relationship that we have in 
terms of being able to use the money transferred to us in these 
federal-provincial financial relationships.  Coming from the 
province of Manitoba, I can speak from personal experience as to 
how worrisome it has been to witness what seems to be a 
deliberate policy shift, a going away from any real commitment to 
a strong central government, a strong national presence and a 
strong influence in national standards across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a graphic representation of what I believe is that 
unwillingness or inability to get involved with national 
standards, and that is watching the government's financial 
commitment diminish from year to year.  It is withdrawing, 
pulling out, abrogating itself from any responsibility for what 
happens in the regions now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps a federal government without vision finds the problems 
just far too tough in some of the regions.  It just cannot cope 
with the reality of Cape Breton or inner city Winnipeg.  It is 
simply turning its back on those areas and saying “You guys have 
a real serious problem, and if you are ever in Ottawa, look us up 
and we will buy you lunch”.  That is certainly how a lot of 
people out in the regions feel about what appears to be—and I do 
not think it is paranoid to assume this—a lack of willingness to 
really try to thread the country together and keep the country 
together with a strong fiscal interprovincial relationship.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a time when fiercely proud Canadian nationalists 
occupied those benches over there.  They were people who had a 
real vision for their country.  I can name some senior Liberals 
in the old days who I think had a real commitment to keeping 
Canada together and to using the constitutional relationship as 
an instrument for building a strong Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now one would think they are trying to dismantle the country 
piece by piece if what they are doing from a financial point of 
view can be taken as an indication of what their true intentions 
and wishes are.  There are people over there who are dismantling 
the country brick by brick and dismantling the faith, hope and 
optimism that Canadians have in a strong central government. 
Sometimes it worries me.  Maybe they are just too busy, but I do 
not think the people across the way give any thought to how 
fragile the federation of Canada is as we speak and at this point 
in our history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we love this country and care about keeping it together, one 
would think we would be pulling out all the stops, more than ever 
in our history, to make the federation work.  It is a federation 
that I feel strongly about.  We in the provinces will work for 
it.  God knows we sacrifice and compromise on a day to day basis 
to try to make the federation work.  We are not seeing the same 
commitment from the federal government, at least as it translates 
into a fiscal strategy, in a period of time when it has record 
surpluses, the largest ever, and also has the lowest ever ceiling 
of transfer payments.  What kind of commitment is that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that the next speaker on the Liberal side will stand 
up and say that the government does not give as much money any 
more, but it gives all the tax points.  It is off-loading the 
burden of taxation onto the provinces and cutting, hacking and 
slashing the flow of real dollars, the real hard cash that we 
actually need for programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking on behalf of the people of the riding of Winnipeg 
Centre and the people of Manitoba, let me say that we have 
serious reservations about the state of the current fiscal 
relationship with the federal government.  We draw the Canadian 
people's attention to the fact that it is an era of record 
surpluses and that those surpluses came from cuts to program 
funding, by and large, and from surpluses in the EI system after 
that.  They also came from gouging the surplus out of the public 
sector workers pension plan.  That is where those surpluses came 
from, so when tiny bits are incrementally released into the 
provinces again I do not think the Canadian public should be 
fooled into thinking that it is some grand largesse on behalf of 
the ruling Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians should be going into this with their eyes open and 
should be very aware that we are not getting all we could from 
the federal government.  If the federal government had a stronger 
vision of how to build Canada into a truly strong national state 
again, it would pay more attention to the regional frustrations 
that stem from the inadequate commitment to funding the CHST and 
the fiscal relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the CHST first came along, the national council on welfare 
called it the most devastating thing to happen since the 1930s. 
It could predict the beginning of the end as we moved from 
established program funding to CAP, to the cap on CAP and to the 
CHST.  It could sense in the wind what was happening there, which 
was that the feds were pulling out of funding these types of 
programs.  Some would say it was so they could give tax cuts to 
their friends.  Others would say that the feds simply did not 
want the burden of responsibility any more.  That is when we 
started to see this downward trend in terms of the overall 
relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have read some of the figures.  The most telling figure and 
the best example to use is the fact that in funding our health 
care the feds now pay for approximately 13.5% and the provinces 
struggle to pay the other 87%.  It is a growing challenge and has 
gone beyond being a fiscal problem.  It is now a problem for the 
health and well-being of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could probably go on about this particular issue as it is a 
topic close to my heart, but I will close with these remarks.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise today to speak on such an important 
topic as equalization.  I will be splitting my time with the hon. 
member for St. John's West today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle of equalization and the notion that we should have 
approximately equal levels of taxation and equal levels of 
services across the country is a sound one.  If there is a policy 
that Canadians are united around and support in principle, I 
think the policy of equalization, as a cornerstone of Canadian 
social and economic policy, is one where there is still a 
considerable level of support across our very diverse country. 
In fact, it is the only constitutionally enshrined spending 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being the case, if we look to the beginning of 
equalization, it has played a very important and, by and large, 
positive role in ensuring equality of opportunity across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the basic principles of equalization, that is the 
generally equal levels of taxation and equal levels of services 
across the country, and look at the reality of what exists today 
across Canada, we will see that there are significant problems in 
equalization in the current context, particularly if we look at 
the disparate levels of taxation across the country. Provinces 
that are in a position to do so are aggressively pursuing tax 
reduction policies that are positive from an economic growth 
perspective within their own jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being the case, we do have an increasingly ghettoized tax 
environment across the country.  Some provinces are having great 
difficulties in addressing and reducing taxes and debt in their 
own provinces, while other provinces are in a much stronger 
fiscal position.  As a result, if we recognize the important role 
that tax policy plays in shaping economic growth and economic 
development policies, we will see that there are some significant 
disadvantages in some provinces that may not have been recognized 
a few years ago based on higher tax levels and that sort of 
thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization, where it should put ladders in front of provinces 
to enable them to succeed, move forward and bootstrap themselves 
into success, in many ways puts barriers in front of provinces. 
There has been a tectonic shift in economic theory over the last 
10, 15, 20 years in terms of the recognition that tax policy 
plays as a lever of economic growth.  Even social democrat 
parties in most parts of the world recognize that one of the 
infrastructure requirements in any pro growth environment, 
particularly in the new economy, is competitive tax breaks. 
Equalization has not been reformed to reflect that evolution of 
economic thought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look over the last 10 to 12 years, Ireland represents a 
tremendous example of a country that has effectively embraced 
some of the evolution of economic thought in this area and did in 
fact adapt successfully in that realization.  Some people compare 
Ireland to Canada and say that what has been done in Ireland 
could be done in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Comparing Ireland to Canada is actually not a very good 
comparison because Ireland did benefit from EU transfers in order 
to facilitate the reductions in taxes and the increase in 
education spending which were so pivotal in enabling Ireland to 
achieve a 97% growth in GDP per capita over a 10 year period. 
Canada achieved a paltry 5% growth in GDP per capita during the 
same period.  So Ireland outstripped our growth rate by almost 20 
times during that period.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if we compare the Ireland example to Atlantic Canada, 
we see some striking comparisons.  There is a beacon of 
opportunity for Atlantic Canada and for any recipient provinces 
of equalization.  If we were to become more creative, we could 
address equalization as a lever for economic growth and not as a 
lever to perpetuate a cycle of dependency.  In the same way that 
Ireland used transfers from the EU to facilitate investment in 
education and to reduce taxes, equalization could be used similarly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the flaws we have in the current equalization system is 
that as provinces diversify their economies and try to find ways 
to increase revenues and achieve greater levels of growth, 
whether it is through the development of offshore resources, 
which is the case in Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, my home 
province, or in the case of a province like Quebec which is 
pursuing a very aggressive biotech strategy, or whether it is 
through revenues from IT, biotech or from offshore, the current 
structure of equalization will eventually result in an 
overwhelming clawback of almost all those revenues, which 
actually perpetuates the cycle of dependency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a province finds itself in a position, because of economic 
development decisions or economic growth in a particular area, to 
pull ahead and actually reduce their level of dependency, the 
federal government actually claws back the lion's share of 
revenue.  In some ways it is the same welfare trap that some of 
our social programs put individuals on social assistance in and 
when they actually get a job they make less money or do not see 
any economic benefit for their initiatives or successes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to be serious about equalization, not as a tool to 
create dependency, not as a political bargaining chip to be waved 
around at election time by the Liberals in provinces like 
Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and Atlantic Canada, but as an actual 
lever to create greater levels of economic growth and 
opportunity, we have to recognize that the equalization reform 
must occur in lockstep with economic development policy reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example of some of the economic development 
issues that need to be addressed in lockstep with equalization 
reform.  The policies for regional economic development agencies, 
ACOA, the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, being one of 
them, need to be reformed.  In Nova Scotia. for example, I think 
the ACOA budget is around $120 million per year.  The total 
federal corporate income tax paid in Nova Scotia is approximately 
around the same amount.  I think it is around $130 million or 
maybe $140 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could actually use the ACOA budget to eliminate federal 
corporate taxes from Atlantic Canada.  This is just one idea of 
something we could do that might create even greater levels of 
growth than perhaps ACOA has created.  We recognize that ACOA has 
had some successes in the past but it has also had significant 
failures.  In some ways, perhaps the ACOA model was a more 
successful model in the old economy than it would be in the new 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to have a very important debate about equalization 
reform and economic development reform.  The campaign for 
fairness that Premier John Hamm of Nova Scotia has engaged in and 
is travelling throughout the country speaking on with opinion 
leaders and public policy makers, is a very important campaign. 
He is pointing out the flaw in equalization that is taking the 
clawback that is resulting in an 81% loss of offshore revenue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every dollar that goes into Nova Scotia from new offshore 
revenue is clawed back by the federal government.  New Brunswick 
may be in the same position in the future, not necessarily 
through offshore revenues but perhaps through some other 
revenues, such as IT development or some other means.  This 
speaks to a larger issue, which is the need for reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to recognize that there is a precedent to 
Premier Hamm's argument that the current equalization system is 
flawed in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equalization payments began in 1958.  Alberta was receiving 
revenues from petroleum at that time and continued to receive 
those revenues until 1965, at which time it had achieved a level 
of economic dependence, which, of course, brought it out of the 
recipient province status and into a contributing province 
status.  During that period of time, between when equalization 
started as a program and when Alberta was able to achieve 
self-sufficiency through the growth in petroleum revenues, 
Alberta continued to receive 100% of equalization revenue.  I 
think that was an important precedent.  That is why Alberta 
Premier Ralph Klein has been supportive of Nova Scotia Premier 
John Hamm's initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we recognize in the House that before 
Albertans had the wisdom, foresight and vision to put oil in the 
ground, it was a have not province.  We and recipient provinces 
are simply looking for the same opportunity to utilize our 
revenues in order to end the cycle of dependency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that in 10 years provinces will be looking back at a 
time when they were recipient provinces.  I also believe there 
will be a significant possibility, if we work collectively and 
the provincial and federal governments share in the vision of 
economic self-sufficiency and opportunity, that we will see many 
of the provinces, which are currently recipient provinces, 
achieve the economic self-sufficiency and opportunity. 
Saskatchewan is another province that has that level of 
potential.  However, it will not happen unless we change 
equalization and adapt the formula to reflect the realities of 
modern economic theory, which is to lower taxes and debt and 
create policies that enable provinces or other jurisdictions to 
achieve those very important infrastructure items.  Unless 
provinces are in a position to do that, we will not see the light 
at the end of the tunnel and economic dependency will be 
something that we will continue to accept in Canada as opposed to 
the notion of economic opportunity in every region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would hope that we would change our approach to 
equalization to recognize that equalization should not just stand 
for the notion of approximately equal levels of services and 
taxes across the country, but that, in a more general sense, we 
should recognize it as an opportunity for provinces and 
individuals across Canada to achieve full equality of opportunity 
and success in the 21st century.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed the comments from the 
member for Kings—Hants.  I think he is trying to be creative by 
putting out some ideas and propositions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The notion that money from ACOA or an equivalent amount could 
result in the elimination of corporate income taxes in Nova 
Scotia is interesting.  I am not sure how that would work at the 
federal level in the sense of uniform corporate tax rates.  That 
is the kind of thinking we need to get into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency allocated 
$700 million to the maritime provinces to encourage innovation 
and transition economies et cetera.  Unfortunately the take-up on 
it has not been significant, but it offers some big potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will touch briefly on the question of offshore resources.  In 
1986 the Canada-Nova Scotia offshore accord was signed.  The 
accord shelters a percentage of Nova Scotia's offshore revenues 
from equalization reductions for a transitional period of 10 
years.  Whenever the accord is triggered, Nova Scotia would be 
able to effectively shelter 90% of offshore revenues against 
equalization reductions in the first year.  Thereafter, 
protection decreases by 10% each year until it reaches zero, at 
which time the tax rate would return to the normal 100%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The accord was never meant to provide a permanent benefit to 
Nova Scotia.  It was triggered in 1993-94 as offshore productions 
began in the Cohasset and Panuke gasfields.  Since then Nova 
Scotia has received a total of $32 million from the accord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to be clear about this.  Any suggestion that 
equalization payments should remain intact while a province like 
Nova Scotia grows richer must be rejected.  If we followed 
through on that proposition we would probably end up paying 
equalization to Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member for Kings—Hants could elaborate on 
those comments.  I refer specifically to the analogy he drew in 
redeploying, let us say, ACOA resources in Nova Scotia to a 
reduction in corporate taxes.  Does he see that at the provincial 
level or the federal level?  How exactly would that work? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question 
from the parliamentary secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The notion was that ACOA, or funding for regional economic 
development programs like ACOA, could be used to address issues 
like corporate taxes which are an impediment to economic growth. 
The idea deserves further debate and discussion.  That is the 
type of thing we should be doing at the finance committee, 
frankly.  We should be taking a hard look at our economic 
development strategies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to say everything ACOA does is wrong.  Some of 
ACOA's involvement has been successful.  However I believe 
aggressive tax strategies could achieve more than direct 
government investment in businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Atlantic innovation fund has not yet, to my knowledge, made 
an investment in Atlantic Canada, although some of its $700 
million has been announced three or four times in various forms. 
The program was announced in a great flurry of media activity in 
Halifax last summer in a pre-election move, after the Liberals 
were once again able to find Atlantic Canada on a map.  With 
media and spin doctors present, they presented the oft-announced 
plan from a Brink's truck in front of the World Trade and 
Convention Centre in Halifax.  The plan has yet to congeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Atlantic Canada no one yet knows how the program will work or 
how the funding will be delivered.  The Canadian Foundation for 
Innovation continues to invest in other parts of the country but 
is holding off to a significant degree in Atlantic Canada until 
the new growth or innovation fund is put together.  It is not 
achieving its goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the clawback, there is a precedent from which 
Alberta benefited.  The member said if that were the case Alberta 
would still receive equalization.  That is not true at all.  His 
argument is wrong because Alberta was able to achieve a level of 
self-sufficiency which prevented it from being able to receive 
equalization.

interim we do not want to lose, in Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, New 
Brunswick or any recipient province, 81% or 81 cents of every 
dollar on clawbacks.  That would prevent provinces like Nova 
Scotia and New Brunswick from reducing their corporate tax burden 
and debt burden and from effectively embracing the opportunities 
of the new economy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate my colleague on his thought provoking speech.  This 
is a topic where I am not sure whether the word we are using 
fits.  We are talking about equalization.  There is absolutely 
nothing equal about the issue we are discussing as it relates to 
the Atlantic provinces.  There is an old saying that everyone is 
equal but some are more equal than others.  Certainly in this 
case we have found out that some across the country are more 
equal than we are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I say I am not sure we are using the right word, I do not 
know if anyone else is sure we are using the right word.  I refer 
particularly to government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some time ago I raised the topic, as I have done on several 
occasions, with the Minister of Finance.  I raised it because it 
is perhaps the most important issue that could be addressed in 
the House, since it relates to the economic well-being of the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not talking just about Newfoundland or Nova Scotia or the 
Atlantic provinces.  I am talking about the country.  We have now 
what we could refer to as federal welfare.  We have a Robin Hood 
system that takes from the rich, particularly in Alberta and 
Ontario, and helps those who need it.  It helps those who, as we 
say, are not equal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we making them equal, however, with the pittance we give 
them?  No, we certainly are not.  We are merely boosting their 
economies slightly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the freezes and cuts that have been made to CHST 
transfers we realize, as someone already said today, that the 
federal government now pays something like 13% or 14% of health 
and post-secondary education costs.  At one time it paid 50% of 
those costs.  The provinces, none of whom are being helped by the 
federal government to bolster their own economies, are trying to 
manage excessive social costs.  Health care in the provinces, 
because of an aging population and increasing costs, takes up 
most of the money in the pot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Post-secondary education is left to try to survive on its own. 
The level of investment in education in the country is a shame, 
and our students are the ones who are paying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past few weeks a lot of attention has been paid by 
provinces to equalization.  Perhaps what government members 
should do, instead of debating the issue and sitting back and 
doing nothing as they has always done, is visit the areas Premier 
Hamm visits.  They could then listen to his basic, down to earth, 
factual speeches about the benefit of letting provinces like 
Newfoundland develop their own resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would not only give provinces like mine a measure of 
satisfaction, it would enable them to hold on to their revenues 
until they reached the Canadian average.  They could then start 
contributing to the Canadian economy, and provinces like Alberta 
and Ontario would not need to give them welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provinces like Newfoundland could then start contributing to 
equalization.  They could help bolster the economies of provinces 
that did not have the same resources, encourage those provinces 
to invest in their own economies and help them create the 
infrastructure necessary to develop resources and profits that 
would turn them into have provinces.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very simple process.  It was done in Alberta, even 
though the Minister of Finance told me it was not.  When 
equalization was instituted Alberta's revenue started to be 
clawed back.  The province was given, after a seven or eight year 
hiatus, a chance to invest its royalties in its infrastructure. 
It has since become not only self-sufficient but one of the major 
contributing partners in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what Confederation is supposed to be about.  Surely we 
can assist the process with a bit of common sense.  That is all 
Premier Hamm of Nova Scotia is asking.  That is all Premier 
Grimes of Newfoundland asked when he visited the Prime Minister 
last week.  When Premier Grimes returned to Newfoundland from his 
visit to Ottawa he stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prime minister is clearly committed to the notion 
that—provinces like Newfoundland and Labrador could keep more 
of their source revenues.  My understanding and my impression 
from my meeting with the prime minister is that he is of the view 
that that's the right thing to do—as soon as they can do it, 
and there's no reason to wait. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within minutes of the premier saying that, the Prime Minister's 
Office issued a terse release which said that the premier was 
wrong and that no commitments had been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a premier saying the Prime Minister committed to give 
Newfoundland a fair deal.  We have the Prime Minister saying he 
is wrong and that he did not say such a thing.  The Minister of 
Industry inserted himself, as he always does, and agreed with 
both of them, as he always does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to the Minister of Industry, who was the premier of 
Newfoundland for years, we might ask if he took up the fight 
Premier Hamm is now taking up?  Absolutely not.  Did he take it 
up when he was a minister in the government opposite for a number 
of years?  Absolutely not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When did he take it up?  He took it up during the last federal 
election in November, when he decided he was not going anywhere 
in Newfoundland.  He ran in the safest Liberal seat in 
Newfoundland, the seat held by the former premier.  After the 
first election he did not even have the nerve to stay there.  He 
ran to what was the safest seat in the province, the only seat 
that had never been represented by anybody except a Liberal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw what happened there after he left.  A Tory was elected 
for the first time in history because of the impressions people 
had of the person who now wants to be Prime Minister of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election campaign he and his minister of tourism, who 
ran in my riding of St. John's West, campaigned on the slogan 
“New Team, New Deal”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the new team?  It was not a new team.  It was the same 
old team.  I took care of one half.  I would have taken care of 
the other if he had had the nerve to run in that riding, the 
riding in which he lives.  However he did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  But they know him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn:</B>  But they know him, absolutely.  They 
knew him there, and they will know him where he is now.  They 
have known him everywhere he has gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new deal he talked about was a new deal for Newfoundland in 
regard to equalization and clawback.  What do we hear?  We hear 
the Prime Minister say no.  We hear the finance minister say he 
will not change it, even though he told me he will continue to 
look at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been looking at it long enough.  Let us give provinces 
that have resources a chance to develop and invest in their own 
infrastructure so they can create more revenues to help those who 
cannot help themselves.  That is what Confederation is all about, 
and it is about time we start practising what we preach.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, what seems to be forgotten in 
the debate is that the development of offshore resources in Nova 
Scotia and Newfoundland promises new jobs, higher incomes and 
greater self-reliance for the people of both provinces.  The 
people of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland will be the big winners, 
and that is the way it should be.  Provincial treasuries will 
also benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To suggest that equalization payments should remain entirely 
intact was never the intent.  I come back to the comment made 
about the province of Alberta.  While it is true that Alberta 
received equalization payments when they were introduced in 1957, 
only three tax bases were used at the time: personal income 
taxes, corporate income taxes and succession duties.  As the tax 
bases were broadened Alberta failed to qualify.  If we were to go 
back today to the original program of personal income taxes, 
corporate taxes and succession duties, Nova Scotia would receive 
about $740 million less per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the right balance now.  There is an incentive for 
provinces to develop offshore resources.  There is a transition 
away from equalization payments.  The bottom line is that it 
provides a tremendous opportunity for these provinces to create 
new confidence, new employment and new career opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that argument, we have a formula that recognizes incentive 
and provides an equal footing for all provinces depending on 
their resource and taxation bases.  Would the member agree that 
it is a fair and sound formula? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is wrong 
if he thinks that I or anybody with a degree of common sense 
would agree with a stand like that.  We are the ones who would 
make sure the country stays the way it is.  He might want the 
rich to get richer and the poor to get poorer and for all of us 
to be subservient to the party opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nova Scotia, Newfoundland or any other province has no intention 
of asking to hold on to equalization payments while obtaining 
revenue from its resources.  These provinces are asking for a 
phase in until they reach the Canadian average where they would 
then become contributors.  They will not require any equalization 
payments after that because they will live on revenues that come 
from royalties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is saying that these provinces are benefiting greatly 
and that the money is pouring in.  If we listen to the Minister 
of Industry talk about how well these provinces are doing with 
their gross domestic product, everybody would think that 
Newfoundland is benefiting royally.  Most of the profits are 
going outside the province.  Oil is bypassing its shores and 
being processed elsewhere, as is its shrimp.  These make up the 
two main components that create Newfoundland's GDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Newfoundland is not doing well because it is being treated like 
people on welfare: if they make 50 cents, the government takes it 
back.  It is better for the people to stay home and do nothing 
than it is for them to work.  It is better for Newfoundland and 
Nova Scotia to leave their resources in the ground or in the 
sea because then they will always have them. They will not be 
better off if they are under a government like this one which 
wants to keep them down.  It is time that changed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to 
participate in the debate on second reading of Bill C-18, an act 
to amend the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act.  Earlier 
the finance critic of the Canadian Alliance, the hon. member for 
Calgary Southeast, highlighted very beautifully our position and 
the weaknesses in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of the folks at home I would like to tell them 
that for fiscal year 1999-2000 the bill removes the ceiling that 
would otherwise apply to equalization payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize that different provinces and regions of Canada have 
different levels of wealth.  All wish to provide similar services 
to their residents.  We are committed to the constitutional 
principle of making equalization payments to ensure that 
provincial governments have sufficient revenues to provide their 
residents with reasonably comparable levels of basic services at 
a reasonably comparable level of taxation.  It will allow all 
Canadians from coast to coast to enjoy a comparable quality of 
important government services.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill implements a commitment by the Prime Minister to the 
first ministers to lift the cap on the first year of a five year 
cycle of equalization payments.  Bill C-18 would increase 
equalization transfers by $792 million with over 50% going to 
Quebec, a per capita increase of $67. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The increase results from growth beyond the $10 billion ceiling. 
It was done to accommodate the demands of provinces made during 
negotiations with the premiers over the $21.1 billion CHST 
transfer package which was concluded in September 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Canadian Alliance is open to exploring a new 
equalization system, that does not penalize poorer provinces that 
benefit from unexpected growth or new resource royalties, we 
believe the equalization formula should be consistently applied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition has consistently called for reform of 
the equalization system to allow the poorer provinces to benefit 
from their economic development.  Nova Scotia's Conservative 
Premier John Hamm is calling for equalization reform as part of 
his campaign for fairness.  When he was premier of Newfoundland 
the industry minister also spoke in favour of equalization 
reform.  There is a need for equalization reform and everyone is 
talking about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For every dollar a province gains in royalties, the federal 
government reduces its equalization payments by about 75 cents. 
The current equalization formula actually prevents the 
equalization of economic opportunity among the provinces.  The 
bill merely touches on one aspect of the problem. There are many 
other aspects that I will be talking about in detail a little 
later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than address the issue of equalization payments on a 
piecemeal basis, a full and thorough debate is needed in the 
House. The equalization ceiling exists to protect federal 
taxpayers from excess growth in payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance supported the $21.1 billion increase in 
the 2000 CHST fiscal accord.  We also supported reviewing the 
application of the formula to stop penalizing provinces that 
experience strong growth or increases in the non-renewable 
resource revenues.  We believe that maintaining the ceiling is 
necessary for the overall integrity of the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also believe that the equalization system should serve the 
longer term purpose of equalizing economic opportunity and 
autonomy in all regions and should not create incentives for 
perverse economic policies on the part of provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lifting of the cap is a one time ad hoc reaction that fails 
to address the bigger and longer term problems.  It was promised 
for purely political reasons.  It may be good politics, but is it 
a good policy?  The fact that this one time band aid solution is 
even being proposed indicates a need for open disclosure in 
parliament, in the provinces and among levels of government to 
come up with ways to prevent the necessity of applying such band 
aid solutions time after time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will describe the equalization payment system that the 
government operates.  Every five years since 1957 the federal 
government through the finance department reviewed the 
equalization program.  The purpose of the equalization program is 
to equalize provincial revenue raising capacity.  In theory, this 
enables provinces to provide reasonably comparable levels of 
public service at reasonably comparable levels of taxation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without equalization payments Canada's wealthier provinces would 
be able to provide more services to their residents than the poor 
provinces could at the same level of taxation.  The equalization 
formula is important to the Canadian federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program is only as good as the processes that allow it to 
keep pace with the provincial tax system.  The key element in the 
equalization formula is the representative tax system called RTS. 
The RTS is a hypothetical tax system that is supposed to be 
representative of the actual systems of the separate provinces. 
The key to success rests on how well the RTS reflects provincial 
tax systems.  The RTS should be comprehensive, representative, 
accurate and appropriately categorized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RTS should include all revenue sources used to support 
public services comprehensively.  Partial coverage of the revenue 
sources yields a biased picture of the relative fiscal capacity 
of the provinces.  The RTS should use definitions of tax bases 
that reflect the tax structure actually used by the provinces to 
reflect what governments actually do.  It should not represent 
imaginary, unfair and unrealistic measures.  It should be 
representative of the actual tax systems used in the provinces or 
in the country.  The data used to measure the various tax bases 
must be as accurate as possible for it to be a reliable measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The items in the RTS that make up a category or revenue source 
should have common characteristics, the ability to be taxed at a 
similar rate and should be appropriately categorized.  The 
finance department currently uses such criteria for its 
assessment of the RTS, but nowhere is it explicitly set out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance department has not formalized the set of principles 
to guide its review of the RTS.  The need for a formalized set of 
principles is necessary if we are to arrive at a common way of 
estimating the tax base for the provinces.  For many of the 33 
revenue sources used by the department as measurements, the bases 
are not straightforward and no consensus exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House have been trying to force this weak 
Liberal government, that lacks vision, to do the work necessary 
to fix the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke to the bill in the last parliament when the five year 
time period expired.  As I mentioned earlier, the House debated 
the details of the equalization program and how it would operate 
for the next five years.  At that time the government had given 
the House only a matter of days to deal with a bill that it was 
passing, the one that has to be passed every five years for the 
purpose of the operation of the equalization plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was really an outrage.  The government did not want the 
opposition parties in the House to have very much time to talk 
about equalization payments.  It held back the bill for three 
days and then there were only a few days left before the calendar 
year deadline approached.  The Liberals said that they had to 
rush the bill because the clock was ticking.  That was because 
they would not put the puck on the ice until five minutes was 
left in the game. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are debating a bill that is tinkering with the nation's 
equalization program, a program that we all support and that we 
all want to operate in the best possible manner.  The Liberals do 
not want to do that work.  The bill touches only one aspect of 
the problem, ceilings.  How about the other related and more 
serious and complicated problems that the bill does not address 
at all?  The Liberals are pretending that other problems do not 
exist.  Maybe the problem will go away by pretending that the 
problems do not exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give six examples to prove what I am saying. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1230"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT30"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT30"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1230

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, some provinces calculate their payroll taxes on the total 
payroll of business, while other provinces tax only a portion 
above certain thresholds.  Still other provinces charge no tax at 
all.  For the purpose of RTS, the base chosen across all 
provinces must be common. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, for sales taxes, the base used in the RTS is no longer 
representative of the tax structure used by all provinces.  The 
four provinces that account for a third of Canada's population 
use a common sales tax base, the GST, which is different from the 
one used in the RTS.  We are comparing apples to oranges.  They 
are not equivalent.  There is a need to review the way the sales 
tax base is currently measured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, there are user fees which are not part of the current 
federal-provincial discussions for the 1999 renewal.  it is very 
important to mention that governments at every level are 
resorting to alternative revenue sources such as user fees.  It 
is a tax with only a semantic distinction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial and local government receipts from user fees doubled 
from $6 billion in 1984 to $12 billion in 1994.  It doubled in 10 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How these revenues are treated in the equalization formula can 
have a significant effect on overall equalization payments.  User 
fees imposed by the provinces have been part of the equalization 
of the RTS since 1967. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similar fees imposed by the municipalities were brought in with 
the 1982 renewal.  They are currently included under the 
miscellaneous revenue category of the RTS.  It is a category that 
is altogether different and impacts on the calculations of the 
complicated equalization formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, since 1977 lottery revenues have been treated as a 
separate revenue source in the RTS, with gross revenues from the 
sale of lottery tickets constituting the lottery base.  It worked 
well until the provincial gaming sector became significantly 
transformed.  Today, provinces are operating video games, 
casinos, bingos, VLTs, break-open tickets and other games of 
chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RTS base does not cover these newer gaming activities.  This 
is unfair.  The revenues are treated differently for equalization 
purposes.  Where a casino is operated by a provincial lottery 
corporation, profits are equalized under the lottery revenue 
source.  If the casino is operated by a government department, 
the gross revenues of the casino are equalized under the 
miscellaneous revenue source in the RTS.  Again, the weak Liberal 
government allows mixing apples with oranges.  Similar inequities 
arise in the treatment of revenues from other games.  That is 
unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RTS has become less representative of the provincial taxing 
policy.  We will see if the government is addressing these gaming 
inequities in the bill.  It has its chance.  It needs to look at 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, is resource taxation which is an area where the ground is 
always shifting.  The resource revenue type bases in the RTS are 
measured on the basis of the value or volume of production. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ideally they would be measured on the basis of economic rent or 
the value of the resource over its cost of production.  Rent is a 
measure of taxable potential, not actual but potential.  It 
consists of a value that can be taxed without affecting 
production because natural resources in different locations can 
differ in quality and production costs.  Rent associated with 
them can also differ significantly.  These differences are not 
captured by the value or volume of production.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many flaws in the present equalization program.  It 
should be completely reformed.  We know the equalization 
provision has limited the cumulative growth of total equalization 
payments to the cumulative growth of GNP, gross national product, 
from the base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixth, the ceiling and floor levels were introduced.  I will not 
elaborate on that much but it does not work favourably.  Rather 
it would make it difficult for the provinces, particularly those 
close to the floor level, to plan their budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is asymmetrical treatment of underpayments and 
overpayments.  The overpayments are treated as non-interest 
bearing loans to the provinces.  This is an important one.  In 
the last year or so, it cost the federal government $38 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Free use of federal funds is not necessarily shared equally by 
all of the receiving provinces.  The federal government does not 
charge interest on the underpayment.  So the government has 
manipulated the program for political favours.  The former 
premier of Newfoundland, who is Minister of Industry, was given a 
gift before the election.  That is the kind of favours I am 
talking about.  That is how the government can manipulate because 
the system is not fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Evolving over many decades, every five years the traditional 
political parties have given us an extremely convoluted and 
complex process.  If the design is so archaic and cryptic that it 
defies logic and reason.  It is not fair that our system is such 
a conundrum.  Equalization as it is structured is divisive.  It 
pits one Canadian against another.  That is not right.  The 
measurements should be accurate, reliable and sound.  In this 
case, they are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party of Canada, now the Canadian Alliance, advanced 
the new Canada act which sought to improve the Canadian political 
and economic system.  There is a need for a single social union 
agreement on transfers from the federal government to the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we are debating the bill, I ask the government members to 
please look into the whole issue and make a serious attempt to 
reform our equalization program.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to express my appreciation to the hon. 
member for Surrey Central for a very good speech on equalization 
payments, and on this particular bill.  He has given both a 
political and a practical perspective to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he have any comments with respect to the overall picture, 
which is the need to provide adequate funding for the social 
services that are provided for our citizens across the country? 
He made some allusion to the fact that we agree with this, but I 
would like him to just reinforce that and to emphasize that the 
Canadian Alliance members believe we have to exercise a social 
conscience as we run the affairs of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are here, in the 
highest chamber of the country, to serve Canadians.  We should 
treat them equally.  They have the right to be treated equally, 
irrespective of the province they live in.  They should have 
equal access to the important government services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the way our system works, different provinces have 
different sources of revenue.  They have different volumes of 
revenue.  Their incomes, in layman's terms, are not equal.  The 
amount of money left for spending on the services, particularly 
the social services, may not be equal.  Rich provinces have more 
money to spend on social services than the poorer provinces. 
That will lead to unequal services being offered to the citizens 
of the provinces.  This is not right.  Canada is a wonderful 
country.  It is our moral responsibility to see that all 
Canadians, wherever they live, have equal access to important 
government services.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, one innovative or workable way, although it does not 
work at the moment, is the equalization payment formula. However, 
at the moment this formula is biased, unfair and unreasonable. 
It does not measure the different elements which compose or 
contribute to the equalization formula.  That is why it is 
important that we sincerely put all our efforts into working on 
the equalization formula so that it provides a fair and equitable 
means to all provinces and Canadians from coast to coast.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am very pleased to speak on this important debate on Bill C-18. 
This is a bill of a temporary measure, but it is good for us to 
be able to see it in the larger context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say something about the basic philosophy of 
equalization payments.  What it says is people in Canada who 
cannot afford certain services because of their wealth or lack of 
it are still entitled to basic services.  I cannot emphasize 
enough that I agree wholeheartedly with this premise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister sometimes says, when he speaks of helping 
those in need, that this is the Canadian way.  Unfortunately, in 
our political environment, it is all together too selective at 
times.  We see certain people who have their needs met almost 
instantaneously and others have to work for years and years to 
have their needs met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thinking of the tainted blood scandal and the hepatitis C 
victims.  These are people who, because of a lack of proper 
procedures by the federal government, were injured by that very 
specific shortcoming of the federal government.  Other provinces, 
such as Ontario, said that these victims should all be 
compensated for their loss, but not all of them  were.  In the 
federal government scheme of things there was a very narrow 
window defined.  If they were outside of that window, it was too 
bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It so happens that my uncle died from hepatitis.  He left a 
widow.  He was in that exact category.  He was diagnosed with a 
brain tumour.  The operation was successful and he bounced right 
back.  Before the operation he had problems with headaches and 
disorientation.  However, his recovery took very long.  He was 
always ill.  Eventually they diagnosed that he was a victim of 
tainted blood.  He had received hepatitis via his blood 
transfusions during the operation.  He was outside the window for 
compensation.  Is there any compensation for that loss?  It seems 
not, so they fight and fight.  Yet others receive aid very 
quickly.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the larger scheme, when an election is coming and there is a 
flood, the promises of compensation and aid to farmers suffering 
from the disaster are immediate and are large.  If it is not 
during an election or if it is in an area where there does not 
seem to be a great deal of political capital to be gained, it 
appears to us, as objectively as we try to look at it, that there 
is some bias on whether or not that helping hand is extended.  I 
personally believe that we need to give a helping hand to those 
who cannot afford these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I grew up in Saskatchewan.  I was born on the prairies, a first 
generation Canadian, my parents having been youngsters when their 
families escaped from Russia and came to Canada to make it their 
home.  I remember very well in the early years of my life, which 
would have been in the 1940s, there was not a great deal of aid 
for people who were in distress.  I know it is hard to believe I 
am that old, but I am getting there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not an unusual occurrence for my family that the church 
community I grew up in would reach out a hand to those who needed 
it.  Sometimes it was in the form of a loan.  Sometimes it was in 
the form of outright gifts.  Sometimes there were food transfers. 
That was the way things were done because we were people who were 
compassionate for those in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later on when my wife and I were married we became aware of a 
couple who had come to Alberta from Ontario or even farther east. 
I do not remember which province they were from.  They had moved 
to Alberta and they were in dire straits.  They had no jobs and 
no income.  He claimed that the police had stolen his car.  We 
later found out that the police had confiscated it because they 
could not get into the trunk and they suspected there were drugs 
in it, but that is another story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This couple was without food and without shelter.  We did not go 
to a welfare agency.  We did not see what we could do to get 
public funds for them.  The way we thought was a natural thing. 
We knew these were people in need and we looked for ways to help 
them.  I remember trundling groceries up to the second floor 
apartment that we had arranged for them.  We made the payments on 
the rent for the first month or two so that they could get 
settled.  One of the men in our group gave this man a job.  We 
tried to help them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through the process of ever increasing taxation and with the 
present Liberal government and past Liberal style governments we 
have had over the last 40 or 50 years, we have had an increasing 
shift of social responsibility away from families, away from 
churches, and on to the government.  Nowadays we end up with very 
little fiscal capacity as individuals and as families to actually 
accommodate the needs of people we encounter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is much more natural now to say we will see if we can help 
people get to the social services centre where there is a 
government program.  This seems to be a general trend that our 
governments have taken over the last 30 or 40 years.  In a way it 
is good, but it also has a tremendous downside, which is that 
while it trades on the fact that we as Canadians are 
compassionate to people in need, it takes away from us the 
capacity to actually exercise that compassion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are taxed to death.  I was talking to an individual just 
yesterday and said that as a young family the decision was made 
that my wife would be a full time mom, so I was the sole wage 
earner.  Even then our marginal tax rates were 40% to 45%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I taught a night class instead of having my wife take a job.  I 
taught full time in the daytime and I taught a couple of night 
courses to supplement our income.  I used to say I worked Tuesday 
nights for Trudeau and Thursday nights for my family.  Basically 
people live on half of their incomes.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons I became a member of parliament was to try to 
address the question of the huge overtaxation.  My family and 
thousands of families like us have lived on something between 30% 
and 50% of our income.  I believe in personal charity.  Over the 
years, besides having 50% of my earnings taken away from me for 
taxation, I have usually given between 10% and 20% of my income 
to charities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, since we were looking at retiring on only my 
pension which was not that great I put a little into RRSPs. 
Another 8% to 10% went into that.  I had 30% of my salary left. 
We struggled month after month to pay the bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation has not changed a great deal.  I can say it is 
great that we live in a country where everyone has free health 
care.  I concur with that, but it has to be done efficiently. The 
federal, provincial and municipal governments took their taxes 
from money I had worked very hard for.  I really needed a greater 
income for my family.  I am speaking now of before I was a member 
of parliament.  I do not want anyone to conclude that I am crying 
because I do not earn enough here.  We struggled and said that if 
they were to take that money they had better use it very wisely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One reason the Conservatives fell out of grace with many people 
in the west was that they were not perceived to be handling the 
money properly.  They were not addressing the question of the 
debt.  They were not addressing the question of huge interest 
payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I resented the fact that half of my income went to taxes and of 
that 30% was being used for interest payments on a debt which had 
burgeoned out of control because of lack of fiscal control by the 
government.  That is why I came here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are talking about equalization payments. While I am in 
favour philosophically of helping people who need help, I am not 
in favour of doing that in an inefficient, wasteful or unfair 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In passing, I should like to make a statement about equalization 
payments.  Since they are done based on provincial numbers, there 
is no recognition of the fact that poor people are living in all 
provinces.  Over the years I have thought of this often.  Here is 
a specific example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a young teacher with a young family, trying to make ends 
meet, making $6,000 a year.  Through my unemployment insurance, 
it was called UI in those days, I was subsidizing a fisherman who 
made $18,000 a year.  It somehow seemed to me unfair because I 
had no eligibility to ever make a claim.  This was especially the 
case in those years when I was a student and my part time job 
required that I make UI contributions.  I would quit in fall to 
go back to classes and I was not eligible to receive any 
benefits.  That money was going to subsidize people who were 
making 20, 3 or 40 times as much as I was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one thing the equalization program does not address.  If 
we have poor people living in the so-called have provinces, they 
are proportionately disadvantaged compared to in some cases rich 
people who are living in the have not provinces.  The well off 
people in the have provinces are paying huge amounts of money.  I 
guess the Liberal way is to tax them to death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we proposed to level off the tax burden for those who make 
an adequate amount of money, we were told all we wanted to do was 
give tax breaks to the rich.  The fact of the matter is that the 
equalization program gives transfers to provinces where some very 
rich people live, and those people benefit from those transfers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will put this in perspective.  Most people here know the 
history of transfer payments.  I picked up a book which had a 
chapter on them and found out a few things that were rather 
interesting.  For fiscal year 2001 it is estimated that the total 
cash payments from the federal government to the provincial, 
territorial and local governments will total almost $25 billion. 
That is a lot of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I play with mathematics as some people play on the golf course. 
Whenever I have an opportunity to do some simple math I do it for 
recreation.  Some time back I built a spreadsheet showing the 
major federal transfers to the provinces.  From 1980 until 1999 I 
have a breakdown of the total major federal transfers from the 
federal government to the individual provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fascinating to see that in that 20 year period 
Newfoundland received a total of some $22.5 billion in transfers; 
Prince Edward Island, $4.9 billion; Nova Scotia, $28.7 billion. 
New Brunswick, $24.9 billion; Quebec, $178.3 billion; Ontario, 
$154 billion; Manitoba, some $30 billion; Saskatchewan, almost 
$20 billion; Alberta, close to $40 billion; and British Columbia, 
almost $53 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1980 to 1999 the total major federal transfers to the 10 
provinces was $556 billion.  That does not include Yukon and the 
Northwest Territories.  At that time Nunavut did not exist.  That 
amount essentially is equal to our national debt.  If we add in 
the Northwest Territories and Yukon, the total major federal 
transfers to the provinces and territories for the 20 year period 
was $573 billion.  By a strange coincidence that is almost equal 
to the present value of our national debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree with transfer payments, but they must be made wisely. 
It looks to us as if we could have had zero debt if they would 
have been managed better.  I am not in any way suggesting that 
transfer payments should not have been made, but meanwhile with 
the growing rate of the debt there are interest payments due 
every year.  The federal Liberal, then Conservative and then 
again Liberal governments did not address this issue until we 
came along and pretty well pushed them into it.  The debt is out 
of hand.  We are now spending $30 billion a year on interest 
payments.  That should not be the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also interesting to find out that the whole idea of 
transfer payments is almost as old as history.  It is included in 
our constitution.  As a matter of fact most of us know that the 
repatriated constitution of 1982 has a clause in it which 
supports the concept of equalization payments.  The formal system 
of equalization payments as we have come to know it today 
actually came into being in the mid-1950s when I graduated from 
high school.  Now a very complicated formula is used which I wish 
I had time to explain to people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been on the finance committee now for several years. 
Several years ago we had experts explain to us how the federal 
system of equalization works.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember with some amusement that during those hearings I 
asked one of these officials, after he had gone through a number 
of convoluted explanations of how these different things work, if 
there really was anyone who understood this totally.  He looked 
at me and said probably not.  He sort of admitted that even he, 
being one of the officials, did not know everything about it.  He 
specialized in one area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is indeed very complicated.  The federal government, in 
computing the amount of transfer payment, does not to compute how 
much income each province earns.  Rather, it has a formula which, 
in 34 categories, looks at how much income the provinces could 
earn.  There are different categories for the building of a 
national average.  From that national average, the federal 
government computes, province by province in each category, 
whether each province in each category is in a surplus or deficit 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember when the government added the lottery category about 
five or six years ago.  It was not a question of how much money a 
province earned through lotteries but how much it could earn.  At 
that time, the equalization payments to Manitoba dropped by about 
$50 million.  Why?  Because even though there were literally 
thousands of people in Manitoba who on principle did not support 
the lotteries, it was deemed that it could have raised this money 
if those people would have bought those lottery tickets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that they did not buy the tickets meant that the 
provincial government did not have the income.  If the people of 
Manitoba could be persuaded to buy lottery tickets, that would 
give their government more money.  The fact that they were not 
persuaded took the money away from the provincial government and 
the formula took the federal transfer payments from Manitoba as 
well, because the federal government deemed that this was an 
amount that the province could have earned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have documented in the public accounts and other sources the 
formulas that are used to compute these payments.  If I look at 
the lottery ticket revenue, according to this formula 
Newfoundland is $31 million short on lottery revenue.  P.E.I. is 
$2.4 million over.  Quebec is $63 million under.  This qualifies 
the different provinces for transfers based on whether they are 
in a positive or negative situation.  Alberta is in the plus 
category by $159 million.  Consequently its equalization revenue 
is actually increased because of the amount of revenue that it 
presumably could earn using lotteries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is just one category.  There are many others.  They include 
the sale of licence plates for vehicles.  They include many other 
categories.  All 34 categories are listed in this documentation. 
It is interesting to see how, by using this formula, the 
government is able to arrange for different amounts of money, 
sometimes motivated for or by political reasons, for transfers to 
the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion I will simply say that we support in principle 
utilizing the wealth that we have in order to 
provide a comparable level of services to all of our citizens 
across the country.

I would have been tempted to ask a question of the member for Elk

do, perhaps I will respond briefly to some of what the member had 
to say, because it seems to me there was a thread throughout some 
of what he had to say which was critical of the equalization 
payment scheme we have in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the member of two things.  Equalization is part 
of the Constitution of Canada.  This was constitutionalized in 
1982.  It is a critical element of Canadian social and economic 
policy that all citizens, no matter where they live, be served by 
provincial governments that, because of equalization payments, 
are able to provide comparable levels of services to all 
citizens.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that Canadian citizens who live in so-called have 
provinces have to contribute to that through the federal transfer 
payments is not something that I think the member would want to 
be seen criticizing, because I know that his party has been in 
trouble in the past for sounding like it would like to do away 
with equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would caution the hon. member that unless he wants to revive 
that debate he should be careful as to what he says, because it 
sure sounded to me as though there was an undercurrent of 
opposition to equalization payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It always strikes me as odd when we hear that coming from a 
province that is doing as well as the province of Alberta is 
doing.  We do not want to have a situation in the country where 
the gap between rich and poor provinces grows any greater than it 
already is.  That is the situation that we find ourselves on the 
edge of now, given some of the economic circumstances that 
prevail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the NDP rise to speak against this particular bill because 
of the fact that even though it lifts the ceiling or the cap on 
equalization payments for one year, it then goes on to restore 
that ceiling or that cap in a way that we find objectionable. It 
seems to me that equalization is not just a constitutional 
principle.  It is a moral principle that there should be this 
kind of comparable equality among all Canadians.  However, if it 
is a constitutional principle, this is something that should not 
be capped.  There should not be a ceiling put on this particular 
constitutional principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the members of the Alliance Party could have their 
meeting outside the House.  That is what the curtains are here

as it apparently was to him, in the sense that I guess the sound 
was going that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am certainly happy to intervene on behalf of the hon. member 
and urge hon. members to show proper restraint in controlling 
their conversations in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was saying that if this 
is a constitutional principle and one grounded as a certain 
normative or moral view of what constitutes Canadian society and 
the relationship that all Canadians have with each other through 
their federal government so that Canadians, no matter where they 
live, can have a comparable level of public services, then this 
is not something that there should be a cap on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have seen too often in this last decade or so is the 
federal government moving to cap, to limit, its commitment to 
certain social programs.  It is not just equalization.  I think 
of a former program called the Canada assistance program, which 
was sometimes called CAP for short, which itself was capped by a 
Conservative government.  It was sometimes called the cap on CAP. 
To compound matters, the Liberal government did away with CAP 
altogether and brought in the Canada health and social transfer, 
sometimes called the CHST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government wonders why there is not the strong sense 
of country that it would sometimes like to see.  No wonder, when 
we have federal governments that have been progressively 
withdrawing from its commitments to social and economic equality 
in the country, starting with the Conservatives with the cap on 
CAP, or actually starting with the Liberals back in the early 
1980s when they were responsible for the first unilateral 
reduction in federal transfer payments to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the course of a long time, the federal government has been 
withdrawing from fiscal commitments it made to the provinces in 
the course of designing specific national social programs and in 
the course of living up to specific national arrangements like 
equalization.  We in the NDP say here today that a cap on 
equalization is wrong and that it should be lifted entirely. 
However, if it cannot be lifted entirely, then at the very least, 
when the ceiling is put back, as this bill also does, it should 
be put back at a base that is higher than where the ceiling was 
before it was lifted for this one particular year.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My understanding is that that was the understanding the 
provinces had.  They understood that when the ceiling was lifted 
and the equalization payments rose as a result, that new level 
would become the new base.  Instead, what this bill does is 
return the base to a lower figure and put many provinces, 
particularly my home province of Manitoba, in a position in which 
they are not as well off as a result of the CHST increases as the 
federal government would like to make out.  They lose, through 
equalization and the restoration of the ceiling next year at this 
lower base, what they gained through the increase in the Canada 
health and social transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens is, despite all the smoke and mirrors and despite 
the Liberal campaign promises and the Liberal spin around the 
great increase in federal funding to the provinces for health 
care that came with the increase in the CHST with the so-called 
health accord, provinces like Manitoba are in effect no better 
off because they are losing on equalization through the 
equalization cap what they gained on CHST.  The only provinces 
that actually come out of this better are the have provinces 
because they do not lose through equalization.  They just gain 
through CHST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where in the heck is the logic of that?  Is this what the 
government intended, that after all was said and done it would be 
the have provinces that have more and the have not provinces that 
have less, because that is the result?  I do not know if that was 
the intended result.  I do not know if the government is just 
stupid or vicious when it comes to this sort of thing.  We can 
take our pick.  In any event, this is the result of what the 
government has done, and what it is doing through this particular 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We say two things.  First, lift the cap on equalization.  Get 
rid of that ceiling that will cost some of the have not provinces 
more and more as the years go by, depending on economic 
circumstances.  Certainly current projections would indicate that 
the cap will cost Manitoba for instance something like $100 
million.  That is a lot of money in Manitoba.  It may not seem 
like much to a federal government that is projecting a surplus of 
$15 billion or whatever.  However, $100 million can buy a lot of 
public services, health care and post-secondary education in a 
province like Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are seeing is a further downloading on the part of the 
federal government.  The federal government is building up its 
surplus and fighting its deficit on the backs of the provinces, 
which in many cases have to deliver those very important services 
that Canadians really care about in terms of health care and 
education, for instance.  The provinces have to take the heat for 
the lack of MRIs, or the lack of other diagnostic services, or 
crowded classrooms or whatever the case may be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we see is a very disturbing trend.  The federal government 
over the course of many years now, accelerated in a remarkable 
way by the Liberals since they came to power in 1993, has been 
withdrawing from all these commitments.  I think it is part of 
the national unity crisis to the extent that there is one. 
Liberals spend their time scratching their heads and wondering 
why Canadians do not have a stronger attachment to their country, 
and how they can get more federal visibility? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who has done more to destroy federal visibility and 
participation than the Liberal Party since it came to power in 
1993.  It did this through the systematic sell off and 
privatization of many of our national institutions and 
infrastructure, eliminating post offices, getting rid of our 
publicly owned national railway and privatizing Air Canada.  The 
list goes on of ways in which the federal government has taken 
the federal presence, both symbolically and practically, out of 
the lives of Canadians.  Then the Liberals wonder why Canadians 
do not have a strong sense of being Canadian. 
One does not have to be a rocket scientist to figure it out.  On 
top of that it withdraws its fiscal commitment from so many of 
these programs and leaves the provinces to pick up the slack. 
There is a lot of slack because most of the areas that the 
federal government is withdrawing from are growing areas of 
expenditure, not diminishing areas of expenditure.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We see the Minister of Finance piling up his surplus, taking 
credit for his fiscal management of the country, and yet in many 
respects this has been done on the backs of the provinces or the 
unemployed through the use of the EI surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is going to happen if worse comes to worse, we do have a 
recession and we have all these ceilings?  Is it not nice for the 
federal government?  It does not have to worry.  Recession can 
come.  All the ways in which it will deal with the social 
consequences of a recession are all capped.  It does not matter 
how bad it gets, the government's commitment is capped:  capped 
on equalization, capped on CHST at a level that is still lower 
than what it was in 1993 when the Liberals became the government, 
capped here, capped there, capped everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the provinces that will have to fight the recession, if 
there is one, all by themselves.  They will have to pick up the 
people who do not qualify for EI anymore and go on provincial 
welfare.  They will have to pick up the increased use of the 
health care system as people are stressed out by economic 
conditions et cetera.  They will have to do that with declining 
revenues because the recession itself will affect their revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile the federal government will sit back and say, “Oh, we 
signed a health accord in August 2000 which solved everything, 
even though it didn't put back what we took out in 1995.  We've 
got an equalization scheme.  It's even in our constitution.  It's 
a great Canadian principle”.  However it only goes so far.  It 
does not go far enough to address the needs of the have not 
provinces.  It only goes as far as we like it to go without 
endangering the federal government's fiscal health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of reasons to be concerned about the bill.  I 
know most people I think probably regarded this as a bit of care 
taking legislation and probably in the end it will not receive 
the kind of debate in the House that it deserves.  However I 
would implore other members of parliament and opposition parties 
to take a good look at the bill and take a good look at the 
principles and the values that underline it and the way in which 
the bill is a repudiation of our constitution.  It is a 
repudiation of the principle of equalization which is enshrined 
in our constitution.  It is a danger to the long term health of 
have not provinces which are continually and increasingly being 
put at a disadvantage in respect of wealthier provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I use my own province as an example.  However, I certainly 
know members from the maritimes have similar concerns about 
equalization and have asked for special arrangements whereby some 
of the revenues that accrue to those provinces through oil and 
gas revenues might not receive such a serious clawback as they do 
now in the equalization formula.  This is one of the ways in 
which this might be addressed, although I do not think there is 
unanimity among the provinces with respect to that because not 
all provinces that have all oil and gas revenues are asking for 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly we need to do something either by way of increasing 
equalization for all provinces that require it or coming to some 
special arrangements with certain provinces with respect to 
certain kinds of revenue.  Whatever the case may be, the system 
that is put in place by this particular bill is inadequate and 
creates a situation in which more and more have not provinces 
have their treasuries and ministers of finance put in a position 
where they do not know really what to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to maintain services, in the face of the lack of the 
kind of money they feel they should be getting from the federal 
government, they have to maintain a certain tax base.  If there 
is a province next door, or two or three over, that does not have 
to maintain that kind of tax base because it is a have province 
and it has the revenues, then we have a growing gap between the 
so-called tax competitiveness of various provinces.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We get a situation in which provincial governments have no 
policy room to manoeuvre.  They basically have to imitate some of 
the richest provinces.  When they do that, they not only lose 
their ability to make their own decisions, they are sometimes 
forced into making bad or regrettable decisions.  That is not 
what people had in mind when they came up with the idea of 
equalization.  That is not what we had in mind in this chamber. I 
was here when we constitutionalized the equalization principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the government members to consider whether they want 
this to be their legacy.  When they had an opportunity to do 
something about equalization, when they had a surplus, when they 
could have done something to strengthen this constitutional 
principle, they did not.  Do they want that to be their legacy or 
do they want it to be said of them that the Liberals were the 
party who finally brought equalization back up to where it should 
have been and created the kind of equality in the country that 
they like to talk about, but which this bill in its details and 
in its principles betrays? 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know the member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona has been in this place for a long time and I 
can only conclude that he has just not kept up to date with some 
of the current facts.  I would like to clarify for the House and 
for Canadians a few facts.  I find it strangely ironic that they 
came from a member from Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 2000 and 2001, transfers to Manitoba will be $2.3 billion. 
It will account for about 35% of Manitoba's revenues and is about 
45% above the national average.  It is the highest of all four 
western provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What exactly did the first ministers agree to at their meeting? 
Perhaps the member for Winnipeg—Transcona has not read the 
communiqué, so I will remind him.  It said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First Ministers raised the issues of Equalization.  The Minister 
of Finance will examine this issue further after consultation 
with provincial Ministers of Finance.  While final revisions for 
Equalization purposes for fiscal year 1999-2000 likely will not 
be known until October 2002, the Prime Minister agreed to take 
the necessary steps to ensure that no ceiling will apply to the 
1999-2000 fiscal year.  Thereafter, the established Equalization 
formula will apply, which allows the program to grow up to the 
rate of growth of GDP. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It said in 1999-2000 and all premiers signed this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Winnipeg—Transcona said because of the removing 
of the ceiling, Manitoba or some of the have not provinces will 
not benefit and the others will.  That is simply misinformation. 
He knows full well that Manitoba will receive an additional $76 
million as a result of lifting the ceiling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one final note.  Equalization has actually increased 
faster than anticipated.  It has grown by 33% or $2.7 billion 
since our government took office.  It was the only area of 
government programming that was not affected by program reviews. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the member for Winnipeg—Transcona have an opportunity to 
read the information that was available to him in the communiqué 
that was widely published and signed by the premiers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, yes, I have a copy of that 
communiqué in front of me.  In fact, the very quote that I have 
in front of me is the same quote that the member read into the 
record in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said that I have been here for a long time.  That is 
true.  I have seen these kinds of federal-provincial fiscal 
arguments go back and forth over the years.  The standard line 
from the federal government, when we make an argument that a 
province is getting less than it would be getting if a certain 
formula were preserved, is that less is more than it got the year 
before.  All we ever get from the government, is how much more the 
province is getting.  We never get any acknowledgement of the gap 
between the more that the provinces are getting and the even more 
that they would be getting if the federal government were to 
respect the formula, or the constitutional principle, or some 
previous agreement or whatever the case may be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the standard form of avoiding the truth that we get from 
the federal government when it gets into this kind of pickle. In 
the very paragraph that the member read, it said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the Prime Minister agreed to take the necessary steps to ensure 
that no ceiling will apply to 1999-2000 fiscal year. 
Thereafter...the 
formula will apply, which allows the program to grow up to 
the rate of growth of GDP. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing in the bill which indicates that commitment will 
be kept.  My understanding from a minister of finance is that the 
bill does not keep that commitment and also is not in keeping 
with the understanding that the ministers of finance had, that 
the base would not return to where it was before.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is kind of typical that the member would stand up and 
say that because it is sort of standard federal government fare. 
Those members always talk about this or that going up but they 
are never prepared to at least be honest and say that it would 
have been higher had they kept their commitment.  At least they 
could explain why they did not keep their commitment and why 
there is a gap between the more and the even more.  No.  All we 
get is talk about the more.  It is easily done but it does not 
convince me.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would ask the member to 
carefully reflect on what he is saying and explain the underlying 
principle of what he is talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there a perverse incentive to equalization?  What is the long 
term goal?  Should it not be to eventually get off such supports? 
Is he talking about more transfers rather than 
self-sufficiency?  Should equalization not be gradually reduced, 
as, for example, offshore revenues greatly increase?  If in 
future years a province like Newfoundland receives tremendous 
more revenue benefits, should its reliance on the formula of 
transfers be gradually reduced?  What would be his formula to 
achieve that self-reliance?  Does the member also still believe 
that it is always just the rights of the receiver and not 
necessarily the rights and benefits of the payer? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we can always count on 
certain members of the Alliance Party to reveal their true 
colours.  Some of them have grown adept at chameleon politics. 
They keep trying to look like part of the mainstream by saying 
that they are not really against equalization, bilingualism or 
this or that, all the things they were against when they came 
together to form the against party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, with some of them, the truth still comes oozing out. 
That member is a good example of one of those members.  Here he 
is talking about have not provinces that are in receipt of 
equalization payments in the same way that I am sure he likes to 
stereotype people on welfare.  The language was identical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the member did not acknowledge is that there is a formula 
now. When provinces get to a certain state of economic revenues 
they do not receive equalization.  That is already built in. Does 
the member not know that or was he just trying to make some 
perverse point that we are not all like B.C. and Alberta?

know the role we played in building this country?  Does he not

equalization payments should be increased so that no one refers 
to us as have nots.

between the speaker and the listener. I wish he had heard what I 
said.

equalization.  I said that several times in the body of my speech

which is that poor people in the have provinces are subsidizing 
rich people in the have not provinces.  That is a fact.  I have a

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  That is nonsense.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think if I use a quick 
example I can perhaps put this into perspective.  I will use the 
technology that is in the legislation.  A person in one of the 
three contributing provinces who is making $20,000 a year is, by 
lack of subsidization of the program in that province, 
subsidizing the person in one of the seven receiving provinces 
who makes $100,000 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know why the socialists are upset about the fact that I 
am saying it is an anomaly to have a person earning $20,000 
subsidizing one who is making $100,000.

time to respond to the last comment and question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  As you said, Mr. Speaker, I am glad 
that people have an opportunity to express themselves freely 
because I think the more the member for Elk Island expresses 
himself freely the more we come to understand the Alliance 
position on equalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think most Canadians would find what the member just offered, 
a very odd critique of equalization.  I am glad he had the 
opportunity to clarify because it reinforced the point that I 
made.  I do not understand how someone can construe equalization 
as poor people in rich provinces subsidizing rich people in have 
not provinces.  I also do not think a lot of other Canadians 
understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think one has to be a socialist to object to what the

not call themselves socialists but who find the logic of the hon.

when I saw that the minister was introducing a bill, and when I 
saw that the title on the first page was “an act to amend the

equalization payment system.  Perhaps he did this without anyone 
knowing about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked my assistant “Did you just bring me the first page of 
the bill?”  She told me “No, that's it”.  The title of the bill 
is an act to amend the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements

I said “There is a problem with the photocopiers at the House of

</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that the Minister of Finance has not travelled in the 
country, he has not met the ministers of finance of the various 
provinces and he has not listened to what is going on in the 
maritimes or Quebec.  So, there is a bill with fewer clauses 
than the clarity bill, but we will not get into that.  That is 
to say that it is not very impressive.

Reform and its approach.  It is a new century, a new approach. 
Not really.   There he is today.

opposition to equalization.  Out west, it has to say that it is 
against equalization, but elsewhere, it has to say it is not. 
Today, however, we realize that it is opposed to equalization. 
But there is more to it than that.  It is the examples it gives 
in order to justify it being more or less opposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically, it is saying “If you get a welfare or an 
unemployment cheque from a government, if it involves an 
individual, or equalization payments, if it involves a province, then 
you are not worth much”. I remind members that they get cheques 
from the government themselves, and I am not sure what they are 
worth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, for us, equalization payments are vital, but they 
need to be modernized. 
However, we realize that the Minister of Finance is under a lot 
of pressure. We say to him “You must change your system. It is 
not right. You are penalizing the provinces, and offending 
others. So, let us sit down and see what we can do together”. 
The minister's only reply, so that we will leave him alone, is 
“I introduced a great bill. I am removing a ceiling”. 
Yes, but where are the walls, where are the foundations of the 
equalization program? These are the things that must be rebuilt, 
with the provinces, with our partners in Confederation. But the 
government does not listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the parliamentary secretary to the minister say “Listen, 
we are giving you a cheque”. He told the hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona “You will get an additional $22 million”. This 
is a paternalistic system. One must practically get down on 
one's knees. 
Come on. This is a system that is in effect from coast to coast, 
not from minister's office to minister's office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should listen to what is being said in all the 
provinces. I am not saying it should agree with everything. No. 
The Premier of Newfoundland is going around saying that changes 
are necessary. We want to make it and we will succeed. Give us a 
chance. But, no, that is no good, according to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that the Premier of Nova Scotia is a 
Conservative. So are the premiers of New Brunswick and Prince 
Edward Island. And the Premier of Newfoundland will also be a 
Conservative. The current Premier of Newfoundland, as the hon. 
member from Newfoundland rightly pointed out in his speech, was 
recently elected leader of the Liberal Party in Newfoundland. He 
has contacts in Ottawa and he told his people “They listen to me 
in Ottawa. 
I will get a commitment from the federal government to renew the 
equalization system. You will see. The Minister of Industry and 
the Prime Minister are good buddies of mine”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Off he goes to Ottawa.  He tells his people back in Newfoundland 
“It's settled.  The Prime Minister agrees with us, and so does 
the Minister of Industry”.  A few minutes later, the PMO says 
“Not true”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know comparisons are odious, but I still cannot help but think 
of the English Prime Minister who went to Germany, and came back 
with a piece of paper.  He announced “I have settled things with 
the German boss” but war was declared just a few days later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that to say that this system does not work.  The only thing 
Bill C-18 does is to try to silence those who want to see major 
changes. 
We are told that more provinces should be added to the five 
currently used as the basis for calculating the equalization 
payments.  There are arguments on both sides, but our immediate 
answer is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Maritimes have sufficient resources to return to what they 
once were, but are told that this is not good, that it will not 
work.  A balance must be struck.  There is much talk of 
openness.  As I have said on many occasions, the ruling party's 
conception of this country differs from ours in a number of 
ways, and of course from the other opposition parties as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For us, the country is comprised of regions and provinces, which 
decided to join together.  As we know, first there was Quebec, 
Ontario, the Maritimes and later the west and the north.  They 
have joined together and have a central government for shared 
services.  This is a principle we defend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals' principle is a different one. 
Canada is Ottawa, which in its great goodness, its vast 
generosity, will give little handouts to the regions and the 
provinces.  This is ignoring history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two conceptions mean that Ottawa's management style varies 
from one party to another.  When it is them, it means we have to 
beg the whole time.  When it is another conception, it means 
simply getting together, discussing and agreeing.  That is the 
difference.  True, it is not always easy, but it is an approach 
that must be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the question of equalization, I remind the House that Bill 
C-18 is simply a bandaid, what we call a plaster.  Do you know 
where they stick the bandaid?  It does not go on a leg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the parliamentary secretary say “Stick your 
bandaid, Bill C-18, here, provinces. Stick it on your lips. 
That is the end of that.  Until 2004, there will be no talk of 
equalization.  It is finished”.  Will the Minister of Finance 
still be here in a few months' time?  We will see.  We will see 
who is going to be the next leader of the Liberal Party.  That 
is going to change, we know.  We know the individuals are going 
to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, between you and me, I hope that the approach will 
change as well, that the government will connect again with what 
is going on in the provinces and regions.  They will never 
listen to the argument that the poor in one province pay for the 
rich in another.  If our tax arguments, our economic and 
political arguments are based on such demagoguery, this is not 
the country I know.  Thank God that people will fight that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, we are very disappointed by the first page of the 
bill, which could have had the government reconnect with the 
regions and with the economic challenges facing the various 
provinces.  We do not have a bill, we have a first page, that is 
all.  Together with our partners in the provinces, we will push 
to have the bill complete.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for this and for all the reasons he gave, and others as

possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for him.  Should the member not help us to get 
Quebec out of this system for all the good reasons he gave? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is only one thing I would disagree with, and that is that 
whichever government is sitting opposite—I agree it is worse with 
the Liberals—the system is exactly as he described for Quebec. 
It is no longer any good for Quebec and Quebec wants to run its 
own show.  Has he understood what I am getting at? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker,  I have heard and 
understood.  That said, it is certain that I am not a 
sovereignist, on that we agree.  We have a different way of 
doing things.  What we are saying is that we are not closing the 
door because there is a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly there are two different ways of doing things, but I 
would remind the hon. member that in Quebec, before a certain 
referendum was held, there was a commission on the future of 
Quebec.  The premier of the day, Mr. Parizeau, asked me to sit on 
that commission in the Eastern Townships.  I was sort of the 
token federalist on the commission.  We asked questions and the 
Parti Quebecois came up with proposals on a sovereign Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must tell hon. members that I raised questions about 
equalization. 
The documents available at the time, when we were discussing 
preparations for the referendum, were an accurate reflection of 
this country's old equalization system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The frustrations, which are in many ways understandable, about 
the Canadian system for a province within Canada would be the 
same for a region within a sovereign Quebec, if the equalization 
system retained were the same, but even more centralized, even 
more severe and involving fewer elements than the present 
Canadian system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing that must be said.  We all know the old 
saying that the grass is always greener on the other side of the 
fence.  In this case, I believe the members of the Bloc 
Quebecois would have everything to gain by again becoming 
partners in improving the system instead of slamming the door on 
a system that has, overall, been extremely positive from sea to 
sea.

that he did not also announce that he was departing with some of 
the attitudes that still permeate throughout the Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How quickly the members from the great province of Alberta 
forget the dirty thirties and how Atlantic Canada sent food, 
money, people and help to assist those people during that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member not believe that all Canadians deserve 
equal levels of education, health, infrastructure and standards 
so that we can all be proud to live here and share in the natural 
resources that Canada provides for all of us?  Would he not agree 
in that equality? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is certain that we should 
agree with the fact that people are equal in this country.  But 
equality is one thing.  We do not all have the same resources. 
Two individuals are different from one another just as two 
provinces may differ.  The needs of one individual may differ 
from those of another, as the needs of provinces may differ. 
Demands and support may be different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we want to do in our party and in the other, the Canadian 
Alliance, is tell those who contend that everybody is the same, 
individuals and provinces, that it does not work.  Across this 
country, things differ.  That is the beauty of our country.  At 
this point, we have to act, react and interact according to the 
needs of the community and the individual.  However, it is clear 
that we must be there to help people, the regions and the 
provinces needing it.

to modernize it and, finally, to take into account the current 
realities of certain provinces and the future reality these same 
provinces want to attain, but are having a little more trouble 
today doing so.  The equalization system should be a development 
tool rather than a paternalistic tool of a central government. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, Bill C-18 is certainly an interesting debate.  I guess 
it brings out the best and the worst in us.  Some members in some 
parts of the country forget that Canada is a very generous 
country.  Canada, as we well know regardless of our politics, has 
been defined by the United Nations as the best country in the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons for that is equalization.  It is an accepted 
reality in the country that not all the provinces are equal in 
terms of resources and richness.  The government and the 
governments that preceded it, going back to the early sixties, 
recognized that and have been very generous over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can argue on points of generosity and whether or not the 
present formula works.  However, if we were living in a perfect 
world and Canada was absolutely perfect, we would not need 
equalization.  Unfortunately Atlantic Canada and some of the 
western provinces are not blessed with oil in the ground at $40 a 
barrel.  That is a reality.  Who do we blame for that, the Prime 
Minister or the Almighty?  It is beyond the Prime Minister's 
capacity to put oil in the ground in every province, although I 
guess if we want to be entirely political we could attack him on 
that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to point out, and I hope that my colleagues from Alberta 
are listening, that from 1957 to 1965 Alberta received 
equalization from Ottawa.  What does that tell us? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It tells us that it was not always rich and that it was not 
always prosperous.  The energy there in its early years was just 
as Nova Scotia's is now, in its infancy.  The major difference 
was that at the time Alberta received 100 cents of every royalty 
dollar that came in.  For every dollar that it took out of the 
ground in oil, it kept it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are arguing in Atlantic Canada, and especially our 
friends from Nova Scotia who are now blessed with natural gas, is 
that it should have the same formula applied to it as was the 
case in Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If logic prevails, and it does in this argument, and if we want 
to raise ourselves to a level of sustainability in terms of the 
economy and diversifying the economy, we need the tools to do 
that.  The biggest tool of all is a financial tool, the financial 
resources to build a strong economy as Ralph Klein has done in 
Alberta and Premier Lougheed before him.  It is building on the 
principle that what is ours is ours and we will use it to benefit 
the people of our province.  That is what we are talking about in 
New Brunswick.  The formula has to be revisited.  Mr. Speaker, 
with your permission I will revisit— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member will have permission and 
have about six and a half minutes to revisit the issue after 
question period.

It is a veritable industry comprising over 12,000 producers and

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud to represent the region of Beauce, a major

of Quebec's entire production of maple syrup. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maple syrup proudly represents our country the world over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to invite the public to the Festival

for a Canadian with the proper academic work and language skills

area around the national capital, shuts out every qualified 
person from B.C. to Newfoundland.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, for two years the Prime Minister has 
been saying that he sold his shares in the Grand-Mère Golf Club 
long before he started pressuring a crown corporation to give 
money to the hotel next door. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just two days ago the golf club's lawyers wrote that the 
transfer of shares was only approved but not that it actually 
ever took place.  Just yesterday golf club spokesmen said that 
they never knew who owned the shares.  I will quote.  They said 
“From 1993 on we did not know exactly who it was”. My question 
is for the Prime Minister.  Who owned those shares? 
<P><A NAME="LINK104"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the ethics counsellor looked into this issue.  He saw 
all the documents and confirmed clearly that I had sold my shares 
on the November 1, 1993.  It was very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sold my shares to a company that was owned by Mr. Prince.  All 
the documents have been seen by the ethics counsellor.  For me it 
is clear.  I have always said the same thing and repeated it. 
Eventually Mr. Prince's company paid me and my company. 
<P><A NAME="LINK105"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, they can weakly applaud that weak 
response but section 50 of the Canada Business Corporations Act 
requires the golf club to maintain a record of the names of each 
shareholder and the date and details of every transaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the golf club's lawyer and spokesperson have said that Mr. 
Prince's name was never entered on the corporate records.  He can 
talk all he wants about Mr. Prince or the records.  This is new 
information.  He cannot refer to what the ethics counsellor said 
earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on this new information not previously known to the ethics 
counsellor, will the Minister of Industry do the right thing 
and—

Speaker, I assure my hon. friend and the House that industry 
officials are working with the company to ensure that it has 
complied with all registration requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear from every inquiry made into this matter that what 
the Prime Minister has said just now and earlier is absolutely 
correct.  He did not own those shares after he became Prime 
Minister. 
<P><A NAME="LINK107"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is one thing to say but it will be 
another thing to prove.  We will watch that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For two years the Prime Minister has also been saying that his 
holding company which owned the golf club shares was held in a 
blind trust, but we know the Prime Minister called the ethics 
counsellor in January 1996 about the shares.  Yesterday, after 
two years, the Prime Minister finally admitted that he was aware 
of and involved in the negotiations to resell those shares.

my question is for the Right Hon. Prime Minister.  It is not 
about the Grand-Mère.  It is about the Prime Minister's concept 
of citizenship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday in the House, in defending the corporate sponsorship 
program for the FTAA, he said that they were just inviting 
Canadian business people who have major interests in all these 
countries to show them that they are good Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the Prime Minister think these people are particularly 
good Canadian citizens?  Why are citizens from across Canada 
coming to Quebec to show their disagreement with government 
policy and exercising their citizenship being treated as 
dangerous citizens rather than good citizens? 
<P><A NAME="LINK124"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, when large enterprises sell products in the Americas 
made by Canadian workers, I feel these people who are creating 
jobs in Canada and selling Canadian products and Canadian 
technology abroad are good Canadian citizens because they take 
care of people who need jobs in Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK125"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister did not answer my question about why 
people coming to Quebec City to disagree are being treated as 
dangerous citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps while he is answering that question he could explain 
why, if the government is so proud of the corporate sponsorship 
issue, the message we referred to yesterday on the government 
website is gone when we try to pull it up today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the government ashamed of this corporate sponsorship?  Does 
the Prime Minister not see that this amounts to the 
commercialization of everything?  Pretty soon we will not be able 
to do anything without a corporate logo staring us in the face. 
<P><A NAME="LINK126"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think it is important for the hon. member to 
understand, first, that our practice with respect to sponsorship 
at Quebec City is consistent with international practice.  It is 
consistent with previous summits of the Americas held in Miami 
and in Santiago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the sponsors do not obtain any particular access to 
heads of state or heads of government who are there.  The truth 
is that the New Democratic Party is not in favour of the summit 
taking place at all.  It is not in favour of developing countries 
in the hemisphere obtaining access to markets and is not in 
favour of supporting Canadian firms in their efforts to sell 
Canadian goods and products throughout the hemisphere.

my question is for the Minister of National Revenue.  The ethics

Grand-Mère Golf Club between 1993 and 1999.  The golf club itself

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Martin Cauchon (Minister of National Revenue and 
Secretary of State (Economic Development Agency of Canada for the

should know the Income Tax Act much better than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cornerstone of the act is the question of confidentiality. 
Each and every time we refer to a specific question on a specific

He should know much better than that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister could obviously waive that.  Here 
is another pebble for the Prime Minister's princely feet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the much celebrated Paquette letter, the mother of all 
letters, the Prime Minister's pardon contains false information. 
It refers to a date on the calendar that does not even exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The devil is in the detail.  If there is to be any credibility 
or closure on this issue, will the Prime Minister tell the House 
if any of his associates, his lawyer Debbie Weinstein or a member 
of her firm, ever owned or controlled the shares in the 
Grand-Mère prior to 1999? 
<P><A NAME="LINK131"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, they never owned the shares.  When I hear the fifth 
party talking about it I would like to say to the leader that 
despite the leader's pension of $85,000 a year and a $10 million 
party debt, he demanded another $200,000 from his party on 
becoming the leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He got the lowest popular vote in the party's history and 
decreased its seats from 20 to 12 but still demanded a $160,000 
top-up to his $130,000 House of Commons salary.  I guess the 
reason he does not want to be the prime minister is because of 
the pay cut.

million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The conflict of interest code is clear.  A public office holder 
cannot even participate in a discussion about his blind trust 
until after the ethics counsellor has been consulted.  Yet in 
January 1996 it was the Prime Minister who phoned the ethics 
counsellor to inform him that the sale had fallen through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How was it possible for the Prime Minister to know that the sale 
of the shares had fallen through without being in violation of 
the conflict of interest code? 
<P><A NAME="LINK133"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, because at that time according to the rules that existed 
a debt did not have to be reported.  The ethics counsellor said 
that very clearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since that time we have changed the rules and a debt in the 
future will have to be reported.  The ethics counsellor explained 
it very clearly when he testified in front of the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debt was owed to me.  I guess I needed the money because I 
am not making as much as the leader of the fifth party and I 
wanted to be paid. 
<P><A NAME="LINK134"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Minister of 
Industry told me that consent of the golf club partners to 
release their letter was given only at 4.30 p.m., after Mr. 
Wilson had finished testifying on the golf club. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The law firm has confirmed to us that it sent the letter to 
Industry Canada earlier in the morning and were only called back 
for permission to release the letter at three o'clock.  That 
permission was granted no later than 3.40 p.m., before the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

question is totally wrong.  There was no withholding of evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ethics commissioner disclosed the letter before the 
committee as soon as he received in his own hands confirmation 
that the person who had written the letter was willing to have it 
disclosed.

his interest in the Grand-Mère golf course had been placed in a

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister admit that his intervention, his

contrary to the very nature of a blind trust, and thus gives a 
serious appearance of conflict of interest? 
<P><A NAME="LINK137"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
spoke to the ethics counsellor.  If he had told me I was in 
conflict of interest, he would have told me “I cannot talk to 
you”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was money owing to me, and I needed that money.  As I have 
already said, as Prime Minister, I probably earn $150,000 less 
than the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party. So I 
needed the money. 
<P><A NAME="LINK138"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister will not justify his actions in connection with the 
Auberge Grand-Mère by telling us he does not earn enough money. 
We do not want to hear about his salary now, we can deal with 
that another time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is this: why has the ethics counsellor obliged the 
Minister of Finance to put his assets into a blind trust and 
forbid him from even taking part in discussions on shipbuilding, 
when the Prime Minister himself does not comply with the same 
standards? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He intervenes, and then he gets his money.  He does everything 
possible in his own case. 
<P><A NAME="LINK139"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
I have said before—and now repeat—the ethics counsellor did not, 
according to the rules put in place by the Conservative 
government, require the debt to be put into a trust, because it 
had been contracted before I became Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a certain point, I needed money.  I wanted to find out 
whether the debt had been paid.  It had not, so I called the 
ethics counsellor.  He told me that this was not something I had 
to declare and that I had declared.

that indeed crosses were being burned on lawns in Prince George.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Canadian

going on in Prince George, even though not the specific ones she 
mentioned the day before.

the Public Service Commission is advertising a program and policy 
job opening in the office of the Governor General of Canada. 
Even though the Governor General of Canada serves all Canada, 
most Canadians cannot even apply for this job.  Only people from 
Ontario and Quebec can apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was this restriction applied by government policy or did the 
Governor General of Canada request that people from eight 
provinces and three territories be screened out of this 
opportunity just because of where they live?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (President of the Treasury Board and

section 13 of the Public Service Employment Act provides for the 
establishment of geographic criteria. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the House know which government revised that legislation in 
parliament in 1992?  It was the Conservative government.  I am

<P><A NAME="LINK167"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I just asked her if the Governor General requested that 
a restriction be applied.  However, I will go on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another job on the website that shows the reason for 
this concept of western alienation.  The website is advertising 
50 government policy and planning jobs in Ottawa, which pay up to

for these 50 jobs.  People cannot apply if they are from the west

this is not a policy.  This is legislation that was passed by the

I think the Governor General respects the legislation and is

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Pallister (Portage—Lisgar, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Secretary of State for 
Multiculturalism and the Status of Women made divisive, malicious 
and false comments in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the comments were rehearsed.  The Secretary of State for 
Multiculturalism and the Status of Women maligned the people of 
Prince George.  She maligned thinking Canadians.  She maligned 
tolerant Canadians with her comments and by her conduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today she offered a halfhearted statement that did not undo in 
any way the damage and hurt she caused yesterday.  An intolerant 
minister's divided— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I do not know whether there is an answer to 
the comment.  If not the hon. member may want to proceed with his 
supplementary immediately. 
<P><A NAME="LINK171"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I do not think that party will ever learn the tradition 
in this House.  When a member of parliament gets up and 
apologizes, in the way the minister apologized and in the way the 
member for Edmonton—Strathcona apologized, we have a tradition 
that when a mistake is made and recognized we accept the word of 
an hon. member of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the Alliance Party is desperate.  We will miss the 
gentlemanly approach of the hon. member for Calgary Southwest 
when he leaves.  He is a good example to those members but they 
do not want to follow it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK172"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Pallister (Portage—Lisgar, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday's comments continue what seems to be a 
growing trend among Liberal ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the heritage minister makes hurtful comments, the Prime 
Minister says nothing.  When the immigration minister sneers and 
makes intolerant comments toward Canadians, nothing is said and 
nothing is done.  The Prime Minister remains silent and, in his 
silence, he condones the conduct of these ministers and 
encourages it to continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to put an end to this dangerous trend by members of 
that party and that front bench.  The member is totally unfit for 
her duties.  I ask the Prime Minister to demand her resignation 
immediately. 
<P><A NAME="LINK173"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I understand that the leader of the fifth party is very 
happy that he does not have the member with him anymore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps I should inform the House that today the Canadian 
Taxpayers Federation had their third annual Teddy Award.  The 
winners of the federal Teddy goes to, hands down, no contest, to 
the majority of Canadian Alliance MPs from the class of '93 for 
abandoning their principled stand against the gold-plated MP 
pension plan and opting back in quicker than an Olympic sprinter.

asked to be exempted from any future agreement on lumber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the Minister for International Trade tell us whether we

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, first, I hope that I am not the only one who wants 
this consensus and that the Bloc Quebecois will also be part of 
it, because it is extremely important. I am not just pushing for 
a consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, if an official from the BC lumber industry is 
negotiating taxes in Washington, I can assure the House that 
this individual has no mandate from our government to do so. 
This is not how things work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met the people from British Columbia on Tuesday morning.

burned on lawns in Prince George.  When the secretary of state

tabled that letter and has not provided any proof of these false

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

for the mistake he made which cost the taxpayers of Alberta 
$700,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said that she had made a mistake and she apologized.  We did 
that for the member for Edmonton—Strathcona.  He made a mistake

happened to accountability?  The secretary of state needs to be

However, the people of Canada want me to be here.  That is the 
problem that the Alliance has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there are 301 persons in one House, mistakes will happen. 
We are not perfect.  However, our good tradition is that when 
somebody stands in his or her place and offers to apologize to a

<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I must admit it is with heavy heart that I have to bring 
this question of privilege today to the attention of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. Prime Minister has said, it should not be necessary 
in this place to remind the Prime Minister and the House about 
our traditions in this place, not only about telling the truth 
but about ministerial accountability and with knowledge 
aforethought misleading the House, which is what we have seen 
over the last two days from the minister for multiculturalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to a Liberal question from a backbencher, in other 
words a question that she knew well ahead of time what the 
contents of it would be, the minister for multiculturalism 
yesterday rose in the House and accused the people of Prince 
George and British Columbians of hate crimes and specifically 
about burning crosses on lawns as we speak.  That is what she 
said in this place.  She knew the question.  She said that 
anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was bad enough, but then with two hours to think it over 
she came back to the House and she said the following, and every 
one of these things is not true.  I refer to page 2010 of the 
Commons <I>Debates</I> from yesterday where she said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In British Columbia there have been incidents of hate crime, 
including cross burnings.  I know of this because I was contacted 
immediately that these incidents occurred by the mayor of Prince 
George. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not true.  That is not true.  She had two hours to think 
it over, two hours to check her facts, two hours to check her 
correspondence, and she came back in the House and said that. In 
the second incident she said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my position as Secretary of State for Multiculturalism I 
funded the mayor to set up a task force right away. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not true.  There was no letter.  There was no request. 
There were no cross burnings.  With two hours to check her facts, 
she came back and said that following the cross burnings in 
British Columbia, which were false and never happened, and in 
consultation with the mayor, which never happened, they set up a 
task force.  That is not true.  Yet she said that in the House 
with two hours to think it over.  She then said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The community was duly concerned and duly appalled at the 
incident— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are not appalled at anything.  They are the proud members 
of Prince George, good, decent people who deserve better than 
what they got from this minister for multiculturalism over the 
last couple of days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She went on to say that the people of the community demanded 
that they take immediate action: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—so I funded the mayor to hold a task force. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, not only did they not demand immediate action on that 
because it never happened, not only was the community not 
involved, they were not outraged.  How could they be outraged? It 
never happened.  Then she went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The task force met and came out with some remarkable and 
courageous recommendations— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was about cross burnings that never ever happened in Prince 
George.  Yet she had two hours to check her facts, two hours to 
come back to the House and give us the facts.  She went on to 
say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was recently in Prince George— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We sometimes wonder if even this is true now, but perhaps she 
was.  Then she said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—I met with the task force and congratulated the mayor and the 
people of Prince George for taking immediate action on incidents 
that could happen—anywhere in Canada. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>She came back to the House today and after all of that she went 
out to a scrum, talked to the media and said that she had a 
letter from the mayor of Prince George in her hand to back all 
this up.  The letter does not exist.  It never happened.  This 
whole thing is a figment of her imagination.  It is a complete 
fabrication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the worst of it.  The worst of it is, not only is it 
all fabricated, not only after the two hours to check the facts, 
but she slandered an entire community, my province and the good 
people who are working to make the communities better, with two 
hours' notice and telling at least five untruths in this place. 
There were five after she had time to check her facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today she went on to say that she regretted the original 
statement and would like to apologize to the people of Prince 
George.  I will tell the House what she needs to apologize for. 
She could start with an apology to the people of Prince George, 
and that will be a long time being accepted because we do not 
consider this at all sincere.

ask the member to withdraw it.  The member says “I am sorry, 
that was a mistake” and withdraws it.  That is not what we are 
dealing with at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with malice from the multiculturalism minister. 
We are dealing with someone who knew what she was doing, not only 
before the question was asked, but with two hours notice and on 
into the media interviews.  She not only did not tell the truth 
here, she did not tell the truth out there to the media.  She did 
not tell the truth to the people of Canada.  She made stuff up 
out of her complete imagination about whether or not a letter 
even existed.  It did not exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She came in with an idea that she can just say sorry about that, 
so what about the record now that says Prince George is a haven 
for racists and cross burners; so what if she maligned an entire 
province and the people who live there; so what if she came into 
the House with two hours notice and told everyone, by the way, 
that was true.  She went on to say that it was true and that 
there were racists in Prince George who burned crosses.  “It is 
true”, she said, “I have checked it out.  I have a letter from 
the mayor”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of it was untrue.  She should have known it, she did know it 
and she repeated it anyway.  I would argue, Mr. Speaker, that you 
have no other course of action but to find the minister in 
contempt for what she has taken the House through over the last 
two days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The crass attempt at being mistaken and thinking it is all over 
is completely unacceptable.  She is in contempt of the House and 
in contempt of parliament.  She should be tossed from this place. 
I urge you, Mr. Speaker, to make that decision.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, first, I could quote the entire 
statement of the secretary of state today, but I will briefly 
highlight the portion which refers to the point just raised which 
says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I mistakenly linked the city of Prince George with a 
specific hate activity.  I regret that and I apologize to the 
people of Prince George. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud of what communities have accomplished in this 
country to counter racism and hate and to promote cultural 
diversity, especially the city of Prince George's city council 
task force on hate activities. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statement was withdrawn.  Therefore, if it was withdrawn and 
the letter attached to something that was withdrawn is equally 
withdrawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it was said that the minister had two hours to think it 
through.  I would think most members in the House know that the 
hon. minister yesterday, immediately after question period, was 
participating in a number of activities with dozens of Canadians 
wishing like her to fight racism in Canada.  To suggest that she 
had “two hours” to do nothing and so on is inaccurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, it was said that the member had a long time to apologize. 
No, that is not stated correctly.  The minister has apologized 
some time ago would be the more appropriate reference.  In fact 
it was two hours and fifteen minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, it was said in the House that the minister was not 
sincere when she apologized.  That is impugning motives to 
someone else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  You bet it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  An hon. member has just now said “you 
bet it is”, confirming the fact that was exactly the intent of 
what was said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Do you want me to say it on the record? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we now have a second 
member just corroborating that accusation and therefore refusing 
to accept the apology of an hon. minister. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1515"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, it has been said in words to the effect that the 
community in question, and I disagree with that, was “a haven 
for cross burners”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This statement was never made by the minister.  In fact she 
withdrew what she said.  Regardless, the particular statement was 
never made.  How could one allege that someone made a statement 
when the statement was not that and was withdrawn anyway?  If it 
was withdrawn, it was assumed under the rules of the House not to 
have been made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not invent those rules.  They were around here long before 
I came along, and possibly will be around far longer than I will 
be here.  Be that as it may, other members and I will accept when 
a member apologizes to the House because that is the appropriate 
thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  She is a minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  A member across just said “She is a 
minister”.  In other words, we should believe some members and 
disbelieve others because they are public officeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refute that.  All hon. members are accountable to the House. 
We all are.  I am a senior cabinet minister and I am accountable. 
I am here now.  My colleague, the secretary of state, was in the 
House and apologized very clearly to the people of Prince George, 
British Columbia.  That was clearly done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us know that was done.  Let this be clear, the Secretary 
of State for Multiculturalism was serious about her apology.  I 
believe that we on this side of the House have taken her apology 
as being very serious.  I would recommend to you, Mr. Speaker, 
that you accept that apology with the seriousness and the 
sincerity in which it was intended.  This issue should be closed 
as a result of this clear and unequivocal apology made earlier 
this day, over two hours ago in the House of Commons. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise on the same point of order.  I wonder whether or not I 
could help shed some light on this darkening situation by 
suggesting that there may be some middle ground here between what 
I would say was a hyperbole and an evasion: hyperbole, justified 
in many respects by the justified indignation of the people of 
Prince George and their representatives about what was said 
yesterday, and evasion on the part of the government in the sense 
that what is at issue here is not whether the minister apologized 
for the statement about there being cross burnings in Prince 
George but whether or not she was withdrawing her claims about 
the letter and the communication from the mayor, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She has not indicated anything in that respect.  I was here when 
she made her statement earlier.  Unfortunately she chose to rush 
out of the Chamber immediately after she made her point of order. 
There were people that wanted to question her on her statement 
about having received a communication from the mayor.  If she 
made some reference to a letter in a scrum, that is a further 
reference to a communication from the mayor of Prince George. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People wanted to know if she is now saying that she received no 
communication, either a letter or any other kind, from the mayor 
of Prince George.  That would go a long way to correcting what 
members of the Alliance are claiming is untrue.  I take them at 
their word.  They know more about Prince George and the situation 
there than I do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point of the matter is that it is incumbent upon the 
minister, or perhaps on you, Mr. Speaker, to advise the House as 
to how we can create a situation where the minister can come in 
and account, not just for what she said about burning crosses in 
Prince George but for what she said about how she came to believe 
that there were burning crosses in Prince George.  She led the 
House to believe this was a communication she received from the 
mayor of Prince George. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members want to know whether or not the apology includes a 
withdrawal of that claim and an apology for making that claim, 
particularly if it is not true and if the mayor of Prince George 
is denying it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All would be settled if the minister would be prepared to come 
in here and defend herself.  Instead of having the Prime Minister 
and the government House leader defend her, she could walk in 
here and give an account of what she said, what she still stands 
by, and what she now withdraws and further apologizes for.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, much of what has been said clearly indicates that 
there are now more facts to be examined because of what has taken 
place here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader has characterized the apology that 
was given as clear and unequivocal.  I was in the House and I 
would characterize it quite differently.  I would characterize it 
as quite qualified and carefully crafted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsequent to that the minister then literally sprinted out of 
the House while there was an attempt made by the opposition House 
leader to have her table documents to which she had referred. 
The minister herself has opened a whole new facet of the 
particular issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took her qualified apology to in fact bring in new evidence 
that suggested she was relying on a letter that came from the 
mayor of Prince George.  That now appears to be totally and 
utterly false.  She did not address that issue in her apology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest there is a need in an unemotional and straightforward 
way to examine all of the facts that have transpired.  It is very 
simple and easy to do that.  We can check <I>Hansard</I> to see 
what was said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister should in fairness be given an opportunity to speak 
to the issue and have an opportunity perhaps to set the record 
straight again, if necessary.  There are a number of very 
specious, false and very damaging statements when it comes to the 
people of Prince George that are now out there for them to try to 
contend with.  The minister herself has to be part of this 
equation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge you, Mr. Speaker, to take the matter seriously, review 
the record and give the minister an opportunity to reply. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The Chair has heard enough on this 
point. We have heard from each party that has offered to 
participate in the discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Not the member for Prince George—Peace 
River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am very well aware that the hon. member 
for Prince George—Peace River wants to rise, but there has to be 
a limit on how long we discuss these matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Mr. Speaker, he is the representative of 
that riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am well aware that he is the 
representative of that riding.  Maybe he should have led off but 
he did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  There are two members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am well aware of that, and one of them did 
not lead off.  The fact is we have had an incident that has 
caused severe distress to the members of parliament from Prince 
George.  I am as well aware of that as I think all hon. members. 
I know that others have been offended by these remarks as well. 
The fact is that sometimes members say things in the House that 
are incorrect or wrong.  Subsequently, when this is drawn to 
their attention, they make some kind of apology or statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case that is what has happened.  I have in my hand a 
copy of the minister's remarks, which I was in the House for 
earlier today, in which as she said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>yesterday I mistakenly linked the city of Prince George with a 
specific hate activity. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apparently she went on to say that she regretted that and she 
apologized to the people of that community.  Many hon. members, 
for whatever reason, may feel that this apology was insufficient, 
given the seriousness of the statements that were made, but the 
fact is that there was an apology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Chair to continue the matter by some means, and I am not 
sure what, perhaps by finding a breach of privilege, I would have 
to have heard something that convinces me that the privileges of 
the House of Commons have been breached by a minister or any 
member making a statement that is incorrect and then making some 
kind of apology.  I do not believe the privileges of the House 
have been breached by this.  Accordingly I do not see a place 
where the Chair can intervene further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members have made their point forcefully that the 
minister's retraction, apology or whatever it is called, was 
insufficient for their purposes.  I am sure that the matter will 
come up again in committee when the minister is making an 
appearance on estimates or something of that kind.  I am sure 
questions will be asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it is for the Chair at this point to rule that 
there has been any breach of the privileges of the House that 
would justify me in referring the matter further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know it is perhaps an unsatisfactory resolution of the issue 
at this time for some hon. members.  I also know that, as we saw 
today in question period, questions may get asked.  There will be 
opportunities, as I say,  when the minister will be asked and she 
may choose to answer further questions or make a further 
statement, but that is not for the Chair to compel or demand at 
this point.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members have made their points and I am very respectful of 
the fact that many hon. members have been deeply offended by the 
remarks that were made.  However, I think in the circumstances 
the minister has made an apology.  The House has to accept the 
apology such as it is, although there may be disagreement about 
it.  I think we need to move on to the other items of business 
before us this afternoon, with great respect to all hon. members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mean no disrespect to the hon. member for Prince George—Peace 
River or his colleague from Prince George—Bulkley Valley in not 
hearing them.  I feel that we have heard from each party.  It is 
a matter that continual discussion of is not going to assist us 
because I do not believe there is a question of privilege in this 
discussion.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>QUESTIONS ON THE ORDER PAPER 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege relating to questions 
on the order paper.  It is a new approach to the same old problem 
of the government not responding within the allotted time period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I heard the hon. member on this point 
yesterday on a point of order during the time questions were 
called.  I believe he raised the matter again this morning when 
questions were called.  I cannot see how there is a question of 
privilege arising out of this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has tabled his questions and he has answers as to why they 
are late one way or another from the parliamentary secretary.  I 
will hear him for one minute, but he has to convince me very 
quickly that this is a question of privilege because I do not see 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will convince you if I 
am given a minute.  I will go back to 1992 and quote from 
<I>Hansard</I> on the very same issue regarding breaches of 
privilege with regard to questions on the order paper.  This is 
effectively shutting down a member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 10, 1992, the then member for 
Glengarry—Prescott—Russell, who by the way is now the 
government House leader in charge of this file, rose on this very 
issue.  The Speaker at the time heard the member out, which I am 
hoping you will do.  The member at the time quoted from pages 70 
and 71 of Erskine May's 20th edition which I will do regarding 
privilege.  It is defined as: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The privileges of Parliament are rights which are “absolutely 
necessary for the due execution of its powers”.  They are 
enjoyed by individual Members— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to point out that Standing Order 39(4) of the House 
says that members can place up to four questions on the order 
paper at one time.  Quoting from <I>Hansard</I>, March 10, 1992, 
the member said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I want to make to you is that the government is 
systematically not answering questions that I place on the Order 
Paper.  By not answering the questions that are there, I am 
unable to ask new questions. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That restricts the role of members of parliament to ask 
legitimate questions of the government.  He continued: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, once the Order Paper is plugged up with four 
questions, new questions cannot be asked. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on in detail— 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am quite familiar with the argument 
the hon. member is making.  I recall making a similar one myself 
at one time or another.  I am very sympathetic to the plight he 
describes, but might I suggest that he go to the procedure and 
House affairs committee at the earliest opportunity, or the new 
committee that has been struck to deal with changing the rules of 
the House, and seek changes to allow him to put even more 
questions on the order paper or seek changes that might have some 
penalty for non-answer to the questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not for the Chair on questions of privilege to deal with 
the fact that answers are not being given.  What power does the 
Chair have to enforce this rule now?  None. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can say that these questions should be answered.  I can stand 
here and say it until I am blue in the face, but if they are not 
answered, they are not answered.  I know the problem.  It is an 
old problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  That is why we are here, to be heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  That is why I am suggesting the hon. member 
go to the committee and raise it there because the committee is 
charged with this responsibility.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not in a position to do something to solve the problem. The 
parliamentary secretary may be able to help by giving further 
solace to the hon. member in respect of the answers, and perhaps 
that is what he will do now. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, none 
of us here have any doubt that the member's questions are 
important and that they raise important issues.  I indicated to 
him last week and in fact shared a draft answer to one of the 
questions.  I indicated it was my intention and the government's 
intention to improve on the answer in the draft.  He seemed to 
have acquiesced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out procedurally, and for the benefit of the hon. member 
if he is interested, that in the event a question of that nature 
is not answered within 45 days he is at liberty, and this is what 
procedure requires,  to ask that it be transferred for debate. If 
he wishes to have it transferred for debate, that is his remedy 
and members of the House will acquiesce in that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However he does not appear to want to transfer the question for 
debate.  He appears to want an answer.  I have indicated to the 
House that I am working with the hon. member to get an answer, 
and he has acknowledged that.  It does not seem to be that 
pressing that we should have to take up more House time trying to 
convince the hon. member that his answers will be good answers on 
these important issues and that they will be forthcoming shortly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
if you check the record, I was quoted the same time in 1992 as 
the current government House leader.  The point I made then, 
which I will make here very briefly because I know you are anxious 
for this to be over, was that the four question rule of only 
being able to put only four questions on the order paper, the 
limit of four questions, was new when instituted in the 1980s. It 
was supposed to benefit the government so that it would not have 
a whole bunch of questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In return for only having four questions, the government would 
answer the questions within 45 days.  Now what we have is that if 
the government does not answer the questions, we cannot put down 
any more questions.  The government is frustrating the will of 
that reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the government want to go back to the days when there were 
100 questions on the order paper?  Is that what it wants?  The 
reform was brought in to meet the needs of the government that 
was complaining it had far too many questions on the order paper. 
It asked to limit them to four and it would answer within 45 
days.  Now what does it have?  It has the best of all possible 
worlds. It does not answer the questions and members can only ask 
four.  It is ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I sympathize with the hon. member.  I 
remember making the same arguments.  However, the rules are the 
rules and the Speaker, as a servant of the House, must enforce 
those rules. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to briefly address this 
question of privilege.  If we look at the questions on the order 
paper we will discover that there are probably fewer questions 
than there have ever been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is that?  There is a very simple reason.  Members of 
parliament have given up on using the order paper as an 
instrument to do their jobs because the process has been abused 
by the government.  It does not matter whether the limit is one 
question or 100 questions.  When we do not get answers, people 
stop using it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not long ago I checked the order paper questions at the clerk's 
table and there were only 18 questions from the entire House. I 
think the Speaker has an obligation to address the issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Let me address the issue by citing to 
the House the decision of Mr. Speaker Fraser on a similar matter, 
not the one referred to by the hon. member for New Brunswick 
Southwest in his argument.  The decision was delivered by Mr. 
Speaker Fraser on May 18, 1989, and appears on page 1890 of 
<I>Debates</I> for that day.  The Speaker said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as I am concerned, I do not think that it is appropriate 
that the time of this House has to be taken up by Members having 
to get up and ask why somebody has not given them the answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Hon. Member for Churchill—made it quite clear. If there is 
a case where something is so complicated that it is impossible 
for the Government to give the answer within 45 days, I think 
Hon. Members would be patient and understanding if the 
Parliamentary Secretary or Minister got up and said that that was 
the dilemma they found themselves in. 
For the most part, there is no real reason in the world why these 
answers cannot be given.  As I say, I cannot order them to be 
given because I do not have the power.  But I do ask that those 
who are asked to prepare these answers take a look at this rule 
and realize that when they do not get the answer back to their 
Minister in time, they are putting all of us through a lot of 
difficulty and taking up the time of the House, because 
undoubtedly there will be more points of order raised on exactly 
this issue.

made arguments on occasion to Mr. Speaker Fraser on this point 
when I was not in the chair of the House.  I sympathize, but I 
respectfully suggest to hon. members that I cannot do anything. I 
agree with what Mr. Speaker Fraser said.  We must consider the

of order, but I do not think it is appropriate to treat this as a 
question of privilege.  As indicated by Mr. Speaker Fraser, there 
is nothing I can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, fundamentally it comes 
down to the fact that the government has the capacity to answer 
those numerous questions within 24 hours.  What is it trying to 
hide?   Why will it not answer the questions?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we may not be able to get answers to pretty 
straightforward questions on the order paper, but perhaps we 
could get an answer to the question of what the business will be 
in the House for this week and the following week. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to make the weekly 
business statement and to indicate to the House that I intend to 
do my utmost to have order paper questions answered as rapidly as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This afternoon we will resume debate on Bill C-12 respecting 
compensation for judges.  We will then continue with Bill C-18, 
the equalization bill, which we started this morning.  That will 
be followed, if there is time, with Bill C-17 respecting the 
innovation foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Friday we will consider report stage of Bill C-4 respecting 
the sustainable development foundation, and any time left will be 
used on second reading of Bill C-7, the youth justice bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an effort to complete consideration of the youth justice 
bill, we will continue discussing that bill on Monday next. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next Tuesday we will commence report stage of Bill C-8 
respecting the financial institutions legislation.  Should that 
be completed, we would then continue with Bill C-22, the income 
tax amendment.  As previously announced and as adopted by the 
House, in the evening there will be a special take note debate on 
the summit of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next Wednesday, March 28, we will debate Bill C-2, the 
employment insurance amendments, at report stage and hopefully 
have third reading on next Thursday, March 29.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from March 12 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-12, an act to amend the Judges Act and to amend another 
act in consequence, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in debate to speak to Bill 
C-12, an act to amend the Judges Act and to amend another act in 
consequence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I first must state how disappointed I am that once again the 
government is going to great lengths to look after what some 
refer to as the elite of our society.  At the same time, what it 
is doing for the ordinary citizens, other than taxing them into 
the ground, is unclear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who occupy the upper echelons of our public service are 
well looked after. 
Meanwhile those in the trenches, the clerks and receptionists who 
comprise the first line of contact between the government and 
citizens, are again expected to do without.

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything I have just said is almost word for word what I said 
in March 1998 when I rose to debate Bill C-37.  It appears the 
more things change around here, the more they stay the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judges, for some reason, attract an inordinate level of 
attention from the Liberal government.  It seems that with every 
new parliament we debate and pass legislation to look after the 
interests of judges.  It is unfortunate that the government is 
not as keen to address the problems of our young offender 
legislation or the creation of a national sex offender registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that farmers were once again demonstrating here on 
Parliament Hill this week.  Thousands of family farms are lost 
each year as debts rise, but the government does little to 
address the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also note, once again, the vast number of RCMP officers who 
will be seconded to provide security at the Quebec City summit of 
the Americas in late April.  Entire crime fighting units will be 
stripped of their top investigators.  Since most of the personnel 
will come from Quebec and Ontario, I foresee organized crime 
having a field day with its drug operations, commercial frauds, 
stock market manipulations and smuggling operations.  I mention 
only federal areas of police jurisdiction because, as we all 
know, when the cat is away the mice will play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the RCMP is required to take on additional responsibility 
of the nature of this summit for VIPs, the force gets further and 
further behind in its battle against crime.  However the 
government will look good because it is hosting such an important 
event.  It will be our citizens and victims of crime who pay for 
enabling the Prime Minister to play on the world stage.  The 
government looks after the elite but often conveniently forgets 
the ordinary citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Bill C-12, I note that the Constitution Act of 
1867, formerly the BNA Act, is part of our formal constitution. 
The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, as we know, includes 
the Constitution Act of 1867.  It was, after all, the document 
that set the stage for the country.  Section 100 of that document 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Salaries, Allowances, and Pensions of the Judges of the 
Superior, District, and County courts (except the Courts of 
Probate in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick), and of the Admiralty 
Courts in Cases where the Judges thereof for the Time being paid 
by Salary, shall be fixed and provided by the Parliament of 
Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the names of our courts have changed over the years. 
Some have even been replaced.  This section of our constitution 
requires salaries of superior court judges to be decided by 
parliament.  That is partly why we have had the Judges Act for 
the past many years.  By constitutional law, parliamentarians 
have the power to fix the salaries and pensions of superior court 
level judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the inside cover of Bill C-12, in the summary of the 
legislation, it states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enactment implements the federal government's response to 
the report of the 1999 Judicial Compensation and Benefits 
Commission regarding compensation and benefits for judges.  It 
amends the Judges Act to increase judicial salaries and 
allowances, improve the current judicial annuities scheme and put 
into place a separate life insurance plan for federally appointed 
judges. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am seeing is the derogation of power, at least to some 
extent, in that the Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission 
is making a report to which the government must respond.  I fully 
appreciate that the commission has been set up because of Supreme 
Court of Canada decisions concerning the independence and 
impartiality of the judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However what has not often been stated is that Supreme Court of 
Canada judges are in a conflict of interest when they try to 
change the law regarding the pay and benefits of the judiciary, 
which of course includes them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having slammed the supreme court judges for causing changes to 
our laws while they are in direct conflict with those changes, I 
fully understand that this is the fix the government has put us 
in.  We have acceded to the use of the Judicial Compensation and 
Benefits Commission, but it merely makes recommendations, with 
all due respect.  We parliamentarians must retain full control 
over what is to be provided to the valuable portion of the 
administration of justice within the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that Chief Justice Dickson, as he then was, stated in the 
Supreme Court of Canada case of Regina v Beauregard: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing would be more damaging to the reputation of the judiciary 
and the administration of justice than a perception that judges 
were not shouldering their fair share of the burden in difficult 
economic times. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following his works, I point out that for a number of years the 
country faced severe economic times.  I recall the Prime Minister 
stating time and time again that Canadians must be patient and 
essentially bite the bullet a little longer until the economy has 
recovered and Canada has returned to a better financial state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge members of the Chamber to carefully consider the 11.2% 
increase in salary for these judges, especially in light of the 
far less significant salary increases the government has been 
providing to our civil service, our federal police force and all 
other employees of the federal government. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT69"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT69"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1545

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fully understand the government being hesitant to open the 
vaults to reimburse all of its employees to the fair and 
equitable level in comparison to the public sector, especially 
when this country has had such a debt hanging over us from years 
of Liberal mismanagement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, 11.2% as a raise in salary, plus a very generous 
pension plan, is obviously creating just the situation 
anticipated by Chief Justice Dickson.  It damages the reputation 
of the judiciary because it creates at least a perception that 
judges are not doing their fair share in getting this country 
back into financial balance.  I am paraphrasing the words of the 
chief justice here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I may not be the first person to recognize the value of our 
judiciary, but I will certainly not be the last.  I have spent 
much time in our courts witnessing day to day administration of 
justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A government argument for such excessive salary increases for 
judges has been that we must pay well in order to attract capable 
and experienced people.  Surely this is just another argument for 
having the judicial appointment process more open and 
accountable.  As far as I can determine, it has not been that 
difficult to attract capable individuals to apply and sit on the 
benches of our superior courts.  I often wonder whether this is 
just not a case of some individuals wanting everything:  the 
prestige, the opportunity to channel legal cases down particular 
paths, or more regular working hours.  Then, after getting the 
position, they are now politicking for extraordinary salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members of parliament had the opportunity to become involved 
in reviewing these appointments, perhaps they would have a better 
chance to see just what is required to ensure that capable and 
experienced individuals are encouraged to continue to apply for 
judicial appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult to accept pay raises beyond the norm when we are 
dealing with salaries in the $200,000 range, when we are dealing 
with, in some cases, sheer patronage, and when the whole process 
is deliberately kept from parliamentary scrutiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have stated, it is the responsibility of parliament to 
decide on the salaries and benefits of our federally appointed 
judges.  Without sufficient information to determine whether such 
a significant jump in pay is necessary to maintain and/or enhance 
the judicial personnel, it is difficult for me to accept the 
proposals of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the meagre percentage raises given by the government 
to so many other needy and deserving employees of the federal 
government, 11.2% is particularly hard to swallow.  I keep 
hearing about our military personnel using food banks to survive 
between paycheques.  I become concerned about our RCMP members 
working two or three jobs when their families have trouble paying 
the bills, especially when we see how rich and powerful organized 
crime is becoming in this country.  When I see these things and 
others I cannot have quite the same concern for federal judges 
who are not nearly so badly off financially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be opposing this legislation.  I urge other members to 
have a serious look at what the government is proposing here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something is seriously wrong when the government continues to 
look after the top officers within the Department of National 
Defence and gives peanuts to the lower ranks.  Something is 
seriously wrong when we have thousands of farmers losing their 
farms because we are reluctant to provide sufficient help in 
their time of need.  Something is seriously wrong when we have 
hospital shortages right across this country because the 
government cut back to balance the budget.  Something is wrong 
when the government continuously brings forth legislation in a 
timely fashion to look after the financial interests of judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  May I ask the hon. 
member whether he will be sharing his time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman:</B>  Madam  Speaker, I am sharing my time 
with my colleague from Surrey Central. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central 
to participate in the second reading debate on Bill C-12, an act 
to amend the Judges Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about the purpose of the bill, which is to 
implement the federal government's response to the 1999 report of 
the Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission regarding 
compensation and benefits for judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill amends the Judges Act to:  increase judicial salaries 
and allowances; modify the current judicial annuities scheme; and 
put into place a separate life insurance plan for federally 
appointed judges. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me speak about the details of the bill.  The government 
accepted the commission's recommendation of a salary increase of 
11.2% for over 1,000 federally appointed judges, retroactive to 
April 1, 2000.  The salary increase will cost Canadian taxpayers 
approximately $19 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The judiciary had initially proposed a salary increase of 26.3%. 
It had maintained that the federal government must compete with 
high paying law firms in order to attract superior candidates to 
the bench.  However, federal representatives told a hearing into 
judges' pay earlier this year that there was no shortage of 
candidates for the bench, with about eight applicants for each 
federal job over the last decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last pay raise for federal judges was in 1998, when they 
received 4.1%.  In 1997 they also received an increase of 4.1%. 
In other words, judges received an 8.2% increase in two years. 
Additionally, judges' salaries are indexed so they receive an 
annual cost of living increase as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 35th parliament, the government introduced two bills 
amending the Judges Act.  In the 36th parliament, one bill was 
introduced.  All of these bills, including Bill C-12, have been 
administrative in nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Or have they been merely administrative in nature?  We do not 
know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians can be assured that the official opposition will 
closely scrutinize Bill C-12.  In particular, we will review the 
provisions of the bill that change the annuities scheme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has made amendments four times to the 
Judges Act.  The big question is why.  We have seen time and time 
again where the government has tailor made legislation to fit 
certain individuals and certain situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will also assure the House and Canadians in general that Bill 
C-12 will not be tailor made to any individual.  That is the job 
of the official opposition:  to hold the government accountable. 
If it were tailor made, it would definitely compromise the 
impartiality of our judiciary, so we will be investigating that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the changes being made to the Judges Act allow a 
judge who is married for the second time to another judge to 
collect, after the death of his or her spouse who also happened 
to be a judge, two survivor benefits upon the death of the 
spouse.  One can only guess why the government is contemplating 
such a rare and highly unlikely situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that the last bill to amend the Judges 
Act, Bill C-37 from the 36th parliament, created the Judicial 
Compensation and Benefits Commission, which provided the federal 
government with yet another opportunity to make patronage 
appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission consists of three members appointed by the 
governor in council.  It should be noted who nominates these 
three individuals.  One is nominated by the judiciary.  One is 
nominated by the Minister of Justice.  The third one, who acts as 
the chair, is nominated by the first two people nominated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The failure of the bill to introduce any changes in the 
appointment process means that important and high paying 
positions in our court system will remain essentially part of the 
patronage system.  The Canadian Alliance would like to see the 
patronage appointment process overhauled to make it more 
transparent and publicly accountable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One option would be to strike a committee that would review and 
interview candidates whose names would be put forward to the 
Prime Minister.  The input of the provinces, which are affected 
directly by decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada, is required 
in these matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern I have with the bill is that the increase in pay 
for federally appointed judges is higher than the federal 
government is prepared to grant to the lower paid civil service 
employees.  Lately it has been the practice of the government to 
grant raises to senior officers in the military, to senior 
bureaucrats and now to judges, while dragging its feet on a 
general salary increase for staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question here is about fairness.  All the hard working 
employees of the public service and the armed forces need raises 
in comparison to the cost of living.  Why is the government only 
focusing on top executives or top officials and not on the other 
employees?  While we do not dispute that salaries for appointed 
judges and others should generally be in line with the private 
sector, it is apparent that the staff on the lower echelons of 
our justice system are being ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we propose is an independent and publicly accountable 
judiciary that would act as a safeguard to protect Canadians from 
the arbitrary power of the state.  However, it must remain the 
responsibility of parliament, not the courts, to debate and 
assess the conflicting objectives inherent in public policy 
development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not address the multitude of concerns that many 
Canadians have with the judicial system, therefore my colleagues 
and I strongly oppose the bill.  We will see what adjustments or 
amendments the government is willing to accept at the committee 
stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we have no position on the exact level of judges' salaries 
and pensions, we generally favour salaries that are comparable to 
those in the private sector.  However, we would like to see an 
overhaul of the process of patronage appointments in the 
judiciary to make it more transparent and publicly accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance declaration of policy, section 69, states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that a non-partisan civil service, an independent 
judiciary and competent leadership of government agencies, boards 
and commissions are vital in a democracy.  We will therefore 
ensure appointments to these positions are made through an open 
and accountable process based on qualification and merit. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public servants should only be given salaries in keeping with 
the average Canadian wage earner.  The government has awarded 
judges and senior bureaucrats with large pay raises and bonuses, 
while frontline police officers and lower level public servants 
receive little or nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that on March 27, 1998, RCMP officers secured 
a pay raise of 2% retroactive to January 1, 1998.  They received 
a second increment of just 1% on April 1, 1998, and an additional 
.75% on October 1, 1998.  RCMP officers have had their wages 
frozen for five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since my time is almost up I have just a few more comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both of the Liberal justice ministers since 1993 have failed to 
introduce a victims bill of rights or to address important issues 
pertaining to drinking and driving or even to pass a new Young 
Offenders Act.  Instead they occupy the justice committee with 
administrative matters at the expense of more important issues. 
For example, the country is experiencing a high degree of backlog 
in the courts and many criminal trials must be put on hold in the 
meantime, yet the government tinkers with salaries of judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I hope the government will entertain amendments 
during the committee hearings.  I regret that the judges 
themselves are somehow caught up in the legislation.  I would 
like to acknowledge that there are judges who are very hard 
working and very much want to contribute to making our judicial 
system fairer and faster and to making Canada a better country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about mismanagement by this weak Liberal 
government.  The unfair treatment handed out by the Liberal 
government to Canadians working or otherwise involved in the 
criminal justice system knows no boundaries.  The inequitable 
treatment of Canadian workers extends all the way to our federal 
court benches.

fairly and today we are debating a bill that does not even treat 
judges fairly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to be able to speak today to Bill C-12.  It 
is discouraging when we see another amendment pertaining to the 
Judges Act.  I have been here since 1993, and I believe it is the 
fourth time the Judges Act has been amended.  It is the fourth 
time I have risen to speak to the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is legislation asking for raises for judges across the 
country, which I believe will amount to $19 million.  I do not 
know the salaries of judges.  I would almost bet that if I were 
in a bank depositing my cheque as a member of parliament and a 
judge was in front of me and we compared cheques, he or she would 
probably make me look like I was on welfare.  I would suspect 
that they get paid very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found it surprising that the judges would ask for a 26% raise 
in pay.  I see that the government accepted a recommendation from 
the commission of 11.2% and that is after already receiving 8.2% 
in the last three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would much rather be rising in the House of Commons to address 
legislation other than the Judges Act.  I would rather debate 
legislation that would have some real teeth in it to deal with 
serious problems such as crime or the need for judges to continue 
working hard.  I know they work hard and I will be as kind as I 
can to judges, although I question their judgment at times.  I am 
sure all of us do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not too many years ago, perhaps three or four, we had a motion 
put forward creating a victims rights bill.  It passed in the 
House of Commons.  The majority supported it from both sides of 
the House.  I cannot say how delighted I would be, after four 
years, if I could stand to speak about legislation that would 
create the victims rights bill that we approved some four years 
ago.  What a pleasure it would be, but no, here I am again rising 
on the fourth occasion because we are making another amendment to 
the Judges Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have difficult problems.  We understand, through the media 
and through other sources, the seriousness of organized crime and 
of a number of other issues.  There is a cry from the public to 
do something with the Young Offenders Act, and yet here I am 
again speaking about judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will this place become a place that really takes its job 
seriously enough to get busy and create the kind of legislation 
that we all agree on?  I can see where it might be difficult when 
there is disagreement, but we agree on victims rights.

that will hopefully provide a lot of safety for individuals.

through with the things that we all agree on?  What is wrong that 
we constantly need amendments to the Judges Act?  Is it because 
these fellows and ladies who make pretty good money are 
underpaid? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was the solicitor general critic during the last session of 
parliament.  I visited many penitentiaries across the country. 
Prison guards had been on a pay freeze for nine years, if not 
longer.  For the last six years, before they finally got a pay 
raise, I raised the issue in the House many times.  However, the 
fact that these lower paid public servants were in a pay freeze 
did not seem to attract any interest from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It had ample opportunity over those years to do something, to 
help those guys who were at the lower end of the stick.  Prison 
guards were fairly equal in salary to the RCMP.  RCMP members 
moved ahead at no great speed, but the salaries of prison guards 
did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people would argue that a policeman's job is more dangerous 
than that of a prison guard.  I would question that.  I believe 
they are both very dangerous jobs.  Most police officers that I 
have talked to have said they would not be a prison guard for all 
the tea in China because of the circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not talk about lower level people who work for the public 
providing the safety we require and whom we need so desperately. 
Negotiations were held and, lo and behold, the RCMP got a 2% 
increase in one year.  It was followed up the next year with 1%. 
Prison guard salaries are at a lower level and now a group of 
people who make a lot more money are asking for 26%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will talk about this issue again for the fourth time.  Maybe 
we ought to take the $19 million that this will cost, put it on 
the table in the middle of the House, and have a serious debate 
on how to spend the money on behalf of those in poverty across 
Canada.  Maybe we should take the $19 million and give it to 
farmers who were denied extra money just the other day.  Maybe 
that money could go toward helping out a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  You voted against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  I beg your pardon.  The hon. member 
says I voted against it.  It was our motion and I voted in favour 
of it.  The Liberals voted against it.  They turned down the 
extra $400 million.  I wanted it to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a miracle how we can come in here and in a flash go 
through committee of the whole and spend $19 billion.  There are 
probably not two people who can tell us where the money is going 
and why.  There was no real debate on that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know there is a chunk of money going here and a chunk going 
there, but we do not know for sure what the chunk will entail. 
There was no debate on it.  It was done in a flash, but we can 
sure debate the Judges Act for the fourth time.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the million and a half children who live in poverty? 
What are we doing about them?  We do not know.  We do not have 
any debates in the House in that regard.  We get lots of claims 
and lots of rhetoric and things of that nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will we start doing things that are of real benefit to the 
country?  If we paid as much attention to the problems with real 
crime as we have to the Judges Act, we probably would have 
accomplished a great deal more.  Instead, we create a commission. 
A commission is patronage at its best, the thing the Liberals 
know best.  They provide patronage for their good old Liberal 
buddies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am getting really sick of this institution constantly dealing 
with these kind of issues and ignoring major problems.  It has 
become totally dysfunctional and it needs to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out for the last time that both the present health 
minister, and I wish him well in his recovery from his operation, 
and the present justice minister failed to accomplish any 
legislation of any real benefit for the difficulties in the 
country involving crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would mention once more the idea of creating a commission. The 
government is good at setting up commissions.  I do not know if 
any member over there could even begin to tell me how many people 
work for the government in some sort of committee, some sort of 
board or some sort of whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many people does the Prime Minister have to appoint each and 
every year to keep these positions filled?  I am surprised he has 
time to be Prime Minister.  I am sure he has to spend a great 
deal of it just appointing people to these plush jobs.  It must 
be nice.  I forgot to mention the Senate.  The Prime Minister 
must take a lot of time to determine who should go in there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was listening to a radio program this morning.  It did a 
takeoff on government called “The monkeys running the zoo”.  I 
thought it was rather hilarious, especially when it was applied 
to the government.  It talked about the Prime Minister being able 
to measure lies, that there are big ones and little ones.  I do 
not know how anybody could do that unless he or she were an 
expert in the field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It related to that issue a lot of times.  It talked about a 
judge making a decision.  I do not blame the judge.  It is 
because of legislation that it happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apparently there were 29 postal workers who were fired from the 
Canada Post for theft.  Under surveillance they were caught 
red-handed stealing cash, cassette tapes and credit cards from 
the mail.  They were convicted.  I understand that this morning 
the court has ordered that the post office rehire these 
individuals.  I am having a real tough time understanding that 
one.  Is that law and order in Canada?  These 29 individuals 
broke the law, were charged, convicted, and fired.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Now their time is up.  Evidently they are on parole, or they got 
parole or whatever.  The union took this situation to a court and 
the judge said they had to hire them back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how many entrepreneurs we have on that side of the 
House, but how would members like to have somebody steal from 
them all the time, have him arrested, convicted and then after he 
was freed have to hire him back?  No wonder they call that show 
the monkey running the zoo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one example of all the things that are going on around 
here which do not make much sense.  We are forever dealing with 
situations where somebody says something they should not have and 
then had to take it back.  As usual, like in the case of the 
member for Waterloo—Wellington, his first step was that he did 
not say it. Then we had to take time the next day because 
somebody woke him up to the fact that he had said it.  Then he 
had to apologize and take it back, and we took time for that.  We 
go through these kinds of monkey running the zoo type of 
episodes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am on duty today so I rushed over because there was an 
important piece of legislation on the table that they wanted me 
to speak to.  Guess what, I got here, picked it up and it was the 
Judges Act; again the Judges Act.  Good grief, folks, I am 
getting tired of talking about the Judges Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When are we going to get serious and talk about what we need to 
do with the young people who are breaking the law; youth and 
crime?  When are we going to start talking seriously about all 
kinds of preventive measures that we need to engage in to keep 
our youth out of trouble?  When are we going to start addressing 
the fact that our aboriginal people are filling our jails at a 
ridiculous proportion to the rest of society? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When are we going to start talking about the mother who has two 
little children who were seriously sexually assaulted by their 
father?  The courts and the judges, because of our legislation, 
ordered this woman to take these two children to visit their 
father in prison, and the children did not want to see him.  The 
mother did not want anything to do with him for what he did to 
their children, yet the courts ordered mom to take these two 
children to the prison because they had to visit their father. 
The courts have upheld our laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members want to amend some kind of a law, think about a law 
that has been created by this government that forces a mother to 
take two little kids to visit their dad who maliciously sexually 
assaulted them.  Think about a law that forces them to sit with 
him and phone him because it is the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see a piece of legislation come out of the 
government of the day.  It is the government.  It knows about 
these situations.  Do members think that we will ever see a piece 
of legislation hit the table that would deal with mom who has to 
take these two little children to visit dad in jail, even though 
he maliciously sexually assaulted them for days and days?   No, 
it will not even be talked about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals will say that the member for Wild Rose is 
fearmongering again or that he is taking the sensationalism into 
this, as if it only happens occasionally.  It is not 
occasionally, it is far too often.  The government says Canadians 
are happy with our system. I guess that is why we have somewhere 
around 10,000 people that hold a membership in some victims 
society.  They are calling for help day in and day out.  We 
cannot deal with all the serious problems out there, but we can 
talk about the Judges Act. 
We can talk about these poor, underpaid individuals who need a 
raise of 26%.  Maybe we should talk about all Canadians and give 
them about a 26% decrease in income tax.  Then we would all get a 
raise.  Would that not be different?

</I></B></P><P align=left>Good grief if we did that, we would not have this revenue coming 
in.  If we did not have this revenue coming in, how could be 
possibly pay our judges another $19 million?  I do not understand 
the government's thinking.  It makes no sense to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course we know from the things in the estimates we approved 
the other night, a matter of $16 billion, $18 billion or whatever 
it was there are going to be lots of committees struck.  There is 
going to be lots of active work going on out there.  I bet the 
government has another committee that is going to work for the 
health department to study us seniors and sexuality again as it 
did before.  It only cost $165,000.  Now that I am nearly 65 
years old, boy, does that make me feel good that our government 
is going to spend tax dollars doing something like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe there is a group of people in Toronto being trained how to 
riot properly in Quebec City when we hold a session there.  Are 
they being trained with tax dollars maybe?  I do not know.  It is 
probably worth talking about.  But let us not talk about that. 
Let us talk about the Judges Act. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I want to bring forward a few issues that were referred 
to earlier today.  The member mentioned equality between 
Correctional Service Canada and RCMP wages.  Certainly 
equalization is very much a part of this great debate.  I believe 
equalization is more than just money.  I think it is equal 
opportunity.  It was raised earlier today that the government has 
a policy that it does not hire people for jobs in Ottawa from 
anywhere else in many cases except from Ontario and Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I referred to one example in question period.  The Public 
Service Commission is advertising for 50 permanent jobs in Ottawa 
which pay up to $81,000 but they are open only to people in 
Ontario and Quebec.  People from the hon. member's riding cannot 
apply.  People from my riding cannot apply even though there are 
50 permanent jobs.  The government could spread these out a bit 
but it is if not doing that.  It wants the total focus to be from 
Ontario and Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member comment on that from an equal opportunity 
point of view and from a national perspective?  These 50 jobs are 
for planners, advisers and policy people.  The government says it 
has 50 job openings and it wants all the people to come from 
Ontario and Quebec.  How does that make the western Canadian 
members feel? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, one thing that has 
been talked about quite a bit lately is western alienation. Is it 
real?  Are there people out there who are so disgusted with the 
government that they are considering alienation?  I hope it is 
not a great number.  Canada is the greatest country and we want 
to hold it together.  It will not stay the greatest country much 
longer if we do not clean up our act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is perfectly right.  If we want to spur on 
western alienation some more, bring out stuff like this member 
mentioned.  Inform all the people in the western provinces that 
we have these jobs but they need not apply if they live west of 
the Ontario border or if they live beyond the Quebec border.  He 
is absolutely right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says that it is so fair.  It is compassionate. It 
is so kind.  It is the party in the middle that has a heart.  It 
is not going to talk about the many people living in poverty and 
the children who are starving. 
It is not going to talk about our reserves where there is a sad 
state of affairs and third world conditions.  It is going to 
create some jobs and make sure that they are for Ontario and 
Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime when the government comes to the House of 
Commons with all these problems, it is not going to worry about 
what the hon. member talked about.  It is going to talk about the 
Judges Act because it is really important. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, my hon. friend from Wild Rose was quite upset and 
quite rightly pointed out the important issues that the Chamber 
should be addressing.  I know he has spent enormous time 
travelling to reserves.  He has reserves in his riding that 
require attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we are talking about judges today, I would like to ask my 
hon. friend, from his experience in visiting the reserves, would 
he not think it more appropriate in the Chamber to address the 
issues that he has seen firsthand?  Perhaps he could tell us as 
well of the judicial systems on the reserves that he thinks 
require reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, most people in the 
House are aware that the United Nations has declared Canada as 
the best country in the world in which to live.  If we really are 
paying attention, it has also factored in the reserves across the 
country and has said we would be 38th. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would encourage all members in the House who have reserves in 
their ridings to make absolutely certain when visiting them to go 
to the grassroots level and see the conditions that some of these 
people are living in.  I want to make it perfectly clear.  Not 
all reserves are that way.  There are some excellent things going 
on in a few, but far too many are living in absolute poverty with 
the most disgusting things we could ever imagine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I saw a sump hole in a basement where they dumped the sewage 
gathered in buckets because they had no sewage system.  Then I 
learned from one family that they had just buried a two and a 
half year old child who had fallen into that ugly sump hole.  The 
children were not allowed down there, but as children will do, 
they found a way to get there.  They had been playing when the 
child fell into the hole and drowned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no running water or electricity.  Stumps were used for 
chairs.  They had skimpy amounts of food.  Yet they were the most 
hospitable people I have ever visited.  I shared with them what 
they offered in their most hospitable way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is that serious.  Should we be spending some time in the 
House of Commons talking about that and how we could quickly 
resolve it so we could be number one in the world, including the 
reserves?  We certainly should be.  Instead what are we talking 
about?  We are talking about the Judges Act. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Fitzpatrick (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I find my hon. colleague's comments very refreshing. 
I know he is very well respected in the community he comes from. 
He was the principal of a high school.  I know how high school 
principals are selected where I come from and where he comes 
from.  People from the community sit on committees.  There is a 
hiring procedure.  We spend a lot of time making sure we get the 
right people as our principals.  They must be leaders in our 
schools and must convey the right kinds of values and beliefs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday we talked about reforming and modernizing our system 
of government.  In my view most of the power cards are held by 
somebody sitting in the front row over there.  Even backbenchers 
do not have any power cards.  When they are told to march, they 
march.  When they are told to stand up they stand up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we really wanted to modernize this institution we could do it 
in one symbolic step.   We could turn over the selection of 
supreme court judges to an all party committee.  We could then 
sit down and review these individuals and pick people who we 
think have high standards of integrity and high levels of 
competency.  As everyone has pointed out, there is no shortage of 
qualified applicants for these jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the way it is now all the power cards are in one 
person's hands and that person makes those decisions behind 
closed doors and without any consultation with any of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to put a question to my colleague from Wild Rose on 
the possibility of having an all party committee look at the 
appointment of judges to our Supreme Court of Canada.  Would he 
be of the view that this committee would be beneficial to this 
institution and change the public's attitude toward the way this 
House operates? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, yes, an all party 
committee is a good idea.  We should spend some time talking 
about how we can form a committee that would select the judges in 
a process that makes sense, instead of patronage.  Let us not 
talk any more about the Judges Act. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise on behalf of my constituents of 
Calgary East to talk to Bill C-12, the Judges Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I share my colleague's view.  This is the second time that I 
have risen in the House to talk about the Judges Act, an act that 
only talks about raising the salaries and benefits of judges.  We 
have heard over a period of time, both in Alberta and here, that 
independent commissions have been set up.  We have also heard the 
judges say that they need more compensation so they can be 
independent and not fall under pressure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  So do we. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  I disagree with the hon. Liberal 
member when he says “so do we”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the judges have used the reasoning that they will be 
subject to undue influence if they do not receive higher 
compensation.  That was the reasoning for the 23%.  In both 
cases, as the holders of the public purse, the government of 
Alberta and the Government of Canada at one time had tremendous 
difficulty agreeing to that level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this bill states is that one segment of our society feels 
that judges need to elevated to a level where there is no undue 
influence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe almost all judges, especially the ones I know and have 
met, are people of high calibre and have high moral values, and 
people look to them to make fair judgments.  However, when they 
say that their compensation should be at such a level that they 
will not be under undue influence, I think that is a 
contradiction.   We put them there because of their high values. 
I hope we never have a situation in this country where a judge 
falls under undue influence just because there was no 
compensation.  The compensation seems to be fairly adequate here. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1635"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance agrees that the compensation should be in line with 
the private sector.  Even judges should get fair compensation, 
and nobody is saying they should not, but it should be done by an 
independent body, and this is not by an independent body. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That raises questions in the minds of Canadians.  They look to 
the judges for respect, but when those kinds of arguments come 
forward, there is a slight loss of respect.  Canadians are the 
ones who will end up in the courts to hear judgments.  This issue 
is not the general trend in the economy nor is it the general 
trend in the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This raises the other questions of what is happening and what we 
should be debating here.  Having said that, I think there are 
more important issues that need to be debated in the House than 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a town hall meeting about a month ago in my riding.  Close 
to 40 grandparents came to the town hall meeting to discuss an 
issue that was hurting them the most, the issue of grandparents' 
rights.  As our society has moved forward, and tugs and pulls 
take place, marriages break down.  At the end of the day, who 
pays?  It is the grandparents who pay.  They need attention.  We 
need to address those kinds of issues, not this issue of judges' 
salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For over six and a half years the government could not produce a 
Young Offenders Act.  It keeps going on and on despite the hue 
and cry from the public.  Every member over here has put forward 
petitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  I am sure all hon. 
members would like to hear what the hon. member for Calgary East 
has to say, and, if not, there are other options available to 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am sure the people in 
the gallery, who have taken the time to come here, and those who 
are listening, would like to hear what I have to say.  If those 
members on that side of the House do not want to listen, they are 
welcome to go out and do something productive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Backbenchers and serious members of parliament are here to 
discuss issues that are important, issues that our constituents 
want to discuss.  If all hon. members had town hall meetings they 
would find out what the people want, what is important to them 
and what issues they want brought before the House of Commons. We 
were elected to do that, not to heckle and create all this 
nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk for a second about the Young Offenders Act which has 
again not been brought into the House of Commons.  It has been 
discussed and discussed, petition after petition has been 
presented to the House and Canadians have been talking about it, 
but the government has not brought it in because it has not had 
the courage to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  Yesterday we had a debate in this place about the 
modernization of parliament.  Members throughout the House 
commented and concurred that relevance was an important principle 
for the House to follow if we were to be efficient.  With all due 
respect, the member is not addressing the provisions of the bill, 
but rather talking about why we should be doing other things 
other than the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  The hon. member 
raised a point of debate, I believe.  I think that in most 
debates in the House the Chair has always shown a lot of 
latitude.  We will now continue with debate from the member for 
Calgary East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Madam Speaker, I think that was just a 
ploy so that I could lose a couple of minutes.  I hope you will 
allow me to add the couple of minutes that were wasted so I can 
tell the member that we are discussing serious issues in this 
place which are absolutely relevant to what we are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are saying is that we need to discuss important issues. 
Yes, yesterday's debate was an attempt to bring forward important 
issues because, under this government, important issues seem to 
have gone out of the window.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not listen to members in committee.  This 
bill does not even deal with the issue of bringing judges before 
a committee.  It is all patronage and it starts from the PMO's 
office, which appoints the judges, the senators, the heads of 
corporations and many board members.  This then creates a 
concentration of power in one place.  We just have to look at the 
situation this afternoon in the House of Commons with respect to 
the Prime Minister's role in the golf club.  This concentration 
of power can give rise to abuse of power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk for a moment on another subject.  My name 
was selected to present a private member's bill that would 
address a very important issue that the government has totally 
neglected.  It is the issue of break and enter or home invasion, 
a crime that has been rising across the country, according to 
statistics, and a violation of personal privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If anyone wants to know what is happening with break and enter 
offenders, they need only ask any law enforcement officer or look 
at the records.  Repeat break and enter offenders are receiving 
conditional or suspended sentences, which creates a cycle of 
break and enter offences.  Why?  The simple reason is that they 
know that if they are caught they will be brought up in front of 
a court and will probably be on the streets within three weeks to 
a month committing the same crime.  Those who do not believe that 
should ask any law enforcement officer in their ridings.  I 
request that all 301 members of parliament here talk to their law 
enforcement officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Police Association and the Calgary Police 
Association have endorsed my private member's bill which calls 
for a minimum sentence of two years for repeat break and enter 
offenders.  The idea is to take these people off the street and 
put them into a system where they can be rehabilitated.  With my 
break and enter bill, we would be looking at assisting people 
and, at the same time, removing these habitual offenders off the 
streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does anyone know what the current sentence is for break and 
enter?  It is life imprisonment.  However, we can forget about a 
life sentence because that is too far out.  Most of these 
offenders get off with suspended or light sentences.  That is the 
reason for the rise in crime.  It also raises the concern that 
there will be more violence. 
It leads to home invasions, which have the potential of getting 
violent.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to address this issue.  We cannot brush it under the 
carpet.  We cannot say that our current legislation is going to 
meet this rising threat.  I do not see the government addressing 
this issue in any way; hence, I brought in my private member's 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One issue that comes out of this bill is the appointment of 
judges, which I alluded to when I was making my remarks.  I have 
mentioned the concentration of powers in the Prime Minister's 
Office.  One of my colleagues asked this question as well.  There 
is a need for serious consideration in regard to the appointment 
of judges.  The question is whether the appointment of judges 
should be under one individual's hand, as it is now, or whether 
it should be under a committee, a committee made up of members of 
parliament.  We can discuss the issues.  We can discuss who can 
be on the committee.  We can discuss who can look at the judges 
who are appointed and make recommendations for appointments and 
so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings transparency to the judiciary system and leads to 
more respect for the judiciary.  It is extremely important that 
we have an independent judiciary system.  There is no question 
about it.  We have seen what happens around the world to the 
populaces of countries where independent judiciary systems do not 
exist.  The populace pays the ultimate price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one will ever argue in a democracy that we need separation of 
powers between the legislation and the independence of the 
judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where the problem arises is with the appointment of judges being 
done by the PMO, by one individual.  What is so difficult about 
moving this to a committee to make it more transparent?  I am 
sure the judges who are on the benches today would probably all 
be appointed again.  That is fine.  That is not the issue I am 
talking about.  I am not talking about the competency of judges. 
I am talking about a process that should bring transparency.  Why 
can we not have that?  I fail to understand why we do not address 
that issue.  We can.  Maybe we should.  Hopefully it will be on 
the agenda.  This is a bill about judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a need for change in parliament.  There is a need for 
us to address this and to talk about our constituents.  It is 
true.  Yesterday we had a debate on these issues.  It is true 
that a lot of points came out, but are we going anywhere?  The 
answer is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech talked about electronic voting.  Great. 
Electronic voting is the great reform that will take place in 
this parliament.  Give me a break.  Is electronic voting why we 
come here?  No.  We come here to debate and to stand on votes so 
that our constituents can see what we are doing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have read reports saying that the government is backtracking 
on electronic voting now, after the hue and cry.  I had the 
pleasure of meeting members of the German parliament who were 
visiting us and I asked them a question.  As we all know, with 
the unification of Germany a new parliament has been built in 
Berlin.  I asked the visitors for their views on electronic 
voting.  They said no way to electronic voting.  The committee 
that they set up to look at it has totally disregarded it.  I 
asked them why.  They said they want their ministers, the people 
who are in power, not to get it into their heads that they are 
above ordinary citizens.  They said their ministers are part and 
parcel of the process and they want to see them stand up with 
them in their parliament.  They felt that with electronic voting 
they would have less access to those in power.  I thought about 
it and I agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course a lot of my colleagues from the other side are now 
joining in the debate and are opposing the electronic voting 
notion.  My friend on the other side is part of this thing and I 
am sure will join in the debate when he gets time to address this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the relevance of what I am talking about?  It is 
accountability.  We are asking for transparency and 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is an opportunity under Bill C-12 which could have 
addressed transparency and accountability of judges.  However, I 
have been in committees and I have heard time after time from 
that side, from parliamentary secretaries and ministers, a 
reluctance to change.  They have a total reluctance to change the 
system, to better it.  We have all heard that change is for the 
better.  We are now in the 21st century, yet this system is what 
was here 30 or 35 years ago.  It is the same system with the same 
rules.  There has been no change.  Can we not move forward?  Can 
we not learn? Can we not build on what we have learned? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is this reluctance.  Time after time, in the 
committees and everywhere, I have heard from that side that this 
is the way the system is and it is fine.  Yet there are people 
asking questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This afternoon my colleague from the Conservative Party brought 
up a fantastic example of what is wrong with the system.  It was 
a fantastic example of a job posting under the federal 
government, from someone supposedly representing Canada and the 
unity of Canada, the residence of the Governor General.  At this 
point I must say that I have the highest respect for the Governor 
General and the comments I will make have absolutely nothing to 
do with Her Excellency, whom I hold in very high esteem.  I am 
just talking about the process of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the Government of Canada advertising a job situation 
that is applicable only to a few Canadians.  It bars everyone 
else.  If that is not discrimination, what is?  Why are we paying 
with the tax dollars of all Canadians for a job that is 
restricted for certain Canadians?  If people inside this region 
want to apply and it is convenient for them, so be it.  The job 
should be open to anyone.  However, How can a job with a salary 
paid by taxpayer dollars be restricted to only certain Canadians? 
It boggles my mind.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in the 21st century.  These are the issues that we need 
to debate and to talk about.  This imbalance that keeps taking 
place eventually may become—and I hope never—the threat to our 
unity.  We are all working hard to maintain our nation.  As we 
all know, when we travel abroad we are all proud of the maple 
leaf.  We are proud of what we have achieved and of what other 
people have achieved, including the immigrants who have come into 
the country, those who were born here and the first nations.  We 
are proud of everything that has been built here, but there also 
comes a time to build better, and if we have seen errors, we 
should learn from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All I get from the other side is a total reluctance to change 
the procedure or change anything, even if it is glaringly in 
front of our eyes that it is wrong.  That advertisement I 
mentioned was in front of everybody's eyes and was glaringly 
wrong, but who has the guts to stand up and admit it is wrong? 
The minister of the treasury today could not admit it was wrong 
or that she would look at it.  She threw the blame on some other 
government out there in question period, but at no time did she 
say that she was going to address the issue, that here is a 
glaring example of what is wrong.  When are we going to learn? 
When are we going to say that we need change?  When can we adapt? 
When can we heal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps these members sitting over there can start pondering it 
and talking about it.  If the people over there do not listen, 
members can stand up in the House of Commons and talk about it. 
They can talk about what their constituents are saying and 
represent them properly.  It is not only east or west in here.  I 
do not represent only the west.  I am here as a Canadian standing 
in the Canadian House of Commons.  I am standing here as a 
Canadian.  Issues of Canadians are being discussed here which are 
applicable to all Canadians across the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we see something like that, it makes us angry.  When we see 
the government refusing to address the issues, then we are not 
proud.  How is it possible that the ruling party, supposedly 
considered one of the most successful ruling parties of our time, 
as its members say themselves, had to set up a task force and 
send it to that region of the country to see what is wrong? There 
was a government that did not even know why people in one half of 
the country were upset.  Why?  Because that region has a smaller 
population, that is why.  Those government members are supposed 
to represent Canada and the government sets up a task force and 
sends it out there to figure out what is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something amiss.  Those individuals are supposed to be 
in government.  Do we know why there is this problem?  Because it 
is the reluctance to change the system that has been entrenched 
instead of the demand for change.  The government members are 
reluctant to change, so they cannot pick up on the currents 
taking place in the other regions of the country.  They cannot. 
Their ears are closed because the system allows their ears to be 
closed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They sent that committee out there, and lo and behold, it was a 
joke.  Even the members of the committee were not from that part 
of the region.  I do not know what happened.  What happened to 
the committee's report?  I do not have a clue as to what happened 
to that committee.  They are still talking about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course our nation has its great potential, but its great 
challenges is regionalism.  There are challenges and regional 
challenges and aspirations and regional aspirations.  That does 
not mean that we can stand in the way here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, when I am talking about the Judges Act, I am 
talking about transparency and I am talking about accountability.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the member seemed to be at one point in 
his dissertation struggling with the subject matter.  I thought 
for a moment that I should rise and suggest that he share his 
time with a Liberal.  I would have been happy to have a speech of 
my own on this subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the House and the member will indulge me, I would not mind a 
somewhat extensive comment to the speech he just gave and a 
comment that I hope he will answer.  I have the bill before me 
and it is all about numbers.  It is about remuneration.  Page 
after page we see the bill describe how much judges should be 
paid and all that kind of thing.  It looks very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the member opposite that we are missing an opportunity 
in the legislation because there is an opportunity to do 
something in the bill, not only for judges, but for people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had occasion to be in Alberta a month and a half ago trying to 
get a line on the case that is before the Alberta courts 
involving Mr. Stephen Harper and the crown.  It deals with a 
charter challenge of the Canada Elections Act pertaining to 
certain aspects of third party advertising that is in the current 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was amazed to discover that I could not get court transcripts. 
What has happened in Alberta and many other jurisdictions is that 
the courts and the government have farmed out the taking of trial 
transcripts to private firms that record the actual verbatim 
testimony.   A citizen, or even somebody who is a defendant at 
the trial, has to then purchase page by page the transcripts 
which can run into many thousands of pages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What that does is make it impossible for the ordinary citizen, 
much less the person who is the defendant in the case, to have 
access to the deliberations of that particular court.  This 
becomes very important when it is a charter challenge because 
something like that is of interest and of importance to every 
Canadian.  Not only do we have to purchase it, but we cannot get 
it through the normal means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have thought, and I would like the member to comment on 
this, that we in the House should be very concerned about the 
lack of transparency and the lack of opportunity of ordinary 
Canadians to know what is going on in the courts, issues that 
concern charter challenges, or any other case before the courts 
that has a wide public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have thought that it would have been incumbent upon 
governments and indeed incumbent upon the courts to not only make 
the transcripts publicly available for free but to put them on 
the Internet, so Canadians can follow these very important 
deliberations.  What I found out was that I could not gain access 
to the transcripts without paying for them page by page. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am probably a little bit more affluent than the average 
Canadian, at $1,000 a shot, it was not something I was prepared 
to do.  I point out that this is not even an expense that is 
covered by the House.  If I want to see the transcripts, it would 
appear that I would have to pay for them out of my own pocket. 
This is a situation that I do not believe is good for the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cited a case in Alberta but I believe it is the same situation 
in Ontario and other jurisdictions.  I suggest to the member 
opposite that if we really want to do something that is important 
for the public, we should be pressuring the government to add an 
amendment to the bill, phrase it so that it would require courts 
to take transcripts of the testimony and make the transcripts 
available to the public, not only for free, but also available on 
the Internet, so that all Canadians can be engaged in the kind of 
important debates that occur in the courts when someone like Mr. 
Stephen Harper decides to challenge the crown on something like 
the Canada Elections Act and makes it a charter challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something that every Canadian should be engaged in and 
be able to follow.  The only answer to that is to make all court 
transcripts available to the public for free.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Madam Speaker, in my speech I asked 
members to talk about what their constituents want.  I am happy 
someone took the bait. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of the member's experience in Alberta, one can 
relate to the fact that it was a provincial code and therefore 
the requirement of the province, and we are federal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not speak to that issue but I will speak to the very 
important issue the member raised about transparency and 
accountability.  The whole point of my speech was accountability 
and transparency in the bill in reference to our federal 
jurisdiction, which is judges and the appointment of judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question that he asked was about transcripts being made 
available for free.  That is an issue that should be visited.  I 
agree with him that transparency is very important.  In our code 
system transparency is something that will bring confidence. That 
is what we need to retain in our court system.  That is something 
that needs to be discussed, and I am glad the member raised the 
point. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Kevin Sorenson (Crowfoot, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, we have seen other judges acts over the last four years 
since 1998.  In 1996 we saw a Judges Act, the name or number of 
which I am not familiar with right now, but there have been four 
such bills.  As we go through the bill, it is all about 
compensation. There are probably 10 or 15 pages on annuity 
scheduling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill gives judges close to a 12% raise.  In 1998 they had an 
8.3% raise.  The salaries of judges are indexed yearly.  Could 
the member enlighten us a little more on remuneration?  When we 
look at different sectors of criminal justice we see that in 1998 
and prior the Royal Canadian Mounted Police had its wages frozen 
for five years.  For five years the police forces had their wages 
frozen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then in March 1998 they were awarded a 3% increase, retroactive 
to January 1.  In April they received another 1% and later on in 
October, three-quarters of 1%.  Over the past six, seven and 
eight years, our police forces have seen marginal salary 
increases of up to 4% or 5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we seeing a higher level of concern or importance respecting 
the remuneration of higher levels of the public service?  We have 
seen close to a 26% increase over the last few years when we 
factor in the indexing.  I wonder if it is a higher level than 
other public sector employees are receiving.  Why is it that the 
government seems to be paying such close attention to high level 
public servants when frontline police forces are seeing such 
nominal pay increases?  Could the member enlighten us on that a 
little? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Madam Speaker, what the member is 
saying is that the general public pay raises are correspondingly 
much less than those of privileged positions in society.  Lawyers 
and judges have access to people in power.  Therefore they can 
articulate the need for higher wages for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I stated, they are saying that higher wages are needed so 
that they are not under undue pressure.  One could have used the 
same argument for the police, the ones upholding the law. They 
should be getting higher salaries so that they are not under 
pressure as well.  That also applies to prison guards and others. 
The argument could be applied to ordinary Canadians working on 
the frontlines. 
I agree with my colleagues.  That is why we are debating these 
issues and that is why the Alliance and many of us are raising 
them. We are not judge bashing, let me be very clear about that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-12.  It is a 
bill that is somewhat technical in nature having to do with 
compensation for judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of my colleagues have explained the remuneration part of 
the bill in terms of the issues we have with the bill.  I will 
focus a bit on one part of that and then I will talk a bit about 
judicial activism.  I will make reference to a creation of the 
bill, having to do with the ability of the government to appoint 
individuals, thereby having another outlet for some possible 
patronage jobs being created.  I will also talk about some local 
issues happening in Dewdney—Alouette. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill deals with about 1,000 individuals, those who are 
federally appointed judges.  As my colleagues from the Alliance 
have pointed out, there have been several increases over the last 
number of years for individuals serving in this important 
position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time there have not been the same kinds of 
significant increases for those law enforcement agents and guards 
in our prison system that are on the frontlines providing good 
service, protection and security for our citizens.  My colleague 
from Wild Rose touched on this issue and my colleague from 
Crowfoot just asked a very good question about it.  It is 
something that needs to be raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We realize that the government does not have an endless supply 
of dollars.  It is actually taxpayer dollars held in trust by the 
government.  The government is called upon to use those hard 
earned tax dollars in a wise way.  We have pointed out over the 
last number of months and years in this place some areas where 
the government could do better in managing taxpayer dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have explored lots of opportunities for the government to 
look at its expenditures to see where it could save some dollars 
in wasteful spending, such as the areas having to do with the now 
infamous billion dollar boondoggle.  We have not heard that word 
for a while, so I thought I would throw it in.  There is also the 
file on Shawinigan, Shawinigate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have explored those areas and approximately $13 billion is 
allocated from the government to grants and contributions across 
government departments.  We have become very aware, because of 
what happened in human resources development, of how the money is 
allocated. Some work needs to be done in all government 
departments in terms of how they are using their resources and 
their dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If what is happening in the area of human resources is 
indicative of how the government is managing the hard earned tax 
dollars of our citizens in all departments, there is cause for 
concern.  There is a possible pool of taxpayer dollars held in 
trust by the government that could be used for law enforcement, 
providing the resources the RCMP needs to do the job of fighting 
organized crime on the frontlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Police officers from across the country came to speak to us this 
week.  Officers who have been working on the frontlines in our 
communities told us what has been happening and how they feel 
limited in what they can do because of their lack of resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incumbent upon us to provide law enforcement officers with 
the proper compensation and the proper resources to be able to do 
their job properly.  As has been raised by other colleagues as 
well, we know that those individuals the government and the 
police forces are fighting have an unlimited pool of capital.

However there needs to be a higher degree of accountability and 
scrutiny of individuals appointed to important positions by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A former colleague in this place, Lou Sekora, the former member 
for Coquitlam, was recently appointed by the government.  He was 
given a patronage position as a citizenship judge.  It was a bit 
alarming because in the history of his dealings in the House, he 
often acted in a very partisan manner and resorted to name 
calling in regard to racial comments, comments which were 
recorded in <I>Hansard</I>.  He even made such comments in his own 
community after he was defeated in the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite that, he was appointed a citizenship judge.  It does not 
make sense that he was chosen for that job based on his prior 
experiences, performance or public record of having said things 
that were in many ways inflammatory to the issue of new citizens 
and immigrants.  That is an example of an appointment that needed 
more scrutiny and that the government was remiss in making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many other positions could have been chosen.  The government 
showed a lack of sensitivity in putting that individual in that 
position.  The opportunity to scrutinize such appointments is 
provided for in this part of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had debates in the House in the last couple days about 
related issues having to do with the minister for 
multiculturalism and her circumstance.  I will not go into detail 
on that.  It is on the record and it is circulating out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is a lack of sensitivity on important issues like 
this, we must look at the actions and deeds rather than just the 
words of individuals.  That is a cause of concern for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are attempting to work together with members of parliament 
from all parties to build alliances and common ground on all 
kinds of issues.  A committee has just been struck on 
parliamentary reform.  That was an idea brought forward by the 
government House leader and other members of parliament, and I 
think it was a good one.  It is time for some changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Signalling an intention to work well with each other is a good 
thing.  The government can demonstrate that intention through its 
actions.  In the case of the minister for multiculturalism, the 
government could show its good will by taking action regarding 
the minister for what transpired in the last couple of days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will move now to the whole notion of judicial activism and how 
it has evolved in the last several years through the way the 
government has handled particular issues.  There are many 
sensitive issues in the public domain, ones the government might 
hesitate in approaching when they bring forward legislation.

well aware that the Alliance brought forward a motion and that 
about 63 government members wrote a letter to the Prime Minister 
asking him to use the notwithstanding clause.  When that vote 
happened they did not support it.

a window of 18 months where the government had an opportunity to

so.  It sent a message to—

order.  I would again raise with the Chair the issue of relevance 
in this place to ensure that members restrict their comments to 
the bill before the House.  This is not a matter of debate but 
rather of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  The hon. member has 
raised this point of order before.  I did state very clearly that 
there is a lot of latitude given by the Chair in terms of the 
content of speeches.  Obviously hon. members must respect the 
debate before the House.  It is Bill C-12 we are discussing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Madam Speaker, I did outline in my 
opening that I wanted to talk about the issue.  Obviously it is 
related to the bill before us.  I talked about the part of the 
bill having to do with the Judicial Compensation and Benefits 
Commission that allows the government the opportunity to provide 
patronage appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked briefly about judicial activism.  I will wrap up my 
comments on that part of my speech in relation to judges and the 
justice system.  When the bill goes forward it will go to the 
justice committee where it will take up a fair bit of time.   We 
must question what other issues might be brought forward by the 
government in relation to justice issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about a few issues that affect communities in my 
riding.  Mike Potter, head of the chamber of commerce in Maple 
Ridge and Pitt Meadows, is bringing forth some proactive 
solutions to combating crime, particularly among businesses in 
the community that have been hit hard.  That is a noble cause. He 
is working hard with Helen Secco, also of the chamber of 
commerce, to develop a strategy in which the community can come 
together to stop crime from happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Vandalism is causing a great deal of harm to local businesses in 
Pitt Meadows and Maple Ridge, and that is of great concern to 
business owners who are the backbone of the local economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of their initiatives are to be applauded.  They recently 
had a forum in Maple Ridge regarding the issue.  Those kinds of 
crimes are on the increase, which is unfortunate.  That is why 
the community is looking for proactive solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a crime prevention priority session coming up in 
Mission.  People in that community are getting together to try to 
find a way to solve issues of crime in the community.  That also 
is to be applauded.  Those citizens are coming forward to work 
together to address important issues of safety in their 
community.  That is a good thing and it should be applauded.

detail the compensation of judges.  I started my speech on that 
topic.  As my colleagues noted, we have concerns that the 
government is not putting the same priority forward with 
individuals of our front line law enforcement communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now conclude.  I know the government House leader is 
hanging on my every word as time draws short in the day.  This 
is, of course, an important issue.  I will conclude by focusing 
on the people of Dewdney—Alouette because they are, of course, 
the people who sent me here.  I applaud their proactive efforts 
to provide safety in their community.  I will wrap up my comments 
by wishing them well in all their endeavours and saying that I

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I raised this on questions and comments 
a little earlier, and I wish to put on the record that the cost 
of the transcripts that I was referring to from the Alberta court 
was $2.20 a page.  I was unable to get these transcripts.  I was 
unable to get them except by either paying the $2.20 a page or, 
in my case, I was lucky enough that I could go across the road 
and look at the transcripts in the Department of Justice.  The 
Department of Justice could not release the transcripts because, 
as they were prepared by a private firm, the private firm was 
entitled to, by copyright according to the Department of Justice, 
to require that the transcripts could not be released. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were in six boxes of thousands of pages apiece, and 
binders.  The point I wish to make, regardless that this debate 
has to go on a little longer than perhaps intended, is that no 
one in the general public would be able to afford to see those 
transcripts.  I was able to see the transcripts solely because I 
happen to live here in Ottawa, I happen to be a member of 
parliament and I was able to access them because the Department 
of Justice was the defendant in this particular case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a trial involving a charter issue which is of concern to 
every Canadian.  In order for an ordinary Canadian to access 
those transcripts, that ordinary Canadian would probably have had 
to pay something like $6,000 or $8,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the members opposite are laughing at that.  They are so, 
so concerned about judiciary remuneration that they do not pay 
attention to the fact that ordinary Canadians cannot access the 
debates that are leading ultimately to the very judicial activism 
that they complain about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to actually prolong the debate with a speech of my 
own, although I would be delighted to under normal circumstances. 
I would suggest to you, Madam Speaker, that in fact the thing 
that we should be really concerned about is not only making these 
transcripts available that are so important in criminal cases, as well as 
in civil cases and even in human rights tribunals, we still have 
to pay for the transcripts because private firms prepare them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would only say this. I hope that the members opposite 
would consider this as a very important issue that is just as 
important as the remuneration of judges, the public access to 
court transcripts, and put it indeed on the Internet just as our 
<I>Debates</I> are put on the Internet.  I am sure the members 
opposite would agree that this would be a very fine thing to 
recommend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Madam Speaker, I heard the question 
earlier that the hon. member had asked. 
He knows that it is a provincial matter.  I have individuals 
coming into my constituency office asking me the exact same 
questions.  This brings to mind the same dilemma members of 
parliament are faced with in terms of getting information from 
the government.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should bring 
in legislation defining a “human being” as a human fetus or 
embryo from the moment of conception, whether in the womb of the 
mother or not and whether conceived naturally or otherwise, and 
making any and all consequential amendments required. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, this is the most important issue facing 
Canada today.  In fact, this issue is more important than 
anything that has been debated in the House since May 1991.  Let 
me explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May of 1991 was when Bill C-43, an act respecting abortions, was 
debated in parliament.  That was the last time there was any 
serious debate about the rights of the unborn in the House.  That 
is a disgrace.  For 10 years now successive governments have 
buried their heads in the sand on this life and death issue.  I 
will correct myself.  It is not a life and death issue, it is 
only a death issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1988 and 1998, 1,021,965 unborn babies died because the 
government did not have the courage to deal with the issue.  Now 
is that time.  Those one million unborn do not think this is the 
best country in the world to live.  They never had a chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-43 was actually passed by the House of Commons but was 
defeated in the Senate by a single vote.  One vote was a death 
sentence to how many babies?  After one million have died is the 
senator who defeated the bill proud?  After one million babies 
have been killed is the government proud of how effectively it 
killed the debate of this issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unwillingness of the government to even debate the issue, to 
even study the issue, to even ask Canadians what they think about 
the issue is criminal negligence if, in fact as I contend, these 
one million unborn were human beings.  Does the government really 
think it can ignore the fact that 100,000 babies are being killed 
every year?  Does it actually think there are no consequences for 
its actions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into my main remarks, I want to tell the House 
about a response I got to one of my access to information 
requests.  I asked Health Canada for the documents, reports and 
correspondence in the department that provided evidence that 
abortions are medically necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 8 Health Canada responded by saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret to inform you that after a thorough search of all likely 
record holdings, departmental officials have confirmed that they 
have no records relevant to your request. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is amazing. 
More than 100,000 unborn babies lose their right to live every 
year and the Department of Health does not have one document that 
says abortions are even medically necessary.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they are not medically necessary, why are we doing them?  Why 
are taxpayers paying for them?  Why is this happening? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is the way we define a human being in Canadian law. 
Our legal definition of a human being is wrong and needs to be 
amended.  This is the sole purpose of my motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently a human being is defined in section 223(1) of the 
Criminal Code of Canada as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A child becomes a human being within the meaning of this Act when 
it has completely proceeded, in a living state, from the body of 
its mother, whether or not 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) it has breathed, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) it has independent circulation, or 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) the navel string is severed. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 228 which I put foward today states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should bring 
in legislation defining a “human being” as a human fetus or 
embryo from the moment of conception, whether in the womb of the 
mother or not and whether conceived naturally or otherwise, and 
making any and all consequential amendments required. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which 
Canada signed, states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the child, by reason of his physical and mental immaturity, 
needs special safeguards and care, including appropriate legal 
protection, before as well as after birth. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canadian law there simply is no protection for a child before 
birth.  The Government of Canada cannot discharge its legal 
obligations under this international agreement, an agreement the 
federal government and 10 provinces have ratified, unless and 
until it changes the definition of a human being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to 1969, all abortions were illegal.  From 1969 to 1988, 
Canada had a law in our criminal code that provided for an 
abortion only when a therapeutic abortion committee of three 
doctors agreed that the continuation of a pregnancy would cause 
harm to the life or health of the mother.  The word health was 
not defined or limited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1988 the supreme court struck down the 1969 abortion law as 
unconstitutional.  The supreme court ruling, commonly referred to 
as the Morgentaler decision, provided constitutional parameters 
for a new abortion law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on the instructions from the supreme court justices, in 
1990 the government of the day introduced, debated and passed 
Bill C-43 in the House of Commons.  As I mentioned, Bill C-43 was 
defeated by one vote in the Senate.  Since that time the 
government has not restricted abortions in any way and the unborn 
have been without any rights.  Since then more than one million 
babies have been aborted while politicians were hoping the issue 
would just go away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1988 the supreme court said that this is an issue best left 
to parliament.  I say it is time for parliament to assume its 
responsibility.  Many key moral and legal issues such as 
reproductive technologies, rights of the unborn and a mother's 
duty of care for her unborn, all hinge on when the law says a 
child becomes a human being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's definition is unacceptable in my mind.  It is debatable 
in the minds of most people.  It is time the debate began.  How 
we define a human being is the place to begin this entire debate. 
That is why I have introduced this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since introducing the motion, I have been asked some important 
questions like why I am trying to ban abortions.  While that 
would be my personal preference, my motion would only ban 
abortions if the legislation I am asking the government to draft 
bans them.  The more likely consequence of my motion would be 
that parliament would determine at what point during a pregnancy 
an unborn human being has rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also been asked why I am bringing in this motion. Because 
the current definition of a human being in the criminal code is 
scientifically incorrect.  A baby has to emerge completely from 
the birth canal before it becomes a human being.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious to everyone that a baby is a human being before it 
is born.  It is a proven law of science that like things beget 
like things.  Dogs have dogs, cats have cats and people produce 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also been asked about a woman's right to her own body and 
if my motion is passed whose rights would come first, the child's 
or the woman's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree that everyone has a right to their own body, until it 
interferes with the rights of someone else's own body.  The 
problem is that under the Canadian law, the human being growing 
inside the woman has no rights until he or she has fully emerged 
from the birth canal.  I maintain that at some point during the 
pregnancy the unborn baby's rights are equal to the woman's 
rights.  Even the United Nations agrees that every unborn child 
has rights.  These rights need the protection of the Government 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My motion would start a debate in parliament, and in the public, 
to determine at what point during the pregnancy does the 
helpless, unborn child deserve protection under Canadian law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A month ago I had the pleasure to meet and listen to Scott 
Klusendorf.  Scott is a director of bio-ethics for Stand to 
Reason from San Pedro, California.  I was impressed by the 
simplicity of his approach and his direct hard hitting message. 
I appreciated his taking the time to meet with the pro-life 
caucus and with our staff.  I thank him for the printed materials 
he shared with us, some of which I have used in preparing for 
this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question we must answer is “Can we kill the unborn?”  The 
answer is “Yes, we can kill the unborn if it is not a human 
being”.  How many have watched a video of what actually happens 
to a baby during an abortion?  After watching any video that 
depicts the truth, no one can doubt what is being killed is a 
human being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When MPs opposite support abortion, they are going against what 
Canadians would think Liberals normally stand for.  Liberals 
normally pride themselves as defenders of the weakest members of 
society.  Who could be weaker and more defenceless than an unborn 
baby? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals normally pride themselves in not discriminating against 
anyone, and I use small <I>l</I> there, but every year they are 
discriminating against more than 100,000 unborn babies and 
defending every adult mother's right to kill the baby in her 
womb, for any reason or for no reason, up to the very moment the 
baby fully emerges from the birth canal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election, the Liberals attacked pro-life policies and 
any politician who holds these views.  However, who should really 
be attacked?   The Liberals because they approve of killing more 
than 100,000 unborn babies or me because I want to save the lives 
of many of these poor, defenceless, unborn babies as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is so wrong with trying to save as many little unborn 
babies as we can?  What is so wrong with trying to get a real 
debate in the House about saving these babies' lives?  What are 
we so afraid of?  What is the government afraid of? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not the scary ones.  We are the ones who think the unborn 
have some rights.  The government thinks the unborn has no 
rights.  We are the ones who want to save these babies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we have a law that allows the killing of a little unborn 
baby, even when they are eight or nine weeks old?  It is like 
unborn babies are not people.  From conception to birth, the 
unborn are not technically people so it is okay to murder them. 
However, the moment they emerge from the birth canal, it is a 
crime to murder them.  Where is the sense in that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Remember when the law did not consider slaves to be people? 
They were property.  Their cries were heard.  Liberals agreed 
this was wrong and the law was changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Remember when the law did not consider women to be persons and 
denied them the vote?  Their cries were heard.  Liberals agreed 
this was wrong and the law was changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Remember when aboriginal people and Chinese immigrants were not 
considered people?  Their cries were heard.  Liberals agreed this 
was wrong and the law was changed.

is time someone heard their cries.  Their cry is not a silent 
cry.  It is a silent scream.  It is time the law was changed.  It 
will take a lot more than one hour of parliament to provide some 
small measure of justice in the defence of the rights of the 
unborn.  In a moment I will be asking for consent to go beyond 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Abortion has been defined as the strong and independent 
exploiting the weak and defenceless.  Here we stand, the strong 
and the independent.  We are the only hope for the weak and the 
defenceless in Canadian society.  There is no one weaker and no 
one more defenceless than an unborn baby.  Anti-life activists 
challenge us by asking why we are forcing our morality on them. 
I say to them that their morality is being forced on me. 
When I cannot stand up for what I believe, is that right? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anti-life activists approve of killing the most weak and 
defenceless human beings.  I am trying to save them.  Who is 
standing on the high moral ground?  Abortion is not a complex 
issue.  It involves the honesty of answering one simple question. 
What is the unborn?  That is what I would like parliament to 
debate.  That is what we are here for today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, could I request unanimous consent to make the 
motion that I have before the House votable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  Does the hon. member 
have unanimous consent?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  If someone denies unanimous consent, does he or does he 
not have to be in his seat when he does so?  The individual who 
denied unanimous consent was not in his seat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  I will tell the hon. 
member and the House that I did hear a no.  I did not look over 
to see if the hon. member was sitting in his seat, but I believe 
the no came from the parliamentary secretary, who was in his 
seat.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B> The hon. member said no 
as well. Because she did not understand the question in English,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the concerns that motivated the 
member for Yorkton—Melville to introduce this motion in the 
House are entirely respectable.  They are very important and 
deserve serious examination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to take this opportunity to emphasize a few important 
considerations which are relevant to this motion. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the House will appreciate, the views of Canadians diverge 
significantly on the important issues suggested in the motion. 
Achieving a consensus is indeed a challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has been visible in laying the research 
groundwork necessary to support an informed policy debate on the 
multitude of issues implied in the motion.  There are moral, 
social, economic and legal implications on health and research, 
as well as repercussions for the general public, that must be 
fully explored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through its three federal research funding agencies, the 
Government of Canada seeks to support and promote a framework for 
conducting ethically sound research. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More recently, the Supreme Court of Canada handed down its 
decision in Dobson v Dobson.  This was a case involving a fetus 
which had sustained injuries as a result of a car accident in 
which a pregnant woman died. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the Supreme Court of Canada say?  It said that it was 
up to the provincial legislature rather than the courts to find a 
solution to these questions, given the limitations imposed by the 
charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the research done by scientists and researchers, funded 
through Canada's health research institutes, the Natural Sciences 
and Engineering Research Council of Canada and the Social 
Sciences and Humanities Research Council is reviewed according 
to the standards contained in the tri-council policy statement on 
ethical conduct for research involving humans.

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998, these three federal research councils developed a joint 
policy statement for research involving humans.  The statement 
replaces the separate policies that have been in place since the 
seventies and ensures a co-ordinated approach to all federal 
funding initiatives in terms of ethical standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to point out that with its launch in September 
1998, Canada became the very first country to produce a 
comprehensive ethical policy statement for research involving 
humans in all academic disciplines.  The councils believe that 
sensitive and thoughtful implementation of this policy statement 
benefits researchers, their institutions and their subject 
ensuring ethically sound research. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the section of the policy statement dealing with 
research using gametes, zygotes, embryos and fetuses emphasizes 
how very central respect for human dignity remains in any 
ethical, political or social debate. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policy statement adheres to the internationally held 
standard that no research involving human subjects should be 
started without prior review and approval by a properly 
constituted and functioning research ethics board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It requires that research ethic boards be established in 
institutions where the research is conducted and to contain 
expertise in the areas being studied: ethical expertise, wider 
academic representation community representation and in most 
cases legal expertise. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tri-council policy statement is also an evolving document. 
Given the complexity of the considerations surrounding the ethics 
of research involving humans, the federal research agency 
releases regular updates to the tri-council policy statement and 
is open to any comments or discussions at any time. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in Canada are lucky to have outstanding scientists and 
researchers.  As Dr. Alan Bernstein, president of the Canadian 
Institute of Health Research, recently pointed out: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the right structure, the right vision and the right 
resources, there's no doubt we can more than play our fair share 
in this exciting revolution in health research in the 21st 
century. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This revolution in health research must incorporate ethical 
standards which will reflect in our policies and programs the 
values with which we are comfortable in this country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Diane Bourgeois (Terrebonne—Blainville, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, today's debate revolves around three points: first, the 
recognition of a fetus or embryo as a human being; second, the 
fact that it can be conceived naturally or otherwise, in the womb 
of the mother or not; and third, if the motion is agreed to, the 
resulting legislation ought to provide that “any and all 
consequential amendments required” shall be made.  This would 
involve discussions on abortion and the regulation of embryo or 
fetal tissue use for research purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite all the respect I have for my colleague from 
Yorkton—Melville, it must be acknowledged that this bill is 
treacherous, deceitful and misleading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it refers to new reproductive technologies on which this 
House has not yet been informed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill has links to previous discussions held in past 
parliaments on which we have already reached conclusions.  The 
subject matters are admittedly closely linked.  A person is 
either for or against abortion, for or against recognition of the 
fetus as a human being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the situation, I venture to believe that colleagues here 
will agree that such a bill would be unacceptable and 
will act accordingly.  As Bloc Quebecois critic for the status of 
women, however, I must present the position of a heavy majority 
of Canadian and Quebec women on the two components of this issue. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1755"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT95"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT95"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1755

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two radically different and opposed concepts involved 
in this debate.  While some defend the right of everyone to choose 
life, their opponents see but one thing: life at all cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument for the embryo being considered a person from the 
moment of conception is that when the nuclei are fused the 
entire program for the development of that being until death has 
been set.  Yet the celebrated physician and theologian Alberto 
Bondolfi, after thorough examination of the question, stated 
that while a fetus is neither a thing nor a tissue, it cannot 
however be treated as a human person from the time of birth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nor must we deliberately ignore the definitive caesura of birth, 
what Hans Saner called the fundamental shift in worlds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must recall that up until birth the embryo is not an 
independent being.  Most philosophers, ethicists, theologians, 
men and women, Catholics and non-Catholics make a fundamental 
distinction between prenatal life and the being after birth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, neither the Canadian constitution nor international 
conventions confer on an embryo the right to life.  Here in 
Canada there is even a fairly major controversy over the extent 
of the federal government's jurisdiction in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 33rd Parliament, the government introduced a motion 
for debate and a vote in order to obtain the advice of parliament 
on the wording of new legislation concerning the recognition of 
the fetus as a human being and the criminalization of abortion. 
This motion was not passed and, of note, no female MPs voted in 
favour of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1988, Canada gave the woman in question the fundamental 
right protected by the constitution to make a free and 
independent decision.  Various private member's bills to restrict 
access to abortion were introduced during the 34th and 35th 
parliaments, but none made it past second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One could also talk about the policy stands taken by governments 
of other countries in favour of freedom of choice.  Even the 
European Commission of Human Rights pointed out that the 
expression “any person” in its second article, which guarantees 
the right to life, does not apply to an unborn child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Abortion and birth control practices date back to the earliest 
civilizations.  Even today a number of traditional societies use 
plants that cause sterility or abortions for birth control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But it was in the middle ages that abortion was considered 
criminal.  Assemblies of bishops—men—condemned it in a number 
of decrees.  I would point out to members that today's proposal 
is being advanced by men.  History makes abundant mention of the 
fact that attitudes toward abortion were influenced by religious 
beliefs, customs and attitudes toward women and the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite religious bans, women continued to use plants that cause 
sterility, turning to charlatans of the day or to witchcraft in 
order to have an abortion at the risk of their life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, in these so-called modern times, religious considerations 
continue to surround the debate on abortion.  However, in the 
Bible the Christian message does not mention it.  What may be 
understood from the Bible is that each woman is free to choose 
independently and according to her own conscience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the New Testament, Luke reports the sentence Jesus said “Woe 
unto you also, ye lawyers.  For ye lade men with burdens grievous 
to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of 
your fingers”.

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to a discussion of the fundamental rights of 
women.  The decision to have a child or not is no light matter. 
It is one of the weightiest decisions to be made in the life of a 
woman.  It is for her and her alone to choose in full knowledge 
of the facts to end a pregnancy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who are we to intervene in such a personal decision?  To prevent 
a woman from ending a pregnancy obliges her to bear a child and 
this obligation is contrary to the fundamental rights of women. 
Is it up to us to rule behaviour and conscience by imposing our 
concept of life? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A woman has a right to life, health, physical integrity, freedom 
of conscience, moral independence, the right to make her own 
decisions and to choose motherhood freely, a right recognized 
fundamentally the world over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To decide against having a child is also to decide for 
something: one's own life and the life of one's family, to 
procreate later, when the woman is able in more favourable 
conditions.  It is a responsible decision that considers the 
impact of one's own choices.  And it is not wrong to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To truly protect life is first and foremost to protect the life 
aspirations and perspectives of women.  It is to prevent 
undesired pregnancies and to ensure that every child is wanted. 
It is to create conditions through appropriate social policy so 
that motherhood may be lived in full awareness and in joy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the hon. member aware only of the responsibilities a woman 
faces when she is pregnant and when she has a child to raise? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pregnancy is not just about reproduction; it is about the 
ability to have access to appropriate clinical services; it is 
about access to information and assistance; it is about 
parenting skills; it is about being able to raise a child 
without living in abject poverty; it is about the availability 
of services that will ensure both mother and child quality 
life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the hon. member not calling for free and universally 
accessible health and social services?  Why is he not calling 
for measures against poverty as it involves women?  Why is he 
not calling for social housing?  Why is he not calling for 
legislation that would force men to pay child support and 
shoulder their responsibilities? 
With the one and a half million children living in poverty, 
without three meals a day, why is he not calling for the House 
to legislate on that?  And I could go on and on in this vein. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois are of the opinion that defining a 
human being as a fetus and making consequential amendments will 
initiate a debate that will take us back to the middle ages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately, public opinion has changed a good deal over the 
past 30 years on this issue.  I can only hope that my 
parliamentary colleagues will become aware of this reality and 
act accordingly. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the motion. For 
those who might be following the debate on television, let us be 
clear that this is a motion, not a bill.  Before I begin my 
remarks I will reread the motion for the record and then comment 
on the remarks of the three previous speakers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is fairly simple and yet extremely complex: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should bring 
in legislation defining a “human being” as a human fetus or 
embryo from the moment of conception, whether in the womb of the 
mother or not and whether conceived naturally or otherwise, and 
making any and all consequential amendments required. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I wish to commend the hon. member who moved the 
motion for doing just that.  I wish to commend him as well on his 
concise and correct history of this issue in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind the people who have spoken and people who are 
watching that this is not some esoteric topic that we are trying 
to impose here.  There already is, as the hon. member for 
Yorkton—Melville pointed out, a definition of human being.  It 
is already in the criminal code. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1805"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT97"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT97"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1805
<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is this:  are we as Canadians comfortable with the 
definition that is already there, or should we, based on whatever 
considerations we believe to be correct, amend that definition?. 
We are not going back to the middle ages by reviewing the 
question, which is already in the criminal code.  The question is 
simple.  First, where does human life begin, and second, where 
does society wish to protect human life? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We already know that society at least wishes to protect human 
life from the time stated in the criminal code, and that is, as 
we have heard, when the child exits the womb, whether breathing 
or not.  The question now is do we wish to extend that protection 
backward, or shall we say forward, to the development of the 
child?  That is, in my opinion, a reasonable question to ask. 
That is all we are doing.  That is all this motion is trying to 
do.  It is trying to bring this issue to the forefront. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary, in his remarks, which I found to be 
respectful, recognized the importance of some of the comments 
that were made by the mover.  I do not want to be completely 
complimentary of the mover of the motion because I do not think 
this matter should be dealt with in a partisan way.  I do not 
think this matter should be debated by pointing fingers to this 
side of the House and saying what this side of the House does and 
what they do not do over there, or anything like that.  This is a 
bigger issue than a political issue.  This is an issue of life 
and death and should not be discussed on a partisan basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will remind listeners that the votes and the bills talked 
about by the mover were brought forward by a Conservative 
government.  The votes were free, except for cabinet ministers, 
and people voted for or against the legislation for a variety of 
reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To educate the member from the Bloc Quebecois, I can tell her 
that there were women on this side of the House who voted against 
the legislation, not because it so-called offended the rights of 
women, but because it did not go far enough to protect the unborn 
child.  Of course she was not here at that time so she might not 
know.  I was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found it interesting when the member from the Bloc Quebecois 
said that this matter had been dealt with and therefore we should 
not deal with it again.  It is a very interesting philosophy from 
a party dedicated to the breaking up of the country.  That matter 
has been dealt with.  There was a referendum.  What legitimacy 
does that person have to sit in the House and attempt to break up 
the country when the matter has been dealt with?  We cannot have 
it both ways.  If a matter has been dealt with, fine, then it has 
been dealt with, but we cannot pick and choose which matters have 
been dealt with and which matters have not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a lawyer.  I do not know if the Bloc member is, but in my 
view she misstated the holding of the Supreme Court of Canada. 
It was correctly stated that the Supreme Court of Canada found 
that there were technical reasons why the law that was in place 
was not in accordance with the constitution and it did turn the 
ball back to the Parliament of Canada to do whatever it wished to 
do in order to correct that.  There is no legal right to abortion 
in this country, according to the Supreme Court of Canada.  That 
is a misstatement of the Morgentaler decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She also mentioned the Bible.  I was not going to mention the 
Bible because as soon as one does that, one imposes one's views. 
However, the member opposite mentioned the Bible.  I would just 
like to remind her about a little story in the Bible which I am 
sure she is familiar with.  When Mary, who was going to become 
the mother of Jesus, visited her cousin Elizabeth, who was 
carrying John the Baptist, the baby leapt in her womb, says the 
Bible, in anticipation of the great joy of Jesus being born.  The 
Bible uses those words, the baby leapt in her womb.  Not the 
fetus, not the zygote, not the embryo, but the baby leapt in her 
womb for joy.  That is from the New Testament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to talk about the New Testament.  I want to talk 
about the motion.  The parliamentary secretary said there is no 
consensus in Canada on the issue of abortion. 
I do not want to talk necessarily about abortion.  I want to talk 
about the definition of human being.  Of course abortion is one 
of the consequences, as the hon. member from the Bloc Quebecois 
correctly stated. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1810"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT97"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of consequences that flow from this motion. 
One of them is, what is the definition of human being?  There is 
no consensus on that issue, as we have already heard in the 
debate, but does that mean there is no truth?  There was no 
consensus that the earth was round.  In fact I would say that the 
majority of people thought at one time that the earth was flat. 
Did that make the earth flat?  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one time the majority of people around the world felt it was 
perfectly reasonable to have slaves.  Even the Bible mentions it. 
It is mentioned in the laws of Moses as to what the Hebrews are 
to do with their slaves.  At one time slavery was considered to 
be perfectly acceptable and in some countries it still is.  Does 
that make it perfectly acceptable?  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that slavery is wrong and the truth is that the 
earth is round, no matter how many people say that slavery is 
acceptable and no matter how many people say the earth is flat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is what is inside the womb a human being?  That cannot be 
decided by consensus.  It is either a truth or it is not.  Let us 
look at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was mentioned by the previous speaker, we have a law of 
science.  It is undisputed.  It is the law of biogenesis.  It is 
very simple and very logical and it cannot be argued, that is, 
like begets like, period, full stop.  Two hamsters cannot produce 
a frog.  Two dogs cannot produce a cat.  Two humans cannot 
produce anything other than a human.  That is simply a fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once a fertilized egg has been conceived by the act of 
procreation of two humans, that is the commencement of human life 
according to the law of biogenesis.  If that is the commencement 
of human life, does that life need protection?  Let us look at it 
philosophically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about human rights and protecting against 
discrimination, but we cannot talk about the discrimination that 
the unborn child has.  It has no rights.  It has an absolute 
impossibility of protecting itself from a decision that another 
person makes about its very right to breathe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you not find it interesting, Madam Speaker, that on the one 
hand it is perfectly acceptable and legal in Canada at the 
present time to kill an unborn child at any point of its 
development, right up until it comes out of the womb, yet on the 
other hand we are wringing our hands about the ethics of 
experimentation on zygotes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the logic in that?  How can it be logical to permit a 
third trimester abortion at eight months without blinking our 
eyes and wring our hands about whether or not a fertilized egg is 
going to be flushed down a scientist's drain? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us start thinking about the realities of what we are talking 
about.  Do we discriminate on the basis of size?  No.  Therefore 
we should not discriminate on the basis of the size of the fetus. 
Do we discriminate on the basis of level of development?  No.  If 
someone has a lower IQ than someone else we do not discriminate. 
Therefore, why do we discriminate because the unborn child has a 
lesser level?  It is the same with its environment and degree of 
dependency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue of fundamental human rights.  The issue should 
be discussed in parliament.  All of the views should be aired and 
decisions should be made.  We should not be afraid of discussing 
the issue.  I commend the hon. member for bringing it forward. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I too commend my colleague from Yorkton—Melville 
for bringing this motion forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has of course been a topic where there are deep feelings on 
both sides of the abortion issue.  The motion specifically talks 
about the government bringing in legislation defining a human 
being as a human fetus or embryo from the moment of conception, 
whether in the womb of the mother or not, and whether conceived 
naturally or otherwise, and making any and all consequential 
amendments required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to state my unequivocal and unqualified support for the 
motion and be very clear about that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1815"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take a minute or two to rebut the comments made by my 
colleague from the Bloc.  The member for Scarborough Southwest 
spent some time on that as well so I will not go into great 
detail, but he made a good point when he said that her argument 
was logically inconsistent in regard to the separation issue 
being dealt with and that we should just leave it alone.  She 
claimed that because the abortion issue, in her mind, has been 
settled and closed, we should not go there.  That is logically 
inconsistent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She also claimed that the opposition to this particular idea of 
redefining what is a human or the definition of a person is, in 
and of itself, one that is religious in its nature.  I would 
disagree with that.  I would say that it is a moral issue and one 
where individuals, who are both religious and non-religious but 
who are what we might call, absolutists who believe in right and 
wrong, would find broad agreement.  Those who would say that 
abortion is wrong would be absolutists and I would include 
myself as an absolutist.  I therefore reject the premise of her 
argument that it is simply a religious argument for those who 
speak against abortion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very big dilemma in this whole issue of abortion has to do 
with the definition of a human being.  My colleagues have talked 
about the legal definition.  It is in statute right now that a 
human is a human when the person leaves the birth canal.  That 
creates a dilemma for many of us specifically because of the 
technology and advancement within our world in terms of medical 
sciences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that in one room we may have a doctor performing 
microsurgery with the latest technology to save the life of what 
some may call a fetus, an unborn child who might be six months in 
its development, while in the very next room we might have 
somebody else in a very similar situation having the termination 
of a pregnancy or an abortion.  That is a big dilemma.  How do we 
explain that?  How do we deal with that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, we are seeing medical dollars allocated to 
saving the life of an unborn child through microsurgery and, on 
the other hand, in the next room a child is being aborted.  That 
has been a great dilemma for people who are both pro-choice and 
pro-life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could have agreement from many pro-choice individuals and 
pro-life people, people who would identify themselves as such, 
that in terms of partial birth abortions, or late term abortions, 
that we should look at redefining the definition of a human.  We 
must scale it back, or as my colleague says, scale it forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate is, when does life begin.  I believe life begins at 
conception.  Many members in this place believe that.  That is 
the fundamental question, the philosophical debate that we have 
around the issue.  It does get very emotional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would do well to try and strip away as best we can those 
emotional catch phrases, in many ways similar to the kinds of 
partisan debates that can take place in the House on many 
different issues.  We must remove that aspect in the debate and 
have reasoned debate taking into account the technologies that 
are available and that our understanding has changed from when 
this practice of abortion became commonplace in the sixties and 
throughout the seventies.  We must re-examine the question and it 
is only fair that we re-examine it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, it has been dealt with previously, but does that mean that 
because we have made a decision on something, we cannot go back 
and open it up? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My Bloc colleague also said she was speaking for her party.  I 
think that was a mistake because I know she has colleagues that 
would identify themselves as pro-life.  This being private 
members' business, it is good for members to state their 
positions.  We have individuals in our caucus that are both 
pro-life and pro-choice, and I think that would be the case for 
all parties. 
We should talk about the issue and open up the debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As a man, individuals have asked me why I feel I have the right 
to even speak on this particular issue.  As a man, I am also the 
husband of a wife.  There are a lot of women in my life but just 
one wife whom I love dearly.  I am the father of three beautiful 
daughters, the uncle of eight beautiful nieces and the son to a 
mother.  I have many other close friends who are women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two very close friends who had abortions earlier on in 
their lives.  They have reflected many years later on that 
experience. One was put in the position of being with an abusive 
husband who forced her to go through with this particular act, 
and she did. The second time she became pregnant, she was being 
forced to do again.  However, she left her husband and gave birth 
to a son.  There are countless stories of individuals who have 
been put in that situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another friend had an abortion at a very young age.  She told me 
she wished she had received counsel on this particular issue 
before embarking on this choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other solutions and other things that we can look at. 
Some say it is wrong to force a woman to remain pregnant. There 
is another possible solution for those women who find themselves 
in an unfortunate circumstance, and that is adoption.  Abortion 
is one possible solution but so is adoption.  I have many friends 
who are adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are losing generations of children every year.  There are 
100,000 children a year who will not walk with us in this world, 
who will not be able to contribute to our society and who will 
not be the doctors, the lawyers, the scholars, the workers and 
the people across the strata of our society.  That is an issue we 
need to examine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we make a decision to end a child's life, are we making a 
decision to end the life of someone who might have a great and 
profound impact on our society?  Each and every life is 
important.  Each and every life will have a profound impact the 
child's family of course but also within a greater sphere as well 
in their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wrap up my comments by saying that I support the motion.  We 
need to approach this topic in a reasoned and rational way.  We 
need to bring forward the knowledge that we received from the 
great science and technology advancements in our society.  We 
need to work together, even individuals who disagree on this 
particular topic.  We should look for some common ground.  We can 
start by redefining life at an earlier stage.  I think pro-life 
and pro-choice people would have a broad consensus on the issue 
of partial birth abortion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a worthwhile motion.  It is one that is emotional but it 
is worthwhile because it is the definition of life, which is the 
most important question in all of our entire lives.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public 
Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
congratulate the member on bringing the issue before the House. I 
believe that life begins at conception and ends at natural death. 
That is precisely what the intent was of the motion before the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the issues I worked on in the House was fetal alcohol 
syndrome which relates to the consumption of alcohol during 
pregnancy and leads to very serious problems.  The House might be 
interested to know that a number of jurisdictions in the United 
States have laws where chronic or irresponsible drinking during 
pregnancy is now considered a criminal offence and is equal to or 
equivalent to child abuse.  That was very interesting because it 
was the first time I heard of the rights of the unborn being 
protected.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It shows the House and all members that things are changing. 
Things do change.  Science is changing.  We can operate on unborn 
children, examine them, do all kinds of microsurgery, et cetera. 
All of a sudden we need to start thinking about fundamentals, 
about what the difference is.  The member from Scarborough says 
size, the degree of independence and the level of development can 
be different in and outside the womb. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing really changes.  That convention was established a long 
time ago and I suspect it will be debated for a long time to 
come.  However I lend my support to the member's motion because I 
believe it is an important issue for all Canadians to consider, 
to have input into and to understand.  Children, as one can 
imagine, are celebrated every day in the world, even unborn 
children.  All one needs to do is go to a baby shower and ask 
what everyone is celebrating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank all hon. members who have 
spoken in support of my motion.  I appreciate that.  I thank them 
for putting politics aside and standing for what is right.  Some 
who have spoken are more eloquent than I on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I have asked is:  What is the unborn?  I have 
talked about the abortion issue and will continue to do so 
because it is one of the key consequences of my motion.  I will 
briefly reply to some of the people who oppose the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anti-life advocates or those who oppose the motion say that 
abortion is a private matter.  The response to that is we do not 
allow child abuse if it is done in private.  Those who oppose the 
motion will say that many poor women cannot afford to raise 
another child.  The answer is obvious:  We do not kill people 
just because it is too expensive to care for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who oppose the motion say killing a fetus is not the same 
as killing a person.  The response is that it comes down to a 
simple question:  What is the unborn?   By the way, Madam 
Speaker, did you know that the word fetus means little one? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opponents to the motion will ask whether we think a woman should 
be forced to bring an unwanted child into the world.  The 
response is obvious:  The homeless around us are unwanted, but we 
do not kill them.  If the unborn are human beings they deserve 
the same protection as other human beings.  In Canada they do not 
have that protection.  We are one of the few countries that does 
not provide it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the government to defend its current stand supporting 
abortion, it must offer a better definition of a human being than 
currently exists in the criminal code.  I ask that they produce 
evidence that the unborn are not human. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If people could produce evidence that the unborn are not human, 
I suspect that the people supporting the motion and I would walk 
away from the debate immediately.  Some will respond by saying 
that no one can prove whether the unborn are human so we will 
keep killing them anyway.  We cannot accept that.  What if the 
criminal code is wrong?  What if we are killing human beings when 
we kill a fetus?  Is the question not worthy of a full debate in 
the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will offer three scientific reasons as to why an unborn child 
is a human being.  First, the unborn is genetically distinct from 
its parents.  It is not just a part of the woman.  Second, the 
unborn has human parents and human parents can only produce human 
offspring.  Third, the unborn is genetically complete.  It is a 
self-integrating organism.

</I></B></P><P align=left>An unborn child differs from a newborn child in only four ways: 
It is smaller; it is not as well developed; it is located inside 
its mother; and it is more dependent.  Those are the only 
differences.  The evidence is clear that the unborn are human 
beings.  They deserve protection.  After 10 years of not debating 
the issue and not talking about it in the House, they deserve a 
fair hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we could probably all reach a decision.  We need 
to talk about the issue.  I think people on both sides of the 
debate would agree that what we have in the criminal code is not 
enough.  There must be some point at which we can agree that 
pre-born children must have protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because I think the debate should continue, I respectfully 
request the House to refer the motion to the Standing Committee 
on Justice and Human Rights so that parliament can hear what 
Canadians think.  The committee can hear from scientists and from 
people on both sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask for the unanimous consent of the House for that to be done 
on the issue at some point.  When the government feels it is 
appropriate, this should be discussed by the justice committee. I 
hope this has been enough of an indication that we need to 
further debate the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  Does the hon. member 
have unanimous consent of the House to move the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  The time provided for 
the consideration of private members' business has now expired. 
As the motion has not been designated a votable item, the order 
is dropped from the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 6.32 p.m. the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
