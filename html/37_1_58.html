on Monday several members opposed to Bill C-287 quoted the recent 
report of the Royal Society of Canada as saying there was no need 
for mandatory labelling of genetically modified foods in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the members neglected to mention was the very next sentence 
in the report.  I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Panel wishes to emphasize, however, that these conclusions 
are premised upon the assumption that the other recommendations 
of this Report concerning the conditions for the effective 
assessment and management of the risks of GM organisms are fully 
implemented by the regulatory agencies. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a very long way to go before we can dismiss any need for 
mandatory labelling.  I encourage all members to read the full 
report before they so disingenuously cite it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this year alone the Liberal government will take more 
than half a billion dollars from the people of B.C. in the form 
of fuel taxes.  That is an annual tax grab that could pay the 
entire Vancouver area highways budget until the year 2006. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet the Minister of Transport stubbornly refuses to return to 
B.C. a single cent of those taxes to support our highway system. 
While greater Vancouver residents line up in gridlock on a 
Trans-Canada Highway built in the 1950s the government pumps over 
$500,000 in grants into cultural special interest groups in 
central Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our taxed to the hilt drivers have had enough of filling up the 
pork barrel for the Prime Minister.  They want their share of the 
national highways funding and they want it now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When is the minister going to deliver?

Simon Gamache. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with all the people of Abitibi, I was filled with pride by 
this sensational victory.  With their win over the 
Acadie<B>—</B>Bathurst Titan for the President's Cup, our junior team 
has made it abundantly clear that the calibre of hockey in 
Quebec is truly at the national level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our players' victory was a tribute to their skills, playing 
strategy and tenacity.  Not only are they an honour to us all 
but they have made the world of hockey realize that Val-d'Or is 
a force to be reckoned with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hats off to Coach Claude Bouchard and each and every player for 
this remarkable exploit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure their stellar performance in the playoffs is an

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>NATIONAL DRINKING WATER STANDARDS 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK13"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, most Canadians turn on the tap and 
expect the water to be safe to drink.  The recent developments in 
North Battleford and the tragedies in Walkerton raised questions 
regarding the potential dangers lurking in our taps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an Edmontonian, I am relieved to know that Alberta 
regulations require drinking water to be 99.5% free of 
contaminants, which is the highest standard for water quality in 
the country.  The problem is that parasites like cryptosporidium 
are microscopic and can pass through mechanical filtering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Researchers at the University of Alberta, in partnership with 
Epcor and the provincial government, are working to perfect a 
process using ultraviolet light to kill microscopic parasites 
such as cryptosporidium.  If this process is proven effective, 
the province has agreed to pay a substantial increase for water 
treatment costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take this opportunity to congratulate the government 
of Alberta, the University of Alberta and Epcor for their 
continued efforts to improve the quality of drinking water for 
Alberta families.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday in Montreal, I had the great honour of meeting the 
strong supporter of Acadian culture and francophone rights in 
Louisiana, Warren Perrin, when he made a presentation at the 
11th symposium on international law organized by Mr. Justice 
Allen Babineaux as part of the Quebec bar's annual convention, 
in co-operation with the French section of Louisiana's bar and 
the council for the development of French in Louisiana, which is 
chaired by Mr. Perrin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Warren Perrin, who is himself a descendant of deported Acadians, 
became acutely aware of the consequences of deportation when he 
was trying to answer his children's questions on the origins of 
their family. 
They could not understand why their ancestors had been treated 
like criminals and deported all over the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This remarkable man then decided to pursue an initiative 
launched over 200 years ago when, after 1763, a petition 
condemning the deportation was presented to King George II by a 
group of deported Acadians. The British crown never deigned to 
follow up on that petition. Mr. Perrin is now asking the British 
crown to apologize to Acadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is never too late to recognize that a mistake was done. I 
want to salute Mr. Perrin and ensure him of our support in the 
pursuit of his efforts.

week.  It has been reported that he plans to announce paying down 
the national debt by the amount of $15 billion to $17 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paying down the debt is important, but at this time it is 
crucial that as a country we address the crises of our lack of 
housing and our failing infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A commitment by the government of $1 billion per year for 10 
years would address the housing shortfall in all of Canada.  A

improving our highways as well as supporting increased public 
transit and green infrastructure like water and sewers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the main reasons we have a surplus is that the government 
has abandoned its responsibility for housing, roads and 
infrastructure.  Now the health and lives of Canadians are at 
risk.  Canadians have lost confidence in a safe water supply and 
local governments are resorting to tolls to improve road safety.

also, and we are encouraged by that.

Speaker, a committee will be reporting in June on that very 
topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could quote the hon. member when he was in Edmonton, where he 
did not want parliament to sit, because when parliament was 
sitting in Alberta it was creating too much demand on the

example.  We do want some reform and we are working on that. The 
committee will be reporting on that next month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say that there were no free votes before this

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian

reply with old rhetoric.  Forty per cent of Canadians stayed home 
during the last election because they felt so dissatisfied.  They 
felt their voices did not matter since their own members of 
parliament could not even speak for them or vote freely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the Prime Minister be specific right now?  Mr. Turner said 
that at the very least, at a minimum, MPs should be able to vote

that much?

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say, for the edification of the House of 
Commons, that the Leader of the Opposition chaired a special 
committee on parliamentary reform in 1993 in Alberta.  It 
recommended that committees should not be allowed to issue 
minority reports.  That is a good example of the type of reform

the Governor of the Bank of Canada appeared before the Standing 
Committee on Finance, he acknowledged that maintaining the 
Canadian dollar involves some costs.  In fact, David Dodge 
referred to a ten year horizon for adoption of a common 
currency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This position is nothing new for the Bank of Canada, as last 
year the director of its international division wrote that “a 
common North American currency is not such a farfetched idea”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the eve of his economic statement, is the Minister of Finance 
going to take the Bank of Canada analysis into account and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
directing my question to the Prime Minister because it is 
obvious that his Minister of Finance is saying one thing and 
Mr. Dodge something else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since he refers to a ten year horizon, and even the division 
director spoke of adopting a common currency, does the Prime 
Minister not think that what is needed is simply to give some 
thought to the idea of adopting a common currency within the 
context of North America, give some thought to it, debate it 
and discuss it in a reasonable manner? 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as

States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian dollar keeps dropping and has reached a level the 
Prime Minister could not even imagine when he mocked the 
“Lévesque buck” at 75 cents.  All the while, the Minister of 
Finance intones a patriotic refrain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of this constant erosion of productivity, the dollar and 
our standard of living, will the Minister of Finance finally 
agree to consider the possibility of a single North American 
currency in an effort to resolve the productivity problems 
Canada is facing? 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member is mistaken.  There was certainly a drop in Canada's 
productivity in the 1980s and early 1990s, but since 1997 it 
has been on the rise.  In fact, last year was a very good year 
in terms of Canadian productivity. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg—Jacques-Cartier, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a weak dollar helps our exports in the short term, but 
represents a substantial handicap to the economy in the medium 
term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, instead of making absurd statements on the supposed 
political uncertainty of Quebec, would the Minister of Finance 
not agree, as do the Governor of the Bank of Canada, a Nobel 
prize laureate in economics, the Toronto Dominion Bank and 
Quebec, that in the end the road to the future for Quebec and 
Canada is to work starting now to establish a single currency 
for all of North America, including Canada, the United States, 
Quebec and Mexico?

Mr. Speaker, it should come as no surprise to the hon. member, 
because it has been part of the defence white paper since 1994, 
that we would engage in consultation and observation.  In fact, 
having somebody in that office is a good way of getting the

agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as a more general question, would the Prime Minister 
also agree to meet personally with the other party leaders to 
work out a new practice to give parliament earlier and more

never approved by a vote in the House because the Prime Minister

system as excellent or very good has plummeted from 60% in 1991 
to less than 25% last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The verdict is in on our health care system.  It needs

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
what the member did not mention, and perhaps he does not know, is 
that consistently over 80% of people who had personal experience 
with the health care system over the last year rated it excellent 
or very good, this member included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to stress is that last September all governments 
came to the same place.  They had agreement with all the premiers

are about to do.

federal government did not meet its own targets for review of new 
drugs.  The fact is that it takes twice as long as it is 
recommending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the health minister is very simple.  Will he 
throw severely sick Canadians a lifeline and guarantee at least 
to meet his own targets in life saving drugs?

yesterday we published through the Canadian Institutes of Health

is not yet complete, but it was an extremely good picture of 
where things stand.  It contained some good news and some news 
that was not so good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall the health care system is providing the care that 
Canadians need.  In terms of drug approvals by Health Canada, we 
can and we will do better.  However Canadians should know that

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Art Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the school is not under the jurisdiction of the

operation of a local school board with responsibilities to the 
province of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the school on our property.  That is quite true.  We

The buck is being passed back and forth.  Not only is there lead 
in the paint but there is asbestos in the halls.  This is toxic 
for these children.  It causes learning disabilities.  In fact it 
is a poison.

purchase their vehicles and then convert them to hand drive, yet 
a GST rebate is given on the conversion cost only. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the minister would tell us why there is no GST rebate on

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member does well to bring this up.  The 
exemption is on the medical and assistive devices.  As well, the 
costs of altering the vehicle also qualify, I would say, in 
addition to those raised by the hon. member for the medical 
expense tax credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out that help for disabled Canadians includes the 
disability tax credit and the caregiver credit.  This combined 
approach is indeed the best way to deal with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also point out that in budget 2000 we increased the

they lacked a long time attachment to Fraser River fisheries 
management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have now learned that the minister has removed Fraser panel

that we protect those threatened species but that we take

criminal code to sell inhalants and other sniff products for 
purposes of intoxication.  It seeks to stop those in our society 
who deliberately prey on our young people at times of

inhaling, sniffing and drinking poisonous substances which have 
lasting side effects and cause permanent damage.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the

follows: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health portfolio for all northern Quebec Cree communities 
has been under the provincial government jurisdiction since the 
signing of the James Bay agreement. Consequently, Health Canada's 
regional environmental health services have not been involved in 
the community's housing assessment since 1978. Since the James 
Bay agreement of 1978, Health Canada has not visited the 
Chisasibi Cree community; Health Canada did not spend anything; 
and Health Canada, first nations and Inuit Health Branch, Quebec 
region, can visit the community if the Quebec government agrees 
to it and makes recommendations accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indian Affairs and Northern Development: Five times; $2.1 
million plus $1.9 million under the new onreserved housing 
policy; the department is quite aware of and concerned about the 
health implications of mold and mildew in houses in Chisasibi. 
While there is no ongoing program or financial resources 
dedicated to this problem, the department provides the Cree 
communities with $3.7 million annually to assist them in 
addressing their housing needs. However, in recognition of the 
serious health concern, the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development advised the chief of Chisasibi that the 
department would provide emergency financial assistance to help 
in dealing with the immediate problems, and, as well, would 
continue to offer assistance in the form of information on the 
prevention of residential mold contamination.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 1 
</UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That Bill C-17, in Clause 6, be amended by

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak to my 
motion, which is a fairly simple motion regarding a fairly simple 
bill.  Bill C-17 is only about four or five pages long, but it is 
the last two paragraphs I had a problem with. 
They are the only two paragraphs in the bill that deal 
specifically with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. A 
clause in Bill C-17 asks for broad exemptions in the Financial 
Administration Act for the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1520"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we agree with exemptions that would allow the board to act 
more as a private organization, we take serious exception to the 
fact that Bill C-17 would prevent the auditor general from 
looking at the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raised this issue at committee the other day and I introduced 
an amendment, as hon. members are aware, that the auditor general 
be allowed to examine the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board if 
he or she so desires and to be the auditor of the plan if he or 
she so desires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The genesis of this clause is that it was inadvertently omitted 
when we last amended the Financial Administration Act and an 
exemption that had been granted the board was inadvertently 
re-introduced.  Now the government wants to put the exemption 
back in place and exempt the board from the Financial 
Administration Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ensure that the auditor general has the opportunity to 
look at the plan.  The reason I put the motion forward on the 
floor of the House is that when I went to committee we had a 
debate about whether the auditor general wanted to be involved in 
auditing the plan.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Finance said that it was no problem to the auditor general in 
1998 and that the auditor general had said that there was no 
problem, that he agreed with the amendment and that everything 
was fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I am a bit concerned that everything is perhaps not fine 
and that the auditor general did have serious concerns about 
being prevented from auditing the Canada Pension Plan Investment 
Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking, first, about a $40 billion amount which is 
growing.  We are talking about an investment plan that is there 
for all Canadians.  We are talking about money that is paid by 
all employed Canadians and held in trust by the government to be 
repaid to them during their retirement years.  We are talking 
about a lot of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a lot more supervision than a financial statement 
addressed by an auditor once a year to the Minister of Finance. 
Canadians need to know that the watchdog of parliament, the 
auditor general, if he or she so desires, has the opportunity to 
do a value for money audit on the board.  That is what my motion 
intends to achieve.  It is more narrowly drafted than the one I 
presented at committee but it is absolutely mandatory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard the Prime Minister talk today about parliamentary 
reform, openness and transparency.  All I am asking is that the 
auditor general have the opportunity, if he or she so desires, to 
look at this plan.  Is that too much to ask?  I do not think so. 
I do not think any Canadian would want it any other way.  That is 
what I am arguing for.  I am not asking for a change in 
legislation.  I am not asking for a change in the way the board 
does its business.  I am not asking for any change other than 
some accountability on behalf of the board that holds $40 billion 
of taxpayer money.  I am asking that it ensure Canadians are 
satisfied that their money is well managed and is held in trust 
appropriately on their behalf.  That is all we are asking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At committee I asked that the auditor general come in.  Other 
members said no, that they had a letter and that everything was 
fine.  We moved to clause by clause and then it was too late for 
the auditor general to speak at committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I do not have definitive proof, I believe that the 
auditor general, when it was debated in 1998, had fairly serious 
concerns about his inability to audit the plan. 
A compromise was reached because the government in essence held a 
gun to his head and told him it was all he would get.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not fair to Canadians.  We must let the auditor general 
be the watchdog on behalf of all Canadians.  We must give him the 
opportunity to audit the plan.  In that way the government and 
Canadians can be assured the plan is managed appropriately and in 
the best interest of all Canadians.  I ask all members and 
parties in the House to recognize the importance of the amendment 
and to support it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member for St. Albert 
exaggerates the case when he talks about a broad exemption.  We 
debated that at committee just yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment proposed to Bill C-17 by the hon. member would 
mean that sections 131 to 154 of the Financial Administration Act 
would apply to the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.  This 
was not intended when the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board 
Act was passed by parliament in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amendments to the Canadian Wheat Board Act in 1998 inadvertently 
removed the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board from subsection 
85(1) of the Financial Administration Act, a change which made 
the board subject to various crown corporation control provisions 
under the FAA.  The error put it in conflict with its mandate to 
operate at arm's length from government, a result which was 
neither wanted nor intended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective of Bill C-17 is to reinstate the Canada Pension 
Plan Investment Board as one of the crown corporations exempted 
from divisions I to IV of the Financial Administration Act.  This 
was the intent of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board Act 
and of parliament in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board was created through 
federal-provincial agreement to operate at arm's length from 
government.  Its legislated mandate and sole objective is to 
maximize returns for CPP contributors and beneficiaries without 
undue risk of loss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board has been structured 
with great care to ensure independence from political 
interference.  At the same time, the board's own legislation 
contains strong accountability provisions.  The board makes its 
quarterly reports public and is required to submit its annual 
reports to parliament.  The board is also required to hold public 
meetings at least every two years in participating provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general is responsible for auditing the financial 
statements of the Canada pension plan as a whole.  The auditor 
general has access to whatever information from the Canada 
Pension Plan Investment Board he or she considers necessary to 
audit the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a 1997 letter to the finance committee chair Mr. Desautels 
indicated he was satisfied with audit and access provisions for 
the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, information that is 
contained in the Canada pension plan legislation.  For these 
reasons I urge members to vote against the amendment we discussed 
yesterday in committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are

impede the operational efficiency or flexibility of the Canada

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would improve the accountability from a financial perspective 
and it would provide the auditor general with the power to 
oversee at least part of the operations of this board, which 
would have immense responsibilities in terms of the amount of 
capital that it would oversee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a parliament where we increasingly speak about the importance 
of parliamentary reform and the accountability of members of 
parliament, it is completely inconsistent with the stated message 
of the government, which is that it will refuse to recognize the 
importance of auditor general oversight on this issue by 
supporting the constructive motion introduced by the member for 
St. Albert.  Our party does support the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government wants to act consistently with the stated 
objectives of the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance and 
others on that side of the House to improve parliament and to 
improve accountability, then this amendment would be an easy and 
simple step to take.  The government has consistently not 
provided the auditor general's office with the appropriate level 
of respect.

the funding of R and D efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time it seems to me that there is one aspect that is 
totally lacking.  For example, there are the post-secondary 
institutions, which are key figures in R and D support and in the 
training of the people involved in it.  The bulk of the funding 
for post-secondary institutions, which are administered by the 
provinces, comes from the provinces, but of course there are 
federal transfer payments for post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the additional funding since we have moved from a context of 
zero deficit to a context of surplus has been via initiatives 
such as the budgets allocated to bodies outside the government, 
such as the foundation.  Non-governmental structures are being 
created in various fields and then they are given funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand, the government is putting money into human 
genome research, which is desirable, praiseworthy and correct. 
Yet there is one essential key element that must not be lost 
sight of: the funding of basic services and the necessity to 
increase the budget for transfer payments to the provinces, which 
in turn have to increase their budgets for post-secondary 
education accordingly.  This is where the first problem with 
basic activities lies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a second one as well. 
I have had the opportunity to mention it several times in a 
parliamentary committee and I once again want to make my message 
very clear to the government. There is another shortfall in 
terms of research and development and I am talking about the 
indirect costs related to the need for post-secondary 
institutions to submit projects and funding proposals to the 
Canada foundation for innovation or granting councils. For 
instance, universities have to pay additional indirect costs 
related to these proposals while their core budgets remain 
relatively stable. There have been cuts, but now their budgets 
are stable and have not been adjusted accordingly.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand part of the government's reasoning on this; 
although I do not agree with it, I understand the logic of it. 
It believes that this money is not as visible as direct 
investments in granting councils or agencies like the 
foundation. These investments are also necessary, extremely 
important and a top priority at this time. We have to stop 
thinking in terms of politics and start thinking about 
efficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One fact remains: we have to be more open about the investment 
objectives set for research and development. 
There is no problem with setting a target and saying that 
investments in research and development will double over the 
next ten years, but our priorities need to be defined more 
clearly. If such a vision does exist, it should be more 
transparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general himself has, on several occasions, 
criticized the fact that there seemed to be a problem in terms 
of follow-up, as well as a lack of transparency with regard to R 
and D investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We sense that there is some kind of agenda because huge sums are 
being invested in this area, but effectiveness should not be 
measured merely by the amount of money invested. In this case, 
the bill will authorize an extra $750 million for the 
foundation on top of the $500 million announced last fall and 
on top of previous measures. This is a lot of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that all these people do commendable work. In 
most cases there are peer review panels where people from the 
scientific community play a very important role in the selection 
of projects. However, there is a certain amount of criticism 
regarding the overall strategy and also regarding the ability of 
small universities, those located in less populated areas 
outside the large urban centres, to compete with larger 
universities. This kind of criticism cannot be ignored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member representing a region, I know what this means in 
practical terms. We know the importance of post-secondary 
institutions and of their ability to generate research and 
economic activity in our communities. A post-secondary 
institution is an extremely important tool for the economic 
development of a community. 
It is also a tool for social development because research is 
not limited to the economy, but also takes in social and other 
fields. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nor must we forget basic research, which is extremely important 
in increasing our knowledge in all fields.  This requires 
research which is more basic.  Educational institutions are far 
more oriented toward basic research than private companies 
often are even though it is in their interest and certain 
companies are very good at it.  Unfortunately, they are all too 
rare because we have a problem here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The research and development efforts of private companies are 
not what they should be, with the result that there are often 
problems of competitiveness which are not solely due to public 
under-investment in research and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The approach needs to be rethought in order to ensure that 
private sector stakeholders do more and are more aware.  There 
is perhaps also a message here that small companies have trouble 
qualifying for government programs, which are often geared more 
toward supporting the research and development efforts of big 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are therefore concerns for small communities.  There are 
also concerns for small businesses which often have some very 
clever individuals.  We should make better use of them in order 
to improve our research and development efforts and bring about 
innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are far from being opposed to a research and development 
timetable, but we do not like it when political objectives take 
centre stage and funding does not proceed according to a 
timetable readily understandable to everyone, while at the same 
time, a very important aspect, that of basic funding through 
transfer payment programs, is being neglected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the other provisions of Bill C-17 and the amendment moved, 
the latter will likely set to rest a number of fears expressed 
by other opposition parties at second reading and in committee. 
We do not have much to add on this particular amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one aspect of the bill which leaves us basically 
unsatisfied however.  Although the amendment is positive in 
nature it does not change the essence of the bill, nor will it 
change our position.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to speak to the bill again and clear some of the 
way for the industry committee.  Between the industry and 
transport committees, we have been extremely busy in the last 
while.  One would hope that we do not neglect parts of these 
bills that are not truly addressing the needs of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give a refresher on the bill for those who are 
listening.  We are debating Bill C-17, an act to amend the Budget 
Implementation Act, 1997 and the Financial Administration Act. 
This too is an omnibus bill introduced by the government to 
increase the grant to the Canada Foundation for Innovation by 
$750 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Foundation for Innovation is a government agency that 
gives grants to the public and not for profit research 
institutions, such as universities and hospitals, to finance 
acquisition and the development of research infrastructure.  This 
part of the bill is extremely credible.  There is no question 
that there is a need to invest in research and technology and 
post-secondary institutions.  Our party supports that part of the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some concern was raised in committee, when discussions were 
taking place, that there should be more accountability as to the 
way the money given to the Canada Foundation for Innovation works 
its way through the system.  We need more accountability.  The 
auditor general gave some indication that he would have preferred 
to see things looked at more thoroughly.  However, it is 
important that we do invest and that we see the dollars go to the 
foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to emphasize at this point that, although it is extremely 
important that we see investment in this area, we need to 
recognize that there has been a serious lack of support on the 
part of the present government in the funding of students 
attending post-secondary institutions within Canada.  As a 
result, a number of students, who attend university to take 
advantage of all the wonderful research and technology that is 
available to them, have huge debtloads.  We need a balance here. 
The government has failed to meet the needs of students attending 
post-secondary institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part of the bill deals with the closing up of 
loopholes.  There are two amendments to the Financial 
Administration Act.  The first amendment closes a loophole that 
allows government departments, agencies and non-exempt crown 
corporations to effectively borrow without the approval of the 
Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the core principles of the Financial Administration Act 
is that departments, agencies and non-exempt crown corporations 
must get the finance minister's approval before any borrowing. 
This way the finance minister is ultimately accountable for any 
debt taken on by any branch of the federal government.  Some 
departments were able to get around this requirement by taking on 
financial obligations that did not fall under the current 
definition of borrowing, such as lease agreements, and therefore 
did not need the finance minister's approval.  Bill C-17 
addresses that issue.  In that sense, this is a very good part of 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, our party does not support the amendment dealing with 
the Canada pension plan board that exempts it from accountability 
and that does not allow parliament to have a say over investments 
that it would be making.  I believe very strongly that Canadians 
do not want their pension plan dollars invested in just anything. 
Parliament needs to make sure that investment of Canada pension 
plan dollars would not be going into things such as tobacco 
companies.  We are fighting a war against smoking and we are 
trying to discourage people from smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should we be seeing the investment of Canada pension plan 
dollars in tobacco companies?  Should we be seeing the investment 
of Canada pension plan dollars in companies that use sweat shops 
or have terrible human rights violations in other countries? I do 
not want to see my dollars invested that way.  I am very 
comfortable in saying that the majority of Canadians do not want 
that either.  They do not want their Canada pension plan dollars 
going into sweat shops or into businesses outside of Canada or, 
for that matter, within Canada because we are not above having 
sweat shops either.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are situations in Canada that do not meet ideal labour 
conditions or human rights standards.  Those places exist in 
Canada as well, but we do not have the kind of control offshore 
that we should have within Canada.  Canadians do not want to see 
their dollars invested in those kinds of operations.  Because 
they are Canada pension plan dollars, parliament should have a 
say over the way the investments are handled.  That has been a 
serious issue with our party, the people who support us, and 
Canadians as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The suggested amendment to the bill may try to increase the 
accountability of the pension plan board, but I am not convinced 
that it would.  Our party will not be supporting the bill because 
there is no parliamentary oversight by the Canadian pension plan 
board.  The board, by the way, has been more or less appointed by 
the governing side of the House.  It does not ensure that it 
truly identifies with the entire population of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are very good parts to the bill such as the dollars that 
would be invested into research and development through the 
Canada foundation for innovation.  If the amendment should happen 
to make its way we would be support that amendment as well.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>MARINE LIABILITY ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK199">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Brian Tobin (for the Minister of Transport)</B> moved 
that Bill S-2, an act respecting marine liability, and to 
validate certain bylaws and regulations, be read the third time 
and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is with great pleasure 
that I rise today on third reading of Bill S-2, the marine 
liability act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I speak about the bill I would like to acknowledge the 
critical role played by members of the House, senators and the 
standing committees that have conducted a thorough examination of 
the legislation.  I would be remiss if I did not take a moment to 
thank members on the other side of the House for their support 
and good questions along the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-2 is a good example of our ability to work together for 
the good of all Canadians.  The introduction of the new 
legislation would not have been possible without the dedicated 
efforts of government officials, in particular those from the 
Department of Transport and the Department of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the legislative process officials from the Department 
of Transport held consultations with the industry, including 
shipowners, passengers, cargo owners, the oil industry, marine 
insurers and the marine legal community.  I take this opportunity 
as well to thank industry groups for their participation in this 
reform and their contributions and support for the new 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thoroughly convinced that the new legislation represents an 
important step toward the modernization of the Canadian maritime 
liability regimes.  The act introduces for the first time 
Canadian legislation regarding shipowner liability for the 
carriage of passengers and new rules for apportionment of 
liability in maritime cases.  At the same time the act would 
consolidate existing marine liability regimes into a single 
statute. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT23"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT23"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1550
<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me briefly review the principal elements of the new marine 
liability act.  The introduction of a new regime of shipowner 
liability to passengers is the key substantive element of the 
bill.   This regime is set out in part 4.  It is an initiative 
born out of the concerns of passengers who may be involved in an 
accident during maritime transport.  The provisions of the 
passenger liability regime as set out in part 4 are based on the 
1974 Athens convention relating to the carriage of passengers and 
their luggage by sea as amended by its 1990 protocol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation was previously introduced as Bill C-59 and Bill 
S-17, both of which died on the order paper when parliament was 
dissolved in April 1997 and October 2000 respectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are currently no statutory provisions in Canadian law 
which establish the basis of liability for loss of life or 
personal injury to passengers travelling by ship.  The intent of 
the regime of liability to passengers is to ensure in the event 
of a loss, particularly a major one, that claimants have a 
guaranteed set level of compensation and at the same time that 
shipowners are provided with a means of determining their 
potential exposure for passenger claims.  The financial 
responsibility of the shipowner to passengers would be abundantly 
clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of equal concern is the absence of Canadian legislation, with 
the exception of the Quebec civil code, specifically preventing 
shipowners from contracting out their liability to passengers. 
Such contractual exemptions are null and void in other countries, 
notably the United States, France and Britain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly such contractual exemptions from liability for 
passenger death or injury are generally absent in other modes of 
transport in Canada or are expressly prohibited as in the air 
mode where the liability of air carriers to passengers has long 
been regulated by the Carriage by Air Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There appears to be no basis for maintaining the contractual 
freedom currently enjoyed by water carriers to exempt themselves 
from their liability to passengers.  Therefore part 4 would 
prohibit such a practice in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second policy objective of the bill deals with the 
apportionment of liability in maritime cases.  The legislation is 
needed to deal with important aspects of liability in situations 
where the claimant has been partly responsible for his or her 
loss.  In the past two rules of common law have been the source 
of serious concerns to the marine community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first rule prevents a claimant from recovering anything if 
it is proved that the claimant contributed, even in the slightest 
degree, to his or her damages.  This is not fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second rule deals with situations where one defendant pays 
the total amount of the loss but cannot in turn recover his or 
her costs from other persons who may have contributed to the 
loss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The common law provinces have replaced these outmoded and harsh 
rules with legislation which allowed courts to apportion 
responsibility and to permit litigation parties to claim 
contribution and indemnity from other persons.  However 
parliament has never enacted any legislation similar to the 
provincial apportionment statutes, except for a few provisions 
covering the topics of damage caused by collisions between ships 
and pollution from ships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its recent decision the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that it 
was unjust to continue to apply the old common law rules to 
maritime negligence claims.  In light of this decision, new 
legislation is needed to establish a uniform set of rules that 
apply to all civil wrongs governed by Canadian maritime law. Part 
2 of Bill S-2 would achieve this objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new act would also consolidate existing marine liability 
regimes and related subjects which are currently located in 
separate pieces of legislation.  This one stop shopping approach 
to marine liability would avoid in the future the proliferation 
of separate legislative initiatives in the area of shipping 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In preparation for the new legislation on passenger liability 
and apportionment of liability, it became evident that it was not 
very efficient or user friendly to leave the various liability 
regimes scattered all over the legislative map.  Thus we are 
bringing forward the act which would consolidate all marine 
liability regimes into a single statute.  It includes provisions 
on fatal accidents or personal injuries, limitation of liability 
for maritime claims, liability for carriage of goods by water, 
and liability and compensation for pollution damage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 1 of the bill re-enacts the provisions on fatal accidents 
that currently appear in part 14 of the Canada Shipping Act and 
revises them to give effect to various Supreme Court of Canada 
decisions. 
These provisions have been brought forward in appropriately 
modernized language.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, part 3 of the bill re-enacts existing provisions 
found in part 9 of the Canada Shipping Act on the limitation of 
liability for maritime claims.  This part is based on the 1976 
international convention on limitation of liability for maritime 
claims as amended by its 1996 protocol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 5 re-enacts existing provisions of the Carriage of Goods by 
Water Act respecting the application of the Hague-Visby rules in 
Canada and the eventual implementation of the Hamburg rules.  The 
Carriage of Goods by Water Act was last revised in 1993.  It was 
the subject of a recent review in which the minister submitted a 
report to the House in December 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 6 continues the existing regime governing liability and 
compensation for maritime pollution by re-enacting existing 
provisions of part 16 of the Canada Shipping Act.  This part is 
based on two international conventions, the 1992 convention on 
civil liability for oil pollution damage and the 1992 convention 
on the establishment of an international fund for compensation 
for oil pollution damage.  The regime set out in part 6 of the 
bill governs the liability for oil pollution damage caused by 
tankers and pollution damage caused by other ships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This concludes my overview of the existing regimes that would be 
consolidated in a proposed marine liability act.  I would like to 
add that, as a supplement to the existing regimes that would be 
consolidated in a proposed marine liability act, there are other 
liability regimes on the horizon.  Notably, there is the 1996 
regime on liability and compensation for hazardous and noxious 
substances and the regime of liability for spills caused by 
ships' bunkers adopted in March 2001 by the International 
Maritime Organization.  Another regime currently under 
consideration at the International Maritime Organization is the 
new protocol to the Athens convention on compulsory insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the maritime liability act would serve us well in 
the future as a logical framework for these new regimes should 
Canada decide to adopt them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, Bill S-2 would first introduce a new regime of 
shipowners' liability to passengers and a set of new rules for 
apportionment of liability, and second, consolidate existing and 
future liability regimes.  The intent of the bill is to modernize 
our legislation to ensure that it meets the current and future 
needs of Canadians in legislating shipowners' liabilities, 
particularly their liability for passengers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all hon. members to give their full support in order to 
pass the bill to the benefit of all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Fitzpatrick (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it gives me pleasure to speak to Bill S-2.  The 
Alliance Party will be supporting the bill because it would be an 
improvement over the existing policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our sole reason for supporting the bill is that it is better 
than what we have.  However there is a serious omission or flaw 
in the legislation and I would like to speak to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday in the House, in response to a water crisis situation, 
we voted almost unanimously in support of a national safe water 
standard and for the federal government to get involved with 
quality water.  We did not really address the problems, one of 
which is how communities get the resources in place to put in 
modern water systems to ensure they have good water. That was 
completely omitted.  I believe North Battleford will spend $20 
million to put such a system in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We never really gave any thought to what a workable standard is. 
Somehow we seem to think that we have the wisdom in Ottawa that 
we would know what it is.  We have two judicial inquiries on the 
subject of water that will take a hard look at the cause of these 
sorts of problems.  I hope they come up with some good 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our wisdom, we know what we require for good water standards. 
We will put it through and forget about the real question, which 
is how these folks get their resources in place to deliver water.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am raising that as an issue only because I am going to tie 
that in with our debate over one defect in the bill.  There is no 
minimum mandatory passenger liability insurance in the bill, this 
despite the fact that in committee industry representatives from 
the insurance sector said that type of insurance would be a very 
minor cost and would not create any great burden for the 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We tried to make some common sense amendments to the bill which 
would allow for minimum passenger liability insurance, but those 
advocating that were stonewalled by members of the government who 
thought there were all sorts of problems with it.  We could not 
get a logical explanation as to why it would be a great 
difficulty, but in their wisdom they blocked it.  Last night we 
had two motions to deal with it, both defeated by the government. 
I find it strange that on the same day the government is 
unanimously supporting a water safety act it is turning down 
minimum passenger liability insurance coverage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would minimum passenger liability insurance do?  I think it 
could avoid a major disaster.  Insurance companies do not accept 
unreasonable risks.  If the quality of the vessels is not of a 
satisfactory standard and if the crews are not competent or have 
a bad safety record, the insurance industry will not accept that 
risk.  Believe me, there are ways of regulating an economy other 
than government regulations.  Insurance would be one good way of 
achieving the goal of safety in passenger shipping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately we have not had a major commercial passenger ship 
disaster in Canada.  I cannot recall one in my time.  That is 
good, but we know it has happened elsewhere.  Some day it could 
happen in this country.  I would suggest that the day it happens 
here we will have a judicial inquiry and there will be a lot of 
finger pointing.  I would suggest that a lot of the finger 
pointing will be directed at the government that is in power 
today.  It had a choice and it took the path of neglect and 
indifference.  What will it tell the passengers and their 
families when that happens?  Will it tell them that there is no 
insurance coverage, that the carrier is insolvent, that there are 
no assets to pay them, that there is no insurance money?  What 
will it say? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose if it happens during an election campaign the Prime 
Minister might come up with some instant taxpayer dollars to help 
out those folks.  That would be the government's way of doing 
things, to roam from one crisis to another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what will happen.  A lot of people will be pointing 
fingers at the government when that happens.  That is why I am 
speaking on this matter.  The Alliance Party wants to be on the 
record at this stage of the game to show that our party did due 
diligence on this matter but the government was very neglectful 
of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To add insult to injury in regard to the NDP motion last night, 
if the government is not going to put in mandatory insurance 
coverage there could be a simple notice published on the ship to 
inform the public that the carrier does not have insurance.  The 
government does not want to do that.  Just about anybody in 
industry who provides a service to the public is required to 
provide warnings and notices, but the government in its wisdom 
says it does not want to do that.  Why inform the public?  Why 
inform passengers when they are getting on a ship that there is 
no insurance on the ship?  Why inform them that the ship may be 
insolvent, that if it goes under there is not going to be any 
protection for anyone? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a lot of ways the government's response to these amendments 
is shameful. 
The day a disaster happens and this thing crops up, the folks on 
the other side of the House will have to hang their heads in 
shame and try to justify why they ignored this very simple 
amendment to the legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When our constituents voted for us to come to the House of 
Commons, one of the skills they asked us to have is foresight. We 
develop public policy in the House.  We pass laws.  The folks who 
sent us here expect us to have foresight.  I think we have 
anticipated a serious problem here.  We have tried to use 
foresight.  The opposition parties have tried to used foresight. 
The government has ignored very real legitimate concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is typical of a Liberal government.  A Liberal government, 
as has been said before, likes to drive in the middle of the 
road.  However, when we drive in the middle of the road we run 
into a lot of yellow stripes and skunks.  The Liberal government 
likes driving in the middle of the road.  It likes that 
neighbourhood.  I guess it is called compromise.  The Liberals 
will put some things in the Shipping Act, but not others.  As one 
of my colleagues said, it is like Liberals making porridge.  If 
one mixes some sand in the porridge, it may look like porridge, 
it might even smell like porridge and it might taste like 
porridge, but it will be hard to swallow and it will be hard on 
the digestive system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Folks on the government side have the power to do things the 
right way.  Why do they not do it?  Why do they always insist on 
going only halfway?  In this case they could have gone the full 
way and addressed some really key areas the opposition raised. It 
was not just the Alliance people who raised this issue.  The 
Progressive Conservative member brought it to the attention of 
the government, as did the Bloc member and the NDP member.  We 
all tried to work on constructive ways of solving this, but the 
Liberals just would not listen.  We gave the Liberals two 
opportunities last night to address this problem in a certain way 
and they would not do it.  Why?  Is it a sign of arrogance or 
what?  They were two very constructive proposals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will summarize the Alliance position.  The bill is an 
improvement over the existing policy, but I wish the government 
had gone the full nine yards on this thing and addressed some 
serious concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last night we went through the motions and got platitudes for 
the sake of public image.  If a disaster happens in the country, 
everybody comes to the House.  If the people want safe water, 
bang, the government will pass something in the House:  magically 
in this land from coast to coast our water will be safe because 
we passed that bill last night.  We know how unreal that is and 
how unrealistic.  We cannot manage by dictating results.  It 
takes work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last night we proposed to the government ways of managing 
something to get the results we want, which is safer vessels and 
good protection for the travelling public, and the government 
chose to ignore us.  Some day when there is a disaster in our 
country in commercial passenger travel, government members will 
be held to account for it.  They have an obligation and a duty in 
the House to pass good laws, not incomplete laws.  They have 
failed to do that.

ensuring that the needs and wishes of taxpayers, waterway users

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am saying is important and it is important that those 
listening understand how, because of the government's arrogance 
and pressure from political lobbies, a good bill can be turned 
into a mere improvement on the existing system, which I feel was 
rotten to the core to begin with.  For decades, people have been 
asking that the legislation be changed to make sea carriers 
responsible, and that is what the people wanted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, part 2 of the bill in its premisses, deals with the 
“Apportionment of Liability”, which has to do with personal 
injuries and fatalities. What the bill states in clauses 4 to 14 
is that this allows the dependants of a person injured or killed 
in a marine accident to claim damages. This is a situation that 
exists in Quebec at least. The legislation was changed and the 
civil code was changed accordingly. Laws are made in such a way 
that people responsible for damage must compensate for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 2 of the bill says that in the apportionment of liability, 
once it has been established that the person causing the damage 
is liable, there is the principle—which is still a principle of 
common law in the other provinces, but a principle of civil law 
in Quebec—that if several persons or ships were liable, the 
liability of each one would be proportionate to the degree of 
fault. But if the degree of fault could not be established 
their liability would be equal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are principles of law which are well understood now. In 
law, the standard is always the reasonable person standard, that 
is, how a reasonable person would manage as a prudent 
administrator and ensure that equity and common sense prevail in 
any situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, if someone causes damages, logically that person is 
liable and if two ships or pieces of equipment are damaged, their 
liability, when it can be established, is proportionate to the 
degree to which they are respectively at fault. When it is not 
possible to establish who is at fault they are jointly and 
severally liable for the damages they caused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under part 4, liability is defined as “liability for carriage of 
passengers by water”. Therefore, a whole part of the bill deals 
with the public. It would be normal for someone travelling by 
ship, if that person  were to suffer personal injuries—which 
would be rather unpleasant for that person—but also loss of 
luggage—which is a rather regular occurrence—to be compensated 
for the damages suffered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 4 of the bill sets as a principle that persons using 
carriage by water will be compensated for personal damages and 
for lost luggage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately under clause 39 of this fine bill, the governor in 
council may require those responsible to get insurance. This is 
where the rub is; this is where we see the arrogance of the 
government yielding to the pressures of political lobbies, big 
shipping companies, and those who would have to get insurance to 
cover liability for damages caused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday in the House we saw the party in power defeat 
amendments whereby parties were asking that those involved in the 
carriage by water of passengers be required to carry insurance to 
cover liability for damages caused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only too easy these days to set up a numbered company and 
register a ship under it, thus avoiding getting insurance. When 
one is responsible for damages one is sued. Those who could have 
collected damages will get nothing because the company is 
insolvent or bankrupt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We tried to make this point in committee. One must realize that 
the shipowner lobby is very powerful and is a main contributor to 
the campaign funds of several members of parliament.  This big 
lobby was successful in conveying the message that the time had 
not yet come to impose an obligation to carry liability 
insurance on all those whose business it is is to carry passengers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is difficult to understand all the more so when officials 
from the Department of Transport appeared before the committee 
and told us that the insurance industry would not be able to 
support—if the industry ever had to do it—the whole new 
economic burden, all the new demands there could be and all the 
obligations that passenger carriers could have. Apparently it 
was too big a job. They are not able to integrate into their 
insurance system the supplementary demands that that legislative 
amendment would entail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the committee do as a good manager of public 
interests? We asked that some insurance industry representatives 
appear before the committee. All the industry representatives had 
a good laugh at the officials' answer that the insurance industry 
was unable to accommodate the supplementary volume of business 
that arises as a result of the obligation for those who carry 
passengers and their luggage to get insurance and provide 
compensation for damages. For the insurance industry this can be 
done very easily. That can be integrated very quickly. The 
industry already insures much of shipowners' fleet that carries 
passengers and there would be no problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This explains why amendments have been moved by the Canadian 
Alliance and the New Democratic Party. Believe it or not, all 
these amendments have been rejected by the government party. One 
of these amendments went as far as to say, in essence “Listen, 
if we think the industry, which says today it can integrate 
this, does not want to do it, let us delay implementation until 
2003 so that starting on January 1, 2003 insurance will be 
compulsory”. Well, this has also been rejected by the government 
party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some things are hard to understand. 
This is a very good example of a bill that purports to be 
perfectly logical so that all the users, all our good citizens 
who pay taxes and travel by ship for leisure or for work, can be 
insured, just like they are when they travel by plane, bus, 
coach, city bus, metro, train, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no insurance for carriage of passengers by water. The 
government has introduced a bill that could have been excellent. 
Admittedly, it is an improvement. 
Previously marine carriers were not liable. The government 
decided to put them on an equal footing with other passenger 
transport industries and said “From the date this bill takes 
effect marine carriers will be liable for injuries to 
individuals, users and passengers and for luggage lost”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I want to warn all Canadians, and Quebecers in 
particular, that before they get on board a ship they should 
ensure that the carrier has insurance coverage, because in its 
wisdom the federal government has decided not to force marine 
carriers to take insurance. If they do business with a carrier 
that does not have any insurance, that started its operation as 
a numbered company and that goes bankrupt, then their 
families will 
get no compensation at all if they should happen to die in an 
accident. 
If they are injured or if their luggage is lost, they will get no 
compensation under this great piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, this started as an interesting bill, but lobbyists 
managed to put so much pressure on this arrogant government that 
it finally brought forward amendments that make it very 
difficult to get any compensation for losses suffered in an 
accident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the only change and the only interpretation made to 
please the lobbyists and to show how arrogant the government can 
be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sixth part of this bill deals with liability for pollution. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT29"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT29"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1620

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is indeed an improvement. As I said before, the Bloc 
Quebecois will support it since, in our opinion, half a loaf is 
better than no loaf. The fact is that with regard to pollution 
this bill is based on the principle that all those who cause 
damages will be held responsible and will have to compensate 
those who incur such damages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be understood that the government had the sense to 
include in the bill a list of those who could incur damages 
other than environmental damages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thinking, for instance, of those who earn a living from 
fishing, from fish farming or from water plant growing, owners 
of fishing vessels and fish processing plant workers in Canada 
who suffer a loss of current or future income or a loss of 
supply as the result of a discharge of oil from a ship. They may 
now be compensated by a special fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members understand that the government had to act 
because of pressures coming from all those who wanted something 
done in terms of liability and compensation for pollution. There 
were pressures from the industry, from those who rely on sea 
products to earn a living, from all those people who could or 
did incur damages. 
If they incurred damages in the past, they are asking, as would 
be the case in any industry, that the party responsible be 
required to provide compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For compensation, a fund is being established and managed by the 
Government of Canada. For each metric ton of oil carried by 
ship, a certain amount is paid into this compensation fund, 
which is managed by the Government of Canada. Believe it or not, 
these amounts are the same as those that were negotiated in the 
1990 international agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, following pressure by shipowners, the influential 
members of our society, primarily politically influential by 
means of the campaign funds of our colleagues opposite, they 
managed to say to them “Now that you are requiring us to 
compensate people who were not compensated before and are 
clarifying the law, what we need to know now is the extent of 
the damages”.  The shipowners did not need to be made too 
liable.  They did not want costs to rise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money paid into this compensation fund is the same as in 
1990 and is indexed. 
The indexing is expected but does not include the increase in 
the cost of energy.  Finally, most of the text on liability and 
compensation in the case of pollution covers primarily oil 
pollution, according to what is in the bill.  Imagine, an 
industry in the business of carrying oil and oil carriers pay 
into the compensation fund.  The money is contributed according 
to a formula dating from 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the same amounts as were contributed in 1990.  They 
are indexed according to the cost of living but not the cost of 
energy.  These people live from energy, and we know very well 
that the increase in the cost of living over the past three 
years was due primarily to the increase in the cost of energy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They managed to convince the government that it would be a good 
idea to index the 1990 amounts but to ignore the main factor in 
the increase in the cost of living, that is energy costs. Once 
energy costs are excluded there is almost no increase. The cost 
of living has practically not gone up since 1990, if energy costs 
are not taken into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is once again a perfect example of a very interesting bill 
aimed at compensating people who depend on sea products for their 
livelihood, who could sustain damages as the result of an oil 
spill caused by oil carriers. Compensation will now be provided 
through a special fund to which corporations and shipowners 
contribute. The amount they contribute, however, is the same 
amount they were paying into a similar fund in 1990. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1625"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This fund had been adopted in many parts of the hemisphere to 
provide compensation to people sustaining damages. Shipowners 
have been paying the same amount since 1990. The amounts are the 
same, but the liabilities have increased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our main question, the one I have asked the government 
representatives is this: Will there be enough money to compensate 
everyone? The answer was “Yes, there is no problem. We are 
talking about $100 million, which is enough”. In an ecological 
disaster $100 million is nothing, particularly if all the 
industries and sea products in one part of the country are 
affected. This amount is nothing. 
It is a drop of fresh water in an ocean of salted water. This is 
what this may represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again we are getting lip service from the government, a 
nice bill that is an improvement.  The industry is being made 
liable for damages it might cause but the industry does not want 
to suffer too much economically; we have to be careful, it does 
not make enough money as it is. Canadian shipowners are allowed 
to do business in foreign countries. For example, in Barbados, 
they can manage businesses and through agreements signed by the 
Government of Canada they pay only 1% in taxes on all the 
income they may earn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is allowed; it is in agreements. The Bloc Quebecois has 
asked the government in this House to deal with this now 
ironic situation of businesses moving to the islands. 
This example is a concrete one. This is an agreement the 
Government of Canada has signed with the Government of Barbados, 
allowing for capital transfers, allowing Canadian businesses to 
have ships registered in Barbados and to pay only 1% in taxes on 
their profits. This is the reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, in a bill to make them responsible for damages 
resulting from an accident, a failure or an environmental oil 
disaster, they are told “Not only are you responsible, but you 
are to compensate all those who make a living in the fishing 
industry. The only thing is that there is a limit on 
compensations that may be paid by businesses”. They contribute 
to a fund. They pay a given amount for each metric ton carried 
by sea.  They use barrels.  The amount has been the same since 1990. 
As I said earlier, there is a cost of living adjustment that 
does not include the energy costs when we all know that these 
companies rely on energy in fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have here is another example of a very interesting bill 
designed to protect the interests of all Quebecers and all 
Canadians, but with this arrogant government and its huge 
majority that always sides with the shipowners' lobby, I am sure 
members will agree with me that this will probably just be 
wishful thinking. I do not wish for an ecological disaster that 
will make it blatantly clear that the compensation fund is 
underfunded. That is not what I wish for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 7 of the bill validates among other things the Pilotage Act 
and the 1992 Laurentian pilotage tariff regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canadian or foreign ships enter the waters of the St. 
Lawrence Seaway system they are taken care of by expert pilots 
who are members of various organizations and associations. In 
this case, it is the Laurentian Pilotage Authority. We also have 
the St. Lawrence Pilotage Authority and the Great Lakes Pilotage 
Authority. There are about 400 to 500 pilots, men and women, who 
take care of the ships plying the St. Lawrence Seaway, to avoid 
any natural disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For several years now lobbyists for shipowners have been trying 
to decimate these pilotage authorities by systematically urging 
the government to review the legislation and allow their own 
pilots to take over from these specialists in the St. Lawrence 
Seaway system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this bill, the government had a wonderful opportunity to 
finally put an end to all the hesitation and discussions on the 
future of the St. Lawrence Seaway pilots, who are members of 
various associations.  It was a wonderful opportunity for the 
government to resolve this endless debate, which has led these 
people, these men and women, to live in a constant state of 
insecurity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They call us and they call members of the opposition to say 
that once again the shipowners and the government are 
exchanging letters and documents because of the additional 
costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government can refuse to make a cost of living adjustment 
to the sums invested since 1990 in the compensation fund, it can 
easily decide to abolish all the associations and the very 
principle of having St. Lawrence Seaway pilots, people who 
protect us from serious disasters such as a fuel spill in the 
St. Lawrence, that estuary which flows into the Great Lakes. One 
must be careful about this, because some people have been wrong 
about which way the water in our rivers and lakes flows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, it was a wonderful opportunity for the government 
to put an end, once and for all, to all the shilly-shallying 
about the usefulness of pilots, those experts on the St. 
Lawrence Seaway. I repeat that these pilots take charge of ships 
as soon as they enter the St. Lawrence Seaway. 
They take charge of them and take them to the Great Lakes, to 
their destination. This is still our best safety measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not the only country in the world that uses expert 
pilots. They do it in the United States on the Mississippi. They 
also do it in Europe. In fact, in all countries where there are 
large estuaries, tributaries or rivers with very specific 
characteristics, there is a system of expert pilots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are being told today that there are all kinds of 
technological inventions that can be used to pilot these ships 
without human involvement. However, the reality is very 
different. No machine can replace humans. If that had been 
possible, machines would have replaced humans long ago in the 
House.  That is not the case. Machines have still not invaded 
this place and I do not foresee the day where they will, the way 
things are going now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the hard reality facing a government that, once more, is 
seeking to improve legislation but has failed to give what they 
want to stakeholders who depend on shipping for their livelihood, 
for leisure or spare time activities. This is what is so 
difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We realize how arrogant the government is when, 
because of its strong majority, it will not even listen to 
interesting advice given by the opposition, to interesting 
questions it asked in committee. For example, when we asked 
questions of representatives of the insurance industry, they said 
“There is no problem”. 
Tomorrow, if we make the system mandatory, that is not a 
problem.  It does not raise the premiums and the cost will be 
less than a person pays for home insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They gave us an example of an 85 passenger ship for which the 
premium would be $1,600.  That is the cost of the insurance. 
That is the reality.  That is what the insurance industry 
spokespersons told us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tomorrow morning, if the decision is made to make insurance 
mandatory for all those who carry passengers, this will not 
increase premiums across Canada.  The industry is very much 
capable of handling it.  It has already done some market 
analyses and the actuarial studies are all ready as well.  It 
already has part of this market, since it provides coverage to 
part of the industry.  That is not a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again the government decided, in response to pressures 
from various lobby groups, to take a step backward.  In dealing 
with a bill, especially one in the shipping sector and 
entitled an act respecting marine liability and to validate 
certain bylaws and regulations, the orientation must be to make 
people liable for certain things.  In addition to imposing 
responsibility upon them, they must be required to adhere to 
certain standards.

been a very good opportunity to settle the future of the 
St. Lawrence Seaway Management Corporation, which has been 
operating the 13 locks along the St. Lawrence Seaway for some 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has therefore been operated by an independent authority, in 
connection with which there has been a transfer agreement 
indicating that all five year plans must be reported to the 
government, through Transport Canada.  From the security aspect, 
it is also required to administer the locks and marine traffic 
on the St. Lawrence Seaway.  It is also required to ensure its 
safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 1, 2000, in  St. Catharines, a 70 year old 
woman lost her life simply because she decided to cross a 
bridge that was being raised to give way to marine traffic. She 
did not have time to cross, panicked, fell into the mechanism and 
died. That was on June 1, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On July 28, 2000, without waiting for the coroner's 
report, because obviously such a violent death calls for a 
coroner's inquest, the St. Lawrence Seaway Management Corporation 
decided unilaterally, apparently for financial and safety 
reasons, to tell its employees working at its 13 locks in Canada 
that starting with the 2001 season, which is now under way, 
it would reduce staff at all locks. The number of employees would 
be reduced from three to two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a directive from the St. Lawrence Seaway Management 
Corporation to its employees. Some permanent employees and some 
temporary employees were affected. Termination notices were sent 
to them to say that their contract would not be renewed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The coroner's report was released on October 17, 2000. Of course 
it criticized certain facilities at the  St.Catharines 
lock but also made the comment that there should be four 
employees, not three, on every shift at that location. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who work at a lock are mostly involved in tying down and 
control activities. Control is necessary because there are many 
tourists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those like recreational boaters who use the 
locks. There are also all those who go for a walk and watch 
the boats. They should be monitored. To prevent accidents like 
the one that happened to this lady in her 70s, people should be 
kept at a fair distance from the facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is a problem with a ship it has to be moored. There 
are cables and mooring bitts. This is done manually. The machine 
to do this automatically has not been invented yet. There has to 
be people alongside of the locks to moor ships, especially in 
case one would break down. Navigation locks are not used only by 
small recreational crafts. There are also huge oil tankers that 
share the seaway with these crafts. If one of them were to break 
down, experienced people are needed on shore to hold and move the 
others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the reason why the coroner made this recommendation. 
Obviously the St. Lawrence Seaway Management Corporation<B> </B>was 
not pleased. At first it said this was a bad report by the 
coroner, as if it were possible to have good and bad coroner 
reports. When there is an accident a report is written. The 
coroner examines the occurrence from the point of view of 
security and tries to find ways to prevent it from happening 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the recommendations was to have four people instead of 
three at the locks in St. Catherines. I am raising this because it 
has an impact, because of the guideline issued by the management 
corporation. If affects the safety of all 13 locks along the St. 
Lawrence Seaway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since it deals with liability, compensation and definitely 
safety and since making people accountable forces them to act more 
safely, this bill would have been a good opportunity to deal once 
and for all with the need to have the required staff at the locks 
along the St. Lawrence Seaway in order to avoid a repeat of the 
situation experienced on June 1 of last year by this lady in her 
70s.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We tabled a letter in committee but that letter was not 
received by government officials for all sorts of reasons. 
Nothing that comes from the opposition is ever good, apparently, 
but the government should realize that when we take initiatives 
in the interest of our constituents, of Quebecers and Canadians, 
it is always good. This is the logic that should guide this 
House, not political interests and lobbies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recommended that the Standing Committee on Transport hear 
officials from the management corporation, the officials from 
Transport Canada who were involved in the inquiry, and workers' 
representatives. They tried to make us backtrack by saying that 
this was a labour relations issue. I must say that none of the 
employees who were notified lost his or her job; they were all 
relocated elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is not workers' interests but the safety of the 
public, of the boaters and tourists who use the 13 locks along 
the St. Lawrence Seaway. The Bloc Quebecois cares about these 
people. Each member of each party in this House should care about 
these people, not about shipowners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with the St. Lawrence Seaway Management Corporation 
is that it charges a fee to ships entering the locks. Of course 
costs are increasing and shipowners do not want to pay more. 
These shipowners are asking the management corporation they are 
part of that fees be reduced, that staff be cut back. Instead of 
listening to the coroner, who says that the staff should be 
increased from three to four at the St. Catharines locks, and it 
would be the same at the 13 locks along the St. Lawrence Seaway, 
the corporation says it will cut back because there are costs 
involved. The concern is not safety but fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, fees have doubled for pleasure craft owners while 
they have been reduced by 40% for shipowners. This is the 
reality. The shipowners' lobby is taking control of political 
organizations. Finally, they know how this works; they know where 
the campaign funds are and how parliament works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For us, the representatives of the community, it is hard to see 
situations such as these and to be prevented in committee to hear 
at least the seaway management corporation and to ask it: “How 
did you decide to cut back on staff? Why was the staff cut back 
when we have a coroner's report saying this is dangerous, this is 
not safe and the staff should be increased and not cut back?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat that this is not a problem of labour relations. The 
permanent employees have all been relocated. This is not the 
problem. The problem is discussing safety. This bill could have 
been a wonderful opportunity to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill purports to be a bill on marine liability. 
I repeat, responsibility means that if one is responsible 
safety must be improved so that damage and accidents do not 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the presentation I made on this particular issue there was a 
letter from a pilot dated November 11, 2000.  This pilot entered 
the lock at St. Catharines; he had engine trouble and could no 
longer stop because he could not reverse. He had to warn the 
stevedores “I am without power. I am drifting toward you.  You 
must stop me.  Bring the equipment”.  They managed to stop him, 
but if they had not the ship would have destroyed everything in 
its path.  As he says in the letter he wrote to his union, “If 
there had been only two of them there, I would have destroyed 
everything in front of me”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the reality of the situation.  This happened in November 
and it will perhaps happen in the middle of July. I for one, as 
an MP, would have made the House aware that such situations could 
have been avoided if parliament had assumed its responsibilities 
and included in bills such as the one on marine liability 
provisions making the St. Lawrence Seaway Management Corporation 
liable for lock safety.  If that had been done, they would 
certainly have taken less draconian measures than they have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a business decision to reduce costs for shipowners, for 
whom the lives of lock workers or those watching boats or 
pleasure craft do not matter anyway.  What matters is the money 
they make and put into their pocket and on which they pay only 
1% in taxes, because they are registered to Barbados; they are 
part of a company flying the flag of Barbados. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the reality of the situation in Canada. This is why many 
citizens, many Quebecers, no longer believe in the Canadian 
system.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have lost the credibility we had probably earned over the 
last 100 years.  Why?  It is because for the past 15 years political 
lobbies have taken over this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  It is my duty, pursuant 
to Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the question to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows: the hon. 
member for New Brunswick Southwest, National Defence. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it 
is a great pleasure to make a few remarks on the marine liability 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we support the bill and would advocate its speedy passage 
in the House of Commons.  As a layman in the field, I am somewhat 
astounded that such a bill is necessary at this time.  As a 
Canadian citizen, I take for granted that I have to carry 
liability insurance if I want to operate a motor vehicle, be that 
vehicle the family car or local school bus.  As a Canadian, I 
take for granted that tractor trailers full of freight are fully 
insured, especially regarding liability insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no such assurances if one is a passenger on a ship or 
is shipping goods overseas.  Bill S-2 would consolidate various 
existing marine liability regimes.  It would incorporate certain 
international conventions on marine liability into Canadian law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-2 is long overdue.  Canada is playing catch up with its 
trading partners on this issue.  We support speedy passage of the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the substantive aspects of the bill is part 4.  It 
concerns the long overdue adoption into Canadian law of the 
Athens convention relating to carriage by sea of passengers and 
their luggage.  The convention sets forth an internationally 
accepted comprehensive liability regime for injuries and loss of 
life by passengers.  We support that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Existing Canadian legislation deals only with global limitation 
of liability for maritime claims.  Part 4 of Bill S-2 sets out 
the basis upon which liability for passengers may be established. 
The new regime would apply to both domestic and international 
carriage of passengers by ship, and accordingly would finally 
bring Canadian law into line with that of our trading partners. 
We support that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also sets out a new regime for apportioning liability 
for maritime claims where the blame falls on more than one person 
or vessel.  It clarifies what at present is a very confusing area 
of Canadian law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another area of the bill that is good.  Part 1 of Bill 
S-2 confirms that claims for wrongful death and injury could be 
made against persons as well as ships.  It would enable relatives 
of deceased or injured to claim for loss of care and 
companionship.  Otherwise, part 1 would generally re-enact the 
fatal accidents provision of the existing Canada Shipping Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One change that sparked debate in committee was the provision of 
clause 46 that would extend Canada's legal jurisdiction to deal 
with the cargo claims of Canada's importers and exporters. 
Representatives of the shipping lines did not want Canadian 
jurisdiction specified, preferring instead to have clauses on 
arbitration and judicial proceedings in their contracts of 
carriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed a culture has grown up that sees most of these disputes 
resolved in British boardrooms and British courts.  That suits 
the big shipping lines and the British legal profession just 
fine.  However I would submit that a small Canadian exporter 
would be badly outclassed going up against the big boys in that 
kind of a setting, so we are supportive of asserting Canadian 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Left to themselves, the big boys as they are called, used to 
insert clauses into their carriage contracts denying liability 
for loss of goods, or life or limb. 
Such liability exemptions are no longer allowed in France, the 
United Kingdom or the United States.  Bill S-2 now forbids the 
opting out of liability in Canada, putting us more in sync with 
our trading partners.  We are pleased that clause 39 of the bill 
would allow the minister to introduce regulations making marine 
liability insurance compulsory.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was some disagreement among stakeholders as to whether or 
not liability insurance should be compulsory.  Some committee 
witnesses said it would take time to set up a more comprehensive 
system.  They indicated that there was currently no system in 
place in this nation for licensing vessels to carry less than 12 
passengers.  However once the provisions of the new Canada 
Shipping Act currently before the House are enacted, there will 
be a consolidation of all commercial vessels under the Department 
of Transport and all pleasure craft under the Department of 
Fisheries and Oceans.  I can see licensing for all these vessels 
coming and insurance cannot be that far behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assume bank financing and provincial tourism rules might 
require small tour boat operators to carry liability insurance, 
but I still feel a little uncomfortable with the fact that the 
insurance at this point in time is not compulsory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Passenger Vessel Association wrote me recently to 
indicate that it favoured compulsory liability insurance to 
protect itself, its passengers and the reputation of the Canadian 
tourism industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to indicate to the minister and the parliamentary 
secretary who is here today that we do support the bill.  All in 
all it is a good bill.  It is long overdue.  It is worthy of 
support. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
want to commend my colleagues from the Alliance and the Bloc for 
the excellent presentations they gave on the bill.  I know that a 
lot of what each of them said and what I will say will be 
repetitious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a committee, we had to repeat over and over again the 
seriousness of the lack of mandatory insurance in the bill.  We 
got absolutely nowhere with the governing side of the committee. 
Therefore, it is only fitting that we should repeat it again. 
Hopefully this time a good number of Canadians will hear this and 
will be as equally upset as we are over the government's failure 
to ensure that there is mandatory liability insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from the Progressive Conservative Party said the 
party would be supporting the bill.  My initial critic 
recommendations were pretty much the same as in the previous 
parliament when we dealt with this bill.  Then because of the 
feelings of the Prime Minister that it was time for an election 
everything was dropped.  However, the bill is back again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Previously my critic recommendation ended with suggesting we 
support the bill.  There were a lot a good changes.  There was a 
comprehensive view of this bill amalgamating a number of issues 
that related to marine liability. It was very positive.  The 
number of people involved in the industry were supportive, and 
there had been co-operation in coming up with the bill.  I would 
have supported it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However something happened this time around.  I guess that is 
the benefit of having to redo things sometimes.  As a committee, 
we listened to a transport official who told us the insurance 
industry could not handle putting in place mandatory liability 
insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people do not realize what happens within the passenger 
carrying industry and a good part of it is the tourism industry 
in Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know we are not supposed to point out who is not here, but I 
was really pleased that the Minister of Industry listened to a 
lot of this debate.  He must be aware that a lot of the 
passengers are carried within the Canadian marine tourist 
industry and that there is no liability insurance for those 
passengers, only if it is a responsible carrier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also glad to see that the Canadian Passenger Vessel 
Association supports mandatory liability insurance.  It is fully 
aware that until liability insurance is made mandatory, it will 
not be found throughout the industry.  However, if carriers do 
not have insurance, the tourist industry has a lot at stake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We register our cars, we get our drivers' licences and we get 
insurance.  A good number of us probably pay approximately $2,000 
a year for car insurance.  At the most we can probably carry a 
maximum of five passengers in our vehicles.  For $2,000 we can 
drive every day and probably put thousands of kilometres on our 
car every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tourist buses have liability insurance.  Airplanes have 
liability insurance.  Helicopters have liability insurance.  I am 
sure the bus lines, the little buggies in Churchill, Manitoba 
that take people out to see the polar bears, probably have to 
have liability insurance.  The rail lines also have liability 
insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However do boats that tour the Great Lakes in Ontario have to 
have insurance?  No, they do not.  Why do they not have to have 
insurance?  Because the Liberal side of the House said that it 
was not needed.  It does not care if there are accidents.  The 
Liberals do not care if the owners of the boats have liability 
insurance.  If someone wants to sue the person can sue.  The 
Liberals will not ensure that shipowners have insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each and every one of those members of that committee felt it 
was necessary and that the regulations would come.  They thought 
it was necessary but they did not put it in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we do when we get a piece of legislation and we know 
there is a problem with it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was recognized that there was a problem and that the act 
respecting marine liability should be fixed.  How many years has 
it been since it was worked on?  It has been a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have this bill and we recognize that something is 
still missing.  We should be fixing it now.  It is before the 
House.  We should not wait for ten years down the road.  We 
should not wait until there is another accident like the one that 
took place on Georgian Bay in Ontario.  There was no liability 
insurance.  The legislation is before the House.  Now is the time 
to fix it, not five or ten years down the road.  That is simply 
bad business.  That is doing a bad job at what we are here to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be different if we did not know about it.  I admit the 
last time around I did not know about it and I was going to 
accept it.  However not this time around.  It is a serious 
mistake that not to include this in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who are at risk are the people who will get on board 
the tourist boats this summer.  Those tourist boats do not have 
liability insurance nor do other boats that carry people in our 
inland waterways.  Anyone crossing the ocean will be covered. 
That is not a problem.  However in Canada there will no be 
coverage because the Liberal side of this House said there would 
be none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was one time in that committee where every member of the 
opposition tried their darndest to make sure it was put in this 
bill.  We do not often agree on a lot of things on this side of 
the House, but this was one area that we thought was serious 
enough because the welfare of Canadians could be jeopardized.  It 
would not hurt the industry because there was no real great cost 
to the industry, as my hon. colleague from the Bloc mentioned. 
It would cost a 100 to 150 passenger boat less than $2,000.  For 
an 80 passenger boat, it would cost $1,600 a year.  That is less 
than we would pay for car insurance.  How is that going to hurt 
the industry? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The saddest part is we listened to transport officials tell us 
that the insurance industry could not handle it.  That was a 
bunch of malarkey because the insurance industry could handle it. 
What is put in question is the information that came from the 
transport officials who appeared before committee.  I will never 
trust them again.  It was just garbage which was supported by 
that side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was extremely disappointing for me to hear member after 
member on the Liberal side say they know they have to change the 
legislation and that it will come.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When?  When is it going to come?  How many pieces of legislation 
has the Liberal government said it would bring forward to deal 
with issues in the country?  It never does anything about them. 
It is all promises, promises, and the government never comes up 
with the legislation or it drags it out time and time again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an area that should not be dragged out.  There is 
absolutely no excuse for not including mandatory liability 
insurance in the legislation.  My hon. colleague from the 
Alliance Party put forth an amendment saying we would give the 
government time and it could put in the bill that this would be 
put in place by 2003.  That is reasonable.  All the Liberal 
members said it will be coming.  The parliamentary secretary sat 
there and said it will be coming because the government knows it 
is necessary and it will come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the Alliance Party put the amendment saying to give 
the industry until 2003.  Committee witnesses said the insurance 
industry could already handle it, that it would not be a problem. 
However, what happened last night in the House?  The Liberal side 
of the House voted it down and said no, the government would not 
give that to us by 2003. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party put forth an amendment, saying that if 
we will not have mandatory liability insurance, carriers should 
at least post a notice because passengers have a right to know. 
What happened last night in the House?  The Liberal side of the 
House voted it down, saying in effect that there will be no 
liability insurance and that the government will not be telling 
Canadians there is no liability insurance.  There are very few 
Canadians who realize that carriers do not have liability 
insurance.  They expect that carriers do.  They think carriers 
do.  They expect that because that is good legislation and good 
business.  Based on that expectation, they are jeopardizing their 
welfare because they trust us to do the job we should be doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From this moment on, with this not in the legislation, I will go 
out of my way to make sure the message gets out throughout the 
country so that people know they do not necessarily have 
liability insurance.  The Liberals had an opportunity to correct 
the mistake and they have blown it.  They did not fix it.  As a 
result I think there is an onus on each and every one of us to 
make sure that each and every Canadian knows there may be no 
liability insurance on a passenger carrier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are good passenger carriers out there.  I would say that a 
majority of them carry insurance.  However, it is like anything. 
Those that do not are the problem.  More than likely they are the 
ones that are not necessarily the safest carriers.  That is why 
it is an issue.  We know that good, responsible businesses carry 
liability insurance.  However, what did the Liberal government 
say about those who do not?  It said that they do not have to 
post a waiver or let anyone know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an onus on each and every one of us to let people know. 
Not only will it affect Canadians but anyone else who has come to 
our country and who is travelling on a boat when something 
happens.  Sure they could go through a civil liability suit, but 
I wish them luck.  If a boat with 80 passengers went down, how 
many of us think that owner would have enough personal insurance 
to cover anything?  How many houses or cars would he or she have 
to sell off?  There would not be enough to cover it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the sake of $1,600 or $2,000 a year the Liberal government 
is willing to jeopardize an industry, because it will have an 
impact on the entire industry once the message gets out that 
there is no insurance.  It is a serious problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I especially want the people in Ontario to hear this, because 
that is where the majority of those members on that side of the 
House come from.  I will wager that the greatest amount of 
passenger lake travel takes place in Ontario.  Those members are 
in the group that has said to people in Ontario that they do not 
need liability insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would like to encourage all the carriers out there to 
do the good and honest thing, to do the right thing morally, and 
make sure they carry liability insurance.  Second, all those who 
do carry it should let their passengers know they do so that then 
they can question the next carrier, which may not have it.

happened last night?  All the little ducks got in a row again and 
did not even think about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should have been at least a thought.  When there is an 
Alliance motion and an NDP motion looking for the same thing, it 
has to be a big enough issue.  It has to be important enough to 
the opposition parties if they are trying to address the same 
problem.   At least that should have flagged for the Liberal 
members that they had better pay more attention to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was extremely pleased today to hear the strong comments of my 
colleague from the Bloc.  He mentioned a lot of other areas that 
are of concern.  From my perspective those issues did not come 
into the discussion when we dealt with it the last time.  I 
recognize, the member being from Quebec, that his concern over 
the seaway is great and rightfully so.  The Alliance member spoke 
very strongly on this as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to admit I was disappointed in the Conservative member, 
who had said his party would support it.  Actually I had the 
impression that he may have thought there was liability insurance 
just down the road.  Maybe he did not realize that last night the 
government voted no and that even by 2003 we will not see it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the members in the House that this was one of those 
times when they needed to pay attention to that legislation.  For 
those from Ontario, I absolutely hope that they are not in a 
situation where they are chewing on this legislation later on, 
because somewhere down the road somebody will not have insurance 
and be passengers will be affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would encourage those members and say to them that the 
government can, under regulation, put this in place.  It can make 
sure there is mandatory insurance.  I would hope that members on 
this side will put pressure on so that it does come out in 
regulation.  I would also hope that the Liberals on that side 
take a good look at it and push for that regulation, because 
there is no question that those who will be at the greatest risk 
will probably be people of the province of Ontario because of the 
inland waterways and the numbers of passengers.  Certainly it 
will affect all provinces without question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to the people of Ontario, I listened to the transport 
minister make a comment one time that had something to do with 
the toll roads, that people voted in Liberals so they would get 
toll roads.  It was a comment like that, indicating that people 
voted for the Liberals and if the Liberals think this is the way 
it should go this is the way it will go.  I guess that is it:  if 
we vote in Liberals we get bad legislation.  That is what we have 
here.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak to Bill S-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate my colleague from 
Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel who spoke earlier this afternoon. 
I want to tell him how much I appreciated his comments and how 
true I found them to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I believe once again is serious. I believe it is a sad 
thing to see this government introduce bill after bill dealing 
with a very specific problem. The idea is good, but as soon as 
the opposition parties bring forward amendments to improve the 
bill the government says nothing and refers the matter to the 
parliamentary secretary. As far as he is concerned, everything 
coming from the opposition has to be dealt with in a very 
negative way. This is a serious problem.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This afternoon I listened to Alliance members and the member 
for the New Democratic Party. As I had not debated this bill, it 
gave me an idea of what should have been included in it. 
Listening to the opposition parties does not mean one is an 
idiot, but rather it shows that one is intelligent. They had good 
ideas, they were on the right track, but they stopped halfway 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stopping halfway is serious because this bill deals with a 
particular problem. We do not rewrite the 
same laws every year, I believe they are made to last a few 
years. 
Why stop halfway in dealing with a problem that really had to be 
addressed in order to have, in the end, something tangible and 
forward looking? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that, as my colleague was saying, this government is 
arrogant. It is not a word to be used lightly, but I am sorry to 
say that this government is indeed arrogant. We were all elected 
by the people we represent. They told us to represent them, 
hoping we would pass on to the government their wishes and their 
suggestions for a better society. I see that they did not get the 
message, or if they did they did not understand it. It is very 
sad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we are all people of goodwill, whether we belong to the 
Canadian Alliance, the NDP, the Progressive Conservative Party or 
the Bloc Quebecois. Sometimes I wonder if the Liberal government 
has the same goodwill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is too bad that we just had an election because Canadians 
already feel that this government is not listening to them. It 
has been only five or six months since it was elected. Imagine 
how out of touch it will be in three or four years. We will have 
passed bills that will have done nothing for the advancement of 
Quebec and Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill dealing with marine liability validates certain 
bylaws and regulations. It was introduced in the Senate on 31, 
January 2001. Current Canadian legislation relating to the marine 
mode of transportation includes several regimes governing the 
liability of domestic and foreign shipowners and shippers, and 
their responsibility for damage to property, environment, or loss 
of life or injury to others during maritime activity and 
therefore dealing with the economic and legal consequences of 
maritime accidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environment is an issue that is very important to me and I 
will be addressing several parts of this bill that are related to 
it in various ways. I will finally get the opportunity to talk 
about threats to the environment. We no longer have the right not 
to protect the environment for current and future 
generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a serious threat to our planet. We cannot afford to make 
any concession where the environment is concerned. I think we 
ought to take every known measures and every measure soon to be 
discovered to fight against any threats to the environment. We 
have to face some serious threats like oil spills at sea or close 
to the coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would consolidate existing marine liability regimes, 
fatal accidents, limitation of liability for maritime claims, 
liability for carriage of goods by water, liability and 
compensation for pollution damage, into a single piece of 
legislation which would also include new regimes concerning 
shipowners' liability to passengers and apportionment of 
liability applicable to torts governed by the Canadian maritime 
legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would retroactively validate certain bylaws made under 
the Canada Ports Corporation Act and certain regulations made 
under the Pilotage Act. The validating provisions are of a 
strictly housekeeping nature and are unrelated to the marine 
liability regimes set out in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about the description and the analysis 
contained in part 1 dealing with personal injuries and 
fatalities. Those provisions are set in clauses 4 to 14. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It follows a decision made in 1993 by the British Columbia Court 
of Appeal where the court found that relatives of persons killed 
in marine accidents could sue under part 14 of the Canada 
Shipping Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 1 of the bill would generally re-enact the provisions 
concerning fatal accidents that currently appear in part 14 of 
the Canada Shipping Act, revising them to give effect to the 
various Supreme Court of Canada decisions. More specifically, 
part 1 would update Canadian maritime law to reflect developments 
in provincial fatal accidents legislation and to confirm that 
maritime wrongful death and injury claims may be made against 
persons as well as ships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 1 would apply only in respect of claims for which a remedy 
would be sought under Canadian maritime law, as defined in the 
Federal Court Act, or any other law of Canada in relation to any 
matter falling within the class of navigation and shipping or 
dealing more precisely with clause 5. Any action based on part 1 
of the bill would be barred for two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would improve legislation but would not solve the new 
problems users would be facing. 
The Bloc Quebecois agrees with this part, whose aim is to permit 
the dependants of a person injured or deceased to recover damages 
and interest.  We agree with these measures, but we could have 
been, as my colleague has said, more attentive to what the 
witnesses said when the bill was being examined in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will also address part 2, that is clauses 15 to 23, which set 
out the apportionment of liability.  It involves the application 
of the principle that if several people or ships are liable each 
is apportioned part of the blame, and if it is impossible to 
determine individual degrees of fault all are equally and 
jointly responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The claimant may initiate proceedings for negligence in shipping 
matters in Canada. First, the common law defence of contributory 
negligence prevents a claimant from recovering anything if the 
defendant can prove that the claimant's own negligence, even in 
the slightest degree, has contributed to the damages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, a defendant who is found responsible for paying a 
claimant damages is then prevented from claiming a contribution 
from other persons.  It really concerned these clauses; it 
improved them and the problems.  It also made it possible to link 
this new apportionment of liability with the Quebec civil code, 
which had always recognized these rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the federal level, however, apportionment legislation such as 
currently exists at the provincial level has never been enacted, 
except with respect to damage caused by collisions between ships. 
It is important to have this vision so that this problem may be 
really linked with provincial jurisdictional distribution.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the Quebec government with its civil code has always 
been further ahead. I am not saying this because I live in 
Quebec: I think this has been recognized throughout Canada with 
many issues. The civil code, which was updated a few years ago, 
has really been updated to respond to what is happening. That is 
what is important to legitimize, to allow the apportionment of 
liability in part 2 which includes clauses 15 to 23. We agree 
in principle with this apportionment of liability in part 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will also deal with part 3, which includes clauses 24 to 34. 
It covers the “Limitation of liability for maritime claims”. This 
is very important. I believe it is very important to ensure the 
apportionment of liability, whether financial or by units of 
account or special drawing rights issued by the International 
Monetary Fund under the London convention of 1976 and the Canada 
Shipping Act, with an extension to cover the liability of dock, 
canal or harbour owners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out that claims arising from a ship 
in collision will be limited to two years. This is in subclause 
23(1). 
However, a court with jurisdiction to deal with such an action 
could, in accordance with the rules of the court, extend the 
two year time limit to the extent and on the conditions that it 
thought fit. As well, the court could extend the time period for 
arresting a ship if satisfied that the two years had not afforded 
a reasonable opportunity to arrest the ship within the waters of 
a province or of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very important provision, because these things could 
take a long time. These legal actions took a long time to settle. 
Ships could be tied down and, before everyone could agree on some 
kind of settlement undue extentions could be granted. 
We all know how long judicial proceedings can 
be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This clause would speed up the determination of liability and 
the processing of maritime claims. That is what is called 
limitation of liability for maritime claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague pointed out, this provision could have been 
improved upon further. I think that we in the Bloc Quebecois will 
support this aspect in relation to part 3.  Given all we have 
heard in the past, legal actions that went on for years on end, 
witnesses that came before the committee urging us to take action 
and to take all necessary means to do so, I think the government 
is not going far enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that my time is quickly running out. As I said at the 
beginning of my speech, I also want to talk about the 
environment. As we know, it is a very important issue. 
It is just incredible how many environmental disasters we see 
around the world.  We hear about ships accidentally discharging 
their cargo into the environment.  We can see how unacceptable 
this is from the ecological point of view.  It will be years and 
years before all the flora and fauna, all the shore areas 
affected by spills can recover and finally get back to the way 
they used to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that many species are endangered.  There are endangered 
birds and marine species.  It is very important to ensure heavy 
vigilance.  I believe we can no longer allow these companies to 
travel about the planet anywhere they want, doing anything they 
want.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the $100 million figure for the fund, I will take the 
example of the incident on the coast of France a few years ago. 
Initially this was to cost a few million dollars but in the 
end the figure was escalating; $100 million is very low.  This 
bill ought to have given a far higher figure.  We have absolutely 
no idea today what it will cost to restore what we have 
destroyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far be it from me to alarm the people listening to us today. 
That is not my intention.  I have never wanted to do that, but we 
must be responsible. 
As responsible persons we must tell oil companies which have a 
major responsibility that they must assume their responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the heading “Payments into the Ship-source Oil Pollution 
Fund”, clause 93 and the following clauses say that ship owners 
must pay 30 cents per metric ton “in respect of each metric ton 
of oil in excess of 300 metric tons imported by ship into 
Canada or shipped by ship from any place in Canada in bulk as 
cargo”. This levy set as of March 31, 1999, will be adjusted 
annually. I believe it is generous. This bill is generous toward 
the oil companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These days, for the past year and a half to two years in fact, 
we have experienced spiralling costs. The government says it is 
not responsible. Oil companies say they are short of money but 
they are making record profits. I will not tell the House what 
people back home are saying. In the Saguenay we have words to 
describe this kind of people but I will not say what they are 
because it is not parliamentary. Allow me to 
think and say that it is indecent.  Let us talk about how much 
money the oil companies are making on the back of the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You must have poor people in your riding, Mr. Speaker. You have 
farm workers, taxi drivers, school bus drivers.  All these people 
need a car to go to work. Do you not think it is very hard for 
them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Quebec City area I paid 89 cents for a litre of regular 
gasoline. It is a lot. What is it going to be this summer? They 
say that during the holidays people are not cost conscious. I 
believe it is indecent to think that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mentioned by my colleague, the Bloc Quebecois will support 
the bill with some reservations. I believe it could have been 
improved to show that we were finally going to do the right 
thing.

<A NAME="LINK216">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
introduce legislation that offers GST relief to the victims of 
premature building envelope failure who are eligible for 
compensation through British Columbia's PST Relief Grant Program 
and to make any and all consequential amendments required. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, the building envelope failure, or a leaky 
condo crisis, has been devastating to British Columbia's real 
estate market.  It has devastated families, evaporated peoples' 
savings, thrown families into financial crisis and drowned the 
dreams of thousands of homeowners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leaky condo crisis involves over 50,000 damaged and 
destroyed homes.  Those affected face an average repair bill of 
$21,043 per owner.  The average owner faces a total loss of 
$58,543 on their investment, 12,879 consumer bankruptcies have 
been the direct result of the leaky condo crisis and at least 
7,500 condo owners have or will claim bankruptcy due to this 
disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue is not just about statistics.  I want to tell the 
House about a couple of constituents of mine who are being 
crushed by this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Carma Albert lives in the Glenborough in Coquitlam Town Centre. 
Carma is a member of her strata council and she is helping to 
co-ordinate its $1.7 million reconstruction project.  Carma and 
her husband had hoped that their suite would be a stepping stone 
to buying their future house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It now seems that with an assessment of nearly $19,000 their 
plan will have to be put on hold for quite some time.  By the 
way, Carma is the mother of a tiny baby only a couple of months 
old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Claudette Friesen is another constituent of mine.  She lives 
with her husband and daughter in the Madison in Coquitlam Town 
Centre in my constituency.  They also have a newlywed daughter. 
Claudette is very involved in my community as president of the 
Coquitlam Town Centre Community Association, president of the 
Madison Strata Council which is managing roughly $1 million in 
repairs.  She is the founding member of the tri-cities condo 
group and she sits on several city committees, including the 
mayor's task force on building envelope failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She also has multiple sclerosis.  Her family has been assessed 
$15,000 with an additional assessment of approximately $3,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These sorts of tragedies are seen all across British Columbia. 
If we count the owners of leaky condos and their extended 
families, this crisis has directly affected 250,000 people, one 
in 10 British Columbia voters.  Twenty-four of 34 constituencies 
in British Columbia are affected by this issue directly.  The 
impact of this issue is enormous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The collateral economic impact of this issue is devastating. 
When local governments are taken to court as defendants in leaky 
condo court cases, all taxpayers are on the hook.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxpayers are soaked again when Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation, a federal crown corporation and the largest mortgage 
insurer in the country, bears the brunt of the cost of 
foreclosures.  Also, when homeowners declare bankruptcy, their 
creditors pass on the debt expense as a business expense, which 
is then borne by all consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all this in mind, it has been three years since former 
British Columbia premier David Barrett was appointed to chair a 
commission to look into this disaster.  His report was tabled in 
June 1998 and it made 82 recommendations to, as the title of his 
report suggests, create a “Renewal of Trust in Residential 
Construction”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the recommendations, the federal government was asked to 
pay $300 million into a compensation plan that would help 
homeowners repair their leaky condos.  On July 17, 1998, the 
minister responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation 
announced that the federal government would lend $75 million to 
the reconstruction fund.  In truth, the federal government will 
not give a dime to affected homeowners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite to the contrary.  At the same time that the federal 
government is giving a no-interest loan to the province of 
British Columbia for $75 million, money that has yet to be spent 
or seen, by the way, it is raking in a tidy profit from the 
application of GST to the cost of repairs.  The three year 
carrying cost, that is the lost interest on the $75 million 
federal loan to British Columbia, is roughly $13 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, before members of the Liberal government pat themselves 
on the back for this contribution, they should know that they are 
profiting mightily from this crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To date, the federal government has received $40.7 million in 
GST revenue on the $581 million that leaky condo owners have 
spent on their repairs.  If we deduct the $13 million carrying 
cost of the $75 million loan, we arrive at roughly $30 million, 
which is the net GST profit that the federal government has 
pocketed on this disaster from its victims.  That is the 
government's profit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While low and middle income families in my riding and across 
British Columbia struggle to keep up with the bills that are 
rolling in because of this disaster, the government is helping no 
one, but laughing all the way to the bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My motion reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
introduce legislation that offers GST relief to the victims of 
premature building envelope failure who are eligible for 
compensation through British Columbia's PST Relief Grant Program 
and to make any and all consequential amendments required. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is nothing more than the implementation at the 
federal level of Barrett commission recommendations 79 and 80, 
found on page 52 of the “Renewal of Trust in Residential 
Construction”, part 2, volume 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those recommendations read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>79. For purposes of reconstruction, all GST and PST, payable on 
qualified repairs and renovations, should be repealed.  In this 
way, the owner/occupier is treated by taxation the same way as 
the owner/landlord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>80. All GST and PST that has been paid on renovations should be 
refunded to the homeowners. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out three things with reference to these 
recommendations.  First, that the Barrett commission believes 
that all taxpayers should be treated equally.  If a landlord can 
deduct the cost of leaky condo repairs from his taxes, then GST 
relief should also be offered to an individual owner of another 
similarly affected leaky condo in the same complex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, while pretending to be a friend of the poor, the 
downtrodden and the little guy, taxes the working class owners of 
the leaking and rotting condo on the cost of repairs to their 
homes but it does not tax the same repair costs in the same 
manner when those repairs are paid for by the building's owner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point I would like to note is that the government of 
British Columbia has wholeheartedly embraced recommendation 79 
and 80 and created the PST relief grant program that is 
administered through British Columbia's homeowner protection 
office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provincial government ensures that the PST relief is only 
given to the intended class of victims, those who own or live in 
leaky condos and those who can prove that they have paid to have 
their homes repaired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the documents those who qualify must submit are:  First, a 
certificate to verify that the repair was necessary due to a 
premature building envelope failure and is not simply related to 
maintenance; second, a statutory declaration by the contractor 
confirming repairs have been completed; and three, copies of 
contracts with change orders, invoices or certificates of payment 
that support the cost of repairs being submitted on the 
application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government could easily piggyback on this system and 
give GST relief only to those who qualify for the PST relief 
grant program.  Unlike the home heating fuel rebate that this 
government botched earlier this year, this approach is foolproof 
from waste and error and, more important, it is compassionate and 
the appropriate thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third point I would like to make is the very nature of 
embarking on commissions like the Barrett commission in the 
future if its findings are simply to be ignored by the federal 
government. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1810"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is currently looking at the issue of 
reforming our health care system.  Mr. Romanow, a respected 
former premier of the province of Saskatchewan is leading the 
effort and he will report to Canadians and the House in up to 18 
months with recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the government to think about the precedent it is setting 
by ignoring the Barrett commission and the cynicism such a move 
will engender.  If the government ignores the Barrett commission, 
how can Canadians have any confidence that the government will 
respect any future reports from similar commissions?  If the 
government turns a deaf ear to its obligations, as stated by the 
Barrett commission, it sends a signal that the reports of future 
commissions, including the Romanow commission, will also do 
nothing more than gather dust on Liberal shelves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What hope, or better yet, what point is there in even asking 
taxpayers to ante up a dime for this type of bogus political 
posturing if commission recommendations are simply ignored? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the cost of repairs on the average leaky condo is 
$21,043 per owner.  GST on the repairs works out to $1,473 per 
condo.  If we assume that the estimate of 50,000 leaky condos 
from the Barrett commission is correct, that would mean that the 
federal government would forgo $73.6 million in GST on leaky 
condo repairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what my motion calls for, granting GST relief only to 
those who qualify for the PST relief from the government of 
British Columbia.  That, by the way, is a paltry 20% of the 
announcement last week by the Minister of Canadian Heritage of 
$560 million for Internet art and assorted cultural posturings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has not escaped my attention, or that of those watching and 
who own leaky condos, that while this motion is not being voted 
on and is not being taken seriously by the government, we will 
soon be voting on the weighty matter of creating the position of 
a parliamentary poet laureate.  I can only hope that the poet 
laureate will be able to adequately capture in iambic pentameter 
the depth of frustration and distress felt by those who live in 
leaky condos who will not be applying for Internet funding and 
whose needs are being ignored by the government's harsh 
decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My motion is in the spirit of strengthening federal-provincial 
relations and in encouraging the federal government to partner 
with the government of British Columbia to implement the Barrett 
commission recommendations 79 and 80.  By respecting these 
recommendations the federal government would send a clear message 
to the people of British Columbia that it is willing to work with 
their government to solve major problems that affect them the 
most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My motion is probably good also for the federal purse as 
contractors cannot avoid paying income tax on the repairs they 
perform if clients need a receipt to claim their GST relief. 
Presumably this is part of the justification for the government's 
partial GST relief on new homes and renovations to homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has repeatedly resisted calls for GST relief on 
the repairs to leaky condos.  In a July 17, 1998 press release 
entitled, “Gagliano Announces Federal Aid for Leaky Condo Owners 
in Lower Coastal B.C.” we find the following paragraph: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax relief or a tax subsidy, as suggested by the Barrett 
Commission report, would not be an equitable option for all 
Canadians.  The Government of Canada's position is that the 
federal tax system is nationally based and it would be difficult 
to provide tax assistance to owners of water-damaged dwellings in 
B.C., while excluding others.  It would also be difficult to 
provide a tax subsidy for unexpected repair costs arising from 
one particular cause but not others. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding that this accurately articulated the 
government's position at the time, and that position has not 
evolved.  The fact that the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Finance is here with five books on his desk to 
respond to my speech says that the government will respond to my 
motion on an economic basis, and the minister himself will not be 
responding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to draw the House's attention to the final sentence from 
the minister's release that I just read.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would also be difficult to provide a tax subsidy for 
unexpected repair costs arising from one particular cause but not 
others. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote from page 5 of Revenue Canada Bulletin 4028 
entitled, “GST/HST New Housing Rebate” as updated online on 
April 26 of this year.  It reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You may be eligible to claim a rebate for a part of the GST/HST 
you pay on the purchase price or cost of building your home, if 
you are an individual, and:  You buy a new or substantially 
renovated home, and you lease the land from the builder;  you 
construct or substantially renovate your own home, or carry out a 
major addition (or hire another person to do so); or your home is 
destroyed by fire and subsequently rebuilt. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Note how this final point, GST relief in cases where one's 
“home is destroyed by fire and subsequently rebuilt,” flies in 
the face of the minister's comments I just read to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I understand the government's position correctly, then it 
will not give GST relief to owners of leaky condos facing 
unexpected repairs and affected by the 1999 collapse of the new 
home warranty program, but his colleague, the Minister of 
National Revenue, will offer GST relief to those “facing 
unexpected repair costs arising from one particular cause”, in 
this case fires, even though in many cases fire damage is covered 
by insurance.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a contradiction in policy seems typical of the government. 
It offers help to those who do not really need it while taxing 
and profiting from those in distress.  The Liberal government is 
even contradicting a core principle of the GST.  Many Canadians 
know that by law the government extends partial GST relief to 
Canadians who build a sun deck, add a second storey to their 
house, or turn their carport into a garage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the government will not extend that relief to Canadians 
who try to repair their own leaky condos and thereby avoid 
deterioration of their homes.  This sort of judgment, with a 
clear contradiction of principle and policy and with blatant 
disregard to its impact on victims, is the sort of judgment that 
alienates Canadians from this institution and undermines the 
ability of parliament to claim to represent those in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen how the government is prepared to give GST relief 
to cases where certain repairs and renovations are undertaken and 
even to the construction of new homes.  However it stops short of 
extending the umbrella of GST relief to those most in need, 
namely 10% of my constituents.  A respected provincial commission 
recommended such relief.  The province was quick to embrace the 
same recommendation and has already established an efficient 
mechanism to distribute this relief.  Surprisingly the government 
stops short of giving this GST relief to only those who need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of thousands of my constituents, tens of thousands of 
British Columbians and all those who seek compassion and justice 
on this issue, I ask the government to implement Barrett 
commission recommendations 79 and 80 to give leaky condo owners 
the same treatment as those who repair fire damaged buildings and 
to show compassion to those whose homes and lives have been 
destroyed by this crisis.  I call on the government to support my 
motion and to treat leaky condo owners with the justice, respect 
and sense of compassion they deserve.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the 
opportunity to comment on the motion put forward by the hon. 
member for Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion proposes that the government introduce legislation to 
offer goods and services tax relief to victims of premature 
building envelope failure, or what we commonly refer to as leaky 
condos, who are eligible for compensation through British 
Columbia's PST relief grants program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is sympathetic to the difficulties and 
inconvenience being experienced by individuals in British 
Columbia over premature building envelope failure to their 
condominiums as a result of moisture damage.  I was in Victoria 
not too long ago and I spoke to many people who were victimized 
by this unfortunate event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the hon. member that the federal government has 
given careful consideration to requests for assistance from 
condominium owners in the British Columbia lower mainland and 
Vancouver Island areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As evidence of its concern I remind the House that the federal 
government through the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation 
announced $27.7 million in assistance for owners of moisture 
damaged homes in British Columbia in October 2000.  That was the 
$75 million interest free loan program.  These funds, which were 
made available through B.C.'s provincial homeowners 
reconstruction loan program, would greatly assist those 
homeowners who are having financial difficulty making necessary 
repairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the hon. member's motion, the federal government 
believes that the GST is not the appropriate vehicle for 
providing relief in regional crises.  Hon. members will recall 
that the GST is intended to be a broadly based tax applied to the 
same tax base throughout the country.  As a result it would be 
very difficult to justify providing tax assistance to owners of 
water damaged dwellings in British Columbia while excluding 
people in other areas of the country who also purchased homes of 
substandard quality.  What do we do for them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, it would be difficult to justify providing a tax 
subsidy for unexpected repair costs arising from water damage but 
not for repair costs arising from other causes.  Is there 
something particularly special about water?

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is sympathetic and has given careful 
consideration to requests for assistance of all types, not only 
in the context of the condominium problems in British Columbia 
but also for the extensive damage to homes resulting from the 
floods in the Saguenay in 1996 and Manitoba in 1997, as well as 
the ice storm in Quebec and Ontario in 1998.  As regional GST 
relief was not provided following these crises, it would be 
inappropriate in this case to use the GST to provide regional 
relief that is limited to British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government supports the view that it is more appropriate to 
provide tax relief for low income Canadians than to exclude 
specific items from the GST base.  This is achieved through the 
GST credit which helps to offset the sales tax burden of low 
income families and individuals, thereby ensuring that the sales 
tax system is sensitive to differences in income and family type. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam talked 
about the energy rebate.  It reached 11 million Canadians at a 
cost of $1.3 billion.  It was driven through the GST rebate and 
went to Canadians directly.  It did not go to the oil companies, 
as was the proposition put forward by the Alliance Party.  The 
rebate went directly to Canadians who needed some relief from the 
high energy costs this past winter.  The credit has proven to be 
a very effective means of targeting and delivering tax relief, 
particularly to low income families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons the government does not support using the tax 
system as a means to provide relief.  However I assure the hon. 
member that the federal government would continue to work with 
the government of British Columbia in assisting owners of 
moisture damaged homes or leaky condos with their repair costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government's October 2000 announcement of $27.7 
million in assistance is evidence of this commitment.  The Canada 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation will continue to work in 
co-operation with others involved in housing research and design 
to find practical solutions to moisture related problems.  For 
the reasons I have just outlined, I am unable to support the hon. 
member's motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam 
for bringing the motion forward for debate.  Like the hon. 
member, I am a member from British Columbia.  I know from 
personal experience, in speaking with my constituents and 
visiting homes in east Vancouver, the devastation that has been 
caused by leaky condos. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the parliamentary secretary speak on behalf of the 
government to the motion.  I cannot help but comment on the 
absurdity of the government saying that it is sympathetic to the 
inconvenience of owning a leaky condo.  We are not talking about 
inconvenience.  We are talking about families who have gone into 
bankruptcy, families who could not sell their apartments for a 
dime.  Everybody knows they are leaky condos; they have put 
plastic and awnings on the outside.  These families know they 
will never be able to get rid of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about an inconvenience when these people use 
all their RRSPs, beg and borrow at the bank, and throw their life 
savings into trying to repair their condos.  It causes sleepless 
nights and incredible anxiety because they are dealing with the 
most important purchase they have ever made.  British Columbians 
are facing a billion dollar tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam 
outlined some of the issues very well.  I support his motion.  I 
am very proud to say that the provincial government of B.C. took 
the issue very seriously.  It set up a public inquiry, headed by 
former premier and former member of parliament Dave Barrett. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1825"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They held exhaustive public hearings.  They tried to get to the 
root causes of what had caused this problem in condominiums and, 
I should mention, in federally funded co-ops.  They have also 
experienced the same problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reading through the volumes of reports of the Barrett 
commission, we see that the B.C. government did come forward with 
very proactive and positive measures to provide relief to 
homeowners, who were suffering terribly.  For example, the 
provincial government provided PST relief.  The province provided 
about $100 million in no interest loans.  The homeowner 
protection office has been operating since October 1998.  There 
are very tough new licensing requirements for developers and 
contractors.  The province even approved $30 million in interest 
free loans for federally funded co-ops because the federal 
government would not do anything.  In fact, the province has made 
extensive recommendations and has acted on them to provide some 
assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite appalling to know that there has been virtually no 
response from the federal government.  I really take offence to 
the suggestion on the other side from the government that because 
this is “a regional issue” it does not qualify for the kind of 
relief called for in the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who thinks this issue of leaky condos, leaky co-ops and 
building envelope failure is contained to this one province 
should think again, because this issue is now cropping up in 
other communities across Canada.  The idea that because it is 
regional somehow people will not qualify for the kind of help 
they need is an idea I find offensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say that my colleague, the member of parliament from 
Burnaby—Willingdon, the former member of parliament from 
Kamloops, and three members from the NDP in British Columbia 
wrote time and time again to the minister responsible for Canada 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one of the many letters we wrote to him, we told him that the 
Barrett commission had urged the provincial and federal levels of 
government to provide compensation and had further recommended 
that the federal government ensure that CMHC provide assistance 
as well as tax relief on repairs.  Ironically, though, we told 
him, because the federal government rejected the recommendations 
that would allow homeowners to repay their RRSPs, the government 
was actually making money off people who were forced to liquidate 
their RRSPs to pay for repairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is just so insulting to people to have to withdraw their life 
savings and then find out that they are being taxed on those 
savings.  The federal government is actually making money off 
this tragedy of people having to deal with costly repairs for 
their homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing the parliamentary secretary did get right is the fact 
that last October the federal government provided to the province 
of British Columbia a one time grant of $27.7 million.  This is 
important to note, because during the last federal election 
campaign our local Liberals, including the member who was 
defeated by the member bringing forward the motion today, tried 
to spin that, saying that the federal government was actually 
providing $75 million in support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear.  The $27 million grant allows the province to 
finance $75 million worth of no interest loans.  In other words, 
the federal money basically pays the province the interest on $75 
million.  However, during that campaign the claims were just 
outrageous.  There were claims in the media by Liberal candidates 
who were running around saying that the federal government had 
coughed up $75 million.  It was no such thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion today is very straightforward and basic.  The motion 
deals with one of the issues that came forward from the Barrett 
commission.  It seems to me to be the most common sense and the 
most minimal thing the federal government could do, which is to 
provide GST relief just as the provincial government has provided 
PST relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, surely we have to go further than that.  People should 
be able to withdraw from their RRSPs and not get dinged on having 
to pay the taxes.  People should be able to have an income tax 
deduction for the cost of repairs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally there is the issue of compensation.  Mr. Barrett made a 
very strong recommendation for compensation because people, 
through no fault of their own, are living in a state of disrepair 
and dysfunction because of what is happening to their buildings. 
Compensation is something I support and I believe the federal 
government has a responsibility to compensate those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary raised the issue of other disasters 
in Canada.  Let us look at the ice storm in Ontario and Quebec 
and how quickly the federal government responded to it.  The 
government saw it as an emergency and put forward some $900 
million or $700 million to deal with it.  That was the proper 
thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of leaky condos in British Columbia is no less of an 
emergency but it has been completely ignored by the federal 
government.  We must continue to press on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the minister today in the House that if he has somehow 
forgotten the file on leaky condos or thinks other people have 
forgotten, he has only to go into any community in B.C. and talk 
to people to understand the horror of what they are facing.  This 
is a very real financial burden for homeowners and families in 
British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I very much support the motion.  It is one aspect of a much 
larger program that needs to be undertaken.  I also say shame on 
the federal government for ignoring the problem and cutting out 
homeowners who are legitimately concerned about an emergency over 
which they have no control.  I urge the government to support the 
motion and provide GST relief.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to be able to say a few words on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A little less than a year ago, shortly after I was elected, I 
found myself in British Columbia with a colleague, Gilles 
Bernier, who was then my party's critic for the department.  Mr. 
Bernier did a lot of work on this file and we became well aware 
of the major problem facing people in British Columbia.  People 
in other provinces were affected as well, but certainly the 
crisis was in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of people do not realize the magnitude of the problem. The 
building envelope failure or, as we call it, the leaky condo 
crisis, has led to at least 7,500 condo owners having to claim 
bankruptcy.  That is 7,500 owners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Average repair costs are over $21,000 per owner, a total loss of 
investment of almost $59,000 for the average owner.  There are 
estimated to be almost 13,000 consumer bankruptcies as a direct 
result of the leaky condo crisis.  The issue impacts about 70% of 
the districts in British Columbia.  This is not an isolated case 
of a housing program in some community.  It is a major concern to 
many people in the province of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reaction to the leaky condo crisis the British Columbia 
government empowered the Barrett commission to make 
recommendations.  Motion No. 293 which we are discussing seeks to 
implement at the federal level the spirit of recommendations 79 
and 80 of the Barrett commission.  Recommendation 79 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For purposes of reconstruction, all GST and PST, payable on 
qualified repairs and renovations, should be repealed.  In this 
way, the owner/occupier is treated by taxation the same way as 
the owner/landlord. 
</UL>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recommendation 80 states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All GST and PST that has been paid on renovations should be 
refunded to homeowners. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The B.C. government has embraced the plan and eliminated the 
provincial sales tax from qualified repairs.  However the federal 
government has repeatedly refused to remove the GST from leaky 
condo repairs although it has exempted new homes from the GST and 
does not tax certain luxury items.  The government does not tax 
luxuries in some cases and yet it taxes misfortune.  That is what 
is occurring here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I listened to the parliamentary secretary I was hit by a 
couple of the words he used.  One was sympathetic.  He said that 
the government was sympathetic to the problem in British Columbia 
and that it was giving it serious consideration.  I ask the 
parliamentary secretary and the government:  How many leaky 
condos can be repaired with sympathy or serious consideration? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary said that tax credits could not be 
used for relief in cases like this.  The government of British 
Columbia found a way to use taxes to relieve the situation.  If 
there is a will there is a way.  The problem with the federal 
government is that the will is not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday in the House we had a debate about the cleanup of St. 
John's harbour.  Let us talk about coincidence.  The NDP member 
who spoke before me mentioned $27 million that the parliamentary 
secretary said had been given to British Columbia.  That was very 
good of him but he did not say when it was given.  The hon. 
member from the NDP, a British Columbia resident, said that it 
was in October of last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened in October?  An election campaign was going on. 
Perhaps it is my devious mind but I wonder if the $27 million 
given to British Columbia, which the government bragged about as 
if it were $75 million, had anything to do with the election.  At 
the same time the government promised Newfoundland $33 million to 
clean up St. John's harbour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw what happened yesterday.  The government said that there 
was infrastructure money but that it needed to pick and choose. 
It said nothing about the ordinary infrastructure agreement last 
October.  It was a specific program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two things are becoming quite clear.  First, the government has 
no will to do what it should be doing.  Ways can be found to help 
the people of British Columbia.  A very simple way is being 
recommended here this evening with this motion.  However the 
government says that it will not do so because it does not have 
the will.  There are ways to help but the government says that it 
will not do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is no surprise to any of us.  The people affected by this 
are going through severe trauma.  Many of them are bankrupt or 
wondering how they will pay for the necessary repairs.  What are 
we saying here in the House?  The government says that it does 
not care.  That is not the way it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This evening we hope to convince the government to change its 
mind, agree with us on the motion and provide the people of 
British Columbia the assistance they not only need but deserve. 
There is a way if the government is willing.

colleagues' comments, particularly the member for Vancouver East 
and the member for St. John's West who just spoke on the issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I came to the House with a big heart, hoping that I could raise 
issues that were important to my constituents, and we have spent 
40 or 45 minutes of discussing the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I went into the general election campaign in my 
constituency, I went in with big ideals that I and my party would 
move mountains, that we would cut taxes and that we would have 
new Canada, and that these were the things would talk about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However when I got into an election campaign I discovered what 
most members discover.  The issues that people are most concerned 
about in their constituencies are the issues that affect them 
most at home, the bread and butter issues such as are they safe 
walking down the street, or is the government going to take more 
from their pockets than it should.  Those are core issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the campaign I knocked on doors in Port Moody, Anmore, 
Westwood Plateau and in Port Coquitlam of my constituency.  When 
I met the people of my riding, I discovered very quickly that the 
most important issue in my constituency was the issue of leaky 
condos.  It affected almost 10% of the people in my riding.  It 
was by far the biggest issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lou Sekora, the former member of parliament for my constituency, 
was elected in the byelection in March, 1998, largely on the hope 
of people from my constituency because this is a non-partisan 
issue.  We have the members for Vancouver East and St. John's 
West supporting the motion.  It is not an issue of conservatism 
versus liberalism versus socialism.  This is a non-partisan 
issue, and we all supported it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of my constituency, because this is a bread and 
butter issue, probably the most important in my riding, got 
together and said they were going to elect Lou Sekora in the 
byelection.  They thought if they had the mayor of Coquitlam at 
the table of power in a Liberal government, he would bring 
attention to this most important issue.  He could not do it, and 
I think for reasons that we see here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who are watching the debate should note that the 
government side had 10 minutes to discuss the issue.  Since 1998, 
frankly I believe this is the first time that this issue has ever 
been raised in the House in a full debate.  The government took 
four and a half minutes of that ten minutes to address it.  It 
affects 10% of my riding, up to 250,000 people in British 
Columbia, and the government took four and a half minutes, 
wrapped it up and said “so long”.  That is not good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Elk Island, one of my most esteemed colleagues in 
this entire House, has been here since 1993.  He has been 
re-elected three times with massive majorities in his 
constituency because of the great work he does in his riding.  He 
has been here for that long and has had zero private members' 
bills drawn out of a pool to be debated and brought to the floor 
of the House, like as this one.  I have been elected once. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if I will run a second time, or a third time or if 
I will have the fortune of having the endorsement of my 
constituents.  However this is the manner in which the most 
important issue in my riding is being dealt with by the House? 
The government spent four and a half minutes on it, denied it and 
blocked in committee the right for the bill to come forward for a 
vote.  It treats my riding and my constituents like that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the government expect me, my constituents and the 
people I represent to have any respect for the government in the 
House, when it treats the issues that are of most importance to 
them with that little respect? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I came here to talk, as I said, about the big issues of 
conservatism versus liberalism.  However on the bread and butter 
issues, like the issue of people having a home that does not melt 
around them and that the government does not profit off the 
people who are losing their homes, the government gave it four 
and a half minutes of debate and brushed it aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the kind of things that make people like me and people 
who want to run for office say “To hell with it.  I'm not going 
to run for office”.  For the government to give my riding four 
and a half minutes of disrespect, slap it aside, deny it the 
right to come to the House of Commons for a vote and deny that 
members of the House be held accountable for this issue, is 
disgusting.  It is absolute disrespect for people whose homes are 
melting around them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary for the Minister of Finance stood up 
and said it was okay if the government profited from people 
losing their homes.  He said that it was not a big deal and that 
it was an inconvenience.  As the hon. member for Vancouver East 
said, that is not good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is travelling to 
British Columbia on a fact finding mission to find out why 
British Columbians are not voting for the federal Liberal Party 
and why there is this thing called western alienation.  This is 
why.  Read <I>Hansard</I>.  Look at the number of people in the 
House who are paying attention to the debate.  Look at the four 
and a half minutes that the government spent on this issue.  That 
is why the government is going nowhere in the province of British 
Columbia, and why people are totally alienated from this 
institution and from this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is my final plea.  This is the last legislative tool I 
have.  The government has blocked it at committee.  It has 
blocked it from taking it seriously.  It gave it four and a half 
minutes of debate.  The government has slapped my constituents in 
the face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are only three members of the government who can block 
this from happening: the hon. members for Mississauga South, 
Etobicoke North and Markham.  I would ask those members:  Will I 
have unanimous consent from the House to make this motion 
votable, and show respect to the people of my constituency?

have been moved.

<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am again on my feet in relation to questions I put to 
the Minister of National Defence and the Minister of Public Works 
and Government Services regarding Lancaster Aviation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the listening audience and for members who are interested, 
Lancaster Aviation is the company that was formed after the 1993 
election to specifically sell aviation parts.  It was awarded a 
contract in 1997 by the Government of Canada to do exactly that, 
to sell spare parts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I became interested was that I noticed Lancaster 
Aviation, although it was contracted and bid to sell spare parts 
and equipment, was awarded a contract without tender.  A change 
in a contract to sell spare parts suddenly became a contract to 
sell 10 Challenger jets and 40 helicopters.  In total dollar 
value it sold those units for approximately $77 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the questions I asked in terms of this contract was how 
much was Lancaster's commission to sell that equipment.  I think 
the Canadian public has a right to know because it is taxpayer 
dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to selling the Challenger jets, the biggest factor 
in the selling, which is probably the way I should express it, is 
that it sold those Challenger jets for less than half the market 
value.  Less than 50% of their value is what the Challengers were 
sold for, so the contract was obviously given by the present 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally the president of Lancaster Aviation happens to be a 
former DND employee.  Would he have inside connections within the 
system to make this deal happen, to be awarded this contract? I 
think any examination of the facts would point to the fact that 
he obviously had some inside contacts within DND to allow him to 
sell the Challenger jets and helicopters without having to 
actually bid on the contract.  There was no open competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, Lancaster Aviation has now closed its offices, its 
warehouse in Milton, Ontario, and has moved in excess of $70 
million worth of equipment owned by the Government of Canada to a 
warehouse in Florida owned by a convicted felon.  A convicted 
money launderer and drug dealer in Florida now owns the warehouse 
in which Canadian goods are stored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question to which I would like an answer is why this has 
been allowed to happen.  What security do we have on the assets 
owned by the Government of Canada now sitting in a warehouse 
owned by a convicted drug dealer in Florida under contractual 
agreement or arrangement with Lancaster Aviation based in Milton, 
Ontario? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think those are questions to which we need answers before we 
will feel comfortable on this file.  Up to now the government has 
not answered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to conclude, when the parliamentary secretary is on his 
feet he never specifically mentions Mr. McFliker, the drug dealer 
in Florida who now owns a warehouse which controls the goods 
owned by the Government of Canada.  Why does he not come good 
with the facts?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public 
Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
government has addressed all the questions raised by the member 
last evening, previously, and in the House during question 
period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lancaster Aviation won competitive contracts in 1997 and again 
in 2000 for the disposal of surplus aerospace assets, not simply 
spare parts, which is the representation of the member.  He also 
suggested that DND awarded contracts, which is again wrong. 
Contracts are awarded by Public Works and Government Services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allegations that the contract to dispose of the Twin Huey 
helicopters and the Challenger aircraft were sole source are 
false.  They were competitively bid.  The 1997 RFP contemplated 
special project sales such as planes.  When such a need arises 
the process calls for an amendment of the contract to legally 
bind the parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we did for the sale of the Twin Huey helicopters 
and the Challenger aircraft.  With respect to the Challenger 
aircraft, eight were sold to DDH Aviation in Fort Worth, Texas, 
for approximately $30 million.  The sale was the result of a 
competitive tender issued by Lancaster.  These aircraft did not 
have civil certification.  Nor were they outfitted for executive 
use.  Also, they were in need of extensive modifications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lancaster was paid a fair commission for its services and is 
subject to the privacy provisions of the Access to Information 
Act, which is why the information is not public.  Lancaster 
therefore had an incentive to sell the surplus aircraft at the 
highest possible price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the assets are in Florida because that is where the 
market is.  The Department of Public Works and Government 
Services has no relationship whatsoever to some party he alleges 
is a convicted felon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  The motion to adjourn is 
now deemed to have been adopted.  Accordingly the House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 
24(1).
