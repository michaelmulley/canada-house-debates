</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.)</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-492, an act to amend the Criminal Code 
(dangerous offender). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, the government has put forward a report 
through the solicitor general's office which states that during a 
10 year period of time dangerous violent offenders who were 
released from prison committed 2,234 new violent crimes which 
unnecessarily created a pile of victims across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason for that is that no one could retain these people 
because they could not be declared dangerous offenders at the 
time of their parole date or date of release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This enactment would provide that an application under section 
753 of the Criminal Code, finding that an offender is a dangerous 
offender, may be made earlier rather than following the date they 
are released from imprisonment for an offence while on parole or 
mandatory supervision, or on the date when the sentence expires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too many times front line officers and prison officials have 
said “Do not release this individual.  He is dangerous and he 
will do it again”, but the law says we have to.  This would 
prevent that from happening.  We could retain people such as 
Fernand Auger, who murdered Melanie Carpenter.  That is one 
example of the 2,234. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the government to support this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some definite objections about Bill C-72.  It does not 
address that two-income families qualify for child care and so 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go to a specific example I have had in the past few 
years, particularly one this spring.  I am sure every member of 
parliament deals with the Department of National Revenue in an 
attempt to help their constituents.  I would suggest to that 
department, as it brings in new legislation, that it follow some 
examples of the treatment of its clients, the citizens of Canada, 
with a touch more humanity.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give members a striking example of a case I am working on 
which I think is a disgrace.  I know a young woman who is 
presently raising two children.  She works at a full time job but 
because she has been deserted by her husband she also works part 
time on the weekends.  I bring this case to the attention of all 
members because I am talking about the treatment of people.  We 
can do all we like in legislation to write something down, but to 
practice it is a different thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This young lady has not seen her husband for three years. 
Revenue Canada finally—and I give it credit—caught up with her 
husband and was able get her the child support that she should 
have received for three years. It then sent her a cheque for 
$11,500.  At the same time, she is being assessed by the 
Department of National Revenue as owing $5,500 in income tax. Not 
only is that dehumanizing, but this mother is struggling to raise 
a 16 year old and a 12 year old and does not have $5,500. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something wrong with a system that employs some 40,000 
to 45,000 people, who can be rigid and efficient in tax 
collection, but surely they could be a little more humanistic 
when it comes to dealing with people. The people who are calling 
Revenue Canada and signing these letters are human beings and 
deserve to be treated as such. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that the Department of National Revenue does deal with 
money and it is going to have agitations.  However, I beg that 
when we get into this bill that we should play fair with people. 
I am sure each one of us in our history have had some grips with 
income tax.  I am sure everybody has.  I can pick out a dozen 
examples over the last two years where people have been treated 
as numbers.  Quite frankly, even when the department is aware of 
the individual's circumstances it ignores them.  This is not 
right for the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wrote a letter this morning to this young lady stating that I 
would do my very best to see that she does not have to borrow 
money to pay the federal government this additional $5,500.  This 
support money was to have been spread over three years so this 
$5,500 should have been considerably less.  This is not the only 
case I have to deal with.  I have 12 other cases on file. I am 
not just citing one example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could stand here until midnight tonight citing examples that 
sometimes take a year before national revenue realizes it has 
erred.  I have never seen a letter of apology from Revenue Canada 
but I have from other departments.  There is never a thank you. 
Many of these people, out of sheer determination, go after the 
Department of National Revenue and pay their own legal costs. 
These costs, however, should be borne by the government as it was 
national revenue that fumbled around on these issues.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have advice for dealing with Bill C-72.  If there was ever a 
department that needed to become familiar with how to deal with 
people in a professional way it is this one.  We can be strict or 
severe.   We can be almost anything if we do it professionally, 
but there are too many people out there who do not deal with the 
constituents of Canada in a professional manner.  The department 
says it cannot do this because it deals with money.  Well I say 
it can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this young lady, this mother of two, and no doubt hundreds 
of others in Canada, let us humanize this department.  Let us try 
to understand and ensure that the department has the staff to do 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very delighted to speak to this bill because nothing churns 
me and makes me more irate than to have to counsel and try to 
help a constituent when I cannot get a response from this 
particular department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really hope all of Canada is listening to this.  I want them 
to get after their MP, not just on this side of the House but on 
that side of the House, to humanize this department. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I certainly agree with the point my hon. 
friend makes.  I suspect we have all had similar experiences, too 
many of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He referred regularly to the department and to the officials as 
not being prepared to bend or to be more humanistic and so on. 
Would he not agree that the responsibility for this law that he 
refers to, regarding the payment of moneys destined to assist 
children, is not a bureaucrat's decision or the department's 
decision but a political decision taken by the political leaders 
in government?  If people have concerns about the Income Tax Act 
they ought not take them out on an official.   They are just 
carrying out the law that has been introduced by the Liberal 
government, by the cabinet and by the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could he clarify this?  He seems to be antagonistic about 
somebody, but surely it is not the bureaucrat.  It must be the 
people who actually make the laws not the ones who carry them 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member is quite right. 
The Income Tax Act is part of the government.  However, the 
carrying out of the act belongs to the officials.  Sometimes it 
does not get back to the department.  I was referring to the fact 
that sometimes the officials make their pronouncements and 
judgments incorrectly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the  hon. member's question, if the government 
was really concerned about these low income people, to which I 
referred, it would take a look now at the exemptions and raise 
them so that the people who are struggling could get by without 
having to pay nearly as much income tax.  That is part of our 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read in the paper this morning and heard on the radio that 
actual income has dropped.  The actual income for the people who 
I mentioned in my speech has dropped even more because they are 
at the low end of the scale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, my colleague from the NDP, this is the government's 
legislation, but those who work in that department should become 
a little more familiar with each case and deal with it 
accordingly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to hear the member's comments in regard to 
the responsibility of the government members and cabinet for the 
Income Tax Act and for the enforcement of it. 
We had the unfortunate case where Susan Theissen and her husband 
had their income tax returns taken out without lawful release by 
Revenue Canada, which made a terrible mess in their personal 
lives.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member comment on whether or not it is actually 
elected government members that are responsible for everything 
that goes on in that department?  It is their overall policies 
that actually filter down to the bureaucrats.  Would he comment 
on whether or not it is the elected officials as opposed to 
bureaucrats that are the biggest problem in Revenue Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, when income tax moves in a 
matter of this gravity the officials make sure that it is indeed 
covered by the act some place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad the member asked that question.  When an error has 
been committed by the bureaucracy, the officials all the way down 
the line, that error should be compensated in the same way as if 
I were in business and I did my hon. colleague wrong.  I would be 
the first one to phone him, write him, make amends, and any 
penalties I caused him should be paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what should be happening with income tax.  They do make 
errors occasionally.  I have never seen one.  I understand they 
have written letters to say they are sorry.  I have never seen 
one.  Occasionally the clients, who are citizens of Canada, get 
something in return.  I have not seen that either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The attitude in Canada in relation to collecting taxes is 
completely outdated.  We need to follow what the IRS did in the 
United States and humanize the department a bit. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my hon. colleague spoke about complexity and our 
convoluted tax code.  We started out with a tax code in a little 
book about a half an inch thick.  Now we are up to volumes that 
stand taller than I do.  We never seem to get rid of some of the 
old stuff that has not worked.  We have dehumanized the system. 
The fairness is missing, as he has alluded to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could he give me some comments on the unfairness to 
tradespeople:  mechanics, auto body technicians, tradespeople in 
other walks of life, electricians, plumbers, carpenters and so 
on?  They are unable to write off the cost of the tools and 
equipment they bring to their jobs.  In a lot of cases it is a 
$15,000 to $20,000 investment of after tax dollars. It is a 
prerequisite of their employment that they have to come up with 
that kind of cash in after tax dollars.  It is just an unfair 
burden on a lot of tradespeople, some of whom are young. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to fly in the face of the youth training program 
initiative the government loves to talk about.  That fairness 
initiative is not being implemented in the tax system.  Would he 
care to comment on that, please? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if I were to answer that 
question we would be here all day.  My hon. colleague raises a 
very valid point.  The other night in the House we approved a 
private member's motion of the member from Kamloops related to 
transit fares and taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is quite right.  Very few people in Canada today file 
their own income tax.  It has become so complicated that 
everybody has to have it done.  The member mentioned 
tradespeople.  They really take a beating in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me explain.  A young fellow is hired for the first time as a 
journeyman mechanic.  In order to go to work the rules of that 
association says he must have his own tools, not the major tools 
like presses but his own tools.  In order to work he must equip 
himself with tools; he cannot work without them.  They are very 
expensive and he cannot claim them as a deduction.  That is 
absolutely insane.  I could talk about carpenters, electricians 
and so on. They have expenses that should be claimable.  It is 
wrong.  We have slapped the faces of our tradespeople far too 
long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me explain.  If this person were working for a corporation 
and the corporation supplied the equipment it is a tax deduction, 
but when the individual buys it in order to work for a firm it is 
not a tax deduction.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time we looked at fairness.  It is time we looked at the 
individual.  It is time we had a total overhaul of the tax 
system.  It is becoming more complex.  Every time the tax system 
moves on we isolate more and more Canadians in their attempt to 
even pay their taxes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to make sure the hon. 
member is aware that Bill C-72 provides some substantial tax 
reduction.  In fact it took 400,000 Canadians off the tax rolls 
and provided $16.5 billion over three years in tax relief.  They 
voted against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about not helping young Canadians.  The registered 
education savings plan went from $2 billion to over $4 billion 
since the announcement was made.  It is helping Canadians save 
for their children to obtain a future education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As much as I understand the role of the opposition parties is to 
criticize, I would hope the hon. member would at least point to 
one or two measures with which he would agree.  I know his 
constituents have.  I would ask him to stand and agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know what the hon. member 
expects me to say and I will say it.  Bracket creep probably 
looked after everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just very quickly on education, I say to members opposite that I 
understand.  I have a case on file right now of a young fellow 
who received a scholarship in September 1998.  He is asking me, 
and I am trying to work on it, whether it is right that he has to 
pay income tax on the full amount of the scholarship in the year 
in which he got it.  That is not right.  It might be correct, 
according to the books, but this young man will use that 
scholarship over a period of four years and Revenue Canada says 
that it wants it all claimed this year.  That is wrong. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this is yet another bill to add to the great pile my friend was 
talking about.  I happen to be six foot five inches tall and 
indeed the documents go over my head.  The Income Tax Act and all 
the reports and documents to interpret it are totally convoluted. 
Bill C-72 just adds to that convolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it was the parliamentary secretary to the finance 
minister who was trying to say earlier that we should look at 
what they have done in terms of clarifying things and reducing 
taxes.  Why does he and his department not take a look at how 
convoluted the Income Tax Act is?  The officials who enforce the 
Income Tax Act have the ability to make virtually any 
interpretation they want of many sections.  It creates all sorts 
of confusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I speak specifically about Bill C-72, I offer by way of 
example something that occurred not once but twice in my own 
constituency which relates to what I am speaking about.  I have 
previously addressed this situation in the House.  I hope the 
parliamentary secretary will listen with great concern and 
interest and take notes.  We are not getting anywhere in this 
situation.  I know he will be able to help me break through on 
behalf of my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years ago, as a result of some rather lopsided logic by 
the NDP government in Victoria, there was a lack of wood fibre or 
feedstock to the local lumber mills in my constituency.  As a 
consequence, a number of ranchers who were not normally in the 
business of tree farming or logging on their property were 
approached by lumber mills and asked if they would be interested 
in selling logs on a selective harvest to the mills.  Many of 
them did.  As a matter of fact, I think the caseload in my office 
right now is approaching 25 or 30 of these ranchers who took 
advantage of the situation.

straightened out.  What was interesting was that in most cases 
the accountants had prior experience with this kind of situation. 
In some instances some of the CGAs and CAs approached Revenue 
Canada in Penticton and asked what was the best way to account 
for that income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None of my constituents, whose cases are in my office right now, 
had any intention of walking away from their responsibility of 
paying taxes.  They are good, responsible Canadian citizens who 
recognize that they have that responsibility and are prepared to 
pay their taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their accountants advised them that the way it was handled as 
far as Revenue Canada was concerned was to declare the income as 
a capital gain.  This was to get around the problem that 
obviously there were some expenses incurred, but because they 
were not in the business of normally growing the trees to be 
harvested for lumber production there were not any easily 
identifiable expenses that could be written off against that 
income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this had just been one public accountancy firm, if this had 
just been one CGA firm, we would have a situation where someone 
obviously was mistaken in his or her interpretation.  However, it 
was 100% consistent on the part of all 10 firms that were 
involved.  As I indicated earlier, some of them actually took 
advice from Revenue Canada about the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened?  Now I am getting into some interpretation, but 
we had a situation where in my judgment some officials in Revenue 
Canada were sitting around one day and realized that a tremendous 
amount of income had been declared but if they had declared the 
income as income and not as income from capital gain which gave 
them a 25% advantage, they would have collected an extra $1 
million in taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of a sudden these constituents were reassessed.  I would 
counsel my NDP colleague from Kamloops that he will have people 
in his constituency who will be hit the same way.  I would 
counsel anyone in British Columbia and, once this has spread, 
anyone involved in this kind of situation.  This has been turned 
back already by one appeal to one level of the tax system.  Now 
the government is taking it forward to a higher court of appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can think of a situation of some people who are now into their 
70s.  They have a very large piece of property and a residence on 
the property.  They received this income.  They went through the 
procedure as specified as good Canadian citizens.  They paid 
their taxes as required by Revenue Canada under the 
interpretation at that time.  They then paid off all their 
encumbrances and disbursed funds to their families who in turn 
will have used that income to pay off perhaps their mortgages or 
some other debts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, what I am saying is that the money is gone.  All 
of a sudden, with a reassessment out of the clear blue sky this 
older couple is now faced with a $72,000 tax bill.  It is 
absolutely bizarre that because the Income Tax Act is so 
convoluted the officials in Revenue Canada were able to go after 
this couple, times 25 or 30 more in my constituency.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said that there were two cases.  The second case deals with 
debate that has happened in the House today.  The member for 
Kamloops asked whether my Reform colleague thought there is the 
issue here that it is the responsibility that the direction comes 
from the political side. The answer to that question is partly 
yes and partly no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The yes part is that a couple of years ago the finance minister 
finally woke up to what the Reform Party had been saying all 
through the 1993 election, that the deficit was killing us and 
that we had to cut back.  The finance minister all of a sudden 
woke up in 1996 and said that the government would be going after 
all these so-called tax loopholes.  He said there were going to 
be ways to take the so-called tax loopholes, tax credits and 
things of that nature away from people in middle and higher 
income brackets. That was in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have received advice that fundamentally the income tax 
department has three years to go back and reassess.  The income 
tax department knew on the basis of what the finance minister 
said that it would be rolling this back.  Why did it not reassess 
immediately for the 1996 year?  If it was too busy, why did it 
not get around to it in the 1997 year?  If it was still too busy, 
which I find difficult to believe due to the amount of tax that 
was outstanding because it was closing this loophole, why did it 
not get around to it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department is now getting around to it. It is filing this at 
the very last minute, at the end of the approaching third year 
when the statute would prevent it from going after this money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is that the finance minister says “We are closing 
loopholes” and Revenue Canada says “We are going to wait”. Why 
would it wait?  Because of the penalties and the interest that 
will be charged on the money that the department is now 
reassessing as a result of the direction from the finance 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to my friend from Kamloops, that is why he is partially 
correct.  Revenue Canada and the Income Tax Act are creations of 
the incumbent Liberal government. On the other side of the coin, 
the department itself in many cases can be legitimately accused 
of being unfair and unbalanced when dealing with with law-abiding 
Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the result is that we end up with decent 
law-abiding Canadian citizens who want to pay their taxes, who 
want to comply with the law and end up feeling as though they 
have been shafted.  What do they do with their income tax the 
next year?  They do everything they possibly can and sometimes 
they slip into very grey areas of trying to avoid tax.  They say 
“I am going to hide whatever I can from those people”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a responsible member of parliament, I would never, ever 
countenance or counsel that and I mean that in all seriousness. 
But I must say as a human being I understand that kind of 
reaction and emotion when people feel that it is simply unfair 
and say “I am being treated unfairly so I will treat the tax 
department unfairly”.  It is an ever growing and an ever 
encroaching problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us deal specifically with Bill C-72.  I would like to read 
something on page 34 of this 155 page document. It is a bit long, 
but it indicates how the act is so completely twisted, 
convoluted, mixed up and creates so many pockets which the tax 
people in Revenue Canada have the ability to work in so many 
different areas of interpretation.

with.  It has to do with what I know the parliamentary secretary 
is going to wax eloquent about, how the Liberals have been 
cutting back on increasing allowances and taking, how many was 
it, 400,000 people off the income tax rolls and all the rest of 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He and the Minister of Finance, instead of all these layers of 
convolution on convolution, should simply do that which needs to 
be done.  Index the basic exemptions going back to the time when 
the Progressive Conservative government in its wisdom decided to 
deindex.  Give people proper basic exemptions.  They would be 
able to take more than 400,000 people off the tax rolls and those 
people would be the people who would be needing it the most.

people even in low income brackets make the people at H&R Block 
rich.  People have to go to some kind of a tax accountant even to 
fill in the most basic form and it is because of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not simply do what is right?  Allow people to keep income in 
their pockets, particularly people at the low end of the scale. 
It has always been and will always be the position of the Reform 
Party that money in the hands of the taxpayers is far more 
productive than it will ever be in the hands of the Minister of 
Finance or the bureaucracy this government represents.

In this case this is precisely what we are coming up with.  Leave 
money in the hands of Canadians.  It is they who buy the running 
shoes for their kids.  It is they who make the decisions about 
what kind of food the children will eat.  It is they who make all 
sorts of purchasing decisions.  Leave the money in the hands of 
the people, particularly the people at the low end of the income

the economy. Instead, the government continues to grab and grab. 
It basically rips off money from the pockets of the poor.

makes the onion that much bigger.  Even if we were to peel this

would be back a little farther. We would have to take a big 
carving knife to this onion to get to a point where ordinary 
citizens could feel confident that when they pay their taxes it 
is in a fair, just and equitable way.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He read from the Income Tax Act, which is always a useful thing 
to do to point out how convoluted the act is and why people have 
to hire tax accountants and tax lawyers to do the most simple tax

</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my friend is concerned about the growth of the 
underground economy.  Many people have decided not to carry on 
business transactions above the table but to do it below the 
table.  This results in a significant loss of revenue to the 
national treasury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the reason so many people have decided to go into the 
underground economy a reflection of people's loss of faith in the 
fairness of our present tax system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is an unusual time when 
we have Reformers and NDPers agreeing on things.  It is like the 
lion and the lamb running side by side from a fire.  I am the 
lamb. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not agree with the member more.  The people of Canada 
clearly have lost confidence in the income tax system from the 
perspective of fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the hated GST, goods and services tax, which the Prime 
Minister pledged in the 1993 campaign he would overturn.  Of 
course he did not keep that promise.  The hated GST is probably 
one of the greatest reasons for the submersion of much of 
Canada's economy. The way the federal government chose to 
administer the GST is convoluted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if we were to have a debate about the efficacy of the GST, 
that would be one thing.  But surely to goodness even Liberal 
members in the House would have to agree that the simple way the 
provincial sales taxes are administered versus the convoluted way 
the GST is administered is one of the main reasons people are 
going underground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In comparison to the Prime Minister, it is to the present 
finance minister's credit that he had the graciousness to admit 
he had not kept his promise on the GST. 
Then when he turned around and brought in what was called the 
harmonized sales tax for three out of the four provinces in 
Atlantic Canada, it exacerbated the problem.

I want to congratulate the member for winning the Masters golf 
tournament last weekend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that there will always be scope for improvement 
in and debate about a tax system.  That is the nature of the 
beast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have sympathy for the member with respect to the convoluted 
nature of our system.  However, in the examples which he cited 
some of the convolutions arise out of a concern to deal with 
every possible case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, if it has to with child care, we think of all the 
possibilities or the unusual circumstances that might exist so 
that people can get some tax benefit for child care.  When we 
start thinking about all the possibilities in Canada and all the 
needs, then it gets more and more complicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member about the sections he quoted.  However, 
at some point when we consider all of these possibilities 
someone should stand back, simplify it and explain it for what it 
is because the purpose is to help people get child care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inevitably there will be debate and complexities.  However, 
there are all sorts of mechanisms built in whereby taxpayers can 
become involved in the process, have their case heard and 
debated.  Also there is great opportunity for members of 
parliament to intercede.  We can intercede on behalf of our 
constituents.  I understand that the member has been doing so. We 
can speak in the House.  We can speak in committee.  Gradually we 
can improve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the member is a bit more general than that.  I 
know the tax system is designed to collect money.  I know we need 
that money for health programs, for transportation systems or 
whatever the program.  I understand that and the example which he 
quoted is as good a case as I can think of.  However, I also see 
the tax system as a way of improving social justice and effecting 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the child care tax credit may make the tax system 
more complicated, but it is there to help the children of the 
poorest families in the land.  Then we have the registered 
educational savings program whereby not only can families get tax 
credits so their children can go on to college or university, 
they can also get grants.  The money they put aside is not taxed 
so it can be eventually used for educational expenses.  In 
addition they can get a grant.  That is very complicated and it 
has to be put into writing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the member's views on the tax system in its role as 
improving Canada, as distinct from its role of simply collecting 
money? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is a very valid 
question and I appreciate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe what the Liberal government and Liberals in general 
want to do is effect change and mould society into their concept, 
their higher vision, of the way Canada should be and that they 
become involved in this quite consciously.  I am very pleased to 
respond to that question because we do not see it that way at 
all.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Reform Party wants to do with respect to child tax 
credits and things of that nature, particularly in the area of 
child care, is to give true choice to people.  As opposed to the 
social engineering that the Liberals have quite openly become 
involved in, we see the ability of Canadians to make these 
choices instead of the government imposing those values through 
the tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of child care we would open the opportunity for 
those parents who choose to have one parent at home to be 
able to make that choice without being directed, as they are 
presently being directed by this Liberal government, out of their 
homes.  Because of the tax system and the way in which the 
Liberals have designed the child tax credit, the choice for many 
Canadians has been made for them by these people who have this 
higher purpose which they wish to impose on Canadian society. 
The Reform Party sees that as being dead wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party wants to create a situation with a tax system 
that will be totally neutral so that couples may choose to have 
both parents out of the home working or one at home, or whatever 
combination or permutation they want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of one couple who are good friends of my wife and I.  He 
was very unhappy as a schoolteacher.  She had a very responsible 
position and was earning approximately the same salary.  They 
made the decision that he was going to become a home husband, 
which was a fine choice on behalf of their family, but they made 
that choice at the peril of their income because of the 
convolution of this government.  I think that is wrong.  The 
Reform Party stands for freedom of choice.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, a bill 
to implement changes to the Income Tax Act is something we could 
talk on and on about.  One of the first things we should point 
out to interested parties is that this bill will implement 
changes to the Income Tax Act for 1998.  As we all know, the 
deadline to file taxes for 1998 is fast drawing to a close, it is 
15 days from now, and we had all better have our filing done. 
This seems to me a rather odd time to be talking about 
implementing last year's changes to the Income Tax Act.  That 
begs the question:  Are are now filing under these 
implementations or are we not?  Are these implementations going 
to take place in the 1998 tax year or in the 1999 tax year? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at a little history about income tax.  Income tax 
was brought in as a temporary measure to pay the war debt of the 
first world war.  It was a very cunning operation because it was 
deemed that only those very wealthy people who earned over $1,000 
a year would be subject to this tax.  Because that did not 
include a lot of people, most folks said “What is the problem? 
We will never be making the princely sum of $1,000 a year, so we 
will not worry about it.  We will let those rich people pay it”. 
Of course it was only a matter of a very few years before 
everyone earned enough money to be blessed with income taxes.  It 
is the sort of thing that creeps up on you and bites you right in 
the pocketbook where you least would like to be bitten. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The need for a flat tax is greater now than it has ever been.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard people talk in this House today about the 
underground economy and what a scourge that is on Canada.  We are 
assuming, at least Revenue Canada assumes, that the way to combat 
this would be to bring in several more inspectors, auditors and 
policemen to harass Canadians into their patriotic duty of paying 
more taxes.  I do not believe that is going to do the job at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing and one thing alone that will encourage 
people to deal in the underground economy and that is a monetary 
incentive.  If people feel that tax rates are so high that they 
have nothing to lose by dealing under the table, as my friend 
from Kamloops has pointed out, then they are going to do that. 
They are going to take the risk.  It is simply a matter of people 
judging whether or not the risk is worthwhile.  The higher the 
tax rates, the more easily people can decide that the risk is 
very worthwhile. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that a flat tax rate would do a lot of things.  It 
would more fairly distribute the tax burden in Canada, and we all 
know we are in favour of fairness as far as taxation is 
concerned.  A flat tax would lower the tax rate for everybody.  I 
firmly believe that if we were to lower the tax rate, the rate of 
compliance would increase to such a point that the government 
would suddenly discover it is getting more revenue than it did 
with the higher tax rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Revenue Canada said it needed fewer people to harass and 
police to make sure it has compliant taxpayers, that in itself 
would be a net benefit to the government because it would incur 
less expense by not having all of these employees on the payroll. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all recognize that there has to be some general taxation in 
Canada in order to provide the services that the federal 
government has undertaken to provide to Canadians.  All services 
have to be paid for.  However, I very much object to the method 
by which the government determines that tax rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax rate seems to be set by Revenue Canada taking absolutely 
every penny it can out of the Canadian people and then setting 
programs to make sure that the money is spent, and then some.  By 
golly, in days gone by the government spent to the tune of $40 
billion more than it took in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now in a position where we are paying $40 billion, $45 
billion or $50 billion, depending on the interest rate, in 
interest payments alone for the party which has been going on 
over the past many years.  It is like paying for the pizza that 
we ate two weeks ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party thinks the government's plans and priorities 
should be set and then the tax rate should be set in such a way 
that revenue can be brought in to pay for the services that are 
demanded by the Canadian people.  That is the way we run our 
households.  We do not say to ourselves that we are going to 
bring in every penny we can, spend all of it and run up our 
Mastercard, so that when the Mastercard is full we can take out a 
Visa to pay off the Mastercard.  We do not spend and spend 
because we love being in debt and paying interest.  I do not 
think we would find very many Canadians who would go along with 
that kind of philosophy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the moment taxes are the biggest single drain on Canadian 
individuals and families.  Their tax obligation is more than 
their house payments.  It is more than their car payments.  It is 
likely more than their bills for food, shelter and clothing 
combined.  When the tax burden gets to that point we have to 
realize that people are going to rebel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are going to rebel in various ways.  They may not form 
picket lines on the street and demonstrate, but they may rebel in 
the way they comply with the tax laws.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am in no way condoning non-compliance with the tax laws.  I 
know that the government certainly has the upper hand and the 
last word in those instances.  It certainly is very onerous for 
one to be in a delinquent position with the taxman. I would not 
recommend that to anybody, but the incentive is definitely there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot help but think about the smuggling problem in central 
Canada. The taxes on cigarettes were such that it was very 
profitable for certain individuals to bring cigarettes across 
from the United States duty free and sell them in Canada at a 
huge profit.  The government's answer to that was to reduce the 
taxes on cigarettes.  I would question the methodology in that 
case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is willing to pursue or to investigate in that 
particular instance, why would it not look at the possibility of 
lowering the income tax rates for all Canadians?  Perhaps we 
would see, as I have suggested, better compliance and more actual 
revenue.  It does not necessarily follow that increased tax rates 
result in increased revenues. I truly believe we need a system 
that will emphasize tax fairness.  We need a system that people 
will be willing to comply with.  Fairness is certainly the way to 
go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had intended to talk about the unfairness that is involved 
with the government's plan to attach itself to the public service 
pension plan.  Unfortunately I am going to have to save that for 
the debate coming up sometime next week when that bill comes 
before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suffice it to say that one of the largest and most recurring 
problems we as members of parliament deal with in our 
constituencies is the unfairness in the tax system, either with 
the GST, with income taxes or various other forms of taxation. 
We have to act as negotiators or advocates on behalf of our 
constituents to try to get fairness out of the government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak today on Bill C-72, an act to 
amend the Income Tax Act.  The parliamentary secretary has asked 
my hon. colleagues on this side of the House to give praise at 
times when the government does something good.  I can stand here 
today and say that for things like the registered education 
savings plan, certainly a little bit of praise has to go to the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been my experience in life, and I happen to be over the 
age of 20, that what the government giveth with one hand, it 
taketh away with the other hand.  As a result, the net gain any 
one of us happens to get out of all these programs ends up being 
zero, or as we have seen in the past, we are actually worse off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budgets in past years have been looked at in that way by 
Canadians.  They look at the taxes they are currently paying, 
then they look at the program changes in the budget that increase 
some taxes or decrease others.  At times it looks as if the 
taxpayer is actually winning.  That is before it is announced 
that now there are some user fees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are fees that farmers in particular have to pay for 
government services that are legislated and mandated by 
government that are for the benefit of all Canadians.  Lots of 
times, as I say, on the one hand the government giveth and on the 
other hand it taketh away.  When it taketh away, it seems it 
taketh more than it giveth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example using gross figures.  In 1998-99 I think 
the federal budget, the revenues in any event, took in about $130 
billion.  That is a pretty big figure. 
Now we look one year later, and I have seen estimates that for 
1999-2000 the federal government expects to take in in the 
neighbourhood of $150-some billion, as high as $157 billion I 
have seen.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are paying much higher taxes. When I use the example 
of giving and taking away, we can see that the government 
continues to take away much larger revenues from Canadians which 
could be better left in their hands as they would spend it and 
make jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been expressed in the House by many members, a government 
should set out what its priorities are. It should set out what it 
intends to do, what is absolutely necessary the government should 
do that private enterprise cannot. Based on that, it should tax 
to the level which is required to pay for those essential 
government services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a tax system that takes away from Canadians tremendous 
amounts of dollars, billions of dollars, to the tune of $155 
billion in the next fiscal year. Then it looks for a place to 
spend that money.  That is what is essentially wrong with this 
taxation system.  We have the cart before the horse in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak for just a couple of minutes on what these 
amendments are doing for low income and poor people. People have 
low incomes many times due to situations beyond their control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers and ranchers fall into that low income level. Based on 
previous historical data, farmers end up paying in quarterly 
payments under the Income Tax Act.  At the end of the year, when 
they ultimately file their tax returns about 14 months later, 
they will get that money back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has had the use of that money for the whole 
fiscal year and the farmer has not had the use of that money.  It 
is the farmer's money in the first place.  Finally, he gets to 
put in a tax return and get some of that money back, probably in 
many cases all of it back. Certainly people making $12,000 to 
$16,000 get most of their tax money back, but in the meantime 
that money has been used by the government. That tax rebate gains 
no interest while the government has it so the taxpayer does not 
benefit from that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrast that with a situation where the same low income 
taxpayer happens to cash in a small RRSP or they get a payment. 
In the Manitoba flood situation there was an initial $5,000 
payment.  That all becomes taxable. When the government is owed 
money by the taxpayer, immediately that is determined to be owed, 
it is my understanding that 9% per day is put on the outstanding 
amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not figured out the actual figures.  But certainly the 
principle of the idea that the government can collect interest 
from the taxpayer but the taxpayer cannot collect interest from 
the government flies in the face of equity and reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see another problem. We are looking at amendments that could 
have gone into the Income Tax Act over the course of time but did 
not.  The amendments that should be going into the act should 
help the taxpayer and should lower the amount the government 
takes in from the taxpaying Canadian public.  It is always 
designed so that does not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will refer to the agriculture income disaster assistance plan. 
In that plan farmers have to do their accounting on an accrual 
basis. 
Many farmers are still operating on a cash basis, which is a form 
of accounting that is good for farmers who have straightforward 
incomes. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1125"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the AIDA program was put together, in order to comply with 
the various complexities of the Income Tax Act, farmers who filed 
under the cash basis had to convert all their records and 
accounting systems over to the accrual basis just to try to get 
in on the agriculture income disaster assistance program.  When I 
say they tried to get into it, it is not that farmers want to get 
into it, it is that they have had a disaster that requires that 
they try to find some way to keep their farms or ranches in 
operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are lots of amendments which could have gone in along with 
the amendments referred to in Bill C-72. I have already mentioned 
those other taxes that could be taken right out of the system, 
such as the user fees for government services that benefit all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another issue which has been partially dealt with, or 
there is a capacity for the Income Tax Act to deal with it.  The 
will of the elected members on the government side is what is in 
question on this particular issue. I am referring to the family 
trust provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians were outraged a few years ago that a well-known family 
in Canada, it was reported publicly, had removed approximately 
$750,000 out of the country without paying any tax whatsoever.  I 
suspect the figure is actually much higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not seen anything in the newspapers and I have not been 
advised in any way that the Income Tax Act has been amended to 
correct that system.  I understand that there was already a 
provision in the act where the government could go back three 
years and look at those transactions and assess appropriate 
penalties and taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of all Canadians, I would certainly like to see the 
tax paid on that $750 million.  It was not $750,000.  That is 
peanuts to a millionaire's family.  It was $750 million, almost 
$1 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see fairness for the poor in this country as 
well as the rich.  The very rich are still not paying their fair 
share of taxes when we see these kinds of family trust provisions 
that only the rich can take advantage of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I praised the government for the registered education savings 
plan.  Certainly the government deserves credit for that. The 
problem is that someone making $12,000 to $15,000 a year cannot 
afford to put the basic money into those plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by asking that the Income Tax Act be simplified 
overall and made fair for all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as we draw to the end of this debate, it is imperative 
that I speak up on behalf of my constituents who are very 
concerned about the complexity of the Income Tax Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we listen to the comments that have been made by the 
Liberals, we as an opposition party feel it is high time that the 
fundamentals be addressed.  The complexity of the Income Tax Act 
is such that the average person can no longer fill out the forms. 
When people cannot understand something, they begin to lose 
confidence in it.  That is only common sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened with the Income Tax Act is that every year it 
has become more and more convoluted, more and more complex.  When 
people fail to understand it and cannot do what the government 
refers to as simple forms, they think it is not fair and they 
would like to see something done about it. 
On behalf of my constituents I am pleading with the government to 
look at an overhaul of the Income Tax Act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other evening when we voted I was really torn between voting 
for tax reduction, that is allowing employers to give their 
employees bus passes without making it a taxable benefit, which 
would have been a way to encourage less use of individualized 
means of transport, or voting for a simpler tax system.  That is 
the choice we had:  voting for a tax reduction or voting for a 
simpler tax system.  That is what it has come to and that is why 
we need an overhaul of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need both.  We need tax reduction, and the government knows 
it.  We are losing some of our best young people who are going 
south of the border or to other countries.  If we are to address 
the fundamentals of our economy, it is high time to look at 
serious tax reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was listening to the questions to us from the members of 
the government as we were speaking on this matter, it was 
abundantly obvious that the bureaucracy and the government in 
Ottawa are not bothered by creating a complex, convoluted tax 
system.  I would like to give a couple of examples with which I 
have been very familiar in the last several months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had the government develop a farm compensation package 
for the drop in commodity prices that farmers have experienced 
because of the subsidies other countries are putting in place for 
their farmers.  The government came out with a program, AIDA, the 
compensation package.  The government said that it would be very 
simple and bankable. Farmers would be able to fill out the forms 
in a few moments, send them in, and would know exactly what they 
would get. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The forms we have pulled off the Internet are 50 pages long.  It 
takes an accountant quite some time to fill it out.  Farmers have 
to go through all kinds of calculations and measurements, and it 
is not very easy to do.  If this is what the bureaucracy and the 
government regard as a simple form, they had better think twice. 
It is costing farmers $200, $300, $500 and up to $1,000 to fill 
out the forms, and then they may not even get anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same is true of income tax forms.  It is very costly for 
people to have somebody fill them out.  It ends up being another 
tax on them that they cannot avoid because they have to hire 
somebody to fill out the forms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing the government has done is to go to a gun 
registry.  I suppose the House is wondering how a gun registry 
fits in with this topic.  It is another example of how complex 
things have become.  One has to jump through all kinds of hoops 
and hurdles now to own property which one has taken for granted 
for many years.  It does not improve public safety.  It does not 
improve our lives in any way.  It is another complex form that 
people have to fill out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government defended this registry system and the licensing 
system that accompanies it by saying that it is no more complex 
than the Income Tax Act.  Let that sink in.  It is bringing in 
more forms, more complex things to fill out, and is defending 
them by saying they are no more complex than the Income Tax Act. 
The Income Tax Act is not simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I have, and I think it is the key question as I 
have listened to all the debate, is why has our tax system become 
so complex.  I listened to the defence the government has made 
for this complex system.  The Liberals and Liberal minded 
politicians, which includes the Conservatives previously and the 
NDP, want to manipulate behaviour.  They want to shape society in 
such a way that it will conform to their way of thinking. They 
will put a tax break here and cause this kind of behaviour to 
take place there by adjusting the tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw it very clearly when it came to giving benefits to 
parents.  Parents who choose to stay at home and take care of 
their children do not get the same tax benefits.  It makes the 
tax system more complex, but it is a way for the government to 
manipulate behaviour.  It gets parents to give up their children, 
send them to day care or whatever, rather than allow them to have 
equality, allow one of the parents to stay home and to do so 
without being penalized by the tax system. 
It is another example of how complex things have become and I 
think it is because they want to manipulate behaviour.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at all the things in the tax system that make it so 
complex.  At some point it can be traced back to somebody who 
wanted to cause a certain kind of behaviour to take place.  I 
would like somebody on the other side to reply to that because I 
am sure that is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to go to a very simple tax system.  Some serious study 
must be done on a flatter tax system.  We have to look at the 
province of Alberta which is doing a study now or thinking of 
implementing a flat tax.  The federal government should do the 
same.  The benefits from that would be enormous.  People would 
again gain control over their lives.  They would be able to 
direct their money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the government put the question forth: “Would you like 
to have a tax break if you can save for your child's university 
education and so on”.  Why have that?  Why not just let parents 
and taxpayers figure out where they want to put their money and 
how they want to manage it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the same problem in other areas, for example RRSPs.  The 
government is trying to tell us exactly how to save, who to 
invest with and so on.  All these things are ways to manipulate 
behaviour.  We have to do some serious study on how to reduce 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my constituency farmers are grossly overtaxed.  There is a 
real concern that many farmers are being driven off the land 
because they are too highly taxed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government will get the message that we need some 
serious tax reductions and that the tax system needs to be 
overhauled and simplified.  That is the message I get from my 
constituents for the entire month of April, at least, and 
throughout the year but it is not as intense as it is right now.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1999 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK63">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from April 14 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-71, an act to implement certain provisions of the budget 
tabled in parliament on February 16, 1999, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we 
seem to be dealing with money all day today.  First we had Bill 
C-72, an act to amend the Income Tax Act.  My colleague just 
talked about how convoluted and complex it was and about how an 
amendment to the Income Tax Act was long overdue, not to add more 
convoluted taxes but to try to ensure that it is simple and 
Canadians understand the basis on which they are taxed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People now have to sign tax returns and take the word of a 
professional that what is there is appropriate.  They really do 
not understand the basis on which they are being taxed any more 
because the rules are so complex. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have entered the electronic age.  A friend in my 
constituency, a tax professional who prepares corporate taxes on 
computer, finds that Revenue Canada requires the taxpayer to sign 
a statement saying that everything is true and correct.  Yet the 
tax return contains line numbers and dollar amounts and there is 
no indication of what the dollar amounts are actually 
representing.  However a statement is still at the end that 
certifying it to be true and correct.  It is just a bunch of 
numbers with nothing on the tax return of any kind. We have to 
start thinking about the concept of Revenue Canada that says sign 
our lives away even though everybody knows taxpayers do not know 
what they are signing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be interesting to hear what the Minister of National 
Revenue would have to say about that.  He should seriously look 
at it.  I wrote to him last week so I will be waiting with bated 
breath for his response.  Maybe not with bated breath because it 
will take a little time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are talking about Bill C-71, an act to implement 
certain provisions of the budget tabled in parliament on February 
16, 1999.  It deals with a number of things.  One is the 
trumpeted increase in funds to the Canada health and social 
transfer.  There is no mention here or in government press 
releases that this is a small replacement of the money that was 
taken away in a previous parliament by a Liberal government.  It 
states that the minister is authorized to pay $3.5 billion of 
those funds into a trust fund from which they will be distributed 
over a three year period beginning April 1, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance has started a new concept whereby he 
takes all the cash and puts it in a trust fund, a separate bank 
account.  Canadians not only cannot understand their tax return 
but now they are overtaxed, and the overtaxed money is sitting in 
bank accounts and is not even being used to provide services to 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general has been very critical of the government in 
the past.  He qualified the financial statements two years in a 
row saying that this could not be done.  Here is another instance 
of the government collecting tax money, putting it in a bank 
account and leaving it there to be distributed over a period of 
time.  First it was $800 million for the centre for innovation 
where the Minister of Finance wrote the cheque and the money was 
sitting in a bank account. 
As far as I am aware it still is sitting in a bank account 
providing no benefit, no research and no development for the 
taxpayers.

fund.  We put up this money through our taxes and it is now 
sitting in a bank account.  The students are not benefiting from 
it because it is not going to be distributed until after the 
millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This type of paying up front by the government has to stop.  We 
have another $3.5 billion to be paid out over a number of years 
but the cash is sitting in a bank account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After we add up $3.5 billion, $2.5 billion and $800 million, we 
see that almost $7 billion is going to get spent after the 
millennium.  This sounds great, but it also happens to be just 
before the federal election.  One wonders if there is a 
connection with spending this prepaid money just before the 
election.  The Minister of Finance has all these goodies and has 
been trumpeting about how the government is benefiting Canadians 
but he is bribing them with their own money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can then talk about the $11.5 billion that he will put into 
health care.  On top of that, there is the other $8 billion, 
which is on top of the $3.5 billion I was just talking about, 
that will be distributed over a four year period beginning April 
1, 2000.  It will be a year before we start to spend a penny of 
that and it will be spent over four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This $11.5 billion, that the minister takes great pride about 
putting back into health care, will be spent starting next year 
and continue over the subsequent four years.  If we take this 
five year period at $2 billion a year, divided by 10 provinces, 
we have a few peanuts.  This $11.5 billion is not an awful lot. 
Compared to the $20 billion that he cut out of health care, this 
is a drop in the bucket in return.  That is only one part of the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another part of the bill deals with the suspension of binding 
arbitration for the civil servants.  We wonder the civil service 
got a little bit upset at the collective bargaining process. 
When we take away the right to binding arbitration is it any 
wonder why the civil service gets a little upset and we have 
declining moral? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a government that does not want to enter into good faith 
bargaining.  It wants to say “We are the big heavy stick.  We 
are the government.  We will impose our solution upon you if you 
are not prepared to bargain to a deal that we are prepared to 
offer you”.  I would suggest this is pretty one-sided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we going through this farce of union negotiations?  The 
government has made up its mind on how much it is going to offer. 
We can talk a little bit about it but the civil servants cannot 
go on strike or to binding arbitration.  All we can do is talk 
about it and make the whole process look good.  It is a sham.  In 
the final analysis the government tells them to either take its 
offer or lump it.  How can that lead to good employee moral? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is also talking about changes to the pension plan 
and the way we calculate the benefits.  This morning the Minister 
of Finance tabled a bill in the House which shows that he intends 
to dip into the excess surplus accrual in the civil service 
pension plan.  This is going to further exacerbate the problems 
of morale in the union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government think it can help itself to all this 
cash and then stand up and say what a wonderful job it is doing 
in managing the finances?  It is courtesy of the employees.  The 
government is going to help itself to the surplus in their 
pension plan and the minister will say that he has done a great 
job in managing the finances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing is in part 5 where we are granting some bands 
the opportunity to tax fuel and tobacco. 
After reading through this it seems to me that natives on the 
reserves are tax exempt.  They do not pay taxes on tobacco, fuel 
and so on.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that we have had some debates over the years on 
municipalities wanting to tax fuel and things like that because 
of the high expenditure of maintaining roads.  They have never 
been allowed to do such things, but here we have this creeping 
concept of granting more and more taxing powers to first nations. 
I am a little concerned about that because the more taxing 
powers the first nations have, the more they have to be 
accountable for that money.  First nations today call themselves 
governments and want to be treated as a government, nut when it 
comes to the cash, they want to be looked upon as a private 
corporation and we are to keep our noses out of their finances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am aware of at least one band that is paying a member $1,000 a 
month on a stand-by contract to remove snow.  This is fine in the 
wintertime but I understand this contract goes for 12 months a 
year.  We cannot get this information out on the table.  We do 
not have them being open and transparent with their money, which 
they have to be.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
glad to have an opportunity to speak to the budget.  This is the 
first chance that I have had to share my point of view on what 
most Canadians viewed as a huge disappointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all thought that the bad news was over.  Stoically, Canadians 
suffered through years and years of cutbacks.  They were being 
told they could not afford anything even though we are one of the 
richest and most powerful nations in the world.  They were being 
told they could not afford the basic needs for a family to 
survive.  We were all sold that bill of goods. We were told this 
over and over again until working Canadians believed it.  They 
really believed and accepted that there was not enough money to 
go around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For seven, eight and nine years they suffered through this era 
of cutbacks, restraint and whatever buzzword the government was 
using at the time. This year was surplus time.  They really 
thought there was a surplus.  They thought they could finally get 
back to where they were in the pre-cutback era.  Even if they 
were not moving forward, they thought they could at least get 
back to where they were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, there was none of that.  They are being told again that we 
cannot afford the basic needs for a family to survive, such as a 
national daycare program.  How long have we been waiting for a 
national daycare program?  How long has it been recognized as a 
necessity?  To get more people into the workforce we are going to 
have to provide for those basic needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While driving to work in the wintertime in my riding of Winnipeg 
Centre, two or three times I drove by the same woman standing at 
a bus stop at 6.30 a.m. on a cold winter morning.  The 
temperature was probably 25-below, as it often is on a winter 
morning in Winnipeg.  This woman was on her way to daycare, I 
presume, because she had with her a toddler of about 18 months 
old who was wrapped up in a parka, scarf and mitts.  The child 
could hardly stand because of all the layers of clothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought to myself that this woman, to her credit, probably has 
to get up every morning at five to get this child wrapped up 
because she is standing at a bus stop at 6.30 with her child to 
go to work.  This woman probably has to take the bus all the way 
across town, drop the child off at daycare and then take the bus 
back to get to her job.  God knows what kind of work she was 
doing.  She looked to be about 22 years old.  This really drove 
home to me what an urgent need there is in this country for 
adequate, decent, quality child care that is affordable and 
accessible. No, there is no mention of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic needs and expectations of families was that maybe this 
year the bad news was over.  Finally, we are in a surplus budget 
and we will start spending on some priorities that people really 
care about.  No, that simply was not to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everybody knows that the child tax credit does not go to 
families on welfare, the people who need it most.  Our 
illustrious premiers are clawing it back dollar for dollar.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, the feds are making a gesture in the right direction. 
However, the program is so flawed that it is not going to wind up 
in the hands of the people who need it most, the people on social 
assistance.  It is being clawed back.  We lose dollar for dollar, 
at least in our province.  It is small consolation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are people, like that woman standing at the bus stop, who 
go from the day's drudgery to the evening's desperation.  That is 
the whole scope of their life.  They will take very little solace 
or comfort in the budget that we saw today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I say that the government is finally in a surplus position 
and could start spending on some priorities, one has to ask how 
it got there.  One way it got there is from the $25 billion it 
looted out of the EI fund surplus, the overpayment.  I will put 
this into context so people will understand.  The surplus in the 
EI fund is $600 million, a month not a year, above and beyond 
what it pays out.  It is staggering.  This again is on the backs 
of those who can least afford it, the most vulnerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unemployed Canadians are being denied benefits while this huge 
surplus is burgeoning.  This is how the fund has arrived at a 
surplus.  It is not going back.  There is no trickle down.  The 
only trickle down in this country for working people, if it is 
not water that is getting trickled on them, it is something else 
that is getting trickled on them.  It is no beach party to be a 
working Canadian these days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How else did the government get this money?  How else did it put 
itself into a surplus?  It stole $25 billion from the EI fund. 
Today the minister had the gall and the audacity to announce that 
he is going to steal $30 billion from the surplus of the public 
service pension plan.  The man has more gall than Ceasar.  It is 
absolutely atrocious.  The same piece of legislation, Bill C-78, 
also jacks up the premium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the plan and the actuarial research was such that the 
premiums needed to go up to meet the government's obligations, 
why would it not take it out of the $30 billion surplus that is 
already in the plan?  Why would it raise premiums and still pull 
out the surplus?  Should it not use the surplus to increase the 
benefits to these people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everybody thinks the public service pension plan is such a rich 
gravy train.  In actual fact most of the beneficiaries in the 
plan are women given the nature of the public sector.  The 
average woman with 20 years service collecting a pension makes 
$9,600 income from her public service pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government divvied that $30 billion up and gave it to the 
people who properly own it, it would amount to $30,000 per 
beneficiary.  If we spread that out over our retirement years it 
may be $4,000 or $5,000 a year more.  That would improve the 
quality of life for our retirees and our senior citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I caution the minister responsible for the Treasury Board that 
he is going to unleash a sleeping giant.  He is going to have a 
grey hair revolution, a blue rinse revolt.  We do not take the 
senior citizens of this country lightly.  We go there at our 
peril.  Ask Brian Mulroney what happened to him when he tried to 
de-index the pension plan.  They drove him to his knees and he 
had to withdraw. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing is going to happen here.  The momentum is already 
building up.  The people are already talking about today's 
announcement of Bill C-78.  My phone has been ringing off the 
hook.  They are asking me if the government can do this, if it 
can take the surplus from their pension plan.  Raising the 
premiums and pulling $30 billion out is reprehensible.  It is 
going to lose.  It is going to pay— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>   Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do believe we are talking about Bill C-71.  I am sure the hon. 
member will have ample opportunity to talk about other pieces of 
legislation when they come to the House.  I would ask him to go 
back to Bill C-71, or am I to assume he is in favour of Bill C-71 
since he has not said a word about it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  As the parliamentary 
secretary and all members know, the debate on this particular 
bill has been wide ranging, but I am sure the point raised by the 
parliamentary secretary has entered the consciousness of all 
members present.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it may seem that I was off 
topic, but if the member was actually here and listening to my 
speech he would know that what I was talking about was how we got 
into a surplus situation in this country and what the source of 
revenue was to put us into that surplus, revenue that we should 
be spending on the basic needs for families to improve their 
quality of life.  That is how we arrived at that.  The member 
would know that if he was actually in the House to listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about Bill C-71.  I will talk about the budget for a 
minute because everybody knows what a charade it is to bribe 
people with their own money just before an election.  It is 
leading up to an election year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First the government takes about $8 billion or $9 billion out of 
the Canada health and social transfer, and then it puts $1.5 
billion back and it expects thanks from everybody.  We talked 
about trickle down economics. We are getting trickled on again on 
that issue.  We are getting hosed in that respect.  It is not a 
trickle, it is a flood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody bought that.  That is why Canadians are disappointed. 
There was an opportunity to correct some of the historic 
imbalances in our social fabric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could use the tax system for the redistribution of wealth. 
It is one of the most effective tools.  In fact I think the 
parliamentary secretary pointed out in his speech that one of the 
most effective tools we have to deal with the growing gap between 
the rich and the poor is a fair taxation system.  However, there 
has been no effort to do that.  Instead, the only real reference 
to taxes has been to give millionaires an $8,000 tax break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this budget millionaires now get an $8,000 tax break.  The 
woman standing at the bus stop on the way to her minimum wage 
job, who does not have adequate day care, is going to take great 
consolation in that because if we have more millionaires we know 
that it will trickle down sooner or later.  We in the lower 
classes will get our share.  It is a good thing that more people 
are getting fabulously rich. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The growing gap between the rich and the poor should be the 
number one concern of this government because the shrinking 
middle class is a serious problem.  Our biggest strength in North 
America is a burgeoning middle class, a consuming middle class, a 
middle class that has money and coins in their jeans to buy 
things.  That is disappearing.  We are going to have the very 
rich and we are going to have the very poor, from the day's 
drudgery to the evening's despair.  It is a despair budget.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
delighted to rise in the House to represent the electors of Elk 
Island on this important matter of budget, taxes, debt and 
spending; all of the things this government just cannot seem to 
get right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was intrigued with the member who just spoke.  His remarks 
certainly underline the fact that the last person considered is 
the poor, long-suffering, bedraggled taxpayer who is every year 
dragged to pay his taxes, which are forced from him whether he 
likes it or not.  The total level of taxation in this country is 
so high that it is really very discouraging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard a number of different presentations.  On the 
weekend I was at a trade fair at Sherwood Park.  I was there all 
day, from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Saturday, and from 3 p.m. until 9 
p.m. on Friday.  There was an endless stream of people who walked 
by in probably one of Alberta's, and maybe even Canada's, best 
trade fairs, which is right in my riding.  The people who came by 
stopped to talk to their member of parliament.  The overriding 
issue that I heard was “When will we ever get rid of this high 
level of taxation?”  People are depressed by it.  If the people 
are depressed, there is no doubt the economy is depressed as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second issue that I hear is that there is waste and 
mismanagement in the system while our health care system is 
suffering.  I am going to get right to Bill C-71.  I know the 
parliamentary secretary, with all of the other 153 Liberals 
present in the House, is terribly concerned that the health care 
system should be fixed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will soon vote on Bill C-72, which will implement certain 
measures of the budget from last year, actually making law the 
things that citizens are already required to do by the department 
in filing their taxes this year. 
That is a digression.  I will return to Bill C-71, which is the 
bill to implement this year's budget.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that this budget and this bill does is to 
authorize the payment of some $3.5 billion for last year's 
budget.  There is not a business in this country that could get 
away with that in terms of trying to get rid of taxes.  Canadian 
taxpayers, individuals, small business people and large 
businesses should all have the ability to average out over the 
years.  That system has really been eroded.  We do not see the 
Liberal government addressing that question, the question of 
averaging over the last number of years.  However, the government 
does it, even though the auditor general says it is not 
permitted.  The government has loaded $3.5 billion from this year 
on to last year's budget so that it does not have to account for 
the surplus, so it does not have to give Canadian taxpayers the 
tax cut which they so rightly deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eventually that money will find its way into the health care 
system.  I suppose if I wanted to search deeply for something to 
commend this government for I would commend it for this health 
care budget.  Members may be surprised at that.  How could I, as 
a Reformer, commend the government for this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is like the day I was being robbed.  The guy was beating me 
with a stick.  He went through my wallet and then he beat me up 
like crazy.  In the end I thanked him.  He asked why I thanked 
him and I told him I was grateful because he did not take the $20 
that he did not find in my back pocket.  That is what the 
government is doing.  It has taken some $21 billion out of the 
health and social transfer and it is putting a little back, so we 
are thanking the government for putting a little back.  Of 
course everybody knows it is not anywhere near what it has taken 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I warn you to pay close attention because you may 
want to call me on being unparliamentary.  I know that I cannot 
use terms like deliberately deceive.  I cannot call members 
liars.  I cannot use any of those words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Elk Island is absolutely correct.  The member for Elk Island will 
not bring in through the back door that which he knows he cannot 
bring in through the front door. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  My apologies, Mr. Speaker.  I should not 
have said those things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to draw a picture for the House.  I was watching 
not long ago a debate in the United States Congress.  One of the 
nice things is that when members of congress give their speeches 
they can actually use charts, and they often do.  Their speakers 
go to the front of the chamber, they speak from the podium and 
beside them they have these big graphs if they are talking about 
budgets.  I wish we could do that here.  Having taught 
mathematics and computing for 31 years, I love the ability to use 
visuals, because it helps people to understand.  However, we 
cannot use props of any kind here.  We cannot display the 
Canadian flag.  We cannot use any props at all.  All we can do is 
gesture with our hands and hopefully communicate in that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will build a graph for hon. members, gesturing with my hands, 
to show what the Liberal government is communicating to the 
people versus what the truth is.  This is how it is doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When government members brought in this health care budget they 
said that they should put about $2 billion a year back into the 
budget.  That seemed like a good number.  Then somebody in the 
back room said that in the last five years they had taken out $20 
billion and if they put $2 billion back the Canadian people would 
complain.  They would say it is not good enough.  Government 
members had to do better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the gurus in the back row at their meeting said he could 
solve that by multiplying it by five.  However, they did not have 
that much money to put into the health care budget.  According to 
the guru that did not matter.  They would just do it over five 
years.  That way they could multiply it by five and it would be 
$10 billion instead of $2 billion.

Finance is required by law to stand in this place to declare for 
Canadians the government's plan of fiscal arrangements for the 
following year.  To enter five years into it is very, very 
dishonest.  It really is.  It does not communicate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want members to visualize a graph.  On the bottom of the graph 
we have 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003, for a total of five 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1999 the government is increasing the payments it is making 
for the health and social transfer.  It is putting in $2 billion. 
The graph is increased by $2 billion from what it would have been 
if there were no changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has a plan for the next year, which it has no business even 
talking about it.  It has nothing to do with this year's budget. 
It is a projection for years two, three, four and five to follow. 
In the next year there is no change at all, but it is still $2 
billion above what it would have been if it had not changed it. 
Then it is being increased by half a billion.  In the next year 
there is no change and in the next year there is no change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By putting $2 billion a year into the budget for two years and 
then increasing that by half a billion in the following year, 
which is the plan, it adds up all of those payments for five 
years and says they come to $10.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the press release say?  It said that this is a health 
care budget, that it will put $10.5 billion into health care. 
That is garbage.  I cannot use that word.  It is not accurate. 
Can I say that?  It is not accurate.  It is garbage.  It is a 
miscommunication.  It tells Canadians “We are doing this” when 
in fact they are doing that.  It is a deceptive way of 
communicating with the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of Bill C-71 concerns the implementation of the money.  The 
government wants everybody to believe that it is doing so great 
and that it is so wonderful.  It just ain't so.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there are 
a number of issues that need to be addressed.  No matter who sits 
in parliament and who sits on the government side, at this time 
in the history of the country it is very important that the right 
things be done.  It is time that the government stop to take a 
look at itself and at Canada as a whole to see exactly how its 
policies have affected certain regions of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am talking about my part of Canada, about the maritime 
provinces and Newfoundland.  It is time that it sat down to take 
a look. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are over 100 members from Ontario, some of whom have no 
interest whatsoever in what is happening in other regions of 
Canada.  Decisions are being made that have real negative impacts 
on other regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think back to the red book.  I will never forget the red book 
when the Liberals were running.  They were saying how they were 
going to abolish the GST.  We all know that the GST is still 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were going to abolish the GST.  They came into the maritime 
provinces and what did they do with the GST?  It was turned into 
the HST and now there are moms and dads who have to pay more 
taxes on more items than ever before.  A lot of those parents are 
living in poverty.  They cannot afford to pay taxes on the 
diapers for their little ones.  They did not have to before when 
we had the GST, but they have to now.  For all the needs of those 
little children they are finding it extremely hard, they truly 
are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I attended the public accounts meeting the auditor general 
said that the government was not doing proper accounting.  He did 
not just say it once.  He told it year after year that it had to 
change what it was doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is telling us how wonderful everything is.  The 
hon. member who just spoke referred to health care. 
He is absolutely correct.  Having had a loved one who was just in 
the hospital and knowing how the nurses with so many cutbacks are 
working so hard, I ask myself what we are doing.  The government 
talks about putting the money back into health care. In the next 
five years we will not have as much money put back into health 
care as the Liberals took out of health care since they came to 
power.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Then I look at the shipbuilding industry.  The government and 
all of us want people to pay taxes.  People want their dignity 
and they want to pay taxes.  The only way they can do that is 
when they are working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just the week before last week in the city of Saint John a group 
of business people came from Louisiana, U.S.A.  They were looking 
for people who could do shipbuilding.  They said that Saint John, 
New Brunswick had the most qualified people in shipbuilding 
anywhere in the world.  They offered 200 jobs and the men are 
going to have to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are they going to have to go to the United States?  Because 
this government absolutely refuses to bring in a national 
shipbuilding policy for us to compete around the world on 
contracts.  We could put 12,000 people to work in shipbuilding 
from British Columbia to Newfoundland.  There would be spin-off 
effects for the economy in all regions of Canada.  Companies 
would have to produce the parts.  It would put other 
manufacturers back to work as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking of over 200,000 people. They would all pay taxes. 
It would make it easier for the government to have a better 
budget.  It would make it easier for all of us to have a better 
living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if any of my colleagues on the government side 
have had little children come into their constituency office, as 
I have.  A little girl came to me two weeks ago with tears in her 
eyes to tell me that she had to leave.  I said, “Where are you 
going, darling?”  She said, “We have to move to the United 
States because there is no work for us here. I have to leave my 
nanny and my grampy and all my cousins.  But that is the only 
place daddy can get work”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what has happened to us in Canada.  I really do 
not.  I look at my colleagues and the government ministers and I 
find they are not compassionate any more.  We have an opportunity 
to bring dignity back to the lives of Canadians but we can only 
do that when the government is going to listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the House this week people from my party and other parties 
were talking about Newfoundland and the fishery. I do not know, 
Mr. Speaker, if you have been to Newfoundland but it is a 
beautiful place and the people are wonderful. To tell all of them 
they have to go to the United States is hard to take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for the Liberals to sit down.  It is time for them to 
look at my community which has lost over 10,000 people since the 
Liberals came to power.  It is because of their programs.  It is 
because of their budgets.  It is because of what they have 
adopted as their policies.  It has just about killed the Atlantic 
region, Newfoundland and Quebec as well. I am really upset. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is a shipbuilding province.  Quebec also wants to put its 
people back to work.  Just this past week we had the world 
curling championships in Saint John.  I had people from all 
across the country, people from Saskatchewan, people from B.C. 
coming to talk to me.  They said, “Please, get someone on the 
government side to listen”.  This is a most serious situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listen to what the government members tell me.  They say that 
the only jobs they have created are through free trade and NAFTA. 
Where did free trade and NAFTA come from? It certainly was not 
from the Liberals.  No, sir.  It came right from the PC party.  I 
have to tell those who are working that it came from those 
policies, not the Liberals' policies.

that has never happened before.  The premier of the province who 
is a Liberal, Camille Thériault, was condemning the minister for

will not even talk to them.  He will not even meet with them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is certainly budget day here on the Hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Less than an hour ago we were discussing last year's budget and 
the dollars that have been pre-booked into this year.  It is kind 
of like closing the chicken coop after the fox has already been 
there. We have less than two weeks in this fiscal year as far as 
Revenue Canada is concerned to implement the additions and 
complications that were added to Revenue Canada from last year's 
budget. People are already filling out their tax forms under 
those rules and regulations and we have not even passed them in 
this House yet. It kind of makes us wonder why we are here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to this year's budget, it is Bill C-71, an act to implement 
certain provisions of the budget tabled on February 16, 1999. 
However, thanks to the way this finance minister has taken to 
spinning these books, we actually end up talking about money 
spent last year, this year and into the future, and other money 
Canadians will not see for two, three or five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is too bad that while the Liberals are bragging about how 
well they listen to Canadians in their across Canada tours, the 
public does not seem terribly interested in keeping tabs on where 
their tax dollars go.  They know they go to Ottawa and then they 
just disappear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This system of prebudget and post-legislating has become so 
convoluted and complex that average Canadians do not have a hope 
of unravelling it before the next election.  Unfortunately it may 
take a slowdown in the global economy to accomplish this 
unravelling and really bring out the problems, but by then we 
will all be struggling to survive the past six years of so-called 
Liberal prudence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will refer to some specifics of this myth of prudence.  We all 
know that in theory the finance minister is only projecting two 
years into the future with each budget.  The problem is that some 
of his spending is still tripping out of the treasury five years 
from now, the so-called health care budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the millennium scholarship fund from last year get 
deducted from the 1998 budget as a $2.5 billion forwarded 
expense.  No one else in Canada can have that option. We are not 
allowed to forward budget like that.  It may have helped to 
alleviate some of the problems on Canadian farms if they were 
allowed to do that.  It is not $2.5 billion in reality.  It is a 
series of charges handed out from the year 2000 and on that will 
only go to a handful of Canadians, in the face of opposition from 
Quebec and other provinces and most of the student groups we 
listened to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not wanted out there and it is not needed since there are 
hundreds of scholarships and bursaries already out there from the 
private sector and other places. Why not top these up at a charge 
of $350 million per year only in the year the expense occurs? Why 
do we have to forward it into more and more years and book that 
$2.5 billion out of the so-called surplus?  I guess no one else 
can get their fingers on it that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not prudent to give away taxpayers' money against their 
wishes in a way that brings disrepute on the nation's finances. 
So much for listening to Canadians.  Do not for once think that 
financial experts from around the world are not looking over the 
shoulder of this government.  We see that in our stock market 
rises and falls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been compliments for Canada's sacrifices to get back 
on a balanced budget.  That strong economy and those sacrifices 
belong to the Canadian taxpayer, not to this Liberal government. 
It may take the credit but it did not do the job.  The minister 
has rightfully thanked the taxpayer for doing some of that but 
not all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is obviously a deep-seated nervousness about where the 
Liberals will go with this large gift of money that has been 
handed to them. The dollar reflects this.  It is positively 
anemic. International organizations continue to warn us that our 
productivity, that great buzzword we are hearing kicked about, 
and our technological expertise are slipping badly.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians who require years of training at public expense head 
for greener pastures because the government is too busy having a 
wild spending spree and thinking ahead as to what it can spend 
that found money on.  The government is too busy to notice that 
the money it is throwing out the window has to be generated by 
its taxpaying citizens and businesses in the first place.  So 
much for listening to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the House what Dr. Prudence prescribed 
for this country in 1997.  The projection for 1998-99 was for 
revenues of $144 billion.  The next year it was revised upward to 
$151 billion, found cash.  Now we are led to believe that in fact 
it may exceed $156 billion; just missed the target by $12 
billion, luckily to the plus side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those extra dollars were generated by Canadians.  Where do they 
end up?  Back in the hands of the original owners?  No, not a 
chance.  The Liberal government finds ways to spend it faster and 
faster.  When the government discovered that its so-called 
prudent projections were out of whack, it does not announce a 
more prudent retirement of the debt and it does not announce a 
more prudent reduction in how much of taxpayers' money it will 
skim off.  Instead the government announces it will prudently 
spend everything it has and more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an article in the February 24 <I>Financial Post</I> William 
Watson directs our attention to table 3.4 on page 57 of the 
budget documents.  This trained and respected economist says that 
before 1998 drew to a close, the government had $11.7 billion of 
extra taxpayers' money it had not spent yet. Great idea.  What 
are we going to do with it now? Typically it lists a series of 
items that magically added up to $11.7 billion and declared a 
balance.  Great accounting.  Mr. Watson called it disgusting and 
I am inclined to agree with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lesson we learned from this is simple.  Given money, the 
Liberals will spend it for us.  It would never occur to them to 
let Canadians keep it in the first place.  The Liberals have 
another trick that they hope nobody will ever catch on to. They 
have a habit of making virtue out of vice and spinning themselves 
as the heroes of fiscal prudence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Originally the government cut $21 billion out of social 
transfers over the last five years.  Now the government is 
talking about putting $11.5 billion back into health care. 
Billions. Big numbers.  Let us break that down.  As my esteemed 
colleague from Elk Island pointed out, if we divide that amount 
by the five years it covers, we end up with a lot lower number, 
$2.5 billion.  That hardly makes a dent.  It is the same cost as 
the millennium scholarship fund going back to a health care 
system that is in crisis across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a discussion with Dr. Hal Baldwin from Saskatoon a short 
time ago.  He is the treasurer of the Canadian Medical 
Association.  He said that it is not just money that was ripped 
out of health care across this country, the heart and soul was 
taken out as well.  We have not just taken the money out, we have 
taken the care out of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people are working handcuffed. The nurses association is 
on strike right now in Saskatchewan. It is not just money they 
are talking about.  Their hands are tied when it comes to caring 
for people, really caring, and putting that back into health 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a $900 million farm aid package that is supposed to 
impact my province of Saskatchewan.  It has had years and years 
of drought situations and people with no net income for three and 
four years.  Do these people qualify for any of this aid?  Not on 
your life.  There is no part in the equation for a zero, zero, 
zero balance.  That is unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of agriculture was asked the other day by my 
colleague from Selkirk—Interlake how many applications the 
department had received and how much money had actually gone out 
of this $900 million.  The minister talked about 11,000 
applications being mailed into Saskatchewan.  Well that is 
notable but there are almost 60,000 farmers in Saskatchewan.  We 
have less than one-fifth who have actually applied because they 
know they do not qualify.  They have a little off farm income and 
some custom work.  They have some livestock.

<A NAME="LINK71">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from March 22 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-68, an act in respect of criminal justice for young 
persons and to amend and repeal other acts, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to participate in the 
debate on the Bill C-68.  As the Chair will know, the bill 
carries a very illustrious title, a title that conjured up images 
of false hope in the past with respect to the ill-conceived 
Liberal firearms registration bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  You are very good at statements of the 
obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Statements of the obvious sometimes 
escape the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to take part in this debate for a number of 
reasons. There is a need for information sharing about the new 
bill.  We have been waiting almost an eternity, 18 months, since 
the bill was first announced.  I would be the first to 
acknowledge that the bill holds out some positive change, but 
after enduring numerous media leaks the March 11 release of the 
bill fell far short of much expectation that had been built up by 
the Liberal government.  This is really a light makeover of the 
originally flawed bill and tinkers somewhat with the edges of the 
original Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After testing public opinion on this controversial legislation 
through these now famous media leaks and off Hill press 
conferences, the justice department has finally enlightened the 
House with the introduction of Bill C-68.  As I mentioned, it has 
a very ironic namesake. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public wants to know, because this bill was supposed to 
consider their opinions.  In fact, the only opinions expressed 
were those of the minister and the Liberal Party. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned in my opening remarks Canadians across the 
country are concerned that the new youth justice act does not 
progress societal attempts at dealing with youth justice in 
Canada.  Many would argue that it is a regressive piece of 
legislation which hearkens back to the days of the outdated 
Juvenile Delinquents Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the Chair will recall that particular act.  It took 
the Liberals over a year and a half of consultation to come up 
with a very old idea that a repeat youth offender involved in a 
less serious offence could be tried as an adult and then 
sentenced as a child.  It is back to the future and back again. 
The Liberals have drafted a bill that does not go far enough in 
terms of protecting Canadians from increasingly violent youth 
crime in our communities. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1235"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT32"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT32"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1235

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps hon. members believe the Liberals have toughened up this 
bill on the back end by potentially placing more violent young 
offenders in adult jail and on the front end by diverting young 
people from the judicial system and into community based 
incentives like restorative justice programming or social 
services.  If this is what will happen, it begs the question how 
will it be paid for with the increasing cuts that we have seen to 
social services and policing services.  Once again the Liberal 
government is asking Canadians and those involved in the justice 
system to do more with less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation also encourages formal caution by police for 
young people who have been involved in less serious offences. 
This is fine.  I am sure many hon. members and Canadians will 
recall that there was a time when a police officer played a 
different role, perhaps a more respected role in the community, 
and often administered this type of justice at street level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How will we ask our police forces to take on this additional 
responsibility?  The government has already cut Canada's police 
force budgets to the point that they are now barely able to 
functions at some levels and barely able to hold up to their 
current workloads.  They no longer have the time to play the role 
of a parent and a psychologist, coming up with a well prepared 
and meaningful statement to warn a young person and consult with 
the parents.  Through the implementation of this act the Liberal 
government is stretching police forces and police officers beyond 
reasonable limits, and thus the increased workload I suggest will 
be barely possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sad result is that Canadian police forces and the public at 
large are seeing our police forces like the RCMP trying to fight 
problems such as youth crime and other complicated crime related 
issues with more and more cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year alone we saw $74.1 million or 13% of the RCMP's budget 
slashed.  We know there are further projected cuts for the coming 
year.  This type of gouging of the RCMP and other police forces 
is essentially asking our police forces to deal with youth crime 
in a depleted fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know there were cuts to transfer payments that then were 
passed on to the provinces and on to the municipalities, which 
result in police forces at the municipal level again facing the 
same serious challenges.  They simply do not have the resources 
to face difficult and complicated problems as they relate to 
youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The stress, strain and emotional cost as a result on our 
officers and law enforcement community are not calculable in this 
context in terms of monetary figures.  I only have to look at my 
home province of Nova Scotia and one community in particular, New 
Glasgow, where there are more officers off on stress leave than 
ever in the history of that police force.  Dedicated officers are 
off work simply because they have been asked to do so much with 
so little and the increased frustrations they feel as a result of 
their commitment to serve the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite obviously there are spiralling and spin off problems of 
asking police to do more with less.  What is missing most of all 
in the legislation is obvious.  It is what is missing in a lot of 
legislation, and that is funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at the bill tabled today by the Minister of Justice with 
respect to victims rights and increasing the role and the 
significant participation of victims in the justice system.  Once 
again I acknowledge, rightly so, that the minister has brought 
forward some improvement to the system.  However she missed a 
wonderful opportunity to put in place a victims office which 
would provide a central point where victims could go for 
information and receive the needed knowledge that exists for 
victims who fall prey to offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no wonder there is a degree of cynicism on the part of the 
opposition, and I suspect the public at large, as it relates to 
this bill.  The cynicism is perpetrated by the federal government 
downloading its implementation costs to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are forcing provinces to abandon their own youth 
justice proposals and follow the federal model by dangling a 30% 
funding in their faces and threatening to take it back should 
they choose to opt out.  If the Liberals had allowed for proper 
consultation in the first place, surely they could have come up 
with a deal that all the provinces would have supported with 
unanimity. 
Instead the bill resembles the sum total of many regionalized 
concessions that will make national enforcement of this bill 
virtually impossible.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were a number of commentary articles about the bill when 
it first appeared.  One in particular in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> 
commented on regionalized concessions by stating: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides considerable discretion on punishment, 
recognizing that provinces such as Alberta and Ontario want 
tougher penalties while others including Quebec traditionally 
rely less heavily on jail sentences. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That accentuates the point that we are looking in national 
legislation for a broad and uniform approach.  Yet the bill has 
built into its very context the fact that different provinces 
will react differently and have the option of opting out should 
they choose to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It begs the question are we not supposed to be working toward 
unanimity.  I know certain members of the Bloc might disagree 
with that statement, but surely the federal government has a 
responsibility to bring forward legislation which encourages all 
provinces to participate on a level playing field and a standard 
that should be upheld.  When it comes to justice, these justice 
issues are far too important to have built-in flaws as they 
pertain to jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By doing so we have seen the parochial fence-sitters that the 
Liberals often are on issues of justice.  Their new youth 
criminal justice bill tried to please everyone.  Yet offering 
these piecemeal approaches will please no one.  The public 
confidence will be further undermined, further fuelling the 
cynicism that exists about our justice system and about the 
effectiveness of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government did not go far enough in lowering to the 
age of 14, the age at which an offender would face adult 
sentences for murder, attempted murder, manslaughter or 
aggravated sexual assault, all very serious offences at the 
highest end of the Criminal Code.  The 14 year old age limit 
would also be a barrier for the justice system as it tries to 
seek justice against youth repeat offenders who commit other 
violent offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why were certain offences left out of the legislation?  It seems 
a glaring omission to me.  These piecemeal changes are obviously 
a response to an overwhelming public reaction and public pressure 
to toughen up what is perceived as a very light justice system 
when it comes to the treatment of young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have given the appearance that they have toughened 
the act, but I question whether these cosmetic alterations will 
actually achieve that desired result.  Why did the minister 
refuse to act?  That begs the obvious question.  She refused to 
act on recommendations that came from her own departmental 
experts, in particular when it came to the lowering of the age of 
accountability to 10 for young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a misconception about this issue from the outset. 
This is not somehow taking 10 or 11 year old infants and throwing 
them into jail.  That is not the suggestion at all. What the 
Criminal Code would do in expanding the envelope of applicability 
is that it would allow social services, the youth justice system 
and the justice system at large to work together in making an 
early intervention when required.  When a young person did run 
afoul of the law at the age of 10 or 11, it would give the police 
the mandate that they need to make an intervention and hopefully 
turn that young person around at the first possible instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the minister has chosen to ignore this opportunity 
against the department's advice that will not in fact happen. 
Once again we are told to rely on our existing social services, 
child protection and early intervention through child welfare. 
The sad reality is that the cuts to those departments in 
particular have been so heavy and so damaging that they simply do 
not have the resources again to act quickly in most cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to hold 10 year olds accountable for their actions 
and get them involved in the judicial process early, there would 
be more programs available which would fit the government's 
priority of rehabilitation at the earliest possible instance.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have to wonder why the minister has chosen to download 
this bill with such bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo and wording that is 
obviously going to be picked apart by the defence bar and which 
is going to be virtually impossible to enforce in some instances. 
Although it may be a terrific make-work program for the bar 
associations across the country, that is not exactly what 
Canadians are expecting or what they were led to believe was 
going to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, when it comes to the law enforcement community, what 
most police officers have said time and time again is that they 
are looking for a more streamlined justice system when it comes 
to legislation.  We hear this repeatedly from officers.  We heard 
it with regard to current offences under the Criminal Code as 
they pertain to impaired driving.  We heard it as they pertain to 
matters covered by corrections and conditional release, in 
testimony in that regard.  The department has missed an 
opportunity to put forward a bill which answers police concerns 
over this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has been described in many provinces as being woefully 
soft on offenders.  I am quoting the Ontario Attorney General, 
Charles Harnick, who on behalf of the province of Ontario 
expressed his concerns and extreme disappointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent correspondence he noted the following facts.  Sixteen 
and 17 year olds who commit adult crimes are not automatically 
tried as adults.  Even for murder, aggravated sexual assault, 
manslaughter or attempted murder there is no guarantee that these 
youths would be sentenced as adults.  Even on a third rape charge 
there is no guarantee that an adult sentence would attach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most serious violent offences still require a prosecutor to 
prove that an adult sentence is necessary.  To prove that it is 
necessary the onus is on the crown.  Jail sentences have, in 
fact, in many cases been reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that adult sentences are subject to early release, 
whereas a young person sentenced to a youth facility will serve 
the full time.  So there is a bit of a shell game going on when 
the Liberals try to tell us that this is going to be tougher on 
violent youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mandatory jail time is not required for youth who are convicted 
of an offence using a weapon.  Again this is an opportunity to 
send a strong deterrent message to those who choose to involve 
weapons in the commission of an offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario Solicitor General and Minister of Correctional Services, 
Bob Runciman, also said this of the new bill. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the people of Ontario have been asking for is legislation 
that will better protect our children and our communities, that 
will send a message to young people that they will be held 
accountable for their actions and would deter youth crime. 
Instead, the federal Liberal government has released a bill that 
has little regard for public safety and even less regard for 
providing meaningful consequences for criminal behaviour such as 
sexual assault, drug trafficking and use of a weapon. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This negative commentary is not only limited to politicians. 
York Regional Police Chief Julian Fantino had this to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many police officers, and citizens right across Ontario, are 
frustrated with the Young Offenders Act because it seems 
primarily concerned with the rights of offenders....  It's 
disappointing that the federal government won't take the 
opportunity to right this wrong and introduce a much tougher law 
to serve as an effective deterrent to youth crime. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a very telling commentary, particularly from an 
experienced and decorated officer such as Fantino. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Deterrence is certainly a factor that has to be brought into 
consideration, not only with youth crime, but with all crime. 
This bill is very soft with respect to deterrence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth criminal justice act's definition of a serious violent 
offence is so vague that it is virtually useless.  The discretion 
that is there is there for a reason and, unlike my friends in the 
Reform Party, I have some faith in our judiciary to offer correct 
discretion on crime.  However, when it comes to an issue such as 
this, when it comes to deterrence, there is a real concern that 
this bill does not allow judges to go the distance that they 
would. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In no case is an adult sentence automatic under this new 
legislation.  Even in the case of first degree murder a young 
person could avoid an adult sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following offences are but a few that are not presumed 
serious enough to warrant adult sentences:  armed robbery, sexual 
assault and drug trafficking.  These are not deemed to be serious 
enough to carry an automatic adult sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A young person can commit three serious violent offences— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there seems to be another 
debate going on at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  There does appear to be another 
debate, but I can certainly hear the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  Of course I am enjoying his 
remarks, as I am sure all hon. members are.  His remarks may be 
provoking the debate.

chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A young person can commit three serious violent offences with 
still no guarantee of an adult sentence attaching.  That is 
absolutely shocking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Repeat offenders of non-violent crimes are not assumed to 
receive adult sentences.  That again is built-in discretion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also an omission in this bill with respect to victim 
fine surcharges attaching to youth criminals when they have the 
ability to pay.  It begs the question:  Why would we not want to 
build in that level of accountability, that a young person would 
have to repay the person against whom they have committed the 
offence?  There should be a built-in victim fine surcharge for 
those types of property offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering this soft approach, the following scenario I will 
put forward would be possible under this new youth criminal 
justice act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A 17 year old who robs a bank, kills a customer and is found 
guilty of murder can still receive a youth lenient sentence. 
Other soft approaches embodied in this legislation would include 
most serious violent offences requiring proof from a prosecutor 
that they should be transferred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A young person who has committed a break and enter using a gun 
is sentenced to a youth crime unless it can be shown that an 
adult sentence is justified.  Furthermore, sentences such as this 
might involve not spending a day in jail.  Sentences such as this 
do not send the proper message to our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario is not the only province that is a little upset and 
disappointed with this bill.  The Manitoba justice minister, Vic 
Toews, said that essentially his dissatisfaction stemmed from the 
fact that there is little in the package to address the mounting 
problem of young offenders under the age of 12.  Mr. Toews also 
berated the federal government for its lack of consultation with 
the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was also very concerned about the downloading of the cost of 
the administration of this.  We know that currently the federal 
government is only picking up a meagre 30% of the administrative 
costs of the current act and there is no commitment to picking up 
further costs with respect to the administration of this act, 
which will of course be even more onerous than the last. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is ample time to debate this further and we will be 
hearing from the minister at committee, which we anxiously 
await.  I appreciate the indulgence of the Chair.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I listened with interest to my friend's remarks and certainly 
there were a tremendous number of them with which I could agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it strikes me as passing strange that this piece of 
legislation—which replaces the current Young Offenders Act, 
which I agree with him has some tremendous deficiencies—is 
legislation which the former government could have brought in 
during the nine years it sat on the other side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my friend is one of the new breed of Conservatives, so 
they say, and certainly we do not like to revisit history.  I am 
sure that my friend is very genuine, but I find somewhat 
ingenuous the concept that he would be speaking on behalf of a 
party that had the reins of power for nine years, when probably 
the most grievous problems surrounding the deficient Young 
Offenders Act were in place, and yet the predecessor to this 
government, which was his party, which was reduced to two seats, 
did not do anything about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has changed?  Is this the all new Conservative Party?  Why 
did the Progressive Conservatives not do something about it?  I 
know when I was being asked to run by people in my constituency I 
was surprised at the time at the antipathy which existed toward 
the Young Offenders Act.  It was number one on the hit parade of 
the people who were approaching me and telling me I had to go to 
Ottawa to do something about it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that in spite of the fact that the Liberals have held 
that side of the House since the election of 1993, it has taken 
from 1993 to 1999 for the second justice minister to finally come 
forward with this legislation.  However, I wonder why his party 
did not get around to doing it before? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question and I respect the work that he does within the 
justice committee.  However, I cannot help but sense the 
frustration in his voice, knowing that his party will never be in 
power to make such changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also know, as the hon. member sits in criticism of the 
previous Progressive Conservative administration, that he was 
very much a supporter of that party at one time and an active 
member of the Progressive Conservative Party.  We are certainly 
hoping that he will be back to support us.  When he talks about 
missed opportunities, I guess the Reform Party is living it, 
while we are looking to the future and rebuilding this party.  We 
look forward to having an opportunity to sit on the government 
side, as we have in the past.  With such a long and stoic 
history, the Progressive Conservative Party will be given an 
opportunity to make some of the changes which we are suggesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to an opportunity to accomplish those things on 
the government side and I hope that the hon. member will be 
joining the Progressive Conservative Party soon so he can partake 
in those changes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
those who do not learn from history are destined to repeat it. 
Clearly my colleague should know that I was not an active member 
of the Progressive Conservative Party.  Unfortunately, at the 
time I actually believed in 1984, going back that far, that the 
Progressive Conservatives were going to do something.  They did 
nothing, except add phenomenally to Canada's debt load, thereby 
crushing all of the social programs.  While people were upset 
about things like the Young Offenders Act, his party, in its old, 
tired, traditional way, was just grinding along and not doing 
anything about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We clearly have a situation which is kind of Tweedledum and 
“Tweedledumber” between the Liberals and the Progressive 
Conservatives.  Is the reason that his party went from a large 
majority to only two seats that his party was not listening, that 
it was out of touch and that it remains out of touch? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we can all partake in a 
revisionist view of what happened and what led to the demise of 
this party or that party, but I would also remind the hon. member 
that it is easier to teach a new dog new tricks.  We in this 
party are looking for new ideas, new invigoration.  He suggested 
that we call it the New Progressive Conservative Party.  That is 
not a bad idea because what we are doing is trying to learn from 
mistakes of the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the biggest mistakes was made by those members of the 
Reform Party who completely abandoned the party.  Rather than try 
to make some positive suggestions within the existing context of 
what we were doing, they chose to storm out of the party like 
angry children.  They went off in a huff.  It might take 10 or 15 
years to heal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we are going to work past that.  We are looking at the 
positive things that we can do in this party, one of which is 
certainly to concentrate on positive changes to our criminal 
justice system which has always been a very important feature of 
the Progressive Conservative Party and will continue to be so for 
years to come. 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think we 
are a little off the topic of Bill C-68, which in this parliament 
of course is the Young Offenders Act.  In the previous parliament 
it was the gun control act.  It seems to me rather unfortunate, 
on behalf of Canadian voters, who sometimes have quite a 
challenge keeping track of what is happening in this place, to 
have Bill C-68 refer to two such disparate bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say something to the hon. member from the 
Progressive Party who just spoke.  I really think that instead of 
arguing with each other we need to start recognizing that we 
have a serious problem on that side of the House.  We have 
budgetary matters and things that are completely out of control, 
and spin doctoring to try to communicate to Canadians something 
quite different from the facts.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a justice system which is limping along.  It has been 
five or six years since the Liberals took office in 1993.  The 
reason for this is that the previous Conservative government did 
not do its job well.  That is the reality.  As a matter of fact, 
the Reform Party and perhaps the Bloc were simply what happened 
when there was a vacuum on behalf of what Canadian people really 
wanted.  They were not getting it from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish we could work together and give Canadians the option they 
so desperately need.  We finally have the bill before us but it 
is inadequate.  After five years of dilly dallying in matters of 
justice it is time to give Canadians what they demand, expect and 
deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not want to continue 
the debate on this side of the House.  I would far rather 
concentrate my efforts on the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a score of examples that everyone can point to of what 
one government did and another government neglected to do. I 
agree we are talking about criminal justice.  Particularly we are 
talking about the Young Offenders Act which we all agree was not 
working for Canadians.  It is was not working in their best 
interest.  It is sad that it took six years for the government to 
do something about it.  I find that to be a complete abdication 
of responsibility on the part of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other examples of the current government having 
recognized good policies like free trade and GST.  Let us forget 
about what it said before.  We know what it did afterward and 
those policies are still here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can point to good things and we can point to a lot of bad 
things on the part of previous administrations.  Let us go back 
to Sir John A. Macdonald if we are to start blaming people for 
what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an evolutionary process.  At least let us have the good 
sense to try to improve upon legislation that requires 
improvement or introduce new legislation when it is needed.  That 
is where the government has been falling down.  It is running out 
of ideas to borrow from the previous government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
was thinking of seeking unanimous consent to let the debate 
continue on the other side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  I said “thinking of”.  We on this side 
of the House are witnessing certain Alice in Wonderland 
experiences.  The most recent evidence of bizarre experience is 
that the people of Windsor—St. Clair allowed those two parties 
to fight over 6% of the vote.  We think the people of 
Windsor—St. Clair have a certain element of wisdom in their 
insight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of Alice in Wonderland, Mr. Speaker, since you are as 
erudite as anyone in the House you will recall one of the great 
phrases in that book:  “First the sentence, then the verdict”. 
In some respects that is my reaction to the hon. member's speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will direct the minds of hon. members to the meaningful 
consequences the bill proposes with respect to serious and less 
serious offenders and I will direct my remarks to sentencing. 
Only a small number of people are involved in serious and repeat 
criminal acts, particularly acts of violence, but I say with 
respect that they seem to drive the agenda.  It is as if those on 
the other side of the House wish to set policy based on Toronto

</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997, 82% of charges laid against youth were for non-violent 
crimes like theft and breach of court orders and contempt orders. 
Unfortunately there are too many examples in our current youth 
justice system of young people serving time for minor offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We incarcerate youth at a rate twice that of the United States 
and ten times that of Europe, and we are soft on crime.  The 
figure when it comes to adults is entirely reversed.  The United 
States incarcerates adults at six times the rate we do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A fundamental question for all members is whether we are safer 
by incarcerating youth at a rate twice that of the United States 
and ten times that of the Europeans.  Are our streets safer?  Is 
our crime rate lower or higher?  Will “toughening up” this 
system of youth justice make our streets safer? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We incarcerate youth despite the fact that we knowingly run the 
risk they will come out hardened criminals.  It is trite but it 
is true that this is where these kids learn how to be real 
criminals.  We incarcerate them knowing that the alternatives to 
custody can frequently do a better job of ensuring that young 
people learn from their mistakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the balanced approach we have taken in this new act there 
is a clear distinction between serious and less serious offences. 
All young people who commit offences will be held accountable 
through meaningful consequences.  However the new act recognizes 
that taking minor offenders to court and sending them to jail is 
not the best way of holding them accountable and is often 
counterproductive.  I would submit that is frequently lost on the 
other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time judges will be given a rationale for the act 
and some sentencing guidelines.  Up to now they have been without 
guidelines and all over the map.  Section 37 gives the purpose 
and principles of the act with respect to sentencing and states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of sentencing under section 41 is to contribute to 
the protection of society by holding a young person accountable 
for an offence through the imposition of just sanctions that have 
meaningful consequences for the young person and that promote his 
or her rehabilitation and reintegration into society. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first purpose is the protection of society.  The second is 
to hold youth accountable.  The third is the imposition of just 
sanctions.  The fourth is meaningful consequences.  The fifth is 
to promote rehabilitation and reintegration of the youth. 
Subsection 37(2) states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A youth justice court that imposes a youth sentence on a young 
person shall determine the sentence in accordance with the 
following principles: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) the sentence must not result in a punishment that is greater 
than a punishment that would be appropriate for an adult who has 
been convicted of the same offence committed in similar 
circumstances. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That directly addresses the issue raised by the previous speaker 
with respect to the “shell game”.  It continues: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) the sentence must be similar to the sentence imposed on young 
persons found guilty of the same offence committed in similar 
circumstances; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) the sentence must be proportionate to the seriousness of the 
offence and the degree of the responsibility of the young person 
for that offence. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on further to outline various other issues to be taken 
into consideration in sentencing.  To review, subsection 37(2) 
states that the sentence cannot be greater than that of an adult, 
that it must be similar to that of another young person, and that 
it must be proportionate.

I draw the attention of members to subsection 2(1) dealing with 
presumptive offences or, as they have become known, the big five. 
It reads:

<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—a serious violent offence for which an adult could be sentenced 
to imprisonment for more than two years committed by a young 
person after the coming into force of section 61, if at the time 
the young person committed the offence at least two judicial 
determinations have been made under subsection 41(8), at 
different proceedings, that the young person has committed a 
serious violent offence. 
</UL></UL>

commit serious violent offences in a repeat pattern.  I turn to

opportunity to be heard, the youth justice court may make a 
judicial determination that the offence is a serious, violent 
offence (and it may not be in the top four categories) and 
endorse the information accordingly. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that finding is made on two separate occasions, the youth 
will be subject to a jeopardy that is not faced by adult 
criminals. In my view the minister has addressed the subsection 
of the youth population which garners the headlines in the 
Toronto <I>Sun</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 69 deals with presumptive offences and states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—If a young person who is charged with an offence set out 
paragraph (a) of the definition “presumptive offence” in 
subsection 2(1), committed after having attained the age of 
fourteen years, is found guilty of committing an included offence 
for which an adult could be sentenced to imprisonment for more 
than two years, other than another presumptive offence set out in 
that paragraph, 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We set out a presumptive offence.  An individual could be less 
than 14 years old and a sentence of at least two years could be 
imposed.  Instead of a presumption youth justice can make an 
order.  The scheme is coherent, rational and proportionate.  It 
is now time for the provinces, the judiciary and the lawyers to 
step up to the plate and make the system work.  The ball has 
moved over to that court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new act provides that in general incarceration is to be 
reserved for violent offenders and serious repeat offenders where 
there is no reasonable alternative that would be capable of 
holding the young person accountable.  Some judges have indicated 
that they reluctantly use custody for some offenders because of 
the lack of alternatives to custody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act provides new sentencing options that allow the judge to 
impose meaningful consequences that do not involve incarceration. 
These options include an intensive support and supervision order 
which will provide closer monitoring and more support than 
probation to assist the young person in changing his or her 
behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, an attendance order will require the young person 
to attend a program at specified times and on conditions set by 
the judge.  Also a deferred custody and supervision order will 
restrict non-violent offenders and will require an offender who 
would otherwise be sentenced to custody to remain in the 
community subject to conditions set by the judge. 
Failure to comply with the conditions can result in a young 
person being sentenced to custody.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These alternatives to custody are in addition to other 
alternatives that will continue to be available under the act, 
such as probation, restitution and community service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some respects the minister puts her money where her mouth is. 
The new resources allocated in the 1999 budget for youth justice 
are $206 million over the next three years.  It will be available 
to the provinces to ensure that front end alternatives and 
alternatives to custody are available.  In other words it is 
great to set it out in legislation, but if we do not put the 
resources with it, it is not terribly meaningful. This will 
enable the more expensive court process and custody facilities to 
be targeted for the more serious youth crimes that warrant their 
use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My submission is that this is a balanced approach.  This 
recognizes the concerns of Canadians to their safety.  It 
recognizes the reality that all youth offenders are not created 
equal and that some deserve a certain kind of treatment.  That 
treatment will in fact result in, it is hoped, turning out useful 
citizens to our society. 
<P><A NAME="LINK77"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I do appreciate the input that the hon. member for 
Scarborough East makes at the justice committee. I know that he 
takes this matter very seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do however question some of the statistics that he cites. In 
particular, he mentioned first that it was four times the U.S. 
model, then two times the U.S. model.  We all know that 
statistics on these matters can be very, very misleading when it 
comes to the human impact that a violent crime has on a person 
and the faith that a person has in the justice system to respond 
adequately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a few questions and comments I would like to put on the 
record with respect to the practical implications of some of 
these changes to the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My own feeling is that it takes a long, long time before a judge 
actually exercises the option of putting a young person in jail. 
That may sound contrary to the statistics that have been cited, 
but most young offenders I dealt with as a crown prosecutor had 
been before the court numerous times, occasionally for violent 
offences.  It took several appearances before the judge even 
contemplated that option of incarceration.  That was built into 
the intention of the act, that we treat young people differently. 
But when it comes to violence, if the only option of protecting 
the public at large is to remove the offender from society, so be 
it.  The first obligation of the justice system is to protect the 
innocent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the length of incarceration that young offenders 
will receive under this act, there is a misnomer that that in 
fact will result in longer sentences.  That is simply not the 
case.  With the presumptive offences, I would ask the hon. 
member, why is it that certain what I deem to be violent 
offences, offences including armed robbery, offences involving 
assaults and sexual assaults with weapons, are excluded from 
those presumptive sections? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This concept that there is a catch-all built into the act, this 
definition of serious violent offences and the fact that a judge 
can then exercise his discretion, does it not make it simpler for 
all to simply enunciate those in the bill the way they are in the 
original presumptive section?  Why would we omit some that 
obviously are violent by their very nature? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My last question pertains to this concept that alternatives to 
custody do not presently exist.  There are numerous options 
currently available to judges.  Those options are being exercised 
now as they have been since the inception of the Young Offenders 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are options like conditional sentencing, which is in my 
opinion inappropriate for violent offences in any event, not only 
existing for adults but existing for youth as well, and the hon. 
member trumpets that as a good thing.  Conditional sentences were 
never intended to apply to violent offenders. I take great issue 
with that, but I would be very interested to hear the hon. 
member's comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a final comment, I would also like to know how all of these 
changes that put greater emphasis on rehabilitation and community 
reformation, greater emphasis on alternative measures and putting 
the emphasis on the community services element now to help in the 
reformation of these young people, will be paid for.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry, but $206 million over that period of time does not 
even equal the amount that has been taken out.  It certainly does 
not allow these services any kind of an increase to match the 
increased responsibility they are receiving by virtue of this 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not sure if that was a 
series of questions or an additional speech.  Having said that, 
my hon. friend's crown attorney bias is showing somewhat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are trying to achieve a balance on this side of the House 
which reflects the need and concern about public safety.  The 
need and concern about public safety are something which we take 
very seriously on this side of the House. That is why we have set 
up these five categories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first four categories of murder, attempted murder, sexual 
assault, et cetera are categories with which my hon. friend and I 
agree.  We could go on to list multitudes of various other issues 
right out of the Criminal Code and my hon. friend and I could 
argue about whether or not those are appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has chosen for better or for worse a system which 
is basically a two strikes and you are out approach.  The two 
strikes and you are out approach is that this may not fall within 
the first four offences, but we are entering a conviction on 
offence <I>x</I> and if the offender is back on a separate 
occasion, then it will be offence <I>y</I>.  If the offender is 
back a third time, then <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> will result in the 
offender doing special time under section 2(1)(b). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a better response to the way in which we should go about 
recognizing serious youth violence, rather than simply getting 
out the Criminal Code and listing everything that is there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to one of his other questions regarding the $200 
million, I would like to point out first that it is dedicated 
money.  The second thing is that the 1999 budget put an 
additional $2 billion in cash back into the CHST, the Canada 
health and social transfer.  That is a serious amount of money 
for provinces to use presumably at their own discretion for their 
justice system and their youth justice system.  I would submit 
that is an additional amount of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My own province of Ontario received another $936 million right 
out of the sky which it was not anticipating.  It has used it for 
pre-electioneering of some kind or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  All money out of the taxpayers' 
pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  All money is out of the taxpayers' 
pockets. That is like saying the sky is blue, it is about that 
useful an observation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $936 million is money the Ontario government was not 
anticipating.  It will be profiled into the CHST and can be used 
for justice initiatives. In particular, it can be used for youth 
justice initiatives.  There are no strings attached to that 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, we put a further $3.5 billion into health care. 
Arguably this is a bit of a stretch on health care, but I would 
submit that a number of the offenders have far deeper problems 
than the criminal justice system.  These kids are there for 
reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with the fact that 
they punched out some kid in the school yard.  These kids have 
some real serious problems and that money can be used there as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would submit that the response of this government is a very 
strong response to the provinces and their needs to administer 
their systems. 
<P><A NAME="LINK78"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed 
the intervention by my hon. colleague across the way.  I always 
appreciated his voice in the justice committee.  It always had a 
logical and sound ring to it.  I do not know what if anything has 
happened to change that since I left the justice committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask him this brief question. This new act is 
being heralded as getting tougher on violent youth crime. 
This is as a result of the cry across the country from concerned 
people.  The government has responded to that, yet it has not 
mandated that the courts must apply the tough measures. 
Throughout the bill the discretion has not been left to the 
legislators but to the courts. Does the member have any concern 
about that? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1325"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, the publication of names, particularly of repeat 
violent offenders, is subject to the discretion of the courts. 
Attendance of the parents with their children in court is not 
mandated by this legislation.  It is also at the discretion the 
courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my hon. colleague have any concern about the status quo 
remaining because the bill is not mandating these actions?  In so 
many cases this procedure has been left to the discretion of the 
courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the short answer is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not a great fan of fettering judicial discretion.  There 
are certain points where parliament needs to give its guidelines 
in terms of minimum and maximum sentences or in terms of various 
other issues.  In this particular instance I do not know how one 
could draft a piece of legislation which says that x, y or z. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a crown attorney is faced with a youth who has committed 
one of the five offences, the crown attorney will give notice 
that he or she will be seeking an adult sentence for this 
particular crime.  Upon conviction there will be an argument as 
to whether this crime warrants the imposition of an adult 
sentence.  It is like Alice in Wonderland, first the sentence 
then the verdict.  That is that side.  We go for the verdict 
first then we go to the sentence. 
<P><A NAME="LINK79"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member for Surrey North has clearly set out where the Reform 
Party is coming on this.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth criminal justice act is nothing more than the Young 
Offenders Act with a facelift and a new name.  We will be 
proposing a number of amendments in the hope significant 
improvements will be made to protect Canadians.  It is our youth 
who are affected by this legislation; it is our youth that are 
most often the victims of crime by their peers.  Our youth 
deserve better from this government. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question we have to answer on behalf of Canadians in this 
debate is are their families safer under this renamed Young 
Offenders Act, the youth criminal justice act? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has been saddled with inadequate young offender 
legislation for a number of years.  Even the justice minister has 
characterized the Young Offenders Act as seriously flawed and 
easily the most unpopular piece of federal legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have become more and more disenchanted and concerned 
with youth crime, believing that our justice system is too soft. 
Young people themselves say to me that the majority of youth 
crime goes unreported.  I am sure that is something which could 
be reflected on by all members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After years of criticism and months of political pressure the 
Liberal government has finally introduced its replacement for the 
failed Young Offenders Act.  The new youth criminal justice act 
we are debating today repeals and replaces the Young Offenders 
Act and provides principles, procedures and protections for the 
prosecution of young persons under criminal and other federal 
laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For years the Reform Party has been fighting for better youth 
crime legislation.  Unfortunately the Liberals' new bill falls 
short of the hopes and expectations of Canadians.  On the surface 
it appears to be what Canadians want, but for every step forward 
they have taken a couple backward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the Liberals have changed the name of the Young 
Offenders Act and they have changed their sales pitch.  A close 
study of the new legislation reveals, as I say, that for every 
step forward there is a hidden step backward.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the hope of salvaging the most unsatisfactory legislation and 
making it work, I would like to draw attention to some of these 
issues. The question is what is missing from the youth criminal 
justice bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First off the youngest offenders are left out.  Our opponents on 
the other side like to go out of their way to place all sorts of 
characterizations on me and our party for talking about 
incorporating 10 and 11 years olds in young offender legislation. 
They can have their characterizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that it is because the Liberals refuse to see the 
involvement or the encapsulating of 10 and 11 year olds that 
those young people at that very tender age are being drawn into 
criminal activity without any way for the justice system to 
involve itself.  Their argument of course is to let the provinces 
do it; let somebody else do it; let the youth social system take 
care of it. In certain situations, that is inadequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new legislation 10 and 11 year olds will not be held 
criminally responsible for their crimes.  The government is 
leaving them to child welfare.  How can child welfare control 
violent criminals who quickly learn they are immune to punishment 
under Canada's youth laws? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about only the tiniest fragment of the youngsters 
of that age.  The reality is that tiny fragment of youngsters can 
wreak havoc on their families, on their neighbourhoods, on people 
around them, and particularly on youths of their own age. We want 
them brought into the system so that the system can handle them. 
They can either be rehabilitated or indeed, habilitated. Often we 
get mixed up between rehabilitation and habilitation. In many 
instances some 10 and 11 year olds that are involved in this very 
awful activity have never had the opportunity to learn what is 
right and what is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Liberal across the floor says to hang them high.  That is the 
kind of inane characterization I was referring to.  The reality 
is that by not bringing these young people into the justice 
system, by not dealing with these youngsters at that age, they 
are simply outside of the system.  They are preyed upon by 
youngsters and older teens to do their work because they are 
small enough to fit into places and slide under things and do 
this and that. It reminds me of Fagin and his hoards of little 
youngsters in the old musical play <I>Oliver</I>.  This kind of 
do-goodism by the Liberals is leaving those people and indeed the 
people around them to the vagaries of what may come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many serious crimes can only receive a light youth sentence. 
Many serious and violent crimes must be added to the list of 
presumptive offences for which adult sentences may be imposed. 
The Liberals have included murder, attempted murder, manslaughter 
and aggravated assault.  But they do not include sexual assault. 
They do not include sexual assault with a weapon.  They do not 
include hostage taking.  They do not include aggravated assault. 
They do not include kidnapping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In British Columbia we are very conscious of the issue of home 
invasions. Unfortunately some young offenders are involved in 
home invasions.  Home is the place of sanctity.  The place where 
Canadians feel comfortable is in their own homes. When their home 
is invaded it is a scar for them for the rest of their lives. 
The Liberals do not include that offence as being one that can be 
treated as an adult offence.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to continue the protection of society, to create a 
situation of meaningful consequences, to promote rehabilitation, 
habilitation and reintegration, this bill falls desperately 
short. Unfortunately the maximum youth sentences remain light. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be very clear.  I am very proud to say that the district 
municipality of Sparwood is in my constituency.  There are three 
people in Sparwood, although one of them has now moved to Fort 
St. John after being promoted from sergeant to staff sergeant. 
They are Judge Waurynchuk, lawyer Glen Purdy and the sergeant. 
Between these three people we have ended up with a situation of 
diversion. Property offences by youth in that municipality have 
been reduced from an average of over 80 a year to only six or 
seven a year.  It has been through a creative way of dealing with 
young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vast majority of young people can be handled intelligently 
and well by their local community with all sorts of creative ways 
of driving home the seriousness of their offences and what it has 
meant to the people they have offended against, even in a 
property offence.  These young people can be reintroduced into 
society and can become functioning parts of society.  I do not 
say this as a matter of theory.  It works.  These are real 
numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The exciting thing is that it does not just work in small 
communities like the district of Sparwood which has approximately 
5,000 people. We have seen it work in larger communities, in 
communities as large as Edmonton where there has been diversion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say one good thing about this bill.  It recognizes the 
idea of diversion. Having said that, we can deal with these kinds 
of offences not only in a humane way but in a way which builds 
society and pulls society together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are still those who will not respond. There are still 
those for whom there must be a system of protecting society from 
them.  They are by far in the minority of people who even become 
involved with the police but nonetheless, this bill goes light on 
them and that is wrong.  It is not fair to them and it is 
absolutely not fair to their peers and it certainly is not fair 
to society.  Even repeat and violent offenders may avoid jail 
terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform supports alternative measures as I just described for 
first time non-violent offenders, but we are dismayed that the 
government has not excluded repeat and violent offenders from 
this lesser form of punishment.  We do not want violent and 
repeat offenders to be serving their entire sentences in 
communities.  Sometimes it is simply not appropriate.  When you 
have to be tough, you have to be tough.  Unfortunately this 
government has not shown the backbone to handle that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, as a result of a lack of negotiating ability on the 
part of the justice minister or whatever, has not been able to 
bring a situation of establishing national standards with this 
bill.  As a consequence youth offences in one jurisdiction will 
be handled very differently from youth offences in another 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question we ask is why are victims not protected and why are 
violent offenders sheltered? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the Reform position on youth crime.  Serious offenders 
aged 14 and 15 and all offenders 16 and over should be tried as 
adults.  I said serious offenders.  The justice system should 
maintain separate young offender facilities that emphasize 
education, skills, training, discipline and community service. 
The records of young offenders should be treated similarly to the 
criminal records of adults.  Parents of young offenders should be 
held financially responsible to victims where lack of reasonable 
parental control has proven to be a factor contributing to the 
offence.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again this is something the Liberals love to jump on.  They 
choose not to understand.  I think they have some intelligence so 
let us try it on them for size.  Let us be very clear.  I will 
read it to them again so that they can understand the words. 
Parents of young offenders should be held financially responsible 
to victims where lack of reasonable parental control has proven 
to be a factor contributing to the offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals turn around and simplify that and ask how parents 
can be financially responsible for young offenders, full stop. 
It does not say that.  It is where lack of control has proven to 
be a factor.  That is where there has to be some responsibility. 
It is very clear and straightforward.  The devil made me do it is 
not a term that actually works in this particular case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has changed the name of its legislation.  It has 
changed its sales pitch.  Once the bill is carefully considered, 
Canadians are being shortchanged.  For every step forward, there 
is a hidden step backward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may take months or years after this legislation is brought 
into force before we see its problems develop.  In many areas 
there are provisions to satisfy Canadians, but the corresponding 
loopholes and openings for provincial initiative will bring forth 
criticism in individual cases.  Over time Canadians will realize 
this legislation will have done little to quell criticism and 
outrage over our youth legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had occasion to have an extended discussion with a defence 
lawyer.  He was pointing out to me as a layman going through the 
bill all the places where he could drive his arguments through. 
We know that the courts are doing everything they can to avoid 
getting into a situation of appeal.  He was saying that this 
legislation is convoluted, the word I used this morning when we 
were talking about taxes.  This legislation is so convoluted, has 
so much overlap, has tried to deal with so many eventualities in 
oblique ways and has done so much to spread around authority.  He 
showed me all the loopholes and spent about half an hour 
discussing how he would argue them. This legislation has the 
potential to be an absolute money maker for defence lawyers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have been saddled with poor young offender legislation 
for a number of years.  The Minister of Justice has promised 
legislation over a period of almost two years.  We recognize she 
has only been in that chair for two years, but her predecessor 
was talking about young offender legislation as well. We wonder 
why the minister could not have done a better job when we finally 
witnessed the results of her endeavours.  We will be proposing a 
number of amendments in an attempt to improve this most 
unsatisfactory legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government talks about a balanced approach.  We have no 
problem with a balanced approach but it must be done right for 
Canadians and not just for our criminals.  We see in this 
legislation a repeat of the question I asked of the solicitor 
general in question period yesterday. An example is the terrible 
murder case that has just been resolved by the jury in Toronto. 
Why does the government consistently lean in favour of the 
criminal?  Why does the government not put the protection of 
society first? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me draw attention to clause 37(2)(d)(i) of the bill. The 
first five words are “be the least restrictive sentence”.  In 
context it is “subject to paragraph (c), the sentence must be 
the least restrictive sentence that is capable of achieving the 
purposes set out in subsection (1)”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The largest single problem in Corrections Canada today is the 
phrase included in the legislation covering the incarceration of 
convicted criminals: “be the least restrictive sentence”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand why the government continuously puts the 
rights of criminals and the rights of those who would become 
involved in criminal activity ahead of the safety and protection 
of the person and the property of law-abiding Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was just leafing through and there it was: “be the least 
restrictive sentence”.  Unfortunately this is their pattern.  It 
is to the detriment, chagrin and denigration of society in Canada 
that this is the pattern of the Liberals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my summary I also point out that 10 and 11 year olds are 
still not to be held criminally responsible for their crimes. The 
government is leaving them to child welfare, but child welfare 
obviously cannot control violent children who quickly learn they 
are immune to punishment under Canada's youth laws. Reform does 
not want to lock up 10 and 11 year olds.  We want them to be put 
into the system.  We want them to have a chance to be 
rehabilitated before they develop more serious and habitual 
criminality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is a massive disappointment after the tour 
parliamentarians made.  An all party parliamentary committee 
recommended that 10 and 11 year olds be included and they were 
not included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a terrible disappointment that government members, given 
the opportunity to correct something that is so very wrong in 
society, have come up with a flawed, badly designed bill which 
will do nothing except give them a way of presenting a new sales 
pitch on how they will take care of the problem.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member lamented the inclusion in section 37 of the term 
“the least restrictive sentence possible”.  Put in the context 
of the legislation, he should go on to say the least restrictive 
possible to accomplish the goals of rehabilitation, restitution 
and all the proper components of sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that the member finds that objectionable?  If the 
courts are able to come up with a sentence that accomplishes the 
proper goals of sentencing, why we would want something more than 
the least restrictive?  What is it the member is seeking?  Is it 
appeasement of the popular opinion, the misconception that Canada 
is soft on crime?  Is it revenge?  Precisely what is it that the 
member is looking for? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am referring to the phrase 
which appears in the legislation that gives us the ability to 
incarcerate convicted criminals.  In taking a look at that phrase 
in the legislation, the practice is that the officials are 
directed to the whole issue of least restrictive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was at the Drumheller Institution last July or August.  We 
were looking at the fact that five criminals had walked away from 
the minimum security facility.  I got into a discussion with the 
warden and with other people at that institution and asked why 
they made the decision they made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to characterize their input to me other than to 
say I took from them that they felt compelled, because of the 
term least restrictive, to move people through the system far too 
quickly to areas where they were walking away from various 
institutions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am taking that phrase from the Corrections and Conditional

from the use of that phrase and the way officials have responded 
to that phrase.  I am taking a look at it in the context of this 
act.  I cannot help but come to the conclusion that we will have 
the same decision, that the least restrictive decision will be 
made to the detriment of the safety of society, which I believe 
is what Canadians are looking for.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest, as I always do, 
to my friend's comments.  I acknowledge the fact that 
approximately 25,000 young people are incarcerated in Canada each 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I can quote from the hon. member's speech, he was concerned 
that the handling of young offenders would differ from province 
to province as a result of the legislation.  That might be just 
paraphrasing, but I think is a fair comment to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the discussion we are having today and will probably have for 
some time, it is important that we keep as much balance among 
ourselves as we try to improve the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there might be a criticism, while there might be a variety 
of ways of dealing with young offenders across the country, would 
the hon. member not agree there are provinces that have dealt 
with young offenders more effectively than others and that by 
having this flexibility it gives those provinces which have a 
progressive and effective way of dealing with young offenders 
more opportunity to continue in that way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the comments of my 
colleagues are well taken.  There are jurisdictions from which we 
can learn a lot.  The province of Quebec has different societal 
values than other provinces.  The province of British Columbia 
has done an excellent job by comparison with other provinces in 
dealing with youth.  I think that maintaining a degree of 
flexibility is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is that in six years the government has not taken the 
opportunity to pull the attorneys general from all of the 
provinces together and come up with legislation that would 
reflect a better way.  There is too broad a scope still involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would fault the government for not having been able to get a 
stronger consensus of opinion.  I am concerned about the fact 
that because of that we will end up, particularly in the area of 
serious criminal offences, with disparate responses to those 
offences on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. 
<P><A NAME="LINK82"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the people of of Tobique—Mactaquac, New Brunswick, are 
sick and tired of violent crimes.  Since 1993 we have seen the 
Liberal government downloading services to the provinces with no 
resources.  It seems to me the government through Bill C-68 is 
expecting police forces, social services and provinces to do 
more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a great deal of respect for the Reform member.  Does he 
expect the same government to provide funding for the new Young 
Offenders Act? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of 
my colleague.  He points out that although the government is 
boasting about the fact it is putting $200 million toward this 
area, I believe the justice minister said the reason she was so 
long delayed in coming forward with this criminal legislation was 
that she was having something of a budget debate with the finance 
minister.  She got her $200 million and therefore felt that she 
was able to go ahead with the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree totally with the member on the issue that the government 
has been squeezing off, squeezing off and squeezing off the 
fiscal resources and the ability of the provinces to able to come 
forward with any intelligent kind of program, this program being 
part of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also very much aware of the constriction of resources to 
the RCMP, for example.  It is only through goodwill from the top 
to the bottom, and I say that without any equivocation, from 
Commissioner Murray to the constable on the beat, that we still 
have a national police force that is actually in working order. 
It is only their goodwill that is keeping our streets safe.

and the National Parole Board.

fight for accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week in Nova Scotia a Micmac group announced that it was 
planning to take its message to every reserve in Atlantic Canada 
by late summer.  Its message is clear to pressure chiefs and band 
councils to be more open, honest and accountable as well as to 
demand copies of their band's audited financial statements. This 
group has found no conflict of interest guidelines, 
accountability requirements and no means to deal with corrupt 
officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week in the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> a group of aboriginal women 
spoke out against the department's policy of transferring the 
administration of social programs as preliminary steps to 
self-government.  They say it is so mismanaged and misdirected 
that it threatens the democratic rights and freedoms of native 
Indians.  The $6.4 billion a year is simply not trickling down to 
rank and file natives on and off reserve.  Fraud, nepotism, 
intimidation and theft are the orders of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the minister finally listen to the grassroots?  It

Human Resources Development Canada, are working toward the 
revival of the area in my riding known as the Junction, which at

it took four divisions of Canadians, led for the first time by a

determination to defy the odds.  After weeks of practice on a

well-entrenched Germans for two weeks before risking a frontal 
assault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the time came to remove the remaining Germans from 
their superior position, the Canadians advanced slowly up the 
ridge behind a wall of fire provided by the Canadian artillery.

cost of 11,000 Canadian casualties.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in the House today to express my extreme

Guysborough county with the decision of the Minister of Fisheries 
and Oceans for rejecting an application from Seafreez Foods 
Incorporated, one that was requesting to harvest 1,000 tonnes of 
shrimp off the Strait of Canso. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As astonished as I am with the minister's decision, it does not 
compare to that of the 150 workers who were temporarily laid off 
only hours after the federal government's decision to reject the 
Seafreez application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seafreez Foods once employed 800 people.  Now Seafreez only 
employs a handful.  It is due to the lack of support and 
understanding that this minister and his government display 
toward the fisheries in Canso, Nova Scotia.  For far too long, 
the fishermen of Canso have seen fish being caught only 
kilometres off their peer to be trucked elsewhere by others for 
processing.  It is ludicrous and offensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fishing industry is the lifeblood of Canso.  With these 
fishermen not fishing they are obviously not working, which is 
precisely the problem.  The lack of work in Canso today is 
primarily due to the minister's illogical decision to reject 
Seafreez's application for increased stocks last Friday.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

which will lead immediately to the stopping of the bombing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope he will understand that it is in the interests of 
everybody that he withdraw his troops, that they stop doing what 
they are doing in Kosovo, so the bombing can stop right away.  I 
hope that he listens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were talking to a lot of people this morning.  For example, 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke with the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs for Russia to try to advance the case.  As any

peaceful solution to this terrible problem. 
<P><A NAME="LINK125"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the Minister of Foreign Affairs said that 
Canada had been involved in the development of this German peace 
plan for over a week.  Obviously, therefore, Canada has a role in 
promoting this peace proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What efforts has the Prime Minister himself undertaken to 
advance the German peace proposal, including within NATO where 
both the United States and the United Kingdom have expressed some 
reservations? 
<P><A NAME="LINK126"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as the Prime Minister just indicated, on the weekend 
there was a meeting of G-8 senior officials in which a series of 
proposals were examined.  They emerged, as the member calls it, 
with the German proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are now doing is engaging in a series of discussions 
among ministers and among capitals to see how we can arrive at an 
agreement on those proposals.  It is one thing to have proposals, 
the other thing is to get agreement on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a discussion with the Russian foreign minister this 
morning to determine how those proposals could be conveyed and 
communicated to the Serb authorities and to determine whether in 
fact they are prepared to accept them.  That discussion is 
ongoing and I hope we will have some positive results.  In the 
meantime, we will continue to work actively to secure those 
results. 
<P><A NAME="LINK127"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, surely we all agree that every effort must be made to 
bring Milosevic to the peace table.  But the Milosevic regime has 
kept its own people in the dark, both with respect to its 
ruthless policies of ethnic cleansing and with respect to the 
peace initiatives that have come from NATO and the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What effort is being made by Canada and its allies to 
communicate to the Yugoslav people, as distinct from the Yugoslav 
government, the fact that there is a new peace proposal on the 
table? 
<P><A NAME="LINK128"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, one of the great handicaps in this whole conflict is 
that the media is totally controlled by state authorities in 
Serbia.  They do not allow any form of communication other than 
the ones which they dictate.  Therefore, it is very difficult to 
get any independent evaluation.  We are in a democracy and we 
have a wide variety of opinions being expressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, I think there are very active presentations 
being made by Radio for Europe and by Voice of America to try to 
communicate the interests of NATO in finding a peaceful solution. 
We will get that information through to the Serbian people as 
much as we can.

That is why 85% of Canadians are saying in a national poll today 
that they want to see tax relief as the number one priority.

down taxes substantially in the last budget.

at this point in time it is impossible for anyone to predict

Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has it wrong.  I do not think 
anything has stalled.  I think the proposal has now been made 
public.  As I said, there is a series of discussions going on. 
The Prime Minister indicated his engagement with leaders of other 
governments.  I am engaged in discussions with my counterparts. 
We also have discussed this with the Secretary General of the 
United Nations, and the five basic principles he put forward are 
encompassed in this plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said to the hon. member's leader yesterday, let us give 
this particular proposition a chance to work.  Let us give it 
a chance to see where it goes and then we will determine what the

evidence that this peace plan has stalled.  Yesterday the foreign

resolution.  He said he was ready to consider this option, but he 
wanted the German plan to be explored first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that we know endorsement for this plan is limited, will

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I do not know where the hon. member gets his 
assessment.  My sense of it is that there is a very active 
interest in trying to see how we can gain agreement.  That is the 
essential ploy.  There is no point in getting a resolution from 
the United Nations, whether it is the security council or the 
general assembly, if there is not agreement by the parties to the 
dispute to abide by it.  We are trying to get that agreement. 
The essential diplomatic task is to get the Yugoslav government, 
Milosevic, to agree to withdraw his troops, to stop persecuting 
his people and to find some international force to make sure that 
implementation can be properly monitored.  That is the issue. Get 
the agreement.

yesterday the Minister of National Defence answered yes to

the LSH, are training for ground operations and peacekeeping.  A 
force of one infantry battle group, one recce squadron and one 
helicopter squadron was confirmed by the Liberal government 
leader in the Senate.  The Kosovo observers training in Kingston 
were told by the J-3 of an option of 2,000 soldiers.

I clearly pointed out yesterday that what he is relating to is a

developed at National Defence Headquarters and ultimately here in 
the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The training that goes on and the training he referred to 
yesterday in terms of the United States is something that has 
been planned for a long period of time.  It is part of our 
ongoing training, our inter-operability with the United States

been talking about in terms of Kosovo have been for peacekeeping 
purposes.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A 61 year old single woman who earned under $12,000 last year

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic issue is that we want to cut taxes as much as anybody. 
In fact we have cut taxes substantially for that person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has a supplementary question and she could tell us. 
Three quarters of our spending was on health care and education. 
Would she not do that?  We spent money on equalization.  Would 
she not do that? We spent money on medical research.  Would she 
not do that?  If her questions are to have any credibility, she 
should stand up and say what she would cut. 
<P><A NAME="LINK154"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
what we would cut is taxes.  And I do not think the minister can 
talk about crocodile tears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister knows that in his latest budget this woman would 
save a paltry $60.  The tax experts have confirmed that and they 
are no rivals.  She would still have to pay over $600 in her 
taxes this coming year.  That is shameful. This same woman also 
had to pay $9.77 in the federal individual surtax when she made 
less than 12,000 bucks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the minister to get up and give a supplementary

much money to him? 
<P><A NAME="LINK155"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

that that woman will be able to go to a hospital and get decent 
health care which she would not get if she followed the Reform 
agenda. That woman will get decent medical research for breast 
cancer which she would not get if she listened to the Reform 
Party. And that woman's daughter will get decent prenatal 
nutrition.  There will be children's programs which they would 
not get if they listened to the Reform Party.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise with great pride and sadness in this august 
Chamber to pay tribute to a man who was a great Canadian, a 
fellow Quebecer, and a former member of parliament for the riding 
of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce in the city of Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Edmund Tobin Asselin, known as Eddy Asselin to many, represented 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce in the House of Commons in the early to 
mid-sixties.  He died of a stroke at the age of 78 on Wednesday, 
March 24, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dashing MP, businessman and lawyer had politics in his 
blood.  His father, Joseph Omer Asselin, was the chairman of 
Montreal's executive committee.  His mother, Beatrice, started 
the Canadian Prisoners of War Relatives' Association after her 20 
year old son, Edmund, was captured during World War II. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Upon his returning home after being liberated by the allies from 
a German prisoner of war camp, the young flight lieutenant humbly 
called his mother the only hero in their family for creating a 
way for families to keep in touch with war prisoners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, his younger brother Patrick represented an eastern 
townships seat which had formerly been held for 30 years by their 
maternal grandfather, E. W. Tobin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Asselin's daughter, Nicole Asselin, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was more than a politician.  He was a man with a very big 
heart.  He was charismatic and charming, and had a joie de vivre, 
a love of life and of food and of people.  He loved to take care 
of people.  He wasn't a receiver.  He liked to give. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eddy Asselin cut his political teeth at Montreal's city council 
in the 1950s.  In 1962, after 12 years as a Montreal city 
councillor, Asselin handily won his NDG seat and headed to Ottawa 
to become part of the Pearson government, along with another 
first time Montreal MP named John Turner.  He was easily 
re-elected in the election of 1963. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Eddy Asselin's career as an MP was destined not to last 
as long as many of his colleagues.  He spent his few years on 
Parliament Hill tackling the problems facing growing urban areas, 
such as his own riding, but chose not to seek re-election in 
1966. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After leaving political life Eddy Asselin finished his law 
degree at the age of 40 and set up his own law practice.  He was 
eventually appointed to the bench as a municipal court judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his younger years he was a star football player at Loyola 
College.  He continued to promote and support amateur athletic 
associations throughout his lifetime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eddy Asselin is survived by three daughters, three sons and his 
fourth wife, Carmelle.  The funeral service, manifesting the 
celebration of his life, took place on Saturday, March 27, 1999, 
at the Armstrong Funeral Home in Dollard des Ormeaux.

those who knew him were saddened when they heard the news on 
Wednesday of his passing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Asselin was no ordinary individual.  Those who knew him, and 
I had occasion to meet him a couple of times in the city of 
Montreal, knew him to be a very dynamic and dashing individual. 
I think those are good words to describe him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I never heard anybody call him Mr. Asselin.  He was always known 
as Eddy.  He went about his business in a way which demonstrated 
a true love for life and a very generous heart for his friends 
and acquaintances, and certainly his family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was a dynamic city councillor in the city of Montreal for 12 
years and then he came to Ottawa in 1962.  He left a few years 
later, obtained a law degree and eventually set up his own 
practice.  He was also called later to be a judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He will be missed by all who knew him.  He leaves a great blank 
in the city of Montreal and in Canada.  He will be truly missed 
by his friends and his family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today our hearts, our prayers and our condolences go out to his 
sons, his daughters and his wife Carmelle.

<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the 
Progressive Conservative Party I extend condolences to the 
family of Mr. Asselin, former Liberal member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce in Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes without saying that all members of our party and the 
entire Progressive Conservative family are in full agreement 
with everything said about Mr. Asselin by those who spoke before 
me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before it was my turn to pay tribute to the man everyone called 
Mr. Eddy, I listened to the comments about his big heart.  I 
think this was an important part of his personality.  He was a 
bon vivant who fitted in well everywhere he went.  I am told he 
was forever receiving invitations to one event or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a young man, he fought in World War II.  That must have taken 
exceptional courage. 
I was struck by a number of things about him, one of them being 
that he was elected three times to city council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few minutes ago someone said that he was close to the people 
and greatly enjoyed working with those he represented.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no way—and I am sure members will agree with me on this 
point—that one is elected three times to city council without 
being very close to the grassroots.  Mr. Asselin was three times 
elected to Montreal city council and it was to his very great 
credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing that set Edmund Asselin apart was that after his 
federal political career he did not call it quits.  He set 
about studying law, opened a law firm, and was later made a 
judge. 
This says a lot about his personality and his readiness to 
tackle things with his fellow citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of all my colleagues I extend my deepest condolences 
to his family and particularly to all his friends who got to know 
him very well and very likely got to work with him on issues 
of importance to his community.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>YOUTH CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK236">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-68, an 
act in respect of criminal justice for young persons and to amend 
and repeal other acts, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie—Lincoln, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have the honour today to stand and address the House on an act 
that has responded to the concerns of Canadians, the youth 
criminal justice act. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are aware that the justice system as it applies to 
young offenders is not working as well as it should in a number 
of important areas, and that it needs reworking. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that it will take a sustained effort, involving all 
levels of government and many other partners, to tackle the 
complex problems of youth crime and to build the fair and 
effective youth justice system we deserve.  That process is 
underway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last June the solicitor general and the Minister of Justice 
launched the government's national crime prevention program. 
Since then millions of dollars have been invested in community 
based crime prevention initiatives across the country dealing at 
the front end with the root causes of crime, with a special focus 
on youth at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 11 the youth criminal justice act was introduced and I 
am pleased to participate in this second reading debate. 
Repealing and replacing the Young Offenders Act with the youth 
criminal justice act is the next key step in the process of youth 
justice renewal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new legislation will signal to Canadians that a new youth 
justice regime is in place.  The new legislation reflects the 
messages Canadians want from their youth justice system:  that it 
first and foremost protects society; that it fosters values such 
as respect for others and their property; that it insists on 
accountability; that it provides both violent and non-violent 
young offenders with consequences that are meaningful and 
proportionate to the seriousness of the offence; that it be a 
youth justice system that is inclusive, that engages Canadians in 
a response to youth crime, and that it does a better job of 
responding to the needs of victims; and that it be a system that 
offers hope to youth, that gives youths who get into trouble with 
the law a chance to turn their lives around for their sake, and 
the sake of their families, their communities and all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth criminal justice act includes provisions for more 
meaningful consequences for the most serious violent young 
offenders.  It expands the list of offences and lowers the age at 
which youth would presumptively receive adult sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the legislation is passed, youth 14 years and older, who 
are convicted of murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, or 
aggravated sexual assault, will receive an adult sentence unless 
a judge can be persuaded otherwise.  The judge would need to be 
persuaded by the youth that a youth sentence would be adequate to 
hold the young person accountable given the seriousness and 
circumstances of the offence and the degree of responsibility, 
age, maturity, et cetera, of the young person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, a fifth presumptive category for repeat violent 
offenders would be created.  Young offenders age 14 and older who 
demonstrate a pattern of violent behaviour would receive an adult 
sentence unless a judge can similarly be persuaded otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act contains an important change to what may be the most 
controversial aspect of our youth justice legislation, the 
publication of names. 
The debate on this issue essentially involves two legitimate and 
competing values:  the need to encourage rehabilitation by 
avoiding the negative effect of publicity on the youth versus the 
need for greater openness and transparency in the justice system. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1520"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation now before the House strikes an 
appropriate balance between the competing views.  It would permit 
the publication of the names upon conviction of all young 
offenders who qualify for an adult sentence.  The names of 14 to 
17 year olds given a youth sentence for murder, attempted murder, 
manslaughter, aggravated sexual assault or repeat violent 
offences could also be published. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation would also, however, permit the crown 
to give notice at the beginning of a trial that it will not seek 
an adult sentence.  This would mean that at the provincial or 
territorial crown's discretion the young person would receive a 
youth sentence and the young person's name would not be 
published. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth criminal justice act would also replace the current 
procedure for transfer to adult court by empowering all trial 
courts to grant adult sentences so that youth retains 
age-appropriate procedure protections and that justice can be 
provided quickly, placing less of a burden on victims and 
families.  This will also ensure that the offender, the victim or 
victim's family and the community see a clear and timely 
connection between the offence and its consequences.  Certainly 
in my consultations this was a very important factor for 
consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act contains other important reforms to the youth justice 
system.  In response to concerns by the law enforcement 
community, judges will be given more discretion to admit 
voluntary statements by youths as evidence at their trials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the concern of victims, victim impact statements 
would be introduced in youth court and victims access to 
information regarding proceedings would be improved.  Again, this 
is a very important aspect of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides for an increased sentence for adults who 
undertake to the court to respect bail conditions involving the 
supervision of a young person who would otherwise remain in 
custody and who willfully failed to comply with these conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides that provinces may recover the costs of court 
appointed counsel from parents and young people who are fully 
capable of paying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The record keeping system for youth records will be simplified 
and allow for greater access by authorized people in the 
interests of the administration of justice and research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of young people who get into trouble with the law 
are non-violent and only commit one offence.  Unfortunately there 
are too many examples in our current youth justice system of 
young people serving time in jail for minor offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We incarcerate youths at a rate four times that of adults, twice 
that of many U.S. states and ten times that of many European 
states.  We incarcerate youths despite the fact that we knowingly 
run the risk they will come out more hardened criminals.  Prison 
is a school for crime.  We incarcerate them knowing that 
alternatives to custody can do a better job of ensuring that 
youths learn from their mistakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-68 includes criteria on the use of custody so that it is 
used appropriately. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the bill includes provisions for handling less serious 
offences outside the legal system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The police would be asked to consider all the options, including 
informal alternatives to the judicial process, before laying 
charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Police officers, the key partners in this strategy, would have 
confirmation of their authority to use verbal warnings to direct 
the young offender toward an informal police program such as a 
family advisory group or a more formal program requiring 
community service or compensation for the harm done to the 
victim. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While every effort will be made to reduce the overreliance on 
incarceration, some youths will be sentenced to custody.  We 
acknowledge that.  The youth criminal justice act includes 
provisions that respect an obligation to ensure that all young 
people, particularly the most serious offenders, receive 
effective treatment and rehabilitation.  Successfully 
rehabilitated youths means fewer victims, restored families, 
safer schools, stronger communities and safer streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To this end, the bill includes an intensive custodial sentence 
for the most high risk young offenders who are repeat violent 
offenders or who have committed murder, attempted murder, 
manslaughter or aggravated sexual assault. 
These sentences are intended for offenders with serious 
psychological, mental or emotional illnesses or disturbances. 
The sentence will require a plan for intensive treatment and 
supervision of these offenders and will require a court to make 
all decisions to release them under controlled reintegration 
programs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation makes an important reform to youth 
justice sentencing to foster the safe and effective reintegration 
of youth back into their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new law, judges will be required to impose a period of 
supervision in the community following custody.  This would allow 
authorities to closely monitor and control the young offender and 
ensure he or she receives the necessary treatment and programs to 
return successfully to the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The period of supervision administered by the provinces will 
include stringent mandatory and optional conditions tailored to 
the individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill proposes a comprehensive, balanced and flexible 
legislative framework for youth justice.  It was developed after 
consultation with the provinces, the police, the bar, youth 
justice workers, youth themselves, victims and many citizens 
through numerous town hall meetings across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth criminal justice act is based on an accountability 
framework that promotes consequences for crime that are 
proportionate to the seriousness of the offence.  More serious 
offenders could receive adult sentences or sentences of custody. 
Less serious offenders will be dealt with through measures 
outside the court process or be subject to constructive community 
based sentences or alternatives.  The act emphasizes that in all 
cases youth should face consequences that promote responsibility 
and accountability to the victim and the community and teach good 
values by helping the young person understand the effect of his 
or her actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new youth criminal justice act offers provinces and 
territories flexibility in choosing options in some areas.  This 
will allow them to address the unique needs, problems and 
differences of their systems.  Provisions in the act also 
recognize the important role of victims and communities in 
dealing with youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next important phase of the renewal of youth justice is 
directed at the implementation of a new youth justice 
legislation.  Youth justice professionals, community members and 
others will need information about the new system and often 
training.  The best answers to the complex problems of youth 
crime lie in integrated approaches.  Effective youth justice 
involves educators, child welfare and mental health systems, 
voluntary organizations, victims, families, youth employers and 
neighbourhood groups; just about anyone who works with or cares 
about our children, our communities and our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Additional federal resources in the amount of $400 million over 
the next six years have been made available to support the 
important challenge of renewing our system of youth justice. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government youth justice strategy opens the door to greater 
involvement by the general public and professionals in youth 
crime, and I encourage all Canadians to get involved. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members of the House to support the new youth criminal 
justice act so we can put in place the kind of youth justice 
system that Canadians are seeking, one that protects society and 
instils the values of accountability, responsibility and respect. 
We owe it to Canadians and most especially to Canadian youth. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in the 
last six years I have come to the conclusion that the Liberal 
government is a list nut.  It has to have a list that applies to 
everything.  For example, it indicate by a list who the hate law 
applies to.  Under the sentencing bill, a judge must take into 
consideration certain things.  If a person is up for murder the 
last thing a judge has to consider on this list is whether the 
person is aboriginal or not.  I would like to know what that has 
to do with anybody who takes a human life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we come out with Bill C-68.  I am afraid to use that name. I 
guess the Liberals have attached that number to it to try to 
confuse the public. 
I hope the public does not get confused because this Bill C-68 is 
no better than the other Bill C-68.  Neither one of them is very 
good.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government came out with another list of offences for which 
adult sentences may be imposed.  It is severely restrictive.  The 
list includes murder, attempted murder, manslaughter and 
aggravated sexual assault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should sexual assault with a weapon, hostage taking, aggravated 
assault, kidnapping and a whole host of other violent crimes not 
be included?  Why is there just this restrictive little list? 
Would he support adding more violent crimes to this all important 
Liberal list? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the current Bill C-68 and 
the one in the former parliament are excellent pieces of 
legislation.  There is no question that we want to zero in on 
very serious offences, and we have done so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend is criticizing us for having a list.  He has his own 
little list.  All offences are serious.  At what point do we 
allow discretion?  Where do we draw the line?  They are serious 
offences.  Every offence is serious, even if it is the petty 
crime of shoplifting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to appreciate that our youth today do not necessarily 
have the maturity that our good friend from Wild Rose has as a 
former principal.  They are young and impetuous.  He should 
realize that; he taught them for years and years.  We cannot 
treat all youth like adults for all crimes.

<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened carefully to what my colleague from Erie-Lincoln had to 
say. I must admit that I find him particularly enthusiastic and 
really highly optimistic about the consequences of Bill C-68, 
which we are discussing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he really think it is an exceptional approach promoting 
rehabilitation to put our 14-year old offenders in front of adult 
courts, with adult sentences served in adult prisons? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can he tell me whether, for example, revealing the name of young 
people who are having problems and have committed crimes—but who 
are having the problems—in the papers is a help to the young 
person? We know adolescents often feel it is a big deal to have 
their name in the paper 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure my colleague from Erie—Lincoln can answer these serious 
questions. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member asks several 
questions.  First I will deal with the publication of names.  The 
debate surrounding this subject centres on two conflicting 
principles of legitimate and competing values.  There is no 
question that we have the need to encourage rehabilitation by 
avoiding negative publicity.  Opposite to that we have the need 
for greater openness and transparency.  Canadians have been 
demanding this and it contributes to public confidence in the 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned about individuals who have committed grievous 
offences and violent crimes and are not in custody.  We are also 
concerned about the safety of the public.  There is no question 
that 14 year olds will not go to adult prison.  They will go to a 
youth facility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we speak to some of the police officers, some youths at 14 
and 15 years of age are tough little characters.  Sometimes for 
the safety of the public they have to be dealt with accordingly. 
We have to look at the seriousness of the offences they have 
committed and make an assessment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The crown in its discretion can make a judgment call in that 
respect as well and say that a child should be tried in a youth 
facility.  There is an option.  I would say this would happen in 
a minority of cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note the profiles of young people in youth 
court.  Only 15% were 14 year olds and two-thirds of them pleaded 
guilty. 
Crime by 14 year olds is certainly not in the same category as 
crime by 16 year olds and 17 year olds as far as numbers go.  I 
do not think we will see many youths at 14 years of age being 
tried as adults, but there needs to be that option where it is 
deemed necessary.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I acknowledge the commitment of the hon. member to 
this issue.  As chair of the justice committee I commend him for 
his ongoing efforts in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some problems with the bill with respect to the effort 
that has been put into it on behalf of the government to give the 
perception that it will be the cure-all and the end-all to some 
of the problems that existed in the previous Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to comment on the fact that the 
bill from my perspective involves many substantive changes, 
leaving it open for new interpretation by judges, prosecutors and 
lawyers across the land.  This legislation will lead to a great 
deal of new judge made law and the type of law that will 
potentially open loopholes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the hon. member will agree that within the bill there 
is greater discretion in areas when it comes to transfers.  There 
is greater discretion on the part of the police who will be asked 
at the front end to decide whether they should lay charges. There 
will be a long period of time before the full implications of the 
bill are felt.  It is a very complicated act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member tell us why the government did not try to 
draft a more streamline piece of legislation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, any new act is subject to 
judicial interpretation as lawyers look for loopholes. This act 
was drafted with a view to assisting our youth at risk, our youth 
in trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some very good aspects of discretion such as police 
warnings, a greater emphasis on prevention and a greater emphasis 
on youth justice committees.  These are all positive steps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The theory of the law in black and white, as the member having 
been a crown counsel would know, and the practice in our youth 
courts are often a bit different.  Sometimes a warning of taking 
the child home to his family is much more effective than dragging 
him from the schoolyard into court where there is strict 
liability in those situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many more positive aspects to the legislation which 
will be of benefit.  Yes, there will be interpretations like 
anything else, but on balance it is a good act.  The aims and 
aspects of it are very worthwhile.  It will go a long way to 
changing the image of youth criminal justice.  There is good 
emphasis on the protection of the public as well. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today at second reading of Bill C-68, an act in respect of 
criminal justice for young persons and to amend and repeal other 
acts.  In more simple terms, this bill will replace the current 
legislation on young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will recall that the bill was tabled for first reading on 
March 11.  It is a product of the strategy to renew the justice 
system for young people introduced last May, nearly a year ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This strategy and the bill have already received a lot of 
comment in Canada, with the greatest opposition coming from 
those involved in Quebec in youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will return a little later to the position of both the 
Government of Quebec and the organizations involved in managing 
the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is blatantly clear that, in making the Young Offenders Act 
more repressive as juvenile crime declines, the Minister of 
Justice has caved in to the Reform Party lobby. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1540"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the principles underlying this reform go back to the 
strategy of renewing the youth justice system, it might be 
interesting to know what the Minister of Justice thinks of the 
present Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a straight face, the minister says that the legislation is 
lacking in clarity and contains a number of contradictory 
principles. 
In her view, the present legislation has three weaknesses: the 
first is that prevention programs and alternative measures are 
inadequate; the second is that violent young offenders are not 
being properly sentenced and rehabilitated; the third and final 
weakness is that there is too great an emphasis on custody for 
non-violent offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, between 1991 and 1997, this same legislation was 
responsible for a 23% drop in youth crime.  Since 1995, the 
number of young people charged with violent crimes has gone down 
by 3.2%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interestingly, in 1997 the national crime rate for all age 
groups had dropped 5% according to the police.  And that was the 
fifth year in a row that the crime rate had dropped, and the 
year with the lowest crime rate since 1980. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are not imaginary statistics. 
These figures are from Statistics Canada's Canadian Centre for 
Justice Statistics.  They are not just a product of wishful 
thinking by the Bloc Quebecois.  The facts are there, despite 
what the minister says, and the legislation she wants to reform 
has, nevertheless, proven itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to the drop in youth crime, it is noteworthy that 
this decrease also applies to violent crime, which also 
decreased in 1997 for the fifth consecutive year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on for some time giving statistics like these, but 
what is clear is that youth crime has been on the downturn for 
several years, thus confirming that the present legislation is 
fulfilling its objectives of protecting society and 
rehabilitating young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former Minister of Justice and current Minister of Health, 
whom I have the pleasure of seeing before me right now, spoke 
out on a number of occasions on the present legislation, which 
the government wants to reform, describing it as fulfilling its 
objectives well.  On June 2, 1994 for instance, in response to a 
question in the House, he declared that “the government 
continues to believe the youth justice system is fundamentally 
sound, and we support it”.  I see he persists with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has also said, in response to another question, that no one 
can imagine that society can resolve the problem of violent 
crime by reworking its legislation.  In fact, the criminal 
justice system cannot put an end to violent crime all on its 
own.  It merely addresses the consequences of underlying social 
problems.  The House of Commons must devote at least equal time 
to preventing crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the bill introduced by the minister focuses more on the 
repression aspect than on rehabilitation.  For example, the bill 
extends the list of offences subjecting an adolescent to an 
adult sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill under consideration decrees that, at age 14, a young 
offender may be sentenced as an adult.  That is two years sooner 
than under the current legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a number of instances, the bill provides that the identity of 
an adolescent found guilty of a criminal offence will no longer 
be kept secret. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This measure, specifically, raises a number of doubts.  How 
could it not be seen that, with the increased media attention 
given crimes committed by young people, the publication of names 
might become a positive thing, particularly among the young 
involved in street gangs.

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are but a few examples of the more repressive measures in 
the bill.  With the drop in crime among young people, this 
reform is totally unnecessary in our opinion.  It is socially 
dangerous, because its negative effects could well yield the 
opposite of what we are seeking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current Young Offenders Act as applied by Quebec is an 
example for the rest of Canada, and the minister will surely not 
contradict me on this, having so acknowledged on a number of 
occasions.  So why did she focus on repression in amending her 
law instead of taking the approach Quebec takes with the Young 
Offenders Act, which is to focus on rehabilitation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still do not have an answer.  The only one I can think of, 
and I did not find it in my crystal ball, is that it was 
critical to silence the Reform lobby. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation as it stands is serving its purpose very well in 
Quebec.  The proof is that we have the lowest rate of youth 
crime in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although youth crime is still a troubling phenomenon and is 
receiving increasing media attention, it is also on the decrease 
in Canada.  In 1997, it dropped by 7%, thus contributing to the 
drop in the overall crime rate and confirming a trend observed 
since 1991. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, rather than rushing into a reform that will favour a 
repressive approach to youth crime, why was Quebec's model not 
used?  It is no surprise that stakeholders in Quebec have 
reacted so strongly to Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a March 11 press release, Quebec's Minister of Justice was 
critical of the fact that Quebec had not been consulted before 
the bill was tabled, despite the assurances given at the last 
meeting of justice ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, it is unnecessary to change a system that is 
working and that already protects society very well, while 
helping rehabilitate young offenders. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 19, a coalition of Quebec agencies interested in the 
new Young Offenders Act had the following reaction at a press 
conference: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the provinces' supposed flexibility in enforcing the legislation 
is no more than a series of limited powers dependent on the 
crown attorneys.  Nowhere in this bill is it stated that the 
provinces may implement their own model. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of those listening and for the minister's 
benefit as well, I will list the Quebec stakeholders that took 
part in this press conference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin with the Association des chefs de police et de 
pompiers du Québec.  Clearly, the police do not all think alike. 
There was also the Commission des services juridiques, the 
Conseil permanent de la jeunesse, respected Université de 
Montréal criminologist Jean Trépanier, Aide communautaire 
juridique de Montréal, the Fondation québécoise pour les jeunes 
contravenants, Institut Philippe Pinel, the Conférénce de Régies 
régionales, the Commission des droits de la personne et des 
droits de la jeunesse, the Bureau des substituts du procureur 
général du Québec, the Association des CLSCs et des CHSLD du 
Québec, Marc Leblanc of the École de psycho-éducation de 
l'Université de Montréal, the Regroupement des organismes de 
justice alternative du Québec, the Child Welfare League of 
Canada, and the Canadian Criminal Justice Association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All professionals concerned with the rehabilitation of young 
people were present at this press conference, sending a very 
clear signal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consensus in Quebec on the issue of young offenders is 
clear. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT71"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT71"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1550

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill which is even more repressive cannot help but have an 
impact on the Quebec model.  What will happen to our model if 
sentences have to harmonize coast to coast?  Will Quebec judges 
be required to adjust their sentences to those being handed out 
by their colleagues in other provinces?  If this is the case, 
one might wonder just how flexible this new act really is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Ontario has already stated that it is very 
much in favour of tougher treatment for young offenders.  That 
will not surprise anyone.  That province can therefore be 
expected to opt for young people to be sent before adult courts 
more often, and is thus favouring prison sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Quebec Bar, “the real effects of these 
provisions could well increase both the number and seriousness 
of recidivism among young people”.  This is why the Quebec model 
does not advocate incarceration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister should also review the entire question of financial 
compensation to the provinces with respect to the application of 
the existing legislation.  In fact, the latest budget provides 
$343 million more over three years for crime prevention, 
including $206 million for reforming the Young Offenders Act to 
permit the provinces to absorb the costs of applying the 
proposed legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Quebec considers that the lengthening of 
sentences and the increased number of young people on trial in 
adult court will cost it an additional $23 million annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Young Offenders Act became law in 1984, the federal 
government paid 50% of the costs of applying the alternative and 
the legal measures.  As is its custom, the federal government 
backed off a bit.  In 1996-97, its share of the funding 
represented no more than 36%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further ineptitude.  In addition to the government's backing 
off, its funding formula does not take into account the 
percentage of Quebec's population of young people.  Although 
Quebec has nearly 25% of young people between the ages of 12 and 
17, it receives only 18.28% of federal funding in this area. 
This is not the first time Quebec has not received its fair 
share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1989, therefore, Quebec has lost out on $77.4 million. 
Furthermore, the former Minister of Justice and the present 
Minister of Health promised to do something about this lack of 
funding, but this promise went up in smoke—at the same time as 
the former minister, apparently—because this promise was never 
kept by the former minister and the present minister seems not 
to have heard about it or is washing her hands of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is therefore still waiting for a specific proposal from 
the Minister of Justice concerning repayment of this $77 million 
shortfall.  We do not know, however, how long Quebec's patience, 
on this issue as on many others, will be tested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To sum up, the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to this bill because 
the consensus in Quebec with respect to young offenders is that 
the bill's measures are unnecessary, ill-advised and even 
threaten the continued existence of Quebec's rehabilitation-based 
model. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately, the federal government should hand over to Quebec 
full responsibility for administering the youth justice system 
along with the associated funding.  This would be the best way 
of ensuring that a system that works for Quebec's youth, a 
system that gives them a chance to become full-fledged members of 
society, is allowed to continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is distressing that the Minister of Justice has been unable 
to convince the rest of Canada of the effectiveness of Quebec's 
approach and that she has taken the path of least resistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, I move: 
<A NAME="LINK242">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the 
motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word “That” 
and substituting the following:

</I></B></P><P align=left>“Bill C-68, An Act in respect of criminal justice for young persons

but that the Order be discharged, the Bill withdrawn and the 
subject-matter thereof referred to the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Human Rights.”

Mr. Speaker, I listened to the member for Laval Centre with great 
interest, as well as the member for Erie—Lincoln, who is chair 
of the justice committee.  When I spoke to Bill C-68 I spoke 
about the simplistic approach of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Laval Centre has indicated that when dealing with 
youth involved in the youth justice system we are usually dealing 
with poor, impoverished, broken home, substance abuse, family 
violence victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the hon. member to comment on the opposition 
position of high punishment and no rehabilitation.  Does she not 
agree that public safety starts with prevention? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The systemic problem of why people commit crimes has not been 
addressed at any time by anyone.  We seem to be putting band-aids 
on problems that exist.  We are not addressing the fact that most 
of these people are already abused.  The member for Wild Rose 
talks about strapping them and hitting them with boards.  The 
member for Calgary Northeast talks about caning them, which is 
some kind of unique approach to beat everyone into the ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member for Laval Centre could comment further on 
that. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is no secret 
that Bill C-68 goes too far for Quebec and not far enough for the 
Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to your question, I will read from the Jasmin 
report.  Members will see that, indeed, society has a 
responsibility to provide an environment that will foster 
individual growth.  It reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is often easier to change a law than to change practices of 
intervention. 
It may be tempting to think that tougher legislation is the 
answer to the problems of delinquency. Simplistic responses 
blind us to the full extent of complex problems and create the 
false impression that we are doing what is necessary to resolve 
them. One such simplistic response is substituting get-tough 
measures for educational approaches.  This, however, overlooks 
the fact that adolescents are still in the process of learning, 
and it means they are being saddled with full responsibility for 
delinquency, as if the society and environment they live in had 
nothing to do with it. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a statement of Quebec's values on the role of 
society in helping young people to become law-abiding adults, 
full-fledged citizens who are capable of assuming their 
responsibilities in a world which, we must acknowledge, is 
becoming a more and more complicated one, which does not make 
things any easier for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that Bill C-68 as it now stands fits the bill as 
legislation making life easier for our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The amendment by the hon.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, first 
of all I would like to just clarify for my Liberal friends that a 
piece of wood is called a paddle and it is used for spanking. 
Obviously the fellow across the way did not get his share when he 
was young. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the hon. member is this.  It has been reported 
that Quebec has the highest rate of suicide by teenagers and 
young people in the world.  Is she aware of that report? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons given for suicide, and I found this out in my 
many years of working with young people in school, is that it is 
strictly out of fear of their peers.  A lot of it is just 
pressure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know there are a lot of things that have happened in our 
society and in Quebec as well where real harm has come to young 
people by young people.  I would like the hon. member to respond 
to that.  A fear exists among young people.  There are suicides. 
I think there is a big connection. Would the hon. member agree? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Mr. Speaker, the problem of 
suicide among young people is a serious one.  In Quebec we 
realize it is a fact we cannot avoid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will nevertheless point out to my colleague that fear may lie 
behind the suicide of a young person.  It is possible, I am no 
expert.  I simply want to say to him that the society with the 
highest rate of incarceration is no doubt that of our neighbours 
to the south, the United States. And yet their crime rate is the 
highest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that incarcerating young people will be a panacea 
and that, suddenly, because we are putting everyone in jail, we 
will no longer be afraid.  There are real fears.  The ones we 
feel inside us.  I think the problem of suicide cannot be 
treated only by saying “We will make a rigid law, a demanding 
one, and there will be no more problem”.  That is simplistic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The day the federal government decides to give $67 million back 
to Quebec, the money could go to helping our young people 
struggling with deep personal problems.  This money could go to 
helping them, to giving them psychological support in situations 
that are often difficult.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the idea that Reform's policy on justice is simplistic 
is absolutely wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been putting forward a provision in my home province. 
This bill continues to make sentences much harsher for juveniles. 
This bill of course is government legislation.  The thing I have 
been pushing is there needs to be attached to this an education 
system for youth as to what this bill entails and that would 
prevent crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member referred to a lot of statistics. 
My experience has been that Statistics Canada will change the 
criteria for statistics.  There will be provincial changes. Can 
the member assure me that the statistics she is using and that 
are being used by all these associations in Quebec are in fact 
statistics that are used across Canada so that we are comparing 
apples to apples and not apples to oranges?

as I have already indicated in my speech, the figures I used 
come from Statistics Canada.  It is very clear that in speaking 
of overall crime rates, we are of course referring to Canada. 
And in order to state that the youth crime rate is lower in 
Quebec than in the rest of Canada, we are of necessity still 
using the same criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is totally logical, and I believe the people at Statistics 
Canada to be professional, even if the name of their 
organization is Statistics Canada.  We are capable of 
recognizing that.

<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I do not know why it is.  The member for Wild Rose is not the 
justice critic, I do not believe.  I stand to be corrected but I 
do not think so.  He seems to be the one out in the forefront of 
Reform policy in this area.  I guess it is because he spent many 
years as a high school principal, which is mind boggling frankly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the comment on what causes youth suicide.  He can 
correct me if he wants to later on but I heard him use the word 
fear.  That really identifies what the Reform policy is all about 
in terms of dealing with young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can rather tragically talk with some experience about youth 
suicide and others.  I have experienced it in my family. A very 
close friend of mine when he was 21 years old committed suicide. 
He tragically laid down in front of a train. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We struggled with trying to understand.  He was not a young 
offender but we struggled with trying to understand what would 
drive a 21 year old human being in his prime to do this.  I can 
give the assurance it was not fear.  It was lack of hope.  That 
is the fundamental problem I believe we deal with any time we 
deal with the issues of youth justice, young offenders, children 
and young people at risk. It is unfortunate when people talk in 
terms of fear instead of respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have raised three young men.  I am proud to say they are not 
young offenders, even though I think when I was their age I 
probably could have been, but was not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is respect.  It is what the young people think about their 
role models.  It is how they look at their parents.  It is how 
they look at their teachers.  It is how they look at their high 
school principals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to get into denigrating other members' comments so 
I will not even attribute these except to say they were made by 
members who are in this House at this moment, members of the 
Reform Party.  They do not talk just in terms of using a paddle 
but have used things like “tasted a piece of wood” that somehow 
that is an appropriate way of meting out discipline on a young 
person in trouble, a young person who is rebelling, is confused, 
who perhaps has made a mistake.  They say the way to deal with 
with that person is to have them taste a piece of wood.  I find 
that absolutely despicable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it interesting coming from someone who worked in the 
education system.  I frankly find that scary.  The one good thing 
about the fact that that individual is here, elected as a member 
of parliament, is that the member is no longer in the education 
system taking pieces of wood to our young people. If the member 
wants to try to take them to us, that is up to the member.  I 
welcome that any time.  But at least that mentality in that 
community has apparently been extricated from the education 
system.  That is a bonus.  That is a plus.  It is truly an 
unfortunate attitude.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Another member opposite says that the Reform Party position on 
the Young Offenders Act or youth at risk is not simplistic. 
Well, how about this: “Beating violent young offenders with a 
rattan cane would not be too harsh a punishment”.  Again, 
another Reform MP's statement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And Reform members wonder why people react negatively to their 
remarks and comments.  They wonder why they got 6% of the vote in 
the Windsor byelection this past week.  They cannot figure that 
out. When they established a united alternative, or the united 
alienation party, they had a convention and brought 1,500 people 
to Ottawa.  Then everybody scratched their heads and said 
“Excuse me, I joined the Reform Party.  Why are you throwing it 
on the scrap heap?  Why are you throwing the Reform Party in the 
dump?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I drew the short straw.  I was there as a Liberal 
representative.  It was like sticking a thousand needles in my 
eyes to spend the weekend there.  It was like scraping one's 
fingernails down the blackboard.  It was unbelievably painful to 
spend a weekend listening to the nonsense that was being espoused 
and listening to avowed separatists coming forth to receive 
standing ovations from these so-called purveyors of moderation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member to which he referred was me and I did not say a

correct that.

single-handedly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Is that what he did? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker,  I am going to talk about 
the bill, but I do want to point out a couple of anomalies, one 
might say.  There are a couple of statements and remarks made by 
members of the Reform Party that show the reason they simply have 
no credibility anywhere east of the Manitoba border and the 
reason they are falling apart in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their cry used to be that the west wants in.  Well, the west is 
in.  The west has tremendous representation at the cabinet table. 
Sixteen Liberal members are doing all the work that the Reform 
Party will not do for their constituents in western Canada.  We 
have a task force travelling across the west to try to pick up 
the pieces because the Reform Party refuses to tell the people in 
western Canada about the good work and the programs available, 
put in place by this government.  We have to do their work. They 
should send a percentage of their paycheques to their colleagues 
in those provinces in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another marvellous statement about how they would deal 
with young offenders.  This is about the dreaded repeat offender: 
“The repeat offender will never see the light of day after 
committing his second act”.   The second time with one's hand in 
the cookie jar and we are throwing away the key, that is it. Boy, 
that is compassion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the party that in some incredulous manner is trying to 
convince the Canadian people that they have changed their 
stripes, that they are softer and gentler.  I do not think so, 
and the Canadian public sure as heck does not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give a couple more before I go to the meat of the bill. 
It says here “except in cases of very young offenders”.  I 
would like to hear that definition.  I think I know what it is. 
“Except in cases of very young offenders the identities of young 
offenders must be made public”.  We should think about that.  A 
youngster gets in some trouble.  Sometimes young males are all 
full of testosterone; they are excited, running around and they 
do something stupid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Like murder? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  No, that is the point.  The Reform 
Party member says “like murder”.  Eighty-seven per cent of the 
crimes committed by young offenders are not violent offences. 
Reformers know that, but they consistently want to somehow 
showcase the ones that are violent. This bill makes changes that 
will deal with young violent offenders.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be the option to publish the names of young violent 
offenders, particularly if the justice system deems them to be a 
menace or a danger to society.  That is what the bill does.  I am 
astounded that members opposite did not stand and give a standing 
ovation.  This is what they have been asking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back to the point that except in cases of very young 
offenders the identity should be made public, their definition of 
a young offender should be 10 years old.  A 10 year old gets in 
some trouble and he is charged by the police.  He stole 
something; he was shoplifting.  He got in with a bad gang of 
kids.  Who knows what it was?  Maybe tragically he got involved 
with drugs.  They would have his name on the wall at the golf 
club, I suppose, as being late paying his dues.  They would 
somehow do the scarlet letter on this 10 year old child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How in God's name can anybody that is at all responsible, being 
an elected member in a place like this and representing 
constituents in this wonderful country, stand there with a 
straight face, without total shame, and suggest that is any kind 
of credible way of dealing with a 10 year old child in trouble 
with the law?  It is truly frightening, frankly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know they want to soften the image.  I know they want to 
change the position as far as the public is concerned.  They 
talked about it at the UA conference that I referred to.  One 
interesting thing about being an elected representative in this 
great democratic society is that people have a nasty habit of 
holding politicians accountable for the things they say.  They 
had better think before they say them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They come out with a statement saying that the Reform Party 
supports legislation which would allow the publication of the 
names of all convicted offenders, including young offenders.  The 
bill says if it is a violent offence, if there is danger to 
society, the option is there.  That should address their 
concerns.  To simply say that we should publish the names of 
every person who gets in trouble with the law from the age of 10 
on up is so nonsensical as to be almost laughable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to refer to some good stories.  I have the honour of 
chairing a group called the prime minister's task force on youth 
entrepreneurship.  Recently I was at a hearing in Halifax at 
which we heard from young entrepreneurs, service providers, and 
people involved in helping young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a wonderful establishment, by the way.  I would say to 
members from Nova Scotia that I believe the province of Nova 
Scotia has it right.  I have been right across the land, through 
the west and down east.  We are continuing to travel.  We will be 
going north and through Ontario and Quebec.  Nova Scotia has five 
operations, two of which I have seen in Windsor, Nova Scotia, and 
one in Halifax, called Open for Business.  Open for Business is 
like the Planet Hollywood of youth entrepreneurship.  It is 
wonderful.  The one in Windsor is in a shopping mall and the 
other one is in downtown Halifax.  They are just alive with young 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were at a hearing where we had some young entrepreneurs in a 
panel that appeared before us in a group discussion.  Senator 
Moore was with us and he asked a question of a very young lady 
who was one of the young entrepreneurs.  He said “How did you 
find out about Open for Business?”  Her answer was astounding. 
She said “My parole officer told me”.  We were all stunned at 
the remark because just looking at this person would certainly 
not fit the profile of what we might expect to be an individual 
who had a parole officer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She had started a business.  I will not go into details about 
her business.  She had been convicted under the Young Offenders 
Act.  She has a four year old son at home.  She was contacted and 
was told that she was a candidate for a program in the province 
of Nova Scotia called second chance.  Obviously second chance is 
what this bill is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This young woman came in and met with the counsellors.  She met 
with peers.  She met with young people.  The real key to success 
in the Open for Business concept is that there are peer 
counsellors, young people who have had a bit of entrepreneurial 
experience and can work with young people who have great ideas.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the province of Manitoba in the month of July I will be 
attending a camp that is run for youth at risk.  It is another 
second chance program.  It is an opportunity for young people to 
come into a camp where they are taught life skills and 
entrepreneurial thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is absolute cutting edge stuff. This is stuff that we 
should be spreading the gospel about throughout the land.  We 
should be inviting young people at risk to get involved in the 
camp in Manitoba and to go to places like Open for Business and 
get involved in second chance.  This stuff works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The young woman I met in Nova Scotia has turned her life around. 
She now has a business that has been open for eight months.  She 
takes her four year old son to work with her because it is the 
type of business where the child is not in the way and she can 
function. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the business were to close tomorrow, this young woman 
has turned her life around.  I do not know what her crime was. 
She has a parole officer.  I suspect it must have been fairly 
serious.  I do not think we assign parole officers to youths 
coming out of school.  She has turned her life around, even if 
her business were to fail, because of the work done by the men 
and women and the young people in the province of Nova Scotia at 
this wonderful place called Open for Business and this wonderful 
program called second chance.  That is what has turned her life 
around.

back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  I will not go away, trust me.  The 
hon. member can trust me.  I am with the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is this kind of intervention we should be doing more of 
instead of coming up with nonsensical statements about pieces of 
wood, caning, punching and hitting.  We just do not beget respect 
from young people by treating them that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand fully that there was a generation which believed in 
that.  I attended a Catholic boarding school.  If we want to talk 
about pieces of wood and paddles, they used closed fists and 
boots to take care of their discipline.  That is what happened to 
me.  It has had lasting, damaging effects.  The violence I saw in 
that school meted out by men of the cloth, I would not tolerate 
now for one second if it were my son.  It is wrong, but in the 
1950s and 1960s it was commonplace.  It was the way of dealing 
with things.  It is the way we were brought up.  I do not blame 
people for that.  It was a mentality that came out of that 
generation.  I do not totally understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I grew up in a family of 10 kids.  My dad was a labour leader. 
He was just as likely to cuff me across the head as not.  He was 
a tough man.  That was the mentality that he grew up in, that I 
grew up in.  It is not the mentality of my sons.  Even though I 
consider myself to be a very strong disciplinarian, I use my head 
and heart instead of my fists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is what the bill does.  It has a mind and it has a 
heart.  It takes on the issue of young offenders and gives young 
offenders an opportunity to start over again, to have a new life. 
If they commit a crime a second time it means we have to work 
with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are elements to the bill that will put requirements on 
young offenders as part of the sentencing that will occur. They 
will have to do work in the community and obey certain rules. 
They will have to stay drug free and alcohol free.  They will not 
associate with certain individuals with whom they might have got 
into trouble.  Maybe they were a member of a gang. That happens 
today.  Tragically we see it in the greater Toronto area too 
often.  Maybe they will have to live up to a curfew. 
The idea of curfews in some communities is repugnant.  It 
probably makes sense.  If they break the rules imposed by the 
justice system under this new law, they can be hauled right back 
into court and put into custody.  It gives them a chance.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canada is known for anything in the world, it is that we 
offer hope, we offer a chance, and we care about our young 
people, in fact all our people.  There can be some changes.  I do 
not have a problem with making some changes at committee or with 
taking a look at improving the bill.  That may well make sense. 
However, some policies have been espoused against the bill.  To 
oppose the bill because one is a separatist and thinks that it 
does not give enough power to the provinces or because one does 
not think it goes far enough and wants to incarcerate 10 year 
olds, is a most unfortunate use of the privilege of being a 
member of parliament.  It is an abuse of the power we all have as 
representatives of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously I support the bill.  It is about time we amended and 
reworked the Young Offenders Act.  This is positive.  This is 
good for young people.  I think it will be good for our justice 
system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
tough to ask the member any questions after that kind of speech, 
especially when he does not even know what he is talking half the 
time.  I might as well talk about the years I spent in school 
because he raised them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spent a number of years there.  I went through a number of 
school boards and a number of superintendents, all of whom gave 
me high praises and letters of merit.  All kinds of great things 
came out of that experience for the way I operated, which was a 
gentle but firm tough love method.  I never doubled my fist and 
neither did anybody else.  We had a kids at risk program that 
worked very effectively.  We were able to identify kids as low as 
grade one who were at risk.  We were able to work effectively and 
it did not take legislation.  It did not take anything but good 
common sense.  Many people's lives were straightened out before 
it ever got to that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During those earlier years we had the freedom to operate as 
individuals with intelligence enough to know how to truly deal 
with some of the problems, regardless of the member's rhetoric. 
He does not know anything about it.  He was not there.  He read a 
little teeny clip, which was probably my talking about when I got 
a piece of wood, which is neither here nor there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the early eighties along came the Liberal government which 
brought in a charter of rights and then the Young Offenders Act. 
Suddenly everybody in the school on the kids at risk programs 
were tied.  They could not do certain things because the 
government would not allow the good things that were going on to 
happen.  Now it is espousing that these things should happen. Yet 
the charter of rights stops half of it.  That is Liberal 
legislation.  The Young Offenders Act came into being in 1984 and 
violent crime escalated, and the members knows that.  What does 
he say about that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, every once in a while I 
hear this member start out by making some sense.  He even shows a 
bit of compassion when he talks about working with young people. 
I would believe that if he worked in the education system in his 
home community he probably was a decent person to those young 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know why he said these things.  Why would he say that 
they should taste a piece of wood if he really cared about young 
people?  I do not know why.  I made the point that when we speak 
in this place we are accountable.  Maybe the hon. member did not 
realize when he was talking to a reporter that the reporter would 
actually repeat it.  Maybe that was the problem.  He thought he 
was just kidding.  I do not now, but it does not surprise me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Just answer the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> I am going to use my

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, having been 
a teacher myself, I would not have liked to have had a principal 
like some members I see here.  My principals were very humane 
people and when someone was having problems they tried to 
understand why, instead of punishing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I myself have hidden delinquent students in one office or 
another.  I have taken some of them home with me.  They made 
progress, slowly, and I can tell you that today—and I say this in 
front of everyone, so they will hear it too—they have become 
upstanding citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was listening to my colleague from the government party. 
He wondered how people could be in difficulty.  How could some 
become delinquents? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said something very true.  Very often, it is because of 
hopelessness.  These young people are given nothing.  They are 
not challenged.  They are 12, 14 or 15 years old, and their 
parents do not work.  There is a major problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really tough for someone who loses his job at 40, 45 or 
50.  The child is at home and can see what is happening.  The 
child realizes that he could end up like his father. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a problem for society.  Fortunately in Quebec there is a 
challenge offered: sovereignty.  Young people in the CEGEPS and 
universities are following us.  Our clientele is essentially the 
young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to put a question to the hon. member for 
Mississauga West.  Instead of hiding in a law harsher than the 
previous one—and we know that former works relatively well and 
this is why we oppose the bill—should we not put more money into 
prevention for elementary and secondary school students rather 
than corner them in a law? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate what the 
member is saying.  I think philosophically I would be much more 
likely to agree with this member's attitude about dealing with 
young people than I would with the party that would throw out the 
bill of rights and all of those aspects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do not understand why the Bloc would suggest that we 
stay with the current act.  We have seen problems with the Young 
Offenders Act.  Difficulties have been pointed out and there is a 
valid criticism of the lack of ability to deal with violent young 
offenders.  It is not much of a deterrent when a young offender 
knows that the worse he or she is going to get is three years in 
jail for committing violence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has to be some ability to move violent young offenders 
into the adult court system.  Thirteen percent of young offenders 
who commit crime commit violent crime.  That is one of the 
changes which this bill will effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There also has to be, and should be, an ability to protect 
society.  We can do that by publishing the names of young 
offenders when the justice system deems they are a danger to 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are changes which I think the hon. member should realize 
are important improvements to the Young Offenders Act.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to thank the member for Mississauga West for what I thought 
was a very good speech.  It is a pleasure to watch a real pro get 
a good head of steam up now and then, especially when they are 
comments that I can associate with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have quite a bit of personal knowledge about young offenders, 
street gangs and so on, coming from Winnipeg.  In the inner-city 
of Winnipeg we have quite a serious problem.  We have been forced 
to deal with it and forced to find lasting solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the member for pointing out some of the exciting 
and innovative things that are being done in the province of 
Manitoba to try to deal with kids as kids.  The member clearly 
pointed out the folly in treating kids like adults in terms of 
the criminal justice system.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Former Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba, Yvon Dumont, was the 
first Metis lieutenant governor of Manitoba.  He started 
something that was called the Lieutenant Governor's Foundation 
for Youth.  I was a member of its board prior to being elected to 
this place.  One of the things he pointed out in dealing with the 
young people who were causing a lot of the property crimes in the 
inner-city, like car theft, was that these kids do not steal these 
cars for the lousy $50 that they get from some fence, although 
that certainly is part of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What really motivates these kids to steal half a dozen cars in 
an evening is that they crawl underneath the steering column in 
the car, they break it open, find the three wires, push them 
together and the thing starts.  It is exciting and it is 
interesting.  It is auto electronics.  It is like the thrill a 
mechanic gets when he tunes up a car. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These kids have some redeemable virtues in the fact that they 
are interested.  They would make good apprentices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments 
of the member who just spoke.  He called me a pro.  The member 
who spoke before him said that I was stupid.  I think I will 
accept the latter definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To follow up on his point, the member said they would make 
good apprentices.  I raised that point at one of our youth 
entrepreneurship hearings.  I asked a question and I was really 
surprised at the answer.  I asked “Has anybody thought about 
young offenders being entrepreneurs?”  Everybody laughed.  There 
was a professional in the audience who stood and said “As matter 
of fact we have”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Outside of the violent young offender, a young offender is very 
much like an entrepreneur, but in a negative way.  If we can take 
these young people and put them in programs to redirect and 
refocus their energy, I think we might have something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is proof in Manitoba.  I congratulate the province and the 
member for that.  There is proof in Nova Scotia.  I saw it 
firsthand.  I met with the young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would invite these dinosaurs to come to the camp in Manitoba 
in July to meet some of these youth at risk, these young people 
who they would take a block of wood to or who they would cane. 
Come and meet these kids to see how they are turning their lives 
around.  That is what this bill is about.

the member was not here from 1993 to 1997, but in the previous 
government I spent a lot of years as one of the major critics of 
the Young Offenders Act and other parts of the justice system, 
which I will continue today because I have the opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make a couple of things quite clear.  First, my party 
and I believe that the number one success to youth crime is 
prevention. 
That is why we had kids at risk programs going on in the school 
which I operated for about 30 years until legislation came from 
the Liberal government which prevented us from doing so because 
we were not entitled to do some of the things we were allowed to 
do previously.  We had to recognize certain things under the 
charter, which destroyed the ability of the police to work with a 
free hand, not in a violent way, but in a way that solved 
problems.  Most of those young people are now parents and some 
are even grandparents who are grateful that we did these things.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to come to some of the class reunions. 
I go to them every year.  It is nice to be able to reminisce and 
to hear the thanks and praise from the students of the past for 
the work that we did on their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that prevention works.  I know that is where a lot of the 
money should be spent; upfront, working on prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard the previous member ramble on about publishing names.  I 
will tell him about a couple of incidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was a principal of a school and received a student from 
another area, perhaps it was from another province or another 
city, we had all of the information about the individual.  We 
could determine what we needed to do on the student's behalf in 
terms of education, social life or whatever.  These young people 
would transfer into the school.  After the Liberal government's 
legislation in the 1980s under the charter of rights, as a 
principal I did not have the right to receive information about 
any previous criminal record or anything else about a young 
person who showed up on our doorstep.  We had to admit him. 
Perhaps he was 15, 12 or 18.  It did not matter.  I had no right 
to that information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of these people who were coming in from other areas had 
been kicked out of every school they had been to. A great deal of 
it was for criminal activity, and a lot of it was for violent 
criminal activity.  Therefore, we were not in a position to 
provide any assistance which might have helped this individual 
with their problem.  Instead we had to accept the student with no 
questions asked because we could not publish anything about these 
young people.  As a result, I cannot even begin to tell members 
how long the list was of victims who came out of my own school 
and my own community because we did not know about that 
individual until after they continued down the same path for 
which they had been removed from a previous school before they 
had transferred to our school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will have to give the Conservative government one bit of 
credit.  It will be very small.  It did allow under the Young 
Offenders Act for certain information to be given to school 
authorities and other officials who might have a bearing on the 
lives of these individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals would have never done that.  It is better not to 
publish or let people know that these young people may be violent 
individuals.  In the Liberals' view it is better not to let 
school authorities know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Please tell me how that prevents crime.  If there is a family 
with young children, would they not like to know if a young 
offender living next door had been in trouble in other places for 
having molested young children?  As a parent, would that not be a 
good thing to know?  Should school authorities not know about 
these particular individuals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals' prevention method is to pour out money and then 
hope that the provinces will come up with something which will 
solve their problem, which they created in the 1980s when they 
brought in their loosey-goosey Young Offenders Act and the 
charter of rights at the same time, protecting everyone except 
the victims.  Since that time the number of victims has escalated 
to such a degree that the 10 year report on the Young Offenders 
Act is a disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not all the fault of the act.  It is the fault of the 
government which suddenly decided that we cannot publish names of 
individuals who could be a problem.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is at fault for making legislation that says 
people can no longer discipline in any fashion that might seem 
abusive, such as with a paddle or a strap.  In my opinion, there 
was always a place for that in the schools.  It was not used in a 
violent way and was seldom ever used, but there was a time when 
it was necessary and most of the time it was effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members would not understand those kinds of 
preventive measures.  They talked the good talk on prevention, 
but I have not heard one good suggestion out of their mouths 
about how we should spend the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to the Liberals coming in, people like the ones in my 
community and others had good programs in place.  We were able to 
put them in place because there was not a Liberal government to 
stop us from doing so through silly legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe there could be a government in existence that 
would say that the public really does not know what is good for 
them; that it must pass legislation because the poor souls in 
Canada do not even know how to raise children in their own homes. 
Why, they might spank them, for goodness sakes.  It cannot allow 
that, so it wants to remove section 43 from the Criminal Code 
which says that parents cannot spank their children any more, 
even if they think that is what they would like to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody dislikes abuse more than this guy.  I have seen it in my 
from peers in my own school.  When I really saw it was after the 
Young Offenders Act and the charter of freedoms and rights came 
in. Everything went sky high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party does not want to put 10 and 11 year olds in 
jail.  We do not want to lash them or cane them.  Nobody has ever 
said that.  What we are saying is that we want them in the system 
so we can work with them and get them to a point where they will 
cease and desist from any activities of a criminal nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Calgary a young person stole 150 cars before he was aged 12. 
In every instance there was nothing anybody could do except 
return him to his house and that was the end of it.  He would 
then go out and do it again.  When did this young fellow stop 
stealing cars?  He stopped on his 12th birthday.  He was smart 
enough to know that he could not continue that activity because 
from that point on he could be arrested and put in the criminal 
justice system.  The government knows about that.  That is not an 
isolated case.  It also happened in Vancouver.  I am not sure how 
many cars the young fellow in Vancouver stole, but it was the 
same story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I introduced a private member's bill dealing with young 
offenders and even adults who steal cars, there was a member of 
the Liberal government who dared to say something to the effect 
that the member for Wild Rose was out of his mind because he 
wanted to punish children who were simply taking a car for a 
joyride.  He said there was nothing wrong with joyriding; that 
was a normal thing for young children to do.  Stealing cars is 
not a normal thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fine for a person to learn how to be a mechanic, a good 
entrepreneur or fix cars.  However, I would like the NDP member 
to know that learning how to hotwire a car in order to steal it 
is not really the best way to get an apprenticeship in the 
mechanics of a car.  There are surely better ways.  Maybe we 
should give these young people the opportunity for rehabilitation 
through some good solid programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, the Liberals talk prevention and talk 
rehabilitation, but I have not heard one good suggestion about 
what that program might look like.  Nobody can disagree with 
that.  Everybody agrees with prevention and rehabilitation but 
they do not know how to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Yes.  As my hon. colleague from the 
NDP says, we have not heard about the amount of dollars that the 
Liberals are prepared to spend to help prevent crime and to 
rehabilitate these young people. 
I have not heard anything on that.  Lord knows the government 
taxes us enough.  There should be an ample supply of it laying 
around somewhere.  The government has not done anything about 
that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what is wrong with the Liberal government.  It 
really likes making lists.  We have a hate law in Canada.  Let me 
paint a little scenario.  A guy hates his mother-in-law so he 
murders her.  Well that will not be considered under hate crimes 
because mother-in-laws are not on the list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is a kid in school who is built a little 
differently.  Maybe he is fat and considered to be ugly or 
homely.  We just do not like him so we want to get him.  Wait a 
minute, fat ugly kids are not on the list so it does not fit 
under hate crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then lo and behold the Liberals come up with another phenomenal 
list, a list that says it is going to get tough on some of these 
individuals.  What does the list consist of?  Let us take a look. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are going to get really tough on those who commit 
serious crimes by putting them into adult court after one 
conviction for murder, manslaughter, attempted murder and 
aggravated assault.  That means that if a young offender kidnaps, 
sexually assaults with a weapon, commits an armed robbery or a 
host of other violent crimes, nothing too serious is going to 
happen.  The young offender will remain under the old Young 
Offenders Act because those crimes are not on the list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really do not understand what is wrong with the government. It 
seems to like the idea of coming up with lists every time we turn 
around.  If the crime is not on the list then it is not a hate 
crime.  If the crime is not on the list then it is not a violent 
crime and would not result in adult court or adult punishment. 
That is the key word. I really do not understand why anybody in 
the House of Commons or why any adult would not believe that the 
consequences of wrongdoing should not involve a degree of 
punishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want to talk about incarceration in the House. It is a 
dirty word.  Community sentencing is a nice word.  The government 
recently came out with Bill C-41.  This bill is supposed to come 
under the Conditional Release Act where people who commit 
non-violent crimes will be able to serve their time helping in 
their community as punishment for their crime.  I agree with 
that. I do not believe for a moment that non-violent offenders 
need to be behind bars.  They need to be out in public paying for 
their crime in the community.  They need to make restitution for 
the loss they have caused their victims.  There are a lot of 
things they have to do which are all part of the punishment 
picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening under the government's legislation is that 
violent offenders, including those who commit manslaughter or 
second degree murder, are being released back into the community 
under community supervision.  There is something wrong with that 
picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of a sudden we have cases under the section dealing with 
sentencing.  There are a number of things that we must consider 
before passing a sentence.  I agree.  One of the very last ones 
regarding the sentencing of an individual is—and this includes 
the person who is charged with murder, manslaughter or 
whatever—that we must consider whether the individual is 
aboriginal or not. 
If someone takes a person's life, what difference does it make in 
regard to his or her race or background?  I have never seen a 
piece of legislation that is any more discriminatory than the 
legislation that keeps coming from the Liberals.  I was shocked 
when I looked at the Criminal Code.  Time after time I found they 
had made a list and anybody else did not apply to that list. That 
is discrimination in the worst kind, in the most subtle way.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe in equality, but this legislation is the most 
divisive kind of legislation I have ever seen when we start 
identifying that we have to take into consideration what 
nationality an individual is before passing sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One judge told me not too long ago that we must treat different 
people differently.  A judge told me in a conversation that we 
cannot treat unlike people in the same way.  “Never mind the 
victim, never mind the crime.  Let us talk about the offender”, 
this judge says.  “If he is not the same as others might be in 
terms of race or nationality then he must be treated 
differently”.  That is Liberal law, the most divisive and most 
discriminatory law that exists.  Why do we allow that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I looked at the Liberal wisdom.  This cannot be any more than 
just Liberal wisdom which is no wisdom at all.  We are talking 
about the youth criminal justice act.  Guess what the number of 
the bill is?  C-68.  My, my, what a coincidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last Bill C-68 which is now law is not going very well.  I 
understand it is almost up to a billion dollars in cost and it is 
going nowhere because nobody knows what they are doing, but after 
taking directions from the Liberal government that does not 
surprise me in the slightest.  However, to dare number this bill 
as C-68 is quite the strategy.  We will name it Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the Canadian public to be careful when talking about Bill 
C-68 from now on because we will be talking about the youth 
criminal justice system and not the gun control bill.  What a 
piece of strategy.  What a work of wisdom.  Let us keep the 
public confused and then they will not question us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What goes in the front door at a committee is usually what comes 
out the back door.  As hard as we try to amend or change it, that 
is usually what comes out because orders will come from the front 
row to not amend or change the bill and to vote yes on it.  The 
old puppets and the old sheep will jump up and lo and behold it 
will become law.  There is no doubt about it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am still 
very surprised to hear such a hard-line speech about young people 
in this place, and I am particularly surprised by our 
colleague's definition of prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He seems to view prevention as an activity that only comes into 
play after the offence.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find this rather surprising, because he talks to us about 
lists, as though young people should be stigmatized.  This is 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have always seen prevention as coming before the offence. 
For there to be prevention, there has to be education, guidance 
and resources in our schools, often at the time when young 
people are having difficulty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my Reform Party colleague what he means by 
the term prevention, which he has used repeatedly in his speech. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I guess I will have to 
repeat my speech.  I thought I had clarified that quite nicely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked about kids at risk programs that we had in the school. 
We caught many young people, even as low as grade 1.  We were 
able to work with them and prevent them from committing future 
crime.  I talked about that a great deal.  Maybe the member's 
earplug was not in.  I do not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and talk about it some more but that is what I was 
talking about, kids at risk programs.  All those kinds of things 
can be put into place.  I thought I had covered that but maybe I 
did not. 
<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I listened with interest to my friend. I 
always enjoy his presentations.  I find I agree with much of what 
he says, but not all of what he says.  I will not focus on what I 
do not agree with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about prevention and the program he had in his 
school that was so successful. Could the hon. member give some 
thought to the causes of crime? I know he is an educator and has 
a lot of experience in the field.  In his experience, why is it 
that certain young people go afoul of the law?  Is there any 
commonality in their backgrounds? Is there any commonality in 
their experiences that he has been able to identify so that we 
can begin to focus on not only the crime itself but the 
fundamental causes of crime? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for the question.  I know there will not be enough time to 
answer it.  It is a difficult question to answer, but not in all 
cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only give examples.  I remember little Eddie whose grade 1 
teacher brought him to me.  He had been kicking her in the shins 
and had pulled a knife on her.  That was an indication there 
could be a problem.  We identified that there was a serious 
problem with little Eddie. I tried to bring in the family, the 
mother and the father.  I said we had to begin the process of 
helping this young fellow out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately there was no father and the mother worked all the 
time, and worked hard.  He had no supervision.  That was a shame. 
No supervision is not good for young people, especially at six 
years of age.  We had lots of problems in that area where 
supervision seemed to be unavailable and therefore kids would 
lean into trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem that came up quite often was caused by low 
self-esteem, kids put down by peers and in some cases put down by 
teachers and parents.  They had low self-esteem and needed 
recognition to become somebody.  Especially if they had any brute 
strength, to be a bully was the way to be, to do something that 
would attract some attention.  I have seen these very same kids 
break into tears when we began working with them because that is 
not what they wanted.  It is a cry for help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list can go on.  Sometimes some kids are just rotten to the 
core and I do not know why.  There is no excuse for it.  I have 
had parents ask “What am I going to do?  He will not listen to 
us.  We tell him he can't go out.  He breaks the window and goes 
out and he doesn't come home until the next morning. If we try to 
punish him, he goes to the police and cries child abuse”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on and on.  It is really a tough one to answer.  I had 
better not take much more time or Madam Speaker will cut me right 
off.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would like to ask my colleague from Wild Rose if he would agree 
with a few brief comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Mississauga West mentioned in his speech that 
young people are often full of testosterone.  I can tell the 
House that the member for Mississauga West is definitely not full 
of testosterone, but most likely the stuff that I wipe off my 
boots when I come from the corral. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I still have the notion that I may support this bill and I want 
to ask the member about that.  But it is speeches like those of 
the member for Mississauga West that make me think and wonder 
what I am doing.  Again, the bill is very little in the right 
direction, but perhaps that is all we can expect from the Liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member agree with me that it is members like the 
member for Mississauga West who give this institution a bad name? 
Certainly in my opinion he is nothing but a blowhard windbag who 
in my opinion is a waste of skin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Could he be a little more explicit about 
that?  What does he really mean? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am not sure what the 
member really means, but I think I agree with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sad part about it is that there are some genuine people over 
there who are serious about doing something about the Young 
Offenders Act.  There is also a bunch of them over there who do 
as they are told.  They have studied legislation to no degree 
because they know they will have to vote the way they are told. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had free votes in this House, if we could have open 
debate, if we could have legislation come to the justice 
committee and know that the justice committee is going to effect 
the change, but we know that most of the legislation that comes 
in the front door of the justice committee goes out the back door 
in the same form that it came in.  Those are the orders and that 
is why there has to be a Liberal majority on a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process and the way we handle business is wrong.  It is a 
shame.  I would not like to sit in the House of Commons in a 
place where I would not be allowed to study legislation and be 
able to vote according to what I or the people that I represent 
feel.  Unfortunately, the member for Mississauga West has to do 
all he can to make sure that he gets heard and known, gets on TV 
and gets well advertised, because he will always be on the 
backbench.  He will never have the opportunity to be on the front 
bench so he can tell the rest of them what to do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I listened to the hon. member's speech and I agree with 
just about everything the member had to say.  It shocked me when 
I sat here and listened to the members before him speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If some young person breaks into a car and hot wires it, they 
are becoming entrepreneurs.  This is coming from members in the 
House. The hon. member from Nipissing stated that because young 
people steal cars they are just being children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what is wrong here.  I have gone around schools and 
talked to children who are afraid of children.  I have talked to 
their parents who have said “The government has handcuffed us. 
We cannot do anything.  The government has taken the right of 
parenting away from us.  It has become the almighty parent and it 
penalizes us if we try to do anything to help our own children to 
stop this type of stuff”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member to comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member is 
absolutely correct.  Parents, the police and myself used to work 
very effectively with young people in our community.  We never 
had to go to court, never had to make an arrest.  We involved the 
parents, we involved the police and we involved the school 
authorities.  We were very successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this government brought down certain pieces of legislation 
and the next thing, I had to open my desk drawer, pull out a 
little piece of paper and before I could even begin thinking 
about discipline or helping the young person I had to say “You 
have the right to remain silent.  You have the right for me not 
to call your parents in”, all of the gobbledegook that has come 
out of this Liberal government.

Madam Speaker, I feel like I have reached into the bag and drawn 
the black marble.  After the member for Mississauga West has 
spoken and gets the member for Wild Rose all riled up, I happen 
to be the next person to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because I have already spoken on the bill, I am speaking on the 
amendment brought forward by the Bloc which basically takes the 
bill away from what it was intended to do.  The bill was intended 
to deal with the youth justice system in a fashion that is 
reasonable.  For some people it would be going too far and for 
others, not far enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my experience as a parole officer in Ontario for a short time 
in my former life, I dealt with the Young Offenders Act when it 
came in in 1984.  I knew when it came in that it needed to be 
refined, retuned and readjusted because it did not address some 
of the glaring problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-68 has addressed some of the problems that were in 
evident need to be addressed.  It was done after much 
consultation and time spent with the various people in the 
criminal justice system, in the parole system and the people who 
work with youth.  A lot of thought has gone into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know that it addresses the systemic problem that exists 
in our society that we as the highest court in the land have to 
deal with, and that is lack of education, lack of training for 
parenthood, disadvantaged people, people from broken homes. If I 
were to sit down and write a report before I saw a case file and 
I put broken home, substance abuse, dropped out of grade 8, lack 
of motivation, lack of confidence, abused as a child, I would 
catch probably 80% to 90% of the people I dealt with in that 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look at the answers and the simplistic approach of the Reform 
Party.  The member for Calgary Northeast was going to study 
caning as a way to address the problems of the youth justice 
system.  Certainly, I found that not a way I could agree with. If 
our answer to a person who has been beaten all their life is to 
give them another beating, somehow that has absolutely nothing to 
do with what is being proposed in Bill C-68.  It has nothing to 
do with the systemic problems of our society and that is how to 
deal with people at a young age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My wife is a special education teacher in an elementary school, 
a resource person as they call it.  She deals with people who are 
in trouble at a very early age.  As with the problems I talked 
about, there is the lack of parenting, the lack of people having 
some kind of a system of rules, a system of looking at whether 
courses should be mandatory for certain people, whether it is 
more involvement with the Children's Aid Society or whether it is 
more involvement with the youth justice system very early in our 
schools.  That is what we have to look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do I do in a parole hearing when a young woman has dropped 
a baby off a balcony because the baby was crying too much? We 
look into the problems that exist with that person being tried in 
an adult court, as she was, and not having any of the advantages 
of people who grew up in a home where maybe two people were 
working.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a person who is suffering from serious substance 
abuse and serious societal problems who ends up in jail and has 
to be kept in the hospital section for fear of being attacked by 
the other inmates who feel that this crime is very serious. Their 
way of approaching and dealing with that crime is to inflict more 
pain on the person who committed the crime, somehow falsely 
thinking that would be a cure or that suddenly the problem would 
dissolve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are trying to do here with Bill C-68.  Basically 
the amendment would gut the bill and make it worth nothing.  I 
think the bill requires us as a government to promote it, to take 
advantage of all the study that has been done and to analyse it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of parliament should look at it, analyse it and decide 
where they want to make changes.  They should follow them 
through.  They should not make changes because they belong to the 
Reform Party or because they are against everything that the 
Liberal Party does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I run into people in society who hate Liberals, who hate 
Catholics and who hate Christians.  I am all of those so I have a 
problem sometimes right at the start in dealing with that. People 
are like that in society.  They grow up in certain areas and are 
expected to do certain things.  We have to break out of that 
mould in order to advance and to advance our youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the problems were dealt with by the hon. member for 
Mississauga West, although he does it in a way that inflames 
members of the Reform Party.  He even attended their UA 
convention.  This was after they actually voted non-confidence in 
the Reform Party and said they could not govern.  They wanted to 
bring in the people left in the Conservative Party, the rest of 
the Conservative Party, and were to do great things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jurassic Joe Clark must be having a field day.  Have not all the 
right wing fanatics gone out of the Conservative Party?  Have 
they not all gone to the Reform Party?  Now they have voted 
non-confidence in themselves and they are coming back.  It is sad 
to see a party, which actually had a chance to be a sound 
official opposition, all of a sudden vote non-confidence in 
itself and go around like a band of sheep wondering which way to 
go.  I have a problem with that, and I appreciate now that the 
hon. member for Mississauga West has come in here to straighten 
me out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Not at all.  To support you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John O'Reilly:</B>  I supported him, of course, but to 
follow the hon. member for Mississauga West after he has inflamed 
the hon. member for Wild Rose— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  He just threatened to punch me out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John O'Reilly:</B>  Well, no doubt, and that is how they 
would cure you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I fail to see the relevance of the hon. member's speech 
given the fact that we are discussing youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am sure that the 
hon. member is about to make a link between all that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John O'Reilly:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for coming in on the conversation and reminding me that I was 
speaking to the amendment to Bill C-68, in fact the amendment in 
all its glory.  I know the hon. member wants to be leader of the 
Reform Party.  He has indicated that.  I appreciate that he would 
get up and get involved in doctoring the speech that is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyway, he has some obviously good points that are almost 
liberal in a sense and that would create some type of a problem 
for his party.  He would be an excellent candidate and I 
appreciate him intervening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back to the main talking points on Bill C-68.  I am 
speaking to the amendment because I already spoke to the bill and 
I know the hon. member listened intently.  I want to correct 
something that I said when I was heckled by one of my own members 
when I spoke to Bill C-68.  I said that I had spent three years 
in grade eight and that they were the happiest years of my life. 
That is not true. 
My wife asked me to have that corrected.  It was actually the 
member who had heckled me.  I indicated those were the happiest 
years of his life but it came out differently in <I>Hansard</I>.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Going back to lowering the age to 14 and 15 years olds, that 
part of the youth justice system was not addressed in the 
original Young Offenders Act.  Young offenders come from three 
sectors. There are the very young first offenders who commit a 
crime and are caught.  Sometimes it is the very first crime they 
have committed and they are caught.  It may be a misdemeanour of 
some type. They go into the justice system and for the first time 
in their lives they are taught some values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they realize those values and are pressured by different 
peers and not the peers or the gang they hang out with, many of 
them are success stories.  They actually spend time with people 
who counsel them.  They spend time with very intelligent lawyers. 
We even have some in the back row who wail away here.  They 
spend some time with people who teach them values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The part of the Reform Party's platform that always bothers me 
is that it wants to pretend that this does not happen, that 
people are not helped by the Young Offenders Act and are not put 
on the right track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can give many instances of people who we deal with once and 
they never come back into the justice system.  They rearrange 
their lives.  They take the talent they have and use it to be 
productive members of society.  The lowering of the age to 14 or 
15 years gives me the feeling that the bill is on the right 
track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When 14 to 17 year olds commit a very serious crime I do not see 
anything wrong with publishing their names.  Right now they could 
go back into school without people knowing that they have 
committed a serious crime.  That part of the system has to change 
so that educators know who they are dealing with when there are 
violent offenders in their school system.  If youths are 
sentenced for murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, aggravated 
sexual assault or they repeat serious violent offences, their 
names are then subject to publication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We sometimes think publishing their names in the paper is what 
this deals with.  It is more than that.  It is the publication of 
their names so that the people who are dealing with them on a day 
to day basis know their backgrounds and are able to come to grips 
with them.  They could be sitting in front of them in a 
classroom.  I am not taking about an elementary school system.  I 
am talking about training courses or rehabilitation courses, 
whether it is Alcoholics Anonymous or courses dealing with people 
who have come in contact with cocaine, marijuana, heroine or any 
of those evil drugs that are out there and so easily available. A 
person dealing with those people should know that a violent 
reaction could happen at any time.  The publication of names when 
a judge considers them to be dangerous is a very important part 
of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very easy to tell if someone is dangerous.  All we have to 
do is look at their file or rap sheet to see the number of 
convictions, arrests and times they have appeared before the 
criminal courts.  Bill C-68 is a very positive step toward have a 
more refined justice system for youth but it will not stop 
someone from committing a serious crime. 
That will not happen.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already heard the Reform Party saying that the Liberals 
have this idea that the bill will be the be-all and the end-all. 
Well, it will not.  Once again I go back.  We have to look at not 
the simplistic approach but the systemic problems in society. 
Until the government and all other parties deal with them our 
chances of having a perfect society, which will never exist of 
course, are diminished.  This helps the people in the youth 
justice system to better apply the power of the courts to help 
youth, to rehabilitate them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are trying to make the public institutions a safer place to 
work.  In order to do that we require crime prevention.  The only 
way to have crime prevention is to educate people eliminate 
poverty, lack of training, lack of education and sometimes the 
lack of discipline.  However, quite often, if we look at the 
people we are dealing with, giving them another beating is not 
the answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to find ways to deal with them that challenge them to do 
something different with their lives and that challenge them to 
have more confidence in themselves.  A lack of confidence is the 
largest problem in youth suicide.  No matter where it is one is 
too many.  Lack of confidence and a lack of resources or ability 
to cope comes from the lack of the basic essentials that one 
needs in life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People with money, people who are rich, still have suicides in 
their families.  It is not because they have given them too much. 
It is because they have not given them the confidence. They do 
not have the ability to cope with the pressures that are existing 
today in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-68 is a good start in addressing our criminal justice 
system for youth.  When we seriously look at the bill in 
committee and when we offer any kind of amendment to it, we 
should take into account the research that was done on the bill 
and the consultation that was done on it with the various people 
that came forward and will still come forward to give submissions 
on a bill which I think is worth the consideration of the House 
to pass as quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope I have added something to the debate that will promote 
Bill C-68 and a new youth justice system.

<P><A NAME="LINK259"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to raise a question of privilege for you to 
consider.  I recently entered the building, after having returned 
to my office.  While in my office I heard a number of members in 
this place stand to hurl abuses my way, which is fine in this 
place.  However, at the front door, on my way back, I encountered 
two members of the Reform Party, the member for Blackstrap and 
the member for Okanagan—Shuswap, who were having a cigarette, at 
which time they proceeded to become very abusive toward me, 
hurling insults.  This is not the first time the member for 
Okanagan—Shuswap has acted in this manner.  He challenged me to 
a physical encounter of some description.  “Come on, let's go”, 
he said and clenched his fists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my job in this place to feel totally confident that I can 
walk anywhere within these precincts, anywhere in the city of 
Ottawa or anywhere in this country without having to endure the 
kind of schoolyard bully tactics which these members have shown. 
Because they do not have the ability to stand here and debate an 
issue they attempt to attack and intimidate members in this 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that my privileges have been violated by both of these 
violent Reform members and I would like them to apologize. 
<P><A NAME="LINK260"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I want to make 
it absolutely clear that if any member is threatened anywhere 
within the precincts of parliament it is indeed a very serious 
matter.  It is indeed a case of privilege.  It will not be taken 
lightly and should not be taken lightly.  A very serious 
accusation has been made by the member for Mississauga West.  It 
will be dealt with in a very serious manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there are any other members who wish to intervene, I would 
invite them to do so right now.  We will start with the member 
for Okanagan—Shuswap. 
<P><A NAME="LINK261"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am one of the members he is talking about.  What 
happened outside is that nobody made any threats to the member 
over there.  As we were standing there he walked by us and called 
us bigots.  He also said that he would like us to do something 
physically to his body that normally you would only have a female 
person do if you were heterosexual.  I took great exception to 
that.  When he walked in the door I asked him to come back out 
to finish the discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Was it physical? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  No, it was not, and there were lots 
of witnesses out there.  I want everybody in the House to know 
that what the hon. member did out there was a total disgrace to 
any member of parliament. 
<P><A NAME="LINK262"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the comments you made from the chair, but the member 
who raised the question of privilege failed to indicate that he 
would move the appropriate motion.  Therefore, having received 
the caution which you have given to all members of the House, I 
think the matter should now rest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I thank the hon. 
member for St. Albert for his sage advice.  I will recognize the 
hon. member for Blackstrap. 
<P><A NAME="LINK263"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
certainly would agree with you that it is the privilege of a 
member of this House to feel quite comfortable and secure when 
walking on the grounds or in the House.  I completely agree with 
you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the member's accusation, I would point out that 
indeed there were many witnesses in front when this heated 
discussion took place, and that goes without saying.  I believe 
there would be people out there who would say that the member for 
Mississauga West was in fact the first to open the discussion, if 
you want to call it that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the House, on my behalf, to remind the member for 
Mississauga West that he should be very careful with accusations 
that I believe are false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Are there any other 
members who have anything to add to this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  You're a liar, Stinson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  Did you hear that, Mr. Speaker? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Order, please.  We 
are going to try to resolve this right now.  The first thing we 
are going to do is ask the hon. member for Mississauga West to 
withdraw the most recent comment which had to do with calling 
another member a liar.  Would the hon. member for Mississauga 
West please do so immediately?

the other very serious matter.  This will be taken under 
advisement.  However, I would ask, given the fact that we are all 
adults, that Private Members' Business proceed for the next hour. 
I would ask all hon. members concerned to take a step back, to go 
behind the curtains and resolve this issue as the gentlemen, 
gentlewomen and distinguished leaders that we are.

forward a position before the end of Private Members' Business 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  While the member who raised the point of privilege felt 
it was a serious issue, he did not specifically seek any redress. 
He did not say that he would move any particular motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I thank the hon. 
member for St. Albert.  His comment is already on the table.  I 
thanked him once for his advice, but I will thank him again.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-484, an act to amend the Criminal Code (consecutive sentence 
for use of firearm in commission of offence), be read the second 
time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to lead the debate on 
Bill C-484.  The purpose of my private member's bill is to amend 
the Criminal Code so that any individual who uses a firearm in 
the commission of certain criminal offences will receive an 
additional sentence of incarceration, that being a consecutive 
sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is referred to as the 10-20-life law, so the 
consecutive sentences that I refer to would be 10 years if a 
firearm is used in the commission of one of the named offences 
that I will list shortly; 20 years if in the commission of that 
offence the firearm is discharged; and a life sentence to be 
added consecutively to the sentence that the individual receives 
for the crime they commit if the discharge of that firearm causes 
bodily harm to anyone other than the perpetrator of the crime or 
an accomplice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list of the specific criminal offences to which this 10-20- 
life law would apply are the following:  murder, manslaughter, 
attempted murder, assault causing bodily harm with intent, sexual 
assault with a weapon, aggravated sexual assault, kidnapping, 
hostage taking, robbery and extortion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently section 85 of the Criminal Code provides for a minimum 
sentence of one year and a maximum sentence of 14 years for the 
commission of an indictable offence.  In the case of a second 
offence, a minimum of three years and a maximum of 14 years 
applies.

<A HREF="#LINKT92"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those sentences referred to in section 85 currently are to be 
served consecutively.  That is the current law, but these 
provisions apply to all indictable offences, including the ones I 
listed.  The significance is that the most violent offences are 
treated the same as all other indictable offences.  My bill lists 
the most serious violent crimes and subjects them to the 
provisions of the 10-20-life law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other jurisdictions similar laws are being passed.  Most 
notably, in 1997 the governor of California signed into law an 
act amending California's state penal code to include a 
10-20-life provision.  Prior to that time there existed a similar 
section of the California penal code which meted out three, four 
or ten years for felony offences.  It was actually four, five or 
ten years in the case of carjacking, and five, six or ten years 
if the firearm used was classified as an assault weapon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The significance is that the changes which were made in 1997 in 
California were in response to the success the law had in 
deterring carjacking within that state.  Carjackers knew they 
would be subject to very stiff consecutive sentences for the 
specific act of carjacking, which was a strong deterrent and the 
number of carjackings dropped substantially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would submit to the House that the same principle applies, as 
it clearly does, to the 10-20-life law.  Criminals should know 
that the use of a firearm will automatically add 10 years to the 
sentence for the commission of one of these serious offences. 
The discharge of that firearm in the commission of an offence 
will automatically result in a consecutive sentence applied to 
their original sentence for the commission of that crime, of 20 
years, and if the discharge of that firearm causes someone bodily 
harm they will be the recipient of an additional life sentence to 
the original sentence for the crime they committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to become mired down in a lot of statistics, but 
there are a couple of relevant statistics I would like to quote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1991 and 1995 half of all homicides in Canada involved 
the use of a handgun.  That number is 75% when looking only at 
Vancouver, Montreal and Toronto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995, 33% of violent crimes committed with a firearm resulted 
in the victim being injured.  In the case of assault or sexual 
assault, the percentage of incidents in which the victim was 
injured was over 50%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1934 in Canada we have had a handgun registry.  It has 
been a requirement that legally owned handguns be registered.  We 
can safely deduce from the statistics I have quoted that the 
handgun registry has been an abject failure.  It has not acted as 
a deterrent to the criminal use of those handguns in any way, 
shape or form.  That is a very important point because what we 
need to understand and what the Liberal government fails to 
understand is that it is not the registration of a firearm that 
deters criminal use, but rather the resulting consequence of 
using that firearm to commit a serious violent crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In keeping with Reform Party policies and principles, we seek to 
not target law-abiding firearms owners but the criminal use of 
firearms. 
I have drafted this bill with the intent for it to serve as a 
deterrent to the criminal use of a firearm. There are three main 
points I would like the Liberal government to understand. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1745"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT94"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT94"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1745

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first point is that unlike firearm registration this 10-20 
life law does target the criminal element within our society.  It 
targets those who use firearms in the commission of an offence 
against another person.  That will have the effect of a 
deterrent, contrary to what the registration of firearms would 
do. We need look only as far as the handgun registry to see that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point is the harsher sentencing provisions, not 
firearms registration, but harsher sentences acting as a 
deterrent to the criminal use of firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third point is this law would serve the purpose of 
highlighting that using a firearm to commit a violent crime is 
abhorrent to society.  It is the will of Canadians that stronger 
punitive sanctions be attached to those sections of the Criminal 
Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very disappointed that the subcommittee which dealt with 
my private member's bill did not deem it to be votable.  For the 
reasons I have just explained to the House, the obvious benefit 
that a 10-20 life law would have in tightening the provisions of 
the Criminal Code and therefore making our communities safer, our 
society safer and establishing a clear understanding in society 
that the criminal use of a firearm will not be tolerated and that 
severe penalties will result, I seek the unanimous consent of the 
House to deem my private member's bill votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is very unfortunate for 
many reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is refusing to enact legislation that 
will make our streets, our communities, our society a safer place 
and which will send a message to the criminal element that using 
firearms to commit serious crimes is not something we are 
prepared to tolerate in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals should not care that it is a Reform member who 
introduced the bill.  I do not think that is relevant.  They 
should look at the issue and understand the facts and say this is 
a good idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are they refusing to allow this bill to be votable?  Are 
they ashamed that their own justice minister did not think of it? 
Or are they ashamed that their own justice minister refuses to 
get tough on crime and instead engages in namby-pamby bills such 
as the young offenders amendments that we were speaking about 
today in the House?  The changes to the Young Offenders Act are 
merely a paint job on the old act but will still do nothing to 
target the deficiencies in that act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Or is their reason because they are obsessed with alienating 
Canadians? On Tuesday we debated in the House all day the 
alienation of the regions in the country.  I spoke on behalf of 
the residents of Saskatchewan and I spoke about the Liberal 
alienation committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have yet another example of alienation.  A member from 
Saskatoon, myself, has introduced a get tough on crime bill in 
the House.  It is a law that would improve our society by getting 
tougher on criminals who use firearms instead of targeting the 
law-abiding citizens like the Liberals are so intent on doing 
with former Bill C-68, the firearms registration act. 
They do not allow the committee to deem it a votable item and 
they do not even allow me the consent in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of Canadians watching, the significance of that 
is at the end of this hour, debate on this bill will collapse and 
that will be the end of it.  They will not have to vote on it. 
That is probably another reason that they refuse to allow this to 
be deemed a votable bill.  They do not want to stand up and let 
Canadians from coast to coast watch them vote against a bill 
which targets the criminal use of firearms.  They seem to be 
intent on firearms registration, targeting law-abiding firearms 
owners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we spent the day in the House of Commons debating some 
very flimsy changes to the Young Offenders Act.  Why is the 
Liberal justice minister so preoccupied with bringing useless 
legislation before the House instead of meaningful legislation 
like the 10-20 life law?  Why does she not introduce bills like 
that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of tinkering with the Young Offenders Act, why does she 
not introduce a victims bill of rights?  Why does she not 
establish that the rights of victims supersede any rights that a 
criminal has? I will answer that question.  It is because the 
Liberal soft approach to crime is something they are obsessed 
with and they refuse to let it go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians will not get proper legislation dealing with criminals 
and fair legislation dealing with private ownership of firearms 
until we have a Reform government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-484, 
an act to amend the Criminal Code (consecutive sentence for use 
of firearm in commission of offence), be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK273"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
compliment you on your ruling.

for their initiative and hard work. I think it reflects well on 
all of us for members to bring forward legislation and ideas that 
need to be debated and considered by the House, ideas that do not 
necessarily originate with the government.

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Usually I start out that way, but in this particular instance, I 
believe this bill is just a waste of House time.  This is simply 
a bill which adds nothing to the debate and in fact is 
counterproductive to many of the initiatives already undertaken 
by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To say that I oppose this bill is to be minimalist in the 
matter.  The bill proposes that there be more severe minimum 
sentences to be served consecutively for 10 serious crimes all 
committed with firearms, but by the same token that we ignore a 
judicial and statutory foundation for our sentencing system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all hon. members to refer to section 718 of the Criminal 
Code, which sets out the principles of sentencing, before they 
get too far down the path which this bill is taking us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January 1996 the government implemented tough new penalties 
for firearm related offences.  New sections have been added, 
provided that when a person is convicted of having committed 
certain serious offences with a firearm, a mandatory minimum 
sentence of four years in prison is now imposed. The 10 violent 
provisions are:  criminal negligence causing death; manslaughter; 
attempted murder; causing bodily harm with intent; sexual assault 
with a weapon; aggravated sexual assault; kidnapping; hostage 
taking; robbery; and extortion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, people get four years minimum regardless.  In 
some respects it is a fettering of judicial discretion.  On this 
side of the House, we think that is an appropriate fettering of 
judicial discretion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are satisfied that these new gun control measures are having 
a positive effect in reducing the criminal use of firearms and 
frankly see no need to amend the sentencing provisions at this 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several difficulties with Bill C-484 and I would like 
to address them now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By imposing severe minimum sentences, Bill C-484 does not 
account for the fact that the criminal justice system judges have 
discretion.  That is fundamental to our system of law in this 
country.  They have discretion in sentencing convicted offenders 
in order that the sentence may be tailored, and I emphasize 
tailored, to the individual, taking into account the criminal 
record and any other aggravating or extenuating circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to draw attention to section 718 which sets out the 
purpose and principles of sentencing: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fundamental purpose of sentencing is to contribute, along 
with crime prevention initiatives, to respect for the law and the 
maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by imposing just 
sanctions that have one or more of the following objectives: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) to denounce unlawful conduct; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) to deter the offender and other persons from committing 
offences; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) to separate offenders from society; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) to assist in rehabilitating offenders; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(e) to provide reparations for harm done to victims; and to 
promote a sense of responsibility in offenders. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the purpose of our criminal justice system. It is a very 
articulate piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the section with respect to the other sentencing 
principles, a court that imposes a sentence shall also take into 
consideration the following principles and it goes on to talk 
about aggravating circumstances.  But in the deemed aggravating 
circumstances section, subsection (c), it says “where 
consecutive sentences are imposed, the combined sentence should 
not be unduly long or harsh”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the essence of the flaw with this bill.  If they are all 
added up, offenders will be serving 10 years past a life 
sentence.  It is a bit of an absurdity.  This absurdity would 
lead to further absurdities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It interferes with what in sentencing principles is called the 
totality principle, when a sentencing judge orders an offender to 
serve consecutive sentences, and this is lost on some hon. 
members opposite.  The Criminal Code already provides for 
consecutive sentences.  There are not simply concurrent 
sentences.  A judge has the discretion to order a concurrent 
sentence. 
I heard endless numbers of speeches from members opposite about 
this issue.  If a judge chooses to put in a concurrent sentence, 
he or she can do so, but it must meet the principle of totality.

<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The totality principle requires that a sentencing judge who 
orders an offender to serve consecutive sentences for multiple 
offences to ensure that the cumulative sentence does not exceed 
the overall culpability of the offender.  The effect of the 
totality principle is to require the sentencer, i.e. the judge, 
to pass a series of sentences, each properly calculated in 
relation to the offence for which it is imposed and to be 
properly made in accordance with the principles governing 
sentencing principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, there are no volume discounts.  I will repeat 
this.  There are no volume discounts.  In part, that is what the 
bill is all about; that somehow or other, if we fetter the 
discretion of judges, we will arrive at a more fair judicial 
system, a more fair sentencing system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I respectfully suggest that it would be counterproductive if 
the bill were allowed to go to a vote.  I was glad to see that 
hon. members had the wisdom to not make this a votable item. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Criminal Code provides for minimum sentences in limited 
circumstances.  This is applicable to certain serious offences 
and reflects society's intolerance toward more serious crimes. 
With a four year minimum sentence for 10 serious crimes committed 
with a firearm, the Criminal Code makes is clear that those 
convicted of such offences should at a minimum spend at least 
four years in a penitentiary.  Judges still have discretion to 
impose more severe sentences for particular crimes should they 
deem it to be appropriate in all the circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I say that having been in court and having listened to 
judges, in all the circumstances they frequently listen to 
literally days worth of testimony, frequently contradictory 
testimony, and hear argument on both sides and, I would suggest, 
with the greatest respect to members in the House, are in the 
best position to decide what is or is not the appropriate 
sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House gets to provide guidelines.  The House gets to reflect 
upon the moral imperatives of sentencing.  The House gets to 
suggest things.  However, in the ultimate and final resolution of 
matters, I would submit that we are prepared to defer to judicial 
discretion in most areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government provided for this minimum sentence for these 
10 serious crimes, the clear intent was to discourage individuals 
from using firearms.  Laws have been written with the objective 
that in all likelihood they have to withstand constitutional 
challenges.  I have heard time and time again from members 
opposite how there are charter problems, is this charterproof or 
this horrible charter, although we all seem to think it is okay 
when it works our way.  When we do pass a law it does in fact 
have to go through the lens of the charter. That is the law under 
which we all live, including the House of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill needs to have a short and quick death.  I could go on 
to other significant problems.  I have described how 718 works 
and how a judge actually goes through the various issues that are 
appropriate to sentencing an individual.  We are all subject to 
the rule of law and we are all subject to the constitution.  They 
put the discretion where it belongs:  with the judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-484 panders to the worst in all of us.  It panders to our 
most basic emotions of fear and it purports to offer a solution 
which in fact it does not.  We have an illusion of protection if 
somehow or other we add on all these sentences.  It ignores many 
of the principles upon which our judicial system is built. I 
would urge all members to simply ask for the bill to die a quick 
and painless death.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to speak to Bill C-484, introduced by my Reform Party 
colleague, the member for Saskatoon—Humboldt.  The purpose of 
this bill is to amend the Criminal Code with respect to 
consecutive sentencing for the use of a firearm in the 
commission of an offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More specifically, this bill is intended to amend section 85 of 
the Criminal Code, as well as several other sections of the 
Criminal Code that I will deal with a bit later. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1805"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT97"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 85 currently states that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>85.(1) Every person commits an offence who uses a firearm 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) while committing an indictable offence, other than an 
offence under section 220 (criminal negligence causing death), 
236 (manslaughter), 239 (attempted murder), 244 (causing bodily 
harm with intent—firearm), 272 (sexual assault with a weapon), 
273 (aggravated sexual assault), 279 (kidnapping), 279.1 
(hostage-taking), 344 (robbery) or 346 (extortion), 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill as it stands is aimed at changing section 85, with the 
exception of all the crimes I have just listed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 85 also addresses the use of a firearm while attempting 
to commit an indictable offence, or during flight after 
committing or attempting to commit an indictable offence, and 
committing or attempting to commit an indictable offence or 
during flight after committing or attempting to commit an 
indictable offence using an imitation firearm, all of which are 
indictable offences punishable, in the case of a first offence, 
by imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years, with a 
minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of one year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of a repeat offence, the maximum penalty is fourteen 
years and the minimum three years.  This is what is set out in 
the Criminal Code at the present time.  It also calls for these 
sentences to be served consecutive to any other sentence. 
The Criminal Code is already clear enough on the use of firearms 
in violent crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, what amendments does our Reform 
colleague want to introduce?  First—and I am sure everyone here 
is rather surprised—Bill C-484 amends section 85 by increasing the 
sentences provided as follows: a minimum of ten years, if the 
firearm is not discharged; 20 years if the firearm was 
discharged—he missed here—and 25 years if the firearm was 
discharged and an individual other than anyone participating in 
the offence is caused bodily harm.  So the change is from a 
maximum sentence of 14 years to a minimum of 25 years.  This is 
no small change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same breath, the member proposes that the same 
supplemental sentences be included in sections 235, 236, 239, 
244, 272, 279.1, 344 and 346, all of which, with the exception 
of section 235, are excluded from the application of the 
existing section 85. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the purpose of this bill. Let us look now at its 
effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say right off that the phenomenon of violent crime, 
particularly that involving firearms, is extremely serious and 
distressing.  However, the more repressive approach, which 
imposes excessive sentences, in my opinion or in the opinion of 
many of those involved in the area in Quebec, will not 
necessarily reduce crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our neighbours to the south, the United States of America, have 
a per capita rate of incarceration that is one of the highest in 
the west. 
It is also a country where, although a large number of states 
have reintroduced the death penalty, the crime rate has not 
dropped accordingly.  This shows that repressive measures are 
not what reduce crime.

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another very troubling feature of Bill C-484 is that, by 
providing for very tough minimum sentences, it reduces the 
discretionary power of courts to hand down sentences that take 
into account the circumstances under which offences were 
committed.  It is as though suddenly judges were not allowed to 
exercise their judgment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under our criminal justice system, sentences can be adjusted to 
fit the crime and the person that committed it. 
This is described as taking into account the subjective and 
objective gravity of an offence.  The subjective gravity has to 
do with the circumstances surrounding the person charged with 
the offence and the objective gravity has to do with identifying 
the extenuating or aggravating circumstances under which the 
offence was committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By substantially increasing the minimum sentences for all 
imaginable circumstances, the member is attempting to turn the 
Criminal Code into a strict set of instructions with no room for 
judicial discretion.  This runs counter to a long-recognized 
principle essential to the enforcement of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important principle is flouted here. 
This is the principle prohibiting multiple convictions 
established by the Supreme Court of Canada in Kienapple v. The 
Queen.  Under this principle, a person may not be convicted 
under different sections having the same elements.  A person 
cannot be charged twice for the same offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the bill before us, this principle is set aside.  For 
instance, convicting someone of robbery, or armed robbery, and 
giving them an additional ten-year minimum sentence for 
committing the offence with a firearm is simply ridiculous.  Yet 
this is what the bill does by introducing the concept of dual 
conviction, when in fact both offences include the same 
essential elements flowing from the same case and the same 
offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any democratic system, the Kienapple principle is very 
important. 
No self-respecting justice system would consider supporting such 
a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last, but not least, if this bill were passed, it would almost 
certainly violate section 12 of the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms under which everyone has the right not to be 
subjected to any cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the courts have already questioned the 
constitutionality of the one-year sentence now provided for in 
section 85 of the Criminal Code.  It goes without saying that a 
minimum sentence of 10 years would violate section 12 and would 
certainly fail the reasonability test of section 1 of the 
Charter.  This is not the first time the Reform Party has taken 
leave of its senses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, I am unable to support the bill and, 
speaking for the Bloc Quebecois, I am certainly not alone.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-484, 
an act to amend the Criminal Code so that any individual who uses 
a firearm in the commission of certain criminal offences will 
receive an additional sentence of incarceration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is behind this legislation?  The member for 
Saskatoon—Humboldt who introduced the bill made reference to old 
Bill C-68 with which there is a lot of concern particularly in 
the regions of Canada that a lot of innocent people who use 
firearms are being asked to jump through a lot of hoops 
unnecessarily and the criminal element is in a sense overlooked.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we speak today thousands and thousands of people who perhaps 
would seldom use firearms for anything other than the occasional 
hunting trip or the occasional trip out to the shooting gallery 
or the gun club are being asked to go through a process in an 
effort to make our country a safer place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose one could make the argument that another way to 
approach it would be to say to people who use firearms to 
participate in some kind of criminal activity that we will come 
down extremely heavy on them.  The misuse of a firearm is 
something we simply do not want to tolerate.  We are not 
particularly concerned about people who use firearms for 
recreational purposes, for international competitions and so on. 
We are concerned about the people who misuse firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend has introduced a private member's bill as a way to say 
to individuals that if they use firearms to participate in a 
crime the penalties, if found guilty, will be much more severe. 
That is how we could summarize this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also suggests the whole issue of consecutive sentencing of 
10, 20 or in some cases 25 years.  If individuals are found 
guilty of committing a crime while carrying a firearm, whether it 
is a pistol, rifle, shotgun or whatever, 10 years would be added 
to their sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This sends a signal to people that as a society we will not 
tolerate this behaviour.  If individuals participate in criminal 
activity while carrying a firearm and the firearm is discharged 
not necessarily causing any harm but to shoot at a person or 
shoot to frighten or whatever, their sentence will be increased 
to 20 years after the time for the original offence has been 
served.  If they happen to actually cause bodily harm the 
sentence will be increased by 25 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could argue about whether these terms of 10, 20 or 25 years 
are appropriate.  We are trying to send a very clear message to 
people that we do not appreciate their participating in criminal 
activities, but if they use a firearm to assist in carrying out a 
dastardly deed we will be particularly hard on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are these offences?  For greater certainty the sponsor of 
the bill has included a number of offences.  I will name them 
because I think it is important.  Murder is included as are 
manslaughter, attempted murder, assault causing bodily harm with 
intent, sexual assault with a weapon, aggravated sexual assault, 
kidnapping, hostage taking, robbery and extortion.  All these are 
dastardly crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a society we have clearly said we do not tolerate robbery or 
kidnapping.  For various reasons people participate in these 
activities.  A whole other element is added when a firearm is 
carried while the crime is being conducted.  This tells 
individuals being kidnapped or robbed that if they do not behave 
as the criminal wants them to, their lives will be taken. They 
will be maimed.  They will be shot.  Very serious bodily harmed 
will be caused.  It adds another dimension to the process. It is 
one thing to rob a person but it is another to hold up a person 
with a firearm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I like the legislation.  I do not know if these are the 
appropriate terms.  I do not know if there should be other 
additions to the member's list.  The purpose of this debate is to 
move the legislation forward.  If it were to move forward we 
would go into committee where we would hear witnesses and perhaps 
fine-tune the legislation.  This is sort of a first draft or a 
first run through.  For that reason I am generally in favour of 
the legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have tried to come to grips with the whole issue of firearm 
control in Canada.  I know we have all been lobbied hard by 
representatives on both sides of the issue.  I am convinced that 
the legislation we used to refer to as Bill C-68, the firearms 
control act, will not have any appreciable effect on reducing the 
amount of violent crime in society.  It will not have much of an 
impact on reducing the misuse of firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the deaths caused each year by firearms, very 
few are the result of a person actually shooting somebody.  It is 
the result of somebody's gun going off.  It is the result of a 
domestic dispute.  It is the result of a hunting accident.  We 
have to ask ourselves if that firearm were registered would there 
not still be that homicide.  If you are in a domestic dispute and 
your firearm is registered, are you going to say that you 
probably should not kill that person because it is registered? 
You have lost control and you are probably going to misuse that 
firearm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about whether firearms should exist or not. 
We are talking about the whole process of Bill C-68 and the 
registration of firearms.  Having looked at that carefully, I do 
not think it will be very effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, will this be effective?  What if we were to tell people 
that if they misuse a firearm while participating in a crime the 
penalties will be significantly increased?  We would all agree 
that 10, 20 or 25 years in jail is a very serious penalty. I 
might add that is a consecutive penalty.  It is added on after 
the first penalty.  I would question whether it would act as a 
deterrent.  I suspect it probably would.  I would like to hear 
evidence on whether it would or would not, but I guess we will 
have a chance to debate that in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 Statistics Canada indicated that 33% of violent crimes 
committed with a firearm resulted in the victim being injured. In 
cases involving assault and sexual assault that number rises to 
over 50%.  We are talking about this legislation having very 
serious implications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people participate in or are involved with extortion, 
aggravated sexual assault, sexual assault with a weapon and so 
on, it often results in bodily harm and often leads to death.  It 
is something we have to take a lot more seriously.  I would like 
to seek unanimous consent to have a vote on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique—Mactaquac, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to offer the comments of the Progressive 
Conservative Party on Bill C-484.  The PC Party believes in 
consecutive sentences to get tough on criminals.  The PC Party 
also believes in legislation that gets tough on criminals who use 
firearms in the commission of an offence.  The PC Party believes 
that by getting tough on criminals of all ages while offering and 
supporting meaningful programs for their rehabilitation, we can 
create a safe society for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we do not believe that Bill C-484 will be able to 
remedy all the degenerative legislation that has been enacted 
over the past six years by a Liberal government that is soft on 
crime.  For example, this legislation could be rendered useless 
due to Liberal initiatives such as conditional sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Liberal initiative has already been applied to rapists so 
why should we not believe that it would not be liberally applied 
to offenders falling under the auspices of Bill C-484? 
Conversely, we feel Bill C-484 is disproportionate to the rest of 
the Criminal Code in terms of the proposed sentences offered to 
criminals who fall under the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government would commit to sensible gun control 
legislation that did not discriminate against law-abiding gun 
owners, and if it would follow the lead of its own MPs and commit 
to consecutive sentencing, the opposition parties would not feel 
the need to propose amendments to correct such bad legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Liberals came into power in 1993 they have tried to 
paint themselves as champions of justice and protectors of the 
public interest.  In doing so they have promoted gun control 
legislation through basic, simplistic terms that played on the 
fears of a public fearful for its own public safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious now that the Reform Party too is falling victim to 
this Liberal image doctoring as its proposed amendments are 
playing right into the hands of Liberal ideals concerning gun 
control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of creating more negative firearms publicity through the 
bill, the Reform Party should be blasting the Liberals for their 
soft stand on crime.  If the Liberals took a harder stance on 
issues such as youth and organized crime, if they listened to 
their colleagues and passed legislation on consecutive 
sentencing, and if they gave our police forces the proper funding 
needed to enforce the law, there would be no need for constant 
Criminal Code amendments to correct bad Liberal legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meaningful legislation would allow people to feel safe in the 
towns and cities of Canada.  They would feel safe enough that the 
anti-gun lobby would not be forced to create its propaganda that 
also affects law-abiding gun owners in an adverse manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party supports the noble basis of Bill C-484, as it is 
steeped in the ideal of public safety.  However, we are tempered 
by difficulties that this proposed legislation will encounter 
when confronted with existing, backward Liberal legislation.  In 
noting this inevitable confrontation, we feel that the following 
problems will ensue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost, our party has made it abundantly clear that 
the Liberal government has and continues to enact firearms 
legislation that discriminates against law-abiding gun owners. 
The Liberals are famous for being parochial fence-sitters that 
manoeuvre in the middle ground so as to avoid committing to 
anything that may damage their popularity.  After all, the 
Liberals have continually proven that their objective is to 
support any popular cause as long as it ensures their 
re-election.  The result is a government with no foresight and no 
platform other than that of doing whatever is necessary to be 
re-elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I previously mentioned, the issue of gun control is one that 
was very easy for the Liberals to be seen as the champions of 
justice for the Canadian people.  With violent images of crime 
being broadcast nightly into the living rooms of Canadians, the 
Liberals gained widespread support by saying that Canada had to 
get tougher gun registration laws to cut down on the availability 
of guns to the public.  They quickly translated this tugging of 
Canadian heart strings into the now infamous Bill C-68, which is 
as disappointing as the current Bill C-68 debated today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Neglecting the fact that this bill would cost taxpayers hundreds 
of millions of dollars to implement and that it would take up to 
233 years to register all Canadian firearms, the Liberals went 
ahead with the legislation championing themselves as the 
protectors of the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy to see the effectiveness of the legislation now that 
the initial hype has been tempered by harsh reality.  For 
example, the Liberal government that will do anything to avoid 
controversy has now come face to face with law-abiding gun owners 
who are protesting Bill C-68 as it discriminates against them 
with an ineffective, time consuming registration process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In continuing with the theme of Liberal legislation that led to 
harsh realty, last week there was the occurrence of an absolute 
tragedy at the OC Transpo depot in Ottawa.  The fact is that the 
Liberal's Bill C-68 would not have prevented a person like Pierre 
Lebrun from buying the gun used to facilitate his horrific 
killing spree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what happens when dealing with a government that has no 
ideology or focus.  It was popular and thus politically safe to 
implement legislation like Bill C-68.  The Liberals must have 
felt that discriminating against law-abiding groups of gun owners 
would be a necessary evil but well worth it when compared to the 
support they would gain through an emotional subject like gun 
control. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1830"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT102"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in the Liberals' push for popularity they neglected to 
deal with the real issue at hand.  If the Liberals—and in the 
case of Bill C-484, the Reform Party—would focus their efforts 
on the root causes of crime, we would not need Bill C-484, which 
will only bring more negative propaganda against gun owners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to remember that the gun itself does not commit the 
crime.  Therefore, we need to focus on stopping the real causes 
of crime, such as unemployment, poverty and the lack of 
protection from non-rehabilitated offenders who are released too 
soon due to concurrent sentencing and prison release quotas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, these problems are not as easily dealt with.  Thus, we 
will not see the Liberals or the Reform Party delve into these 
issues and risk their popularity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second caution which our party would like to make has to do 
with the idea of amending the Criminal Code.  Amending the 
Criminal Code can be a dangerous practice as it involves some of 
our society's most fundamental beliefs.  Although these beliefs 
relate specifically to the manner in which our society 
disciplines itself, they also overlap into other areas, such as 
the charter of rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, if society was allowed to make amendments every time the 
Criminal Code fell afoul of popular opinion, we would make 
changes in haste that could adversely affect significant portions 
of society, and because such changes would be made in response to 
popular public opinion, it would leave minority groups 
unprotected from the tyranny of the majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to have faith in our judicial system which allows our 
judges to interpret the Criminal Code as it relates to an 
individual case.  Although the system is not perfect, it allows 
for thoughtful, non-partisan decisions to be rendered and it 
allows for appeals of the process to be heard. 
<P><A NAME="LINK277"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
commend my hon. colleague from Kamloops for his well thought out 
speech and I appreciate his attempt to have this private member's 
bill deemed votable, as I did myself.  Clearly he has far more 
respect for the democratic process than any Liberal MP in this 
House, which brings to me to the comments of the member for 
Scarborough East who stated that the bill is a waste of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That comment is insulting and is typical of Liberal arrogance. 
More importantly, it underscores their soft on crime approach and 
their reluctance and unwillingness to deal with the criminal 
element in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do they insist on protecting criminals instead of 
law-abiding citizens?  Why will they not enact legislation which 
makes our communities and our society safer? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been pressuring them to remove section 745.  It is the 
provision that allows first degree murderers to be released on to 
the street after serving only 15 years in prison.  That is a 
Liberal policy.  The conditional sentences say to criminals who 
have committed violent acts “Just don't do it again and we will 
let you go”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the Young Offenders Act.  The member for 
Mississauga West ranted on and on about how radical the Reform 
Party is for wanting to have young offenders named. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I live in a nice community in Saskatoon.  I submit that I have a 
right to know if some youth who lives on my street is a criminal. 
If one of my neighbour's kids engages in some criminal activity, 
breaking into people's houses, stealing cars or is trafficking 
drugs, I have a right to know because I have a family.  It is 
shameful that the Liberal member for Mississauga West would stand 
in this House and say it is okay to deny Canadians the right to 
know when people living beside them are criminals.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also said that it was his preference to defer to judicial 
discretion, which is also the preference of all Liberal members 
of parliament.  As we know, recently a court in British Columbia 
ruled that it is a violation of our constitutional rights to not 
be allowed to possess child pornography.  As we know, Reform 
Party members found that absolutely disgraceful and we urged the 
government to invoke the notwithstanding clause to override the 
judge in that case because possession of child pornography is a 
crime and it must be considered a crime.  Did the Liberals stand 
to defend the children who are the victims of child pornography? 
No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixty-eight Liberals signed a letter asking the Prime Minister 
to do exactly the same thing which we asked for two weeks later 
in the House, but the Prime Minister cracked his whip and the 
backbench flock of sheep stepped into line.  Their approach to 
crime is absolutely disgraceful and all Canadians ought to know 
that this Liberal government is refusing to act to make our 
streets safer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My private member's bill today is a simple, straightforward 
attempt to target the criminal use of firearms.  What could be 
simpler?  What could be more straightforward? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Scarborough East said that it panders to our 
emotions of fear.  We do have fear.  I talk to elderly people all 
the time who say that at night they are scared to walk down the 
street.  When they see a group of young people approaching, they 
get scared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of culture have we created in our society?  Why do we 
not act now to implement laws which change that?  Why do we not 
enact laws that target the criminal use of firearms instead of 
law-abiding citizens who use firearms for legitimate purposes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker, as you know and as all members of 
the House know, the purpose in passing the Firearms Act was not 
to crack down on crime; it was to confiscate legally owned 
firearms from all citizens in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to conclude by saying that it is very unfortunate that 
the undemocratic Liberal members of parliament refuse to allow my 
proposal for a 10-20-life law to come to a vote in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The time provided

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
March 4 I posed a question to the Minister of State for 
Multiculturalism and the Status of Women relating to the issue of 
family taxation and whether the Income Tax Act was the only 
instrument that was relevant in that discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is much broader and the secretary of state I think 
made it very clear to the House that it was much broader.  Not 
only do we have a child care expense deduction available to 
families, we also have a spousal amount, a non-refundable tax 
credit, that is available to families where there is only one 
earner.  We also have the Canadian child tax benefit, which is 
not taxable, as well as the national child benefit program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, under the employment insurance program we have 
provisions for parental leave.  We also have wage and training 
subsidies which are available for parents who have taken parental 
leave and would like to get back into the workforce.  In that 
case we also provide benefits for families with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, under the Canada pension plan there is what is referred 
to as the child rearing drop-out, which ensures that parents who 
withdraw from the workforce to raise children are not unduly 
penalized for having low income years of service in the 
calculation of their Canada pension benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is quite right.  There are a broad range of issues 
that we must balance to ensure that we are fully aware of the 
whole menu of areas in which the Government of Canada, and in 
fact the taxpayers of Canada, support families with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue has now been referred to a subcommittee of the 
Standing Committee on Finance to address the issues of fairness 
and equity and how we deal with families with children.  However, 
it is a children's issue more than it is a tax issue. 
It is a children's issue and if we value our children we must 
also, as the minister knows, value our caregivers.

<A HREF="#LINKT104"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the finance subcommittee does its work, there are some 
principles that have to be taken into account.  We have to have 
some guideposts in the work we are doing so that we understand 
there are certain things that really should be reflected in the 
policy of the government on behalf of taxpayers. I had given some 
thought to some of the principles we might apply in developing 
policy.  I would like to put them on the record for the 
minister's consideration.  I am going to ask for her comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all our policy should be child centred and promote the 
best interest of the child to the greatest extent possible. 
Second, it should presume that parents are the primary caregivers 
and that they are in the best position to determine what 
constitutes the best possible care for their children.  Third, 
our policy should provide flexibility, options and choices which 
will make it feasible for either parent to be a caregiver or to 
be in the paid workforce.  The fourth item is that our policy 
should be inclusive and responsive to the social realities, 
circumstances and preferences of parents and their children. 
Finally, our policy should be fair and equitable and be seen to 
be fair and equitable and neither penalize nor compel specific 
caregiving choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe these are some principles that we can consider as a 
starting point in terms of how we should shape our policies so 
that they reflect principles and criteria which will be fair and 
equitable to all families regardless of their configuration, 
whether they be one income earner families, or two.  No matter 
what the configuration, certain principles must guide us. I would 
ask the minister for her comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK281"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I welcome the hon. member's 
question.  In asking his question he has shown that he grasps the 
issue and that he understands what is at stake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Families have changed.  There was a social infrastructure to 
meet the needs of families in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s 
and those worked very well.  We have found that families have 
changed since then. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Families come in many different configurations as the hon. 
member said.  We have two parent families where one parent works 
and one parent stays at home.  We have single parent families 
where the lone parent works.  We have single parent families 
where the lone parent stays at home. We have blended families 
where both parents go out to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is how do we meet the needs of these families as a 
government in a way that gives them the choices they need and 
which recognizes the stresses these families face today. They are 
stresses in terms of making tough decisions about how they meet 
their income needs, their caregiving needs, how they spend their 
time. The message we have heard is loud and clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Families are under pressure, especially families with children. 
They are not only under pressure for the caregiving of their 
children.  We now know that families are under pressure for the 
caregiving of the seniors. Their parents are coming home to live 
with them. These same families also have disabled persons that 
they are looking after.  They are supporting the system because 
they are looking after the terminally ill and the chronically ill 
in the home. The pressure that puts on families means the choices 
they make must be flexible.  The choices they make must meet 
their needs so that as the member says, they are not unduly 
penalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issues are not only about the income tax system.  There were 
some answers there.  The hon. member is absolutely right.  We 
need to talk about pensionable earnings.  How do families plan 
for pension?  The Canada pension plan is one way.  Other forms of 
pension would be another way.  How do we look at parental leave, 
at a caregiving subsidy of some kind?  How do we look at the ways 
in which we help these families cope, across the policy 
initiatives, parental leave or otherwise, so that we can assist 
families with the problems they face? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a complex issue. This government has the number one place 
in the world today to figure out these issues and look at ways in 
which to deal with them.
