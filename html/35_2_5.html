	<B>The Speaker:</B> Before we begin with orders of the day, I have a 
point of privilege from the member for Beaver River.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the time.
<P>
	I rise on a question of contempt of Parliament. The issue is one 
that I originally raised as a question of personal privilege on 
February 28 on the floor of the House. After further consideration 
of all the information, I now raise this matter as a concern to all 
members of Parliament in the context of a contempt of Parliament.
<P>
	I cite Joseph Maingot's <I>Parliamentary Privilege in Canada</I>, 
page 192:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>While privilege may be codified, contempt may not, because new forms of 
obstruction are constantly being devised and that Parliament must be able to 
invoke its penal jurisdiction to protect itself against these new forms; there is no 
closed list of classes of offences punishable as contempts of Parliament.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I intend to prove in my arguments that Mr. Simpson of the Prime 
Minister's office coerced, intimated and incited staff of the House 
of Commons into not fulfilling their mandate to answer to a request 
for printing made by me on February 28 and that this constitutes a 
contempt of the House. Consequently I will be asking, Mr. Speaker, 
that if you rule this a prima facie case of privilege, this matter be 
referred to the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs for examination.
<P>
	It is difficult to determine what any House of Parliament will 
consider as an offence and a contempt of Parliament. Erskine May 
describes contempt as:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Any act or omission which obstructs or impedes either House of Parliament in 
the performance of its functions, or which obstructs or impedes any member or 
officer of such House in the discharge of his duty, or which has a tendency, directly 
or indirectly, to produce such results may be treated as contempt  even though 
there is no precedent for the offence. It is therefore impossible to list every act 
which might be considered to amount to a contempt, the power to punish for such 
an offence being of its nature discretionary. Nevertheless, certain broad principles 
may be deduced from a review of the kinds of misconduct which in the past either 
House has punished as a contempt.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	On October 29, 1980 a Speaker of this House had this to say:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The dimension of contempt of Parliament is such that the House will not be 
constrained in finding a breach of privileges of members, or of the House. This 
is precisely the reason that, while our privileges are defined, contempt of the 
House has no limits. When new ways are found to interfere with our 
proceedings, so too will the House, in appropriate cases, be able to find that a 
contempt of the House has occurred.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The House shall not be constrained in dealing with this matter. It 
is a very serious matter and should be taken up by the Standing 
Committee of Procedure and House Affairs for further study.
<P>
	It is very important at this time to understand the sequence of the 
events in this matter. Since I went through those last week I do not 
know if we need all the gory details again. However, suffice it to 
say that when I requested a printing order from the printing people 
they were willing to fulfil my request and had already completed 
48 out of the 60 copies I had requested when not only one but two 
phone calls were made from the department to the Prime Minister's 
office to talk about the number of copies that would be available. It 
then slipped out erroneously from the printing department that it 
had run off copies and that it was for an opposition member.
<P>
	At that point,Mr. Simpson in the Prime Minister's office said: 
``No, do not fulfil her request''. It certainly limits me or any other 
member of the House of Commons when somebody from the Prime 
Minister's office can know what is going on and what members are 
asking to be printed, and further that somebody there would have 
the gall to say do not print that.
<P>
	I give notice and read the following motion which I am prepared 
to put forward. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Mr. Simpson of the Prime Minister's office coerced, intimated and 
incited staff of the House of Commons into not fulfilling their mandate to 
answer to a request for printing made on February 28, 1996 by the member for 
Beaver River, and that this constitutes a contempt of this House, and 
consequently that this matter be referred to the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs for examination.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="212"> 212 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member will recall that I did rule on 
what I feel is the first part of the question which she put before 
the House in review. The second part constitutes something quite 
different from what we dealt in the first, which was an 
administrative matter.
<P>
<B>(1105 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Labour and Deputy 
Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, you have already ruled on this issue. I do not think the 
hon. member has all the facts. Therefore, Mr. Speaker, before you 
proceed we should find out exactly to whom the document belongs.
<P>
	In any caucus there are documents that belong to it. All caucuses 
have documents such as research papers which belong to the 
caucus and we ask the House printer to print them for caucus 
members, whether from the government, the official opposition or 
the Reform Party.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, before you proceed you should inquire as to the 
exact ownership of the document. I think the hon. member is 
coming back on a ruling you have already made. I do not see any 
new facts. They are the same facts, the same document, the same 
person she referred to last week. Before you proceed, you should 
inquire more about the facts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I heard briefly some of the remarks from outside the 
Chamber, remarks with regard to the alleged question of privilege 
today.
<P>
	As the deputy House leader has just indicated, the Chair has 
already ruled on the issue. To raise the issue again with a further 
belief that the same point is valid even though it has been rejected 
by the Chair is not usually recognized by the Chair as being valid in 
itself.
<P>
	The Board of Internal Economy has its own entity of the board 
and a subcommittee on printing. If my agenda is correct, we have a 
meeting of the subcommittee on printing only a few days from 
now. There are representatives from each of the political parties on 
that subcommittee of the board on printing. I believe the whip of 
the Reform Party is a member of that subcommittee. That sounds 
like an appropriate vehicle through which to raise the issue even 
though it is not a question of privilege, as the Speaker has indicated 
to us.
<P>
	There is probably a suitable forum to raise the issue there to see 
if anything that has occurred is inappropriate, notwithstanding that 
it is not a point of privilege, and to determine what correction or 
restitution is in order if an offence by someone has been committed 
at any time.
<P>
	We do have that structure. It was created by the Board of Internal 
Economy, which was created by the House. The issue could be 
appropriately dealt with in that forum. I understand we are only a 
few days away from a meeting of that group.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in reference to the chief government whip's statement I would have 
to disagree that it is appropriate for this matter to be dealt with in 
that subcommittee. The issue here is not printing. The issue here is 
interference, bold faced interference by the Prime Minister's 
office.
<P>
	This is a serious enough matter that we as members of the House 
want to redress it in the most appropriate forum, which is certainly 
not that subcommittee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
in the House when the issue was first raised by the hon. member, at 
which time the Speaker also ruled.
<P>
	My understanding is that when a matter comes forward like this 
in the same form after the Speaker has ruled, it is effectively a 
challenge to the Chair.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	I would like to have clarification of whether it is the intention of 
the member to challenge the Chair's ruling with regard to the 
matters that have been addressed in the House. That is an extremely 
important point for all members. The integrity of the Chair is very 
important to the House.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> Mr. Speaker, it certainly is not my intention to 
challenge the Chair ever. You and I had a meeting along with the 
clerk of the House of Commons. New facts came out when you 
talked to me very specifically about the printing department and all 
those departments being under your supervision.
<P>
	We are not talking about printing here. We are talking about 
interference by the Prime Minister's office which, Mr. Speaker told 
me clearly, was not under his jurisdiction. I am talking about a 
contempt of Parliament by the Prime Minister's office, not the 
printing department.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We understand that the point of privilege on 
which I ruled has now been set aside.
<P>
	Regarding the second point, the point of contempt, I would like 
to inform myself, get more information, seeing as I have been 
asked by both the deputy House leader for the government and by 
the Reform Party to consider the information.
<P>
	I ask that the hon. member for Beaver River table the document 
she referred to in her contempt of Parliament. If you will give me 
some time, I will come back to the House with a ruling which I 
hope will be clear to all members.
<P>
	If that will be deposited with the clerk, it will form part of the 
other point that was brought up, which I will look at. I will come 
back to the House if necessary.

<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I declare the motion carried.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this motion 
calls for the reinstatement of any government bills at the same 
stage under the same legislative procedure and process at which 
they stood at the time of prorogation.
<P>
	Why is this necessary? Why not introduce legislation from the 
session before we prorogued which is new and improved? All those 
bills that are at various stages and which all members know can be 
improved upon, why not bring them back in their new forms?
<P>
	Why did the Prime Minister prorogue? To give a confusing 
throne speech? He talks about a national referendum in the throne 
speech or is there not a national referendum? He talked about 
creating jobs and not creating jobs. He said that maybe it is not the 
government which should create jobs, it should be the business 
community. He talked about national unity: Is it plan A, plan B or 
no plan at all?
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No plan at all.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> No plan at all. That is probably what he has.
<P>
	The point is, why did the Prime Minister prorogue if only to 
introduce this motion to bring back any of the legislation, anytime 
the government wants at any stage at which the legislation was if it 
is similar to the current bill? Why did we prorogue?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> For a photo op.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> For a photo op. I never thought of that one.
<P>
	We were happily working along in the 35th Parliament. We were 
happily going about our business trying to make the government be 
held accountable. We were working along trying to ensure that the 
bills that were being passed were as good as possible and trying to 
give our constructive criticisms.
<P>
	What happened? The Prime Minister said: ``Whoa, let's clean 
the slate. Let's just take three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine 
weeks'', how many weeks did we take off? He said: ``Let's just take 
that time off. We will prorogue and we will come back with a new 
slate. We will  come back here with a new throne speech, a new 
direction, a new vision and new ideas for Canada''. What do we 
get? Motion M-1: ``Let's bring back all the old bills whenever we 
want. We will not tell the opposition when; we will just sneak them 
in there when we can and at the same stage''.
<P>
	That is anti-democratic and very autocratic. The use of closure 
which we just voted on is a violation of the freedom of speech 
within the House. It is a violation of the freedom to openly express 
our thoughts and our points of view. By limiting the debate, by 
limiting the time in which we can debate this, we are forcing 
members of Parliament to be quiet. We are allowing this freely, 
democratically elected Prime Minister to be a dictator and he is 
dictating to us by his very action.
<P>
	Why is the government acting just like the previous government, 
but only worse? When the Liberal members were on this side of the 
House they accused the Tories of using closure and time allocation 
and the hue and cry went out. I can remember watching them on 
television saying it was anti-democratic and asking why debate was 
being limited. All the arguments they were using I am using now, 
except they are over on the other side and they are laughing. 
Already the Liberals have used time allocation and closure in the 
35th Parliament more times than the Conservative government did 
during its mandate of four years.
<P>
	The Prime Minister when he was opposition leader sat here 
criticizing former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney asking: ``Why 
are you travelling outside the country? Why are you going all over 
the world when the problems are here in Canada? We have to solve 
our problems with Quebec; we have to solve our problems with 
Alberta, B.C., Ontario and the Atlantic provinces? Why are you 
travelling all over the world?''
<P>
	Now that he is Prime Minister, the current Prime Minister has 
already travelled more outside this country. He is very close to 
being outside this country more, while we have to run this 
government, than he has been in the country. This Prime Minister 
has travelled more than the previous Prime Minister Brian 
Mulroney.
<P>
	Why is he doing this exactly in contradiction? I have already 
mentioned prorogation. When the Conservatives prorogued the 
House and they came back in, all they wanted to do was bring back 
five bills. That is all the Conservatives wanted to do, bring back 
five bills. When the Liberals were on this side in opposition the hue 
and cry that went out about those five bills, about how it was 
anti-democratic, how it was short circuiting the system, how it was 
changing the parliamentary rules. They said: ``We would never do 
that if we were over there because we are better than you guys. We 
would be different''.
<P>
	What did they do now that they are over there? Exactly the same 
thing as the Conservative Party did, only worse. They sat over here 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="215"> 215 </A></B>
<P>
and watched the Tory GST come in. They said: ``That is not the 
way to do it.  We should look at tax reform. We should look at other 
ways of replacing this manufacturers' sales tax. We would get rid 
of it. We hate it. We would kill it''. What have they done in two and 
a half years? They have not got rid of it. They have not killed it.
<P>
	On Senate appointments, how they used to sit here in opposition 
and criticize those Senate appointments and they are doing it the 
very same way. They are doing it for the very same purposes, the 
very same reasons as the Conservatives.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	What has changed? All that has been done is change the faces of 
the people in government. The system has not been changed. In 
fact, it is worse. What about the latest appointment to the Senate? I 
am sure the gentleman is a fine, outstanding Canadian citizen but 
he is eight months away from having to retire after he is appointed 
to the job. Does it not take six to eight months to learn the job of a 
senator? It takes at least a year to learn the job as a member of 
Parliament. By the time this gentleman learns the job he is out and 
is replaced by someone else. Why not put someone in the Senate 
who has some time to learn and contribute something?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> He is just holding it for another Liberal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> The action by this government on Motion No. 1 is 
anti-democratic, is short-circuiting the system and is a very lazy 
way of governing the country. That is, I think, the secret of the 
success of this government. It is a do very little or do nothing and 
keep the Canadian public asleep and quiet. Do not get them upset 
with any controversial issues. Distort the truth. Tell the Canadian 
public that we have broken the back of the deficit. Tell the 
Canadian public that this is the best bill that has ever come along 
since sliced bread. Then, as the leader of the country, stand up and 
say: ``Don't worry. Be happy. Everything is okay. Quebecers are 
happy. All Canadians are happy. Everything is fine''.
<P>
	I am disappointed in the government's actions. I am 
disappointed that government members will not act and behave the 
way they said they would when they were in opposition.
<P>
	I submit the following as being the real reason the government is 
doing this. It has no real, new, substantive legislation planned for 
this session. Therefore, it needs an inventory to draw on. What 
better inventory than the 32 bills that are sitting in abeyance 
somewhere in various stages? If it has a slow Tuesday, Wednesday 
or Thursday, when the member for the opposition party gets up on 
the Thursday question and asks: ``What is in store the next week?'', 
the government will be able to just pick one out here or there or 
knowing that a committee is not very busy and it will just pick 
another one out and get the committee busy. That is why the 
government did this. It has nothing planned.
<P>
	Look at the throne speech. What is in the throne speech that sets 
out anything newer than what it said in the first throne speech? 
What is in the throne speech that gives it a new direction or a new 
focus so Canadians can feel there is something to look forward to? 
What is there?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nothing at all.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> This prorogation was strictly for the purposes of 
general appearances, to make it look as if the government is still in 
control. As members will recall, before we prorogued things were 
unravelling, unsettling.
<P>
	This Prime Minister bragged about that red book. He bragged 
about the people he was attracting to that party. He said he had the 
plan. He said he had the people. However, we very quickly found 
out that there was no plan because they spent all those months in 
committees trying to come up with the purple book, the green 
book, the lavender book and the grey book.
<P>
	Talk about the people. He fired everybody. His people were so 
good he fired them all. He fired all the parliamentary secretaries. 
He fired some cabinet ministers. Where are the people? Those 
people he brought in, I believe 178 of them, were so good that he 
had to bring in two more from the outside. Now we have 
byelections to bring in two new members. Not only have they never 
been elected before, not only have they never served in public 
office before; they are cabinet ministers. Right away they are 
cabinet ministers. How good are these people? For general 
appearances, that was my point.
<P>
	Liberals brag about how wonderful their first two years were and 
how the wonderful finance minister in two years of rolling targets 
is meeting these soft targets, how great he is and how much better 
he is than any previous finance minister. I will give him credit for 
this: the previous finance ministers have been a sorry lot. They 
could not even project three, four or five months ahead. At least I 
will give the finance minister credit for setting a target, no matter 
how soft, and meeting it. He made some cuts, no matter how 
meagre, and met them and beat them. That is good for the 
investment community. It just has to be done a little bit quicker.
<P>
	However, that is about the only thing government members can 
brag about. Do they brag about abrogating the NAFTA? The Prime 
Minister in opposition said: ``If elected I will abrogate NAFTA 
unless they change certain clauses''. Do members know what really 
happened? They signed it as was. They did not change one word or 
one letter in the agreement. They just signed it.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	The Liberals said that when they were elected they would protect 
civil servants. They did a good job of that. They fired 45,000 of 
them. They promised no big spending cuts. Since they have been in 
office, during the  past two and one-half years, they have 
announced $15 billion in spending cuts. That is less than what 
Reformers would have cut but where did they cut the most? Right 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="216"> 216 </A></B>
<P>
where it hurts people the most: in education, in health care and in 
welfare.
<P>
	The Reform Party, the party that has been accused of being slash 
and burn, would have cut $3 billion less than the government on 
health care, education and welfare. The government's combined 
cuts with its Canadian social and health transfer is $6.6 billion and 
ours would have been only $3 billion; that is $3 billion more than 
we would have cut.
<P>
	Talk about slash and burn. Talk about draconian. That is the party 
that should be embarrassed. That is the party that is down loading 
its problems to the provinces. The provinces now have to deliver 
the programs for education, health care and welfare. Now they just 
sit back over there on that side of the House and say: ``Boy, did we 
pull a good one on the provinces, eh? We give them less money, we 
made our cuts. Now they have to administer it''.
<P>
	Guess whose Parliament gets rocks thrown in the windows? Not 
the House of Commons but Queen's Park. Guess which premiers 
get all the flack? Not the Prime Minister but Mike Harris and Ralph 
Klein. They have to take all the flack over health care and 
education when they are trying to administer the diminishing funds 
they are getting. They should have had $3 billion more.
<P>
	Talk about smart. That is smart. It is smart politics but it is not 
smart government. It is not smart investment of money.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, in the throne speech did the Liberals brag-I 
believe the only reason they prorogued the House was to do some 
bragging-about eliminating that GST? No. Once again that is 
smart politics. What did they do? They are now going to introduce 
a new national sales tax that combines provincial sales taxes with 
the goods and services tax, calling it the national sales tax.
<P>
	Do we think the federal government is going to reduce its take 
from 7 per cent? No. It will expect the tax to go through, combine it 
with the provinces and call it one tax. I recall when the finance 
minister was in opposition. He criticized the GST as the 
replacement for the manufacturers' sales tax. I cannot quite 
remember the quote, but to paraphrase the finance minister he said 
that replacing one bad tax with another new bad tax, it still remains 
a bad tax. Is that not the same logic as that exhibited by the finance 
minister now? Does a national sales tax which combines a 
provincial and a federal tax not leave the rates the same? They were 
bad taxes separately. Is it still not a bad tax to combine them? Does 
it not remain a bad tax under a different name?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> What will it do to Alberta?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> What will it do to the province of Alberta that does 
not have a provincial sales tax? Are we going to  make that 
government collect 15 per cent of taxes, then rebate people? The 
government does not brag about things like that. That is very smart 
politics. The Liberals know how to pull the wool over people's 
eyes, to distort the truth just a little by talking about what they are 
doing and how they are doing it. If they say it often enough then 
people might just believe it.
<P>
	Do the Liberals brag about all the broken promises they have 
made but have not kept? There must be a lot of people that voted 
Liberal who are very disappointed in the government's efforts. In 
fact, I happen to know of a lot of backbenchers that are unhappy 
with the government's efforts. I know why they are unhappy. They 
are unhappy about that GST and the promise of replacing or 
eliminating it. The red book says replace.
<P>
	The newspapers have been quite clear that when the Liberals 
campaigned door to door-I cannot name the members because I 
do not know their ridings-many of the members around Toronto 
said, ``We will get rid of the GST. We hate the GST. This is an 
awful tax. It is not going to be there. You vote for us and it is gone. 
The GST is gone''.
<P>
	The red book says replace which I understand. I understand the 
Prime Minister saying: ``I hate it. I would kill it. We will get rid of 
it. Now I have to find something to replace it with''. I know he did 
say that. He said that in some speeches. I heard him say that in 
Calgary when I went to listen to him speak.
<P>
	However, I hear that a lot of the backbenchers around Toronto 
did not say that. They went door to door and said: ``Vote for me, 
we'll get rid of the GST''. They did not say that would replace it 
with something revenue neutral. They did not get that elaborate. A 
lot of the backbenchers are worried about the next election. They 
are saying that unless the government gets rid of the GST, 
harmonizes it, hides it or something, and tries to keep this promise, 
their chances of getting re-elected are nil. It is about integrity. It is 
about keeping one's word. It is about making a promise and 
keeping that promise. The government is slowly eroding the 
foundations of the word called integrity. A national sales tax will 
be the son of the GST. However, once again it is smart politics but 
it is not good government.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	One of the biggest promises made by the Prime Minister during 
his campaign was made September 10, 1993, about a month and a 
half before the vote. He said there would not be a promise that he 
would make in the campaign that he would not keep. Fair enough.
<P>
	Five days later he said something to the effect that anyone could 
go before him at any time with that red book, wave it in his face and 
say, where are you with your promises? By the points that I made, 
where is the Prime Minister with his promises?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="217"> 217 </A></B>
<P>
	He broke the promise on NAFTA. He broke the promise on 
protecting the civil service. He broke the promise on big spending 
cuts. He broke the promise on the GST or he has not kept it yet, 
although he still has time. He can still get rid of it. We will wait 
for him. Mr. Prime Minister, where are you with your promises? 
Mr. Prime Minister, why are you acting like your predecessor, but 
even worse? How can you sit on that side of the House?
<P>
	Reformers could never do that. Once we become the 
government, we are going to keep our promises. We are going to 
run this government the way we said we would. We kept our 
promises. We have kept everything up front, above board and we 
plan to do that all the way through. The government said one thing 
to get elected and now its members act like the previous 
government did in power.
<P>
	That is a great and huge disservice to the Canadian voting public. 
That is not the way to retain one's integrity. I do not understand 
how the Prime Minister can get away with saying one thing in 
opposition and doing another in government. Now in government 
the Liberals say they will do something, then not do it or do the 
opposite.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is sending out such confusing and 
convoluted messages whether he says it in French or in English. No 
matter who is listening, it is confusing, convoluted and 
complicated. Why can we not get a clear direction from the 
government? We ask questions in question period. Are we going to 
have a national referendum on the issue of national unity? Should 
Quebecers decide for themselves whether or not they should be 
voting on that issue or should all Canadians have a say?
<P>
	Anybody can petition for divorce but both parties have to agree 
to the terms. Maybe that is where some of the separatist members 
of the Bloc Quebecois can see the government's side. When one 
gets to the terms of the settlement, perhaps it does take two sides to 
negotiate and to decide what the consequences of that break-up 
would be.
<P>
	This is where the Bloc members could take a look at that new 
cabinet minister who is not a member yet. He is suggesting that 
both parties look at it.
<P>
	Why will the Prime Minister not run Parliament like he 
promised when he was in opposition? Why will the Prime Minister 
not live up to the standard that the Canadian public expected of 
him? He is a very popular individual. He has a personality that is 
liked by all walks of life. He is an individual who has spent 30 
years of his life serving the public.
<P>
	At the end of those 30 years, is it not worthwhile to be able to say 
that he kept his word, his promises? Is it not better at the end of 30 
years to be able to say that he meant what he said, that he said what 
he meant and did it  instead of caging this all in flowery rhetoric, 
confusing everybody, hiring spin doctors to give the right image 
and playing politics all the way through?
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	I am embarrassed for the government. I am embarrassed that it is 
doing a worse job than the Conservative Party ever did in terms of 
the rules of the House and how it is trying to force its legislation 
through with the use of closure, time allocation and with motions 
that make it appear to be a government that is not interested in 
following the democratic process.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, we do not have 10 minutes of 
questions and comments now since the vote. We will therefore go 
directly to the hon. member for Mercier.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I strongly 
object to the motion before us. First of all, for the people watching 
or listening to us, I should explain what this motion means. It 
would allow a minister, during the first 30 sitting days of this 
session, to restore a bill to the same legislative stage it had reached 
at the time of prorogation simply by making a statement at the first 
reading stage of the bill. This bill must be exactly in the same form 
as it was during the last session.
<P>
	For someone who is not familiar with House proceedings, this 
may sound like normal procedure but we cannot find any 
precedents for such a motion. Since 1938, there has been only one 
example of such a motion: in 1991, the Tory government tabled a 
motion for debate on March 28 and then imposed closure on May 
29.
<P>
	Before 1991, parliamentary tradition dictated that such a motion 
be agreed to with the unanimous consent of the House. The 
Liberals, who were then in opposition, strongly denounced that 
motion as irregular and undemocratic.
<P>
	According to parliamentary tradition, when the government puts 
an end to a session, it usually means that it has achieved its goals. If 
some bills die on the Order Paper, the government has only itself to 
blame. A new session means that it must submit new bills to the 
House of Commons to be examined right from the start.
<P>
	We are asking government members to object to it if they want to 
be consistent with what they said in 1991, when they denounced 
this process in very strong terms.
<P>
	If they ever decided to vote in favour of this motion, we would 
end up with bills such as the one on employment insurance-whose 
number I cannot recall-which would have come before the House 
only at the report and third reading stages. They are bypassing all 
the usual legislative stages, as I recall that the employment 
insurance bill did not go through second reading in the usual way. 
The government used a  parliamentary tactic that also bypassed the 
usual procedure.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="218"> 218 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	At second reading, all members were not allowed to express 
their views as they should on such an important bill; instead, we in 
the opposition had to make do with six times ten minutes. This is 
absolutely disgraceful, especially considering the absolutely 
ridiculous amount of time we were given to inform the public about 
the details of former Bill C-111-whose new number we are not 
about find out, I hope-because that is what serving in Parliament 
is about.
<P>
	What is the use of readings, of broadcasting readings, if not to 
inform the public? The public has not received all the information 
it should have been provided with regarding this bill on 
employment insurance.
<P>
	The government interfered with the normal second reading 
process. When people protested vehemently, supported by their 
bishops in the Gaspé Peninsula and by their Churches in other parts 
of Canada, instead of abiding by parliamentary procedure and 
withdrawing the bill, or letting it die on the Order Paper and 
introducing a revised bill, as requested by any and every one who 
cares about the ordinary people of Canada, this government 
impertinently seeks to bring the bill back before the House, during 
the second session of this Parliament, while skipping all other 
stages.
<P>
	This is my first experience as a member of Parliament, and I 
thought that the House of Commons of Canada provided a certain 
decorum, certain democratic guarantees and a forum where the 
people could inform themselves and their representatives, in the 
opposition that is, could raise in public-and be given the time they 
need to make their point-the serious problems posed by various 
bills.
<P>
	I am forced to realize that this is a far cry from how I thought the 
British parliamentary system was used in Canada. This government 
motion goes farther than anything before. This government motion 
is, to put it bluntly, antidemocratic. It is unusual and, as such, 
problematic.
<P>
	That is why, as energetically as we can, we urge the government 
not to proceed according to this motion, but rather according to the 
parliamentary spirit, which provides that, within the course of any 
given session, a certain procedure shall be followed after a bill has 
been read for the first time, that allows the opposition to play its 
role.
<P>
	Let us not forget that, unless the opposition is free and able to 
express its views, there can be no democratic process. The role of 
the opposition is a fundamental one, and a crucial one as well. And 
when we find ourselves in a situation like this, with a bill as 
fundamentally important to ordinary people as the employment 
insurance bill, that will go to committee without having  undergone 
proper consideration at second reading and come back before this 
House only for committee report and third reading, we are dealing 
with highly unusual procedures, which are totally unacceptable. 
Ordinary citizens are not properly served, or else this is a drastic 
and serious change in parliamentary proceedure in the House of 
Commons.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	Numerous rallies were held in various Canadian provinces, 
including Quebec and the Atlantic provinces, by people who are 
disgusted with the major changes included in a bill that was 
supposed to have died on the Order Paper, but that will now be 
referred to committee if the government passes its legislation.
<P>
	People are concerned; they do not know what to do. 
Unemployment insurance is the only security for millions of 
Canadians and Quebecers. There are some who do not understand 
that, because they have financial security; they have money and a 
steady job. But for all the others, unemployment insurance is the 
only security they have. And I could add that it takes them a long 
time to get that security, often a full six weeks. However, few 
people can save enough to survive six weeks with no income, but it 
is possible to somehow manage, if one knows that one will at least 
get a minimum income.
<P>
	Everyone is urging the minister to withdraw this bill and conduct 
an in-depth review of its provisions, because it changes everything. 
It creates conditions whereby, for example, young people, 
newcomers to the labour market will have to work six months 
before being eligible for UI benefits, at a rate of 35 hours of work 
per week.
<P>
	Everyone knows that these conditions are hard to meet for a 
woman who re-enters the labour force, for a new immigrant, for 
someone who has been sick for more than two years or who left the 
labour force, or for a young person entering the labour market. It is 
difficult to keep a first employment. Some do find a stable first job 
that pays well, but this is uncommon. In real life, this is a rare 
occurrence indeed.
<P>
	What does that bill imply? It means that, from now on, in spite of 
having worked at one, two or three jobs, many people who have not 
managed to get six months of employment at an average of 35 
hours per week will have to rely on their friends and family, or go 
on welfare. This is what it means. It means that, instead of entering 
the labour market and, given existing conditions, being able to 
count on some help to tide them over between jobs, people entering 
the workforce will immediately get the feeling that they are being 
ejected from it.
<P>
	This bill contains some discriminatory measures. It also 
completely changes the old rules.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, we will have the opportunity to speak of it a great 
deal, and I am obliged to tell you that we in  the Opposition want 
the government to listen to the Canadian coalition and to withdraw 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="219"> 219 </A></B>
<P>
this bill, or rather just leave it where it is. It does not need to be 
withdrawn because it is supposed to have died on the Order Paper. 
We do not want the government to resuscitate it in its current state, 
for it is a bill which bodes nothing but despair.
<P>
	The government may well say: ``But the demonstrations 
involved only a few thousand people here, a few thousand people 
there, another hundred somewhere else.'' But it cannot claim that 
this bill has not brought out crowds in opposition. Does the 
government not make any move unless it is facing a large enough 
crowd? Has it not itself studied the economic impact of the bill?
<P>
	This bill, which died on the Order Paper and deserves to be 
allowed to rest in peace, was adding $640 million annually in 
unemployment insurance cuts for Quebec alone to the $735 million 
cut annually by the Liberals since 1994. In 1995-96 and 1996-97, 
there will be $735 million less for unemployment insurance 
benefits. If this bill were resuscitated artificially by Motion No. 1, 
it would impose an additional $640 million in cuts.
<P>
	What does that translate into? It means $1,375,000,000 in 
Quebec alone in the year 2000. The Liberal government welcomes 
you to the year 2000, where if Quebec is still part of 
Canada-which I hope will not be the case-unemployment 
insurance will have been cut by $1,375,000,000.
<P>
	And how much in the Atlantic provinces? This year $635 
million, plus $344 million, to a total of $974 million less. What 
does that mean? It means $974 million less for groceries, rent, 
children' basic necessities. That is what those cuts represent. They 
affect what goes directly into the economy, not money used for 
speculative investments, but money injected directly into the 
economy.
<P>
	Did the government even look at the economic impact of these 
cuts in disadvantaged regions, of which there are many in Quebec 
and in the Atlantic provinces? Did it even give this a thought? We 
have been shown studies of all sorts, but no economic impact 
studies have been done. The only thing it came up with, no doubt 
because it heard rumbling, was the figure of $300 million over 
three years, peanuts compared with the cuts I just mentioned.
<P>
	So it is not surprising that the people in the disadvantaged 
regions rose up. It is not surprising that the bishops in the Gaspé 
rang the bells-a sort of alarm in the event of fire-because the 
ordinary folks will be finding themselves facing extremely hard 
times.
<P>
	Why did the government not let the bill die on the Order Paper 
instead of resurrecting it? There is still time for the government to 
give it some thought.
<P>
	It should not underestimate the anger and discontent of the 
ordinary people, who are facing cuts, who know there are more to
<P>
come and who have only this little bit of security. There was indeed 
abuse and a system in certain regions. But individuals are not at 
fault, the fault lies with the labour market, which is not providing 
the jobs it should. We should be going after it and not after the 
people who are eking out a living.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	I implore the government not to bring back this bill. The best 
way would be for it to withdraw this anti-democratic and 
exceptional motion, which the hon. members opposite opposed 
with virulence in 1991, in conditions that were not so harsh as they 
are now. Their responsibility before history, Parliament and society 
will be heavy.

	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, your predecessor on May 29, 1991 ruled the following 
according to Beauchesne's fifth edition, citation 167(1):
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The effect of a prorogation is at once to suspend all business until Parliament 
shall be summoned again. Not only are the sittings of Parliament at an end, but 
all proceedings pending at the time are quashed. Every bill must therefore be 
renewed after a prorogation, as if it were introduced for the first time.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I now continue with the text of the ruling of your predecessor. He 
said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Thus prorogation gives Parliament the chance to start anew in dealing with 
the business of the nation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>While the effects of prorogation are clear, there have been many occasions 
when the government has sought the permission of the House to reinstate 
legislation considered in the previous session. This has always been considered 
an extraordinary procedure. In fact, on two separate occasions, July 1977 and 
March 1982, the House amended its standing orders to permit certain bills to be 
reinstated in the next session. These and other instances of reinstatement-have 
been dealt with by unanimous consent.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This tradition was not followed in 1991 and it is not being 
followed in this year's prorogation. All that the opposition 
demanded in 1991 is being demanded by Reformers and the Bloc 
now: government, please do not use a omnibus motion to reinstate 
all bills that died with prorogation; instead, bring them up for 
unanimous consent, one by one. We the opposition have not only 
the right but the duty to examine the reinstatement of each bill on 
its own merit.
<P>
	Prorogation means the government decides to end a session of 
Parliament and suspend all business. Governments have 
historically used this mechanism because they have exhausted their 
agendas and wish to use the throne speech to set a new tone. All of 
this is business hallowed by long and valued tradition. It has served 
Canada and other parliamentary democracies well.  It should be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="220"> 220 </A></B>
<P>
changed only after it has shown clearly that it no longer serves such 
democracies.
<P>
	The change in tradition introduced in 1991 and continued with 
the present motion threatens to destroy the basic purpose of 
prorogation: the opportunity for government to start parliamentary 
business anew with a new throne speech.
<P>
	With the quasi-automatic reintroduction of unfinished bills from 
the preceding Parliament, all we have left of this tradition is a 
throne speech with its accompanying expensive pomp and vacuous 
media hype. The essential element of a clean legislative slate is 
gone. The historic modification of permitting the reintroduction of 
selected pieces of previous legislation is nullified by the insistence 
that all such previous legislation be reinstated without proper 
debate on each.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	Perhaps it is more efficient in our times to have such omnibus 
motions. During the 1990s in one debate one the members of the 
present government, then in opposition, suggested that such an 
innovation should be embodied in a bill brought before the House 
before prorogation. Reformers agree and are ready any time to be 
persuaded that changing this or any other parliamentary tradition is 
in the interest of all Canadians. We were never given the 
opportunity by the government to vote on this matter.
<P>
	Now here we are in the enjoyable position of being able to cite 
for all some of the remarks made by individuals now on the 
government side of the House, citations which show how power 
corrupts.
<P>
	The former member for Ottawa-Vanier, now in the other 
chamber, said in a speech given on the occasion of prorogation in 
1991, page 647: ``I cannot understand why this government, these 
government bullies now want to impose their will on the House of 
Commons through force of numbers and then would have us 
believe that they are sensitive to parliamentary reform and want 
Canadians to see this House work in a friendly, co-operative way''.
<P>
	I continue with a remark by the hon. member for Kingston and 
the Islands:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I want to deal with the propriety of the motion that the government has 
introduced. I suggest that it is contrary to all the practices of this House for the 
last 124 years. It is a breach of the proprieties of this place. I suggest that it is 
morally wicked of the government to proceed with this motion and particularly 
then to apply closure to the motion and thereby curtail the debate on it. What the 
government is doing by this, and let us make it perfectly clear what is happening 
here, is short-circuiting the legislative process.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I suggest that this is wrong. It is wickedly wrong. It is a gross violation of the 
constitutional principles on which this House has operated since Confederation. 
Indeed it is contrary to the whole practice of British parliamentary tradition for 
900 years. Nothing  like this has ever been tried before. I suggest it is wrong. The 
government knows it is wrong.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	These are remarks made and recorded in <I>Hansard</I> by members of 
the present government in the House to a motion identical to the 
one before us today when they were opposing it.
<P>
	Let me continue with another quotation by the hon. member, 
now a minister, for Cape Breton-East Richmond: ``I contend that 
the motion is in principle unacceptable in that it seeks to 
circumvent, indeed to subvert, the normal legislative process in 
this House''.
<P>
	How can these members of Parliament look us in the eye when 
they stand to vote in favour of closure, in favour of this motion 
which they opposed with such strong words in the past?
<P>
	The hon. member for Kingston and the Islands a few days later in 
1991 said, commenting on this motion: ``In other words there was 
always a debate allowed at third reading of every bill that was 
reinstated, but here in this motion today we have a bill that is 
deemed passed by this House, so there will be no debate at any 
stage on this bill''.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	The record notes an hon. member interrupted the speech saying: 
``That is terrible''. The hon. member who had the floor said: ``It is a 
national disgrace''. Another hon. member yelled: ``It is a travesty''. 
These are the same members who have the affront today to get up 
and vote for a motion which they had a short five years ago 
condemned in such strong words. Let me continue with the speech 
made by the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands. He said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If this kind of thing was reported in parliamentary journals around the world, 
the Canadian Parliament would become a laughing stock because of the 
outrageous conduct of the government in introducing this motion. It violates all 
the constitutional principles of debating bills at three readings in the House of 
Commons. That is the standard practice in every British parliamentary 
institution and has been for hundreds of years, and this government is violating 
this practice.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Who is to blame for this practice aside from all the members on the other 
side? The government itself had a choice.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>They had a choice. Remember those words. The members opposite may 
remember them because they came up in a debate. They had a choice. They 
chose to prorogue the last session and leave the business unfinished on the 
Order Paper. They sent us away through April and early May and said: ``We do 
not want you in Ottawa. We do not want questions every day. We do not want to 
listen to you. We do not want our sins exposed to the people of Canada on 
national television here on the floor of the House of Commons''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I could not have said it better. The only thing I would change in 
order to make this a speech relevant for today's situation is to say: 
You have kept us away from here and the opportunity to do things 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="221"> 221 </A></B>
<P>
for Canadians by debating the issues on the floor of the House until  
February 27, when we were supposed to return much, much earlier.
<P>
	The situation has not changed. These kinds of rulings and 
motions simply show how people change once they get power. 
Once they are sitting on one side and they see the interest of the 
people in continuing with traditions that have served the country so 
well, they argue one way and in the strongest fashion one can 
imagine. The words were used by the same individuals who are 
now in power. We all know power corrupts. What do the Liberals 
do? They have the nerve to stand up and look us in the eye and do 
exactly what they have condemned so strongly in the past.
<P>
	Another favoured member in the government had a few words to 
say on this. It is the hon. member for Halifax. I can just see her 
demeanour when she read into the record the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I can only say that the government should hang its head in shame. One 
wonders today why the government prorogued the House of Commons last 
time. Why did it prorogue? We heard a speech from the throne which did not 
appear to tell us anything new or different. It did not appear to give us any new 
blueprint for Canadians. It was remarkably low on specifics about its programs. 
Yet we had the prorogation. One presumes it was because the government 
wanted to get away from here, take some time, regroup and come back with 
some fresh ideas.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Instead of fresh ideas, we have today this pernicious-and I underline that 
word-motion of the House leader ramming through five bills. We are just 
supposed to pretend that prorogation did not take place. We are just supposed to 
accept the government's decision that these bills will come to this Parliament in 
the state in which they were supposed to have died in the last Parliament.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	I challenge the member for Halifax to look me in the eye, 
remembering the words I have just read which she said on the 
occasion when the government pushed on the House a similar 
closure motion that is under discussion today. It is very revealing 
the way power corrupts.
<P>
	I have a few more quotations. Some of them are quite delicious. I 
must say I am disappointed to read that this is the way these 
individuals talked. The member for Winnipeg North Centre said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The role of the opposition is to be a thoughtful opposition and a thoughtful 
critic of what the government is trying to do. But the lack of opportunity as 
posed to us in this case makes it very difficult for an opposition party to continue 
to deal with the government when we do not feel the government is being honest 
in its motives.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I cannot help myself but read this. It is from one of the most 
articulate and argumentative members of this House who has 
departed for higher callings. Now the premier of a province, the 
former member for Humber-St. Barbe-Baie Verte said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The governing party of the day, regrettably for the country-a country in 
desperate need of leadership on the constitutional front, a country in desperate 
need of leadership on the economic  front-does not have the confidence of the 
people. Even as a member of the opposition, one who wants to replace the 
governing party, I say it is regrettable for Canada that at this time in our history 
only 14 per cent or 12 per cent or 8 per cent of Canadians have confidence in the 
government of the day.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What does this government do? Does it attempt to lay bare before the people 
of Canada its agenda? Does it attempt to persuade the people of Canada and the 
elected representatives of the people of Canada of the value of its agenda? Does 
it say it has a vision for Canada and such a profound belief in our vision for 
Canada that we are prepared to debate it and to defend it?</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No, it uses the tyranny of the majority. It uses the temporary trust given to this 
party as a consequence of an election two and a half or three years ago to 
bulldoze its legislative measures through the Parliament of Canada, to deny the 
people of Canada a chance to be heard, to deny the elected representatives of the 
people of Canada-not an opportunity to speak, but their obligation to speak, 
their responsibility to be heard in the proper examination of bills.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is merely a sample of the kinds of words and arguments a 
group of people while they were in opposition used to oppose a 
motion that now has been introduced in this Parliament. But the 
tables have turned. These same members are now part of the elite. 
They are part of the government. They have power.
<P>
	We can see how much power corrupts. The principles they 
enunciated and the strength of the convictions they had at that point 
have gone down the drain. I challenge each and every one of the 
hon. members who made such strong statements, when they stand 
up to vote, to acknowledge that they are voting against their own 
words and their own arguments.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government motion before us would allow a minister or member to 
reinstate, in the first 30 sitting days of this session, a bill to the 
legislative stage it had reached at the time of prorogation, as soon 
as he or she proposes the motion for first reading. In theory, this 
would enable the government to resuscitate all bills before the 
House at the time of prorogation. Private bills would be treated the 
same way.
<P>
	The amendment put forward by my colleague from 
Berthier-Montcalm is aimed at dividing the process in as many 
parts as there are bills, since a member could object to the 
reinstatement of any bill. The bill would then have to go back to 
square one, especially if it is challenged and opposed by the public. 
I am thinking in particular of the bill respecting employment 
insurance in Canada.
<P>
	I think that the government motion is irregular and 
undemocratic. When a government ends a session, it means that it 
has done its job or that it faces new challenges and wants to give its 
mandate a new direction. The Liberals, who are now in power, held 
a very 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="222"> 222 </A></B>
<P>
different  view in 1991: they felt that such a motion was irregular 
and undemocratic when the Tories tried to use it for the first time.
<P>
	I will quote a few statements made by the same people who are 
now sitting on the government side of this House. Let us look at 
some members' statements. I will start with the hon. member for 
LaSalle-Émard, who is now Minister of Finance, and I quote: 
``We find ourselves in the situation we are now in. The bill died on 
the Order Paper. In its supreme arrogance and lack of 
understanding, this government comes to us and says: `we would 
like to reinstate it'''. He called a bill similar to the one now before 
the House arrogant and incomprehensible.
<P>
	I continue with another quote. For his part, the hon. member for 
Cape Breton-East Richmond felt that the government was ``trying 
to reinstate legislation which has fallen dead as a result of the 
government's own ineptitude and subsequent action with regard to 
proroguing this Parliament''. That is exactly what this government 
is doing. It ended the last session by proroguing Parliament.
<P>
	One last quote, because I do not want to quote them all. I will 
conclude with the hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, 
who is still a member of Parliament and an influential government 
member. He said: ``The implications of ruling this motion in order 
would be such that I fear we could render-if a government wanted 
to, and I am not saying that it does-this House of Commons 
totally irrelevant and redundant.'' That is what members of this 
government had to say on the issue back in 1991, when they were in 
opposition.
<P>
	If this practice was described as unacceptable in 1991, what 
makes it acceptable today? If the Conservatives called certain 
Liberal opposition members stupid and self-righteous for doing 
this, how are the Liberals different from the Conservatives? 
Personally, I can see no difference as far as this bill is concerned.
<P>
	If the government decided to prorogue Parliament, it must have 
had good reasons for doing so: to renew its legislative agenda. 
What does it need this kind of procedure for then? The bills that 
could be reintroduced are not, by definition, new. If the 
government wants to reintroduce one or two of its old bills, it can 
do so through the normal process, which includes debating. But 
there is more. Some of these bills are unacceptable to the Bloc 
Quebecois as well as to the people of Quebec and Canada.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	A case in point is one the major pieces of legislation that died on 
the Order Paper, namely Bill C-111, the employment insurance bill. 
This bill is unacceptable to us. Clearly, and we all read the papers 
and watch the news on the tube, protests are on the rise. As far as I 
can  see, the people of Quebec and Canada are horrified at the 
current situation and at the decisions made by this government.
<P>
	Bill C-111 penalizes the unemployed, those who do not have a 
job, and it penalizes women, a group that I have the honour of 
representing in this House. Let me tell you how it penalizes 
women; you will see what I mean.
<P>
	An impact assessment carried out by the federal government 
shows that the hardest hit will be individuals earning less than 
$25,000. It is a well known fact that the low income earners of our 
society are women, women and young people also. Second, 
eligibility requirements would be tighter, eligibility being 
determined on the basis of the total number of hours worked over a 
given time instead of the number of weeks worked. In addition, it 
will be much more difficult for first-time claimants to qualify, 
which means women re-entering the labour force after having been 
away for a long time and young people will be hit hard.
<P>
	The program set out in Bill C-111 would greatly limit the 
number of people eligible for benefits. Moreover, while not being 
eligible for benefits, these people would still have to make 
contributions, thereby growing poorer. That is not employment 
insurance.
<P>
	It is also proposed that workers who hold precarious and 
seasonal jobs would receive less benefits. The fact is that close to 
70 per cent of part time workers are women. There are 1.5 million 
of them in Canada.
<P>
	The bill is also unacceptable because the spouse's income would 
be taken into account in determining whether a person is entitled to 
the supplement. In other words, a woman whose spouse earns an 
income would not be eligible for such a supplement. This creates 
two forms of discrimination: one against all women, and the other 
against those who have a spouse, as opposed to living alone.
<P>
	Finally, this bill seeks to reduce the maximum number of weeks 
of benefits. This measure would inevitably result in making people 
turn to welfare more quickly, and as such shifts the load onto 
another level of government. As we know, once a person ends up 
on welfare, it becomes very difficult for that person to find a job. In 
my own riding, it is a pity to see, on the one hand, the lack of 
available jobs and, on the other hand, the increasingly large number 
of welfare recipients.
<P>
	The bill would also maintain duplication and overlap, something 
which does not promote the development of an efficient 
employment policy, nor employability for workers and women. As 
we know, there is a consensus in Quebec on the need to implement 
an effective employment policy.
<P>
	Bill C-111 died on the Order Paper when Parliament prorogued, 
and it is a very good thing. The government should go back to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="223"> 223 </A></B>
<P>
drawing board and take  responsibility for its indecisiveness, 
because this is how I see this legislation.
<P>
	Since it was elected, this government has shown a remarkable 
lack of vision. It goes nowhere and everywhere at the same time. 
Last week's speech from the throne did nothing to improve the 
situation. Its main feature is that it is as vague as possible, so as to 
lend itself to any number of interpretations.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	There is a truism in Canada that says that when everyone agrees 
with a statement, it is because that statement is totally meaningless. 
To let the government's motion go through today would be 
tantamount to encouraging the confusion that, unfortunately, has 
prevailed since the beginning of this Parliament.
<P>
	The government must go back to the drawing board. It must try 
to come up with a new and consistent legislative agenda. After all, 
this is what prorogation is all about, is it not?
<P>
	The amendment proposed by my colleague seeks to give this 
House some democratic control over the issues that we debate. It 
provides for the speedy passing of those bills for which there is 
unanimity, while excluding such a possibility for the more 
controversial ones. This amendment is a true reflection of the 
democratic spirit that must govern the proceedings of this House. 
This is why I ask all members to support it.
<P>
	I also ask the Minister of Justice to reinstate Bill C-119, on 
genital mutilation. Even though this measure could be improved 
on, it deals with an issue for which a degree of consensus already 
exists in the House. Therefore, it would certainly be appropriate for 
the minister to take advantage of this opportunity provided by the 
hon. for Berthier-Montcalm.
<P>
	Unlike Bill C-111 on employment insurance, Bill C-119 does not 
perpetuate, nor does it increase, discrimination against women. On 
the contrary, it seeks to ensure that women can continue to hope 
that their bodies will not be subjected to harsh treatment. We are 
grateful to the minister, and we urge him to continue his work in 
that respect.
<P>
	I therefore ask the government to withdraw this bill and to come 
up with a new agenda that would take into account certain social 
and economic realities, as well as the realities of the labour market.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to confine my comments to three general 
areas.
<P>
	First, I would like to speak to the notion of why we are debating 
this in the first place, rather than the how. Quite a lot of the debate 
has dealt with the mechanics of how bills are introduced or 
reintroduced and not a whole  lot of thought has been given to why 
bills are introduced or reintroduced.
<P>
	Second, I would like to spend a couple of minutes talking about 
the difference between private members' business and government 
business and why, in my opinion, private members' business 
should be treated discretely and differently than government 
legislation.
<P>
	Third, I would like to touch on what really should be the power 
of the government, exactly how encompassing and how 
overpowering is the power of the government.
<P>
	I will begin with the third point. Those of us in the Chamber are 
acutely aware of how this place works, but many Canadians are 
not. After being elected I came here full of hope, inspiration and 
with the brightest of lights shining in my eyes. I thought as the 
member of Parliament representing the people of Edmonton 
Southwest, I was going to have a say in how the government ran the 
country. Well, was I surprised. I am sure many Liberal 
backbenchers found themselves in quite the same state of surprise. 
As a matter of fact I think some of the cabinet ministers may have 
been surprised. I am not suggesting that the government is alone. 
To my knowledge, all governments in Canada run on a premise 
which is: ``How do we go about getting re-elected?'' The first 
objective after being elected is how to get re-elected because power 
is everything. If one does not have power in politics one might as 
well be washing floors somewhere because not very much is 
accomplished. Yes, one can have some influence with luck. That is 
what private member's business is all about. It is all of the 
backbenchers on the government and on the opposition sides who 
are trying to make our country work not a lot better but a little bit 
better, just incrementally to trying to do something worthwhile.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	The path of private members' business through the House to 
become legislation is laborious and long. There are all kinds of 
checks and balances. Private members' bills very rarely become 
law. It is not part of the government agenda.
<P>
	When the throne speech was read there was not one single word 
about the government saying: ``We know we have 295 people in the 
House of Commons, most of whom are here for the right reasons: 
to make our country work better. Therefore, we are going to see 
what we can do to use private members' business to create 
legislation''.
<P>
	It has never been that way. If good private members' legislation 
is introduced very often it is co-opted by the government and we 
will see it rearing its head again as government legislation. Perhaps 
that is not all bad. It does not matter. If the legislation is passed it 
has to go through this process.
<P>
	However, private members' business is very different from 
government business. When government puts out  an agenda it is 
its agenda to get re-elected. If that means it is going to do whatever 
it has to do to meet the requirements of the perceived wants of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="224"> 224 </A></B>
<P>
body politic that is what it is going to do. That is why governments 
change direction from time to time. That is why there are 
traditionally in a country different opinions of different values 
represented by different political parties.
<P>
	In Canada we do not really have that differentiation. The Liberal 
Party changes its spots to meet whatever the expectations of the 
body politic are. It has worked successfully for most of our time as 
a country and it is likely that is the way it is going to be in the 
future. It does not really matter whether the left and the right or the 
yin and the yang is met because the country changes political 
parties or if the political party that is in power changes to meet the 
demands of the people. That happens. The government has the 
ability, the authority and the responsibility to bring forward 
whatever legislation it wants because it has a majority. It will 
introduce that legislation and that legislation will be passed. 
Nothing the opposition has to say will change that. Absolutely 
nothing will change the opinion of the government once it has its 
mind made up and it has a head of steam.
<P>
	Therefore, the only possible way that any backbencher from the 
government side or the opposition side is able to have meaningful 
input into the affairs of the nation is through private members' 
business. These bills may be very meaningful or they may be 
relatively small but they are evidence of the fact that people have 
been elected who represent their constituents.
<P>
	I have a vested interest in this debate because I have a private 
member's bill that made it through committee. If one is playing 
Snakes and Ladders, that is all the way up to just about the top of 
one set of ladders. The problem is that when one makes it over the 
top one is on the downhill slide again which is what happens with 
House business. When the the House prorogues and all of the 
business dies on the Order Paper that means all of the private 
members' business dies as well.
<P>
	When I first heard that the government was planning on 
changing legislation to bring back its own business as well as 
private members' business, my immediate reaction was that we 
should be careful what we say because whatever is said on this side 
of the House is likely going to come back to haunt us when we get 
to the other side of the House. We have stacks and stacks and stacks 
of words that Liberal members on the government side, most of 
them cabinet ministers, said when another government tried to do 
exactly the same thing, that the government business should die 
and it should be brought back again. If they want to do so they 
should bring it back starting from square one.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	My original reaction was that there is a fair amount of work to go 
through to get these things done. It goes  through the legislative 
branch of the House of Commons. There is a lot of work to get 
legislation here. If the government has a majority, it is going to 
come back sooner or later, why not bring it back sooner rather than 
later? They are the government. We will do whatever they suggest, 
so why not just do it?
<P>
	That brings us to the how and why of this debate and why we are 
having it in the first place. I think that most people on this side of 
the House see the reasonableness in the argument that if you are 
going to bring back legislation, why not bring it back in the way 
that is the most cost effective and the easiest, leaving aside the fact 
that the government very probably has absolutely nothing on its 
platter other than the legislation it had in the last session. We are 
waiting of course.
<P>
	The government woke from its great slumber and has decided 
that national unity is going to find its place on the front burners. 
The problem is that the government does not have any legislation 
so let us reintroduce the legislation that was on the books. Fine, but 
if this is the plan, would it not make sense for the House leaders to 
get together?
<P>
	I could spend all kinds of time going through the hypocrisy of 
the litany of members opposite. They stand on that side of the 
House and say black is black when on this side of the House we are 
saying white is white. I know that if I get too far down that road, 
sooner or later the same thing will happen to me. Imagine what the 
people who are watching this debate as it unfolds today are 
thinking.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Stop dreaming.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> To the member opposite who just said to stop 
dreaming, it is his nightmare and my dream. They never thought 
they would see themselves back over there on that side of the 
House either.
<P>
	I understand the way the government works. It is the right and 
the responsibility of the opposition to oppose and the government 
to propose and very much of what we do here sometimes goes by 
rote. We automatically oppose because that is what we are 
supposed to do. It is supposed to test and strengthen the legislation 
the government proposes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> What about accountability? They were here and 
they have to be held accountable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Members surrounding me are saying that 
perhaps the government should have been held accountable and 
should be accountable.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> No, they are Liberals. You cannot count on them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> They will be held accountable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="225"> 225 </A></B>
<P>
	I apologize to members opposite if they are trying to find some 
thread to what I am saying. I am trying to find it again as well.
<P>
	The power of the government in our House of Commons is 
absolute. I was quite surprised to learn just exactly how absolute 
that power is. I thought there would be an opportunity for not just 
members of Parliament in opposition and in the House but 
members of Parliament in committee to work in a much more 
collegial atmosphere in order to try to improve legislation. We are 
here for the benefit of the taxpaying Canadian citizen, for all of the 
citizens.
<P>
	Given the fact everything the government does is considered a 
question of confidence, I was somewhat disappointed to learn that 
the whole notion of being able to lose a vote or to lose an argument 
or to look at legislation as a possible win-win rather than a win-lose 
is missing. It is missing here; it is missing in committee.
<P>
	Members on this side feel frustrated as I am sure members 
opposite do when they are asked by constituents: ``Why do you not 
do something about this or that? Here is a situation that obviously 
does not make sense. Why can you not do something about it?'' 
When we say that we are not the government, people reply: ``You 
are the government, you are a member of Parliament. You are part 
of the government''. We say that yes we are, but we are not the 
people in charge and they ask: ``Well, who is in charge?'' The 
Liberals are in charge.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> We are not sure.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> The problem is this Parliament as with 
previous Parliaments is really run by the strategists in the parties 
and they are trying to figure out how to get re-elected.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> The PMO.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> The Prime Minister's Office. That is the way 
our system works so we have to accept it.
<P>
	During the last Parliament one of the promises the Liberals made 
to the people of Canada in order to get their support, to get their 
vote which gave them a majority in the House of Commons, was 
that they were going to change the way Parliament worked. They 
would make it more inclusive and would involve opposition parties 
in the day to day operation and would give opposition members as 
well as backbench Liberal members a say and a feeling they were 
participating in the affairs of the country. They promised to take the 
affairs of the government out of the backrooms and put the affairs 
of the country and government into the House of Commons and 
into the committee rooms.
<P>
	Those promises were genuinely made and genuinely felt because 
the Liberals had just come through eight years in the wilderness. 
They had spent eight years  atoning for the sins they committed 
while they were in government and in power.
<P>
	Is it not funny how times change. It did not take very long before 
the government decided it was going to be absolute in its authority 
and in its control over all of the happenings here in Parliament. For 
the first two years in government, the Liberals knew they were 
facing a referendum in Quebec. The referendum would be on the 
question of whether Quebec should stay or go.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> The neverendum.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> In those first two years the Liberal 
government bent over backward to ensure it did not do or say 
anything that could in any way be interpreted as offending anyone 
in Quebec, more particularly the Bloc. The Bloc, whether the 
Liberals like it or not, represents many voters in Quebec, just as the 
Reform Party represents many voters in other jurisdictions. They 
were totally afraid of doing or saying anything that could in any 
way be interpreted as offending the Bloc. This included the election 
of officers in committee.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	Think about it. There is a political party in the House of 
Commons, the Bloc, whose raison d'être is to take the province it 
represents out of Confederation. The Bloc's raison d'être is to 
break up the country. Its members have the perfect right to do so 
and they have the perfect right to be here. It is an expression of the 
strength of our democracy that they can be and that we can debate 
it. Nobody is shooting at anybody. That is a sign of strength in our 
democracy, not a sign of weakness. It is certainly my hope that at 
the end of the day Quebec will continue to be a province within 
Canada.
<P>
	I will say that we are having a much more honest and open 
debate about the future of Quebec and the future of Canada today 
than we have ever had in the House. It is only through addressing 
things honestly that we are ever going to resolve the problems we 
have as a country.
<P>
	While I do not concur and I did not appreciate it, I can 
understand the fact that the government in the first two years of its 
mandate bent over backward not to offend the Bloc, particularly in 
committee. However today is another day. The referendum was 
held in Quebec; the separatists lost. They lost on a question that 
was fuzzy. Here we are in the House of Commons today and have 
we started to take on the Bloc or the separatists head on? No we 
have not. The Liberals have gone right back to their attitude of not 
saying or doing anything that could in any way offend any member 
of the Bloc.
<P>
	It seems to me we should be putting our efforts into making sure 
there is an honest representation of what the rest of the country 
feels rather than bending over backward to appease the people who 
would break up the country. It is time that everyone put all of their 
cards on the table and dealt with the issues as they are. I suspect 
that might be something the Liberals might be thinking  of doing 
now because they know that appeasement has not worked. The 
problem is that the Prime Minister said this when he was out west. 
He mused about it, and now all of a sudden this is no longer part of 
the debate. What is part of the debate? Where is the debate? Why 
do we not have this on the table?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="226"> 226 </A></B>
<P>
	I will conclude by coming back to the fact that the government 
has the right and the responsibility to bring forward legislation it 
promised during the election campaign under which it was able to 
get the support of the people who voted for the Liberals. They 
should keep the promises they made and which they put in writing, 
like getting rid of the GST. Having made it, that is one of the 
promises they should keep. They have the right and the 
responsibility to bring that legislation forward.
<P>
	The only avenue for the rest of us to have meaningful input into 
what we do here in representing our constituents is through private 
members' business. Private members' business and government 
business should be treated discretely. They should not be lumped 
together in an omnibus bill or motion and we are forced to vote 
against private members' business that we support. It is a kind of 
blackmail.
<P>
	I will spend a couple of seconds talking about the how and the 
why. There is not very much that cannot be done here in the House 
of Commons with all parties if we treat each other with respect. If 
the government has an idea that it wishes to change the way the 
House of Commons works and how legislation is brought forward, 
then it would be appropriate for the government to come to the 
whips of the other parties represented in the House and say this is 
what it would like to do. Why can we not work together collegially, 
rather than having the government use the power of its majority, 
sort of a jackboot diplomacy, over the backbench MPs of its own 
side and of the opposition?
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in the House today to speak on some 
of the issues the Liberals have tried to convince us are right. Finally 
we see the light of day and they see the light of day.
<P>
	We are seeing that the electors in the last election were kind of 
double crossed. They are finding out they elected a party that does 
not keep promises, that is, a party that is not of action. It is a party 
of misguiding the constituents and the electors. That will change in 
the next election. It will be back in the opposition benches if at all.
<P>
	One thing that really surprises me is that members on the other 
side were so honest and probably sincere with their comments in 
the last legislature that they were not afraid to get up and call a 
spade a spade, and try to run on that basis during the election.
<P>
	As a farmer it has been a disappointment to me when I see they 
have made huge promises of how they would reorganize 
agriculture, how they would go to the farmers for some input in 
marketing, how they would allow these people to make the needed 
changes and yet did not fulfil those promises. I do not think they 
ever intend to.
<P>
	When I see what is happening in the agriculture field today, they 
are trying to more or less digress from what they said and put more 
government rules and regulations into the system to get more 
control over food processing and agriculture marketing.
<P>
	It was astounding to me when I read an article in the Ottawa <I>Sun</I> 
about a year ago when the former agriculture minister was a little 
upset. Mr. Whelan, a man I always respected very highly in 
agriculture during the early years when I farmed, said: ``We have 
gone from a corporate, capitalist, democratic system to a 
non-democratic, czarist, socialist system''.
<P>
	Hold it a minute, boys. That is something I thought I would 
never hear from an agriculture minister who served in the House, a 
Liberal saying we had gone from a democratic, corporate system to 
an undemocratic, czarist system. That is what eastern European 
countries have experienced and we know what the results have 
been there.
<P>
	Is this something the Liberal government will keep promoting in 
the House when I see, during the elections of the standing 
committees, we do not even have a ballot to elect a vice-chair? 
Somebody from the hierarchy dictates to the Liberals on the 
standing committees how to vote.
<P>
	What does that remind us of? That reminds us of a Hitler or a 
Stalin telling his people exactly how to vote. Is that not correct? 
Democracy to me means voting by ballot in seclusion where 
nobody knows how we vote. It is supposed to be free.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	Look at what has been done in the House over two 
reorganizations. Last fall we went through the same issues and the 
same principles. People were told how to vote. ``We would rather 
have a separatist party siting as official opposition than you real 
Reformers''.
<P>
	Real reform is what the House needs; not just the word reform, it 
needs real reform. That is the only way we can start addressing 
some of the problem in the House. It will not be done by 
backbenchers moving their heads in conjunction with the rope 
those on the front benches pull. It is like puppetry.
<P>
	That is not a democracy. That sounds more like a kids game, 
which is what I see happening a lot of times in the House. It seems 
we are not really trying to run the country, we are trying to control 
the minds of the people and their ideas by the way we influence one 
another, the same way cabinet influences backbenchers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="227"> 227 </A></B>
<P>
	Backbenchers for some reason are trying to influence the 
opposition into seeing they are correct. They are trying to make 
us believe we really do not know what the issues are. That is very 
sad. When we start manipulating minds and ideas we go back to 
what the former agriculture minister said, an undemocratic csarist 
system. That really scares me. In all the countries where there has 
been that type of democracy, a csarist system, people began 
starving not just for food but for ideas and freedom to vote.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> The Liberal benches are starving for that 
same freedom.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> They have been starving for 30 years now, ever 
since the Trudeau era. Mr. Trudeau ran not on ideas, not on 
philosophy but on charisma.
<P>
	That is what we are trying to determine today. Can another 
election be won on charisma or on ideas? Which are we going to go 
for? It looks to me as though charisma and ideas are dead, and so 
Reformers will have to take over because we have something that 
has not been seen before in the House: honesty, accountability and 
the freedom to do what one thinks is right, not what the hierarchy 
tells us.
<P>
	Democracy comes back to the idea that we vote on a ballot and 
nobody knows how we vote. Publicity can be put out saying: ``I 
was against the government and I did not vote for it'', but what was 
done behind closed doors? That is what I see in a lot of the 
backbenchers.
<P>
	We do not agree with the frontbenchers. We do not agree with 
what the government is doing. When it comes time to make a 
decision, it is not willing or able or capable. Why? Has anyone ever 
thought why? The Prime Minister says: ``If you do not do what I 
told you to do in the House, I will not sign your nomination papers 
in the next election''. Does that not sound like coercion or 
intimidation? I would hate to have a leader who would tell me he 
will not sign by nomination papers because I am going after the 
wheat board and the commodity exchange because they are the sole 
entity of what I am doing.
<P>
	Why are we even debating this? We should prorogue the House 
for the rest of the two years. We would probably do more good 
outside of the House than sitting here debating things we know are 
a fact and that we cannot change. That is the problem in the House.
<P>
	What can I say to a Liberal government that does not want to 
listen?. We can tell the Liberals what was told to the Conservatives 
in the last election. The Liberals were not elected, the 
Conservatives were defeated. In the next election history will 
change and we will defeat the Liberals because the people will vote 
for the Reform Party. We will throw the Liberals out of the House 
once and for all. We will have a reformed House that is honest and 
accountable and that will really do something for this country.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am rising 
of course in opposition to the government motion, the motion 
tabled by the Liberal government, a Liberal party which was 
outraged against a similar motion by the Conservative government 
in 1991.
<P>
	The Liberal government has tabled Motion No. 1 which allows a 
minister, during the first 30 sitting days, with a mere statement 
when proposing a motion for first reading, to restore that bill to the 
same stage in the legislative process as it was during the previous 
session. The bill needs only be in exactly the same form in every 
detail as it was in the previous session. That is the rule.
<P>
	The government has incorporated into the motion amendments 
concerning the period for examination of the Main Estimates for 
the fiscal year 1996-97. These amendments are related to 
prorogation of the House and are of a technical nature. There is no 
precedent for such a motion. The only precedent that exists dates 
back to 1991, when the Conservative government tabled a motion 
for debate on March 28 and moved closure on May 29.
<P>
	Prior to 1991, Parliamentary precedent required such a motion to 
have unanimous consent of the House, and this was democratic. If 
all parties were in favour of this motion, there would be no problem 
in proceeding case by case.
<P>
	It is interesting to review the speeches made in 1991 by various 
Liberal members, who were then in opposition. I will begin with 
the member for Cape Breton-East Richmond, today a government 
minister, who stated that they were opposed to the government 
motion because ``the motion attempts to place before the House 
five separate and distinct legislative matters which do not lend 
themselves to being considered together. The government should 
have given notice of five individual motions and this motion seeks 
to circumvent, indeed to subvert, the normal legislative process of 
this House''.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kingston and the Islands, who often rises 
to speak in this House, not so much since prorogation but during 
the past two years at least, said in 1991 ``They have to be reinstated 
in the usual course, but they ought to have been introduced and 
dealt with as new bills in this session''. That is the tradition, the 
rule, the custom. He added that ``any irregularity of any portion of 
a motion renders the whole motion irregular. For this House to 
adopt a bill without any debate, without any discussion at any stage 
is completely irregular and improper''.
<P>
	In 1991, the hon. member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell 
said ``The implications of ruling this motion in order would be such 
that I fear we could render-if a government wanted to-this 
House of Commons totally irrelevant and redundant''.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="228"> 228 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	The member for Cape Breton-East Richmond, whom I already 
quoted today added, on pages 657 and 659 of Hansard: ``The 
motion before us today in its substance is totally 
unacceptable-[and] is designed for the sole purpose of subverting 
the legislative rules of the Parliament of Canada''. What the hon. 
member said at the time was pretty significant and fairly serious. 
Today, however, they are doing an about face and are saying the 
total opposite. Really coherent.
<P>
	He went on to say: ``-trying to reinstate legislation which has 
fallen dead as a result of the government's own ineptitude and 
subsequent action with regard to proroguing this Parliament''. This 
is exactly what is happening today. The Liberal government 
decided on February 2 to prorogue the session. It knew where the 
bill was at. Why was it not debated in the previous session? Why 
did it not decide to prorogue at some other point?
<P>
	The member for LaSalle-Émard, now the Minister of Finance, 
said, again in 1991: ``We find ourselves in the situation we are now 
in. The bill died on the Order Paper. In its supreme arrogance and 
lack of understanding, this government comes to us and says: `we 
would like to reinstate it'''.
<P>
	Next, I would like to quote the member for Halifax, who said in 
1991: ``The government should be ashamed. We are wondering 
today why there was a prorogation-the House leader is presenting 
us this pernicious motion-and I emphasize the word-in order to 
speed up the passage of five bills, in total disregard for the 
traditions of the House and the British parliamentary procedure and 
in disregard for the Canadian people''.
<P>
	The former fisheries minister, influential member of the Liberal 
Party, the member for Humber-St. Barbe-Baie Verte, now the 
Premier of Newfoundland said, again in 1991: ``Parliament is being 
systematically destroyed by the government-in hundreds of years 
of evolution of parliamentary government, such a motion has never 
been put before any parliament-because [such a motion] is a form 
of executive dictatorship-Parliament belongs to the 
people-[government] uses the tyranny of the majority-to deny 
the elected representatives-[their responsibility] to be heard in the 
proper examination of bills''.
<P>
	I come back now to the member for Kingston and the Islands, 
who said: ``The government wants to impose a new definition of 
democracy on Canadians, one of the greatest affronts to the House 
in years. It is immoral for the government to introduce this motion. 
The government is short-circuiting the legislative process to 
consider five bills. This behaviour is reprehensible. The 
government knows it. It has not produced a single tittle of evidence 
to support this gross breach of our practice, and I suggest that it is 
totally inappropriate''.
<P>
	Next, I would like to quote the member for Winnipeg St. James, 
who said: ``No government would want to resurrect a bill that was
<P>
deemed dead some time in the past-if the government in effect 
says to heck with this House, to heck with the opposition, to heck 
with precedent, if that is the view of the government, how much 
more down the road can it go?''
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	Finally, to quote the member for Saint-Léonard, the riding 
neighbouring mine, and now the Minister of Labour: ``If the 
government really intended to examine these bills, it should have 
done it before the prorogation of the House and that should have 
been negotiated.''
<P>
	In my opinion, this motion is anti-democratic. It runs counter to 
the rules, customs and traditions of British parliamentary 
procedure. I see no reason whatsoever for the government's 
decision to introduce this motion when two opposition parties are 
against it.
<P>
	This motion will affect several bills, bill C-111 in particular. 
This bill on unemployment insurance I described in a previous 
speech as a bill on poverty insurance or destitution insurance, since 
its ultimate objective is to reduce benefits to the unemployed and to 
attack the jobless rather than joblessness, contrary to the Liberal 
red book's promise of ``jobs, jobs, jobs''.
<P>
	Instead of creating those jobs, it has tabled Bill C-111 which is 
also anti-union and anti-worker and has been criticized across 
Canada. We have witnessed demonstrations in New Brunswick, in 
Quebec, in Ontario, and last week in British Columbia. The 
unemployed from the Outaouais region came here to demonstrate 
against the bill. I personally took part in a regional demonstration 
against the bill held in Montreal by three labour federations. 
Everyone felt that the bill would be considered to have died on the 
Order Paper. But now with this motion we find ourselves faced 
with the bill at the same stage, as if there had been no prorogation. 
This is unacceptable to all those who have worked against this bill, 
which is anti-worker and anti-union.
<P>
	For all of the foregoing reasons, I am vigorously opposed to this 
government motion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on this 
government motion there are two issues that absolutely must be 
dealt with and addressed. First is the lack of integrity the 
government has demonstrated on this issue. My colleagues have 
said very clearly that when government members were in 
opposition they made a commitment not to do what they are doing 
today. That is issue number one, the lack of integrity the 
government has shown on this issue.
<P>
	The second point I would like to make is with regard to the 
appropriateness of this motion relative to private  members' 
business. Can private members' business be tied into this 
resolution as part of government business? The point I would like 
to 
<P>

<B><A NAME="229"> 229 </A></B>
<P>
make is that private members' business is just that; it belongs to the 
private members.
<P>
	Everything we do in this House, or in any legislative assembly 
should be to give the private member the opportunity to express his 
or her opinion on a special item, or an item relative to constituents, 
or an item relative to a special interest. In a free way, a private 
member should be able to express his or her thoughts without 
government control; without the government saying when 
something should be done or when it cannot be done; or the 
government taking away the agenda or giving the agenda to the 
private member.
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	That is exactly what is happening. The government has 
intervened in private members' business. Those are the two topics I 
will cover in my remarks in the few remaining moments.
<P>
	First I will deal with the integrity of the government. As some of 
my colleagues have done, I will quote some of the remarks made 
by hon. members of the government when they were opposition 
members in 1991.
<P>
	I quote the remarks of the current premier of Newfoundland, the 
former member for Humber-St. Barbe-Baie Verte, Mr. Brian 
Tobin, when he stood in this House. He spoke very clearly on a 
motion quite similar to the one we have here today. He said: ``We 
see the decision by the government today to put this motion before 
the House as a confirmation of the destruction, and that is what it 
is, of our parliamentary system''. No truer words have been spoken 
from this side of the House. If they are good on this side, they 
should be just as good on the other side of the House.
<P>
	Mr. Tobin went on to say that by such a motion as we are looking 
at here today, the parliamentary system is being systematically 
destroyed by government. He went on to say that Canadians 
watching this debate are wondering what the fuss is all about. It is 
about destroying the parliamentary system.
<P>
	We can look at what other participants in that debate had to say 
about the matter. I refer now to a current minister, Mr. David 
Dingwall, the member for Cape Breton-East Richmond-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I know we are just getting back in shape, but I 
would ask you please not to mention hon. members who are 
currently in the House by name.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, the current Minister of 
Health made these remarks while he was a member of the loyal 
official opposition. He said very clearly to the House at that time in 
words well spoken, as they usually are by our Minister of Health: 
``Third and finally, I contend that the motion is in principle 
unacceptable in that it seeks to circumvent, indeed to  subvert, the 
normal legislative process of this House. In the past, this kind of 
thing has been done only by unanimous consent. Now the 
government is seeking to establish an omnibus precedent by 
attempting to force this procedure on the House. This is an 
offensive and dangerous departure from the practices of all 
parliamentary bodies and it is, I believe in accordance with 
Beauchesne's citation 123(1) and Standing Order 1, unprecedented 
violation of the checks and balances written into the rules 
governing the normal legislative process''. That says it.
<P>
	I could go on to quote other members of the House-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being 2 p.m. we will now proceed to Statements 
by Members.

	<B>Mrs. Jean Payne (St. John's West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
future of the aquaculture industry in Newfoundland is very 
promising. Announcements made by the federal aquaculture 
development strategy is evidence of this.
<P>
	Also, the aquaculture steering committee's strategic plan for the 
development of Newfoundland and Labrador is further evidence. 
Additionally, a $100 million economic renewal program has 
committed $20 million to the industry to foster development.
<P>
	Aquaculture in Newfoundland is entering a growth period where 
production is expected to rise dramatically over the next two to 
three years and well into the future. With this new growth, new jobs 
will be created in my riding of St. John's West as well as many 
other rural and coastal communities where limited opportunities

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let 
me quote criminal defence lawyer Russ Chamberlain of Richmond, 
British Columbia: ``Victim impact statements are just venting the 
spleen and don't serve justice and should be outlawed, banned 
completely''. He also said that victims want to blame everyone else 
for their ``pathetic'' lives.
<P>
	These kinds of lawyers and Liberal politicians-what is the 
difference?
<P>
	Let me identify just a few of the unconditional victims' rights 
that will exist in a Canada governed by the Reform Party. Victims 
must have the right to choose between giving oral or written impact 
statements. Victims must be informed in a timely fashion of the 
details of the crown's intention to offer a plea bargain before it is 
presented to the defence, and victims must also know why charges 
were not laid if that is the decision of the crown or the police.
<P>
	Criminals have far too many rights under the Liberal 
government. We must devote ourselves to victims' rights as we 
should have done in the first place.

	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
March 4, 1986, 10 years ago, then Minister of Justice John Crosbie 
promised his government would put sexual orientation into the 
Canadian human rights code. Ten years later we still have not seen 
a federal government willing to prohibit discrimination against 
gays and lesbians in the Canadian human rights code.
<P>
	The current Liberal justice minister said initially that it was 
pretty hard to do in pre-election time. Then he said we had to fight 
separatism and that is why he could not put it in the human rights 
code. The Prime Minister said he would like to see it in the human 
rights code but we were just running out of time.
<P>
	We are not running out of time. The Liberal government has run 
out of guts, and I challenge the Minister of Justice for once to 
prohibit sexual discrimination in the Canadian human rights code. 
Seven provinces and one territory have done it. Surely the Liberal 
government can do it as well.

because the old UI was desperately in need of reform.
<P>
	However, certain measures in the new plan, including the 
intensity rule and the divisor method, must be changed, as the new 
HRD minister has agreed. Without that change the very people who 
are most in need of our assistance will be hurt. People such as 
seasonal workers, substitute teachers and others who live in areas 
of high unemployment would rather be working full time, year 
round but cannot through no fault of their own.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="UNEMPLOYMENTINSURANCEREFORM">UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE REFORM</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in Quebec and in the maritime provinces, a growing 
number of demonstrations are being held to oppose the reform of 
the unemployment insurance system, whose net result will be to 
exclude thousands of workers from the scheme. In the middle of an 
employment crisis, the government is cutting benefits to the 
unemployed and, in order to reduce its annual deficit, is creaming 
off the surplus from the UI fund although it has not contributed to it 
since 1990.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. Could the minister, whose role should be to protect 
the unemployment insurance system, tell us whether, on the eve of 
the budget, he has received guarantees from his colleague, the 
Minister of Finance, that he will stop using the fund surplus to 
artificially lower his deficit?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, as regards the proposed 
unemployment insurance program, we are all aware of the concerns 
that have arisen pretty well throughout the country and we have 
said clearly that, as soon as the parliamentary committee resumes 
its deliberations, we will raise, properly I hope, the question of 
calculating benefits for the unemployed and the intensity rule.
<P>
	As to the surplus, I am sure that the hon. Leader of the 
Opposition is aware that, last year and two years ago, we were in a 
deficit situation with unemployment insurance.
<P>
	Frankly, I would reassure the Leader of the Opposition that the 
surplus has nothing to do with the changes we are going to make to 
the unemployment insurance program. This program must reflect 
reality for both people looking for work and the labour market.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, is the Minister of Human Resources Development daring 
to claim that the $5 billion surplus already being counted on by the 
Minister of Finance does not come from two main sources: the cut 
in unemployment benefits and the exclusion of hundreds of 
thousands of unemployed from the plan?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, at the moment, the program has 
not undergone the changes proposed in Bill C-111. The present 
surplus is the result of a fairly dramatic change in the country's 
employment rate.
<P>
	No doubt the Leader of the Opposition is aware that, in recent 
years, the job situation has improved in the country, though it 
remains painful for those unemployed.

<HR>

<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	I would point out to the hon. Leader of the Opposition that, over 
the past three years, there has, each year, been a fairly small 
reduction in the contributions made by employees and employers 
to the UI program.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I must point out to my hon. colleague that the Minister of 
Finance, in last year's budget, counted on annual surpluses of $5 
billion in the coming years. Now they tell me that they will cut 
payments to the unemployed and the plan's benefits without taking 
into account the changes to the plan. Now I really do not 
understand.
<P>
	My question is as follows: Does the Minister realize that, by 
cutting benefits to the unemployed in order to create a huge surplus 
in the unemployment insurance fund, he will continue to unload the 
federal government's deficit onto the provinces, since it is the 
provinces that will have to look after the many unemployed who 
are no longer eligible for benefits under the plan with the 
government's proposed changes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we are very aware of the 
possibility that the changes proposed in Bill C-111 could indeed 
result in a number of people being denied the benefits they have 
enjoyed for many years.
<P>
	This is why my predecessor before Christmas and I, since I have 
been asked to take on the department, confirm that, with the 
resumption of the deliberations of the parliamentary committee-I 
am certain of it, because all members of the House have heard their 
constituents' claims and concerns-the members of the committee 
representing all parties in the House will sit down at the table later 
this week to begin the work that is part and parcel of the legislative 
process and which consists in making the necessary changes to Bill 
C-111, thus reflecting some of the concerns raised by my hon. 
colleague.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	The proposed unemployment insurance reform, that the Minister 
of Human Resources Development seems stubbornly determined to 
bring back instead of letting it die on the Order Paper as he should, 
contains many unacceptable measures, which we will apparently 
discuss, including the reduction of the maximum yearly insurable 
earnings from $42,400 to $39,000, when what is required is an 
increase.
<P>
	My question is the following: Given that employers would no 
longer have to contribute beyond this $39,000 ceiling, does the 
minister not realize that this will act as a very strong incentive for 
all businesses, and those so-called capital-intensive operations that 
pay high wages  in particular, to make as many employees as 
possible work overtime?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this legislation contains several 
elements that seek to do the exact opposite of what my hon. friend 
has just described. In fact, I think there is ample evidence across 
the country that many people believe that the UI program is being 
abused and that there is not enough incentive for people to go out 
and look for a job.
<P>
	We have taken the approach of having every hour worked count 
and including in the program right from the start anyone who has 
worked at least one hour. I do not quite understand the question 
about limiting the contributions made by high income earners. 
Naturally, by reducing the maximum payable, we hope to protect 
low income earners. It is always interesting to see how systems 
evolve, because today's newspapers report that Quebec plans to 
increase the insurance premiums paid by those with the highest 
salaries.
<P>
	It is obvious that various people have many solutions or options 
in mind, and I can assure my hon. friend that, when committee 
work resumes, we will gladly listen to all your suggestions and, if 
any of them seem to meet the needs of the workers-after all, they 
are the ones we should be trying to help-we will pay serious 
attention to what you are saying.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the 
minister realizes that Quebec's proposal, and not his own, may be 
the way to go, perhaps he should do what everyone is asking him to 
do, that is to say, withdraw the bill and review its basis, as it does 
not make any sense under the present circumstances.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that, with this lower ceiling acting as 
an incentive for businesses to increase overtime, he is running 
counter to the growing consensus about the need to reduce 
overtime, put in place conditions conducive to job creation and 
make room for young people? This bill runs counter to this, as we 
will keep pointing out, and the minister will have to account for 
this.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of the fundamental 
elements in all of these proposals is that everyone in Canada 
recognizes the need to make sure that everybody takes up every 
hour of work that is available to them no matter where they live in 
the country.
<P>
	I want to assure my hon. colleague that whatever we do when 
modifying the present elements of the law, under no circumstances 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="235"> 235 </A></B>
<P>
are we going to consider any  approach that will make it easier for 
people to take advantage of the system.
<P>
	I do not think that anyone in the country, other than the hon. 
member, who has listened to what we have had to say, would 
believe that somehow it is going to be easier to take advantage of 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
	What we are saying, which has offended a great number of 
people in the industries and in the businesses to which I think the 
hon. member was referring, is that they are concerned about first 
hour takeup. They are concerned about the fact that the legislation 
is going to take care of everybody in the country immediately when 
they go to work, whether or not they are working part time. The 
current legislation allows people to perform work for less than 15 
hours a week which leads to the abuses to which the hon. member 
just referred.
<P>
	Do not think it will be any easier. You might be a little surprised 
that it will be substantially tougher than it is now.

week the Prime Minister said that his job was done. He was 
satisfied with a $17 billion deficit projection and that now it was 
time to create a few jobs.
<P>
	What the Prime Minister does not seem to grasp is the fact that 
deficit elimination is job creation. Thirty-three cents of every 
taxpayer dollar goes to pay just the interest on the federal debt. 
That is 33 cents that cannot go to health care, post-secondary 
education and pensions.
<P>
	Does the government really feel that its job is done when 33 
cents out of every taxpayer dollar ends up in the hands of money

	I would like to read something from the <I>Globe and Mail</I> in case 
the hon. member missed it. It states: ``It is worth noting that Mr. 
Martin has yet to report a deficit bigger than the one he predicted. 
This week he will probably say the deficit was less than that, which 
works out to 4 per cent of GDP or less than any deficit since 
1976-77''. That is not a bad record. It is a darn good record.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We are back into the second week now and I 
would ask members please to refrain from using names instead of 
ridings or titles in the House.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when 
the minister talks about rolling targets, how long are we going to 
roll along until this thing gets balanced?
<P>
	If somebody puts the high jump level at one foot I would say 
anyone could trip over that kind of low and ridiculous target. The 
Liberal government says that it wants to create jobs, especially for 
young Canadians. However, in the upcoming budget with its $17 
billion projection, more jobs will be created on Wall Street than on 
any university campus: $250 million for young people versus 
$50,000 million for interest payments alone to international money 
lenders.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	Why will the government not offer young Canadians real hope 
and a chance at a real long term job by simply balancing the 
budget; no rocking, no rolling, just balance it?
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> You don't know what rock 
and roll is, so let's go back a few years.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party is 
not willing to listen to answers, they just want to ask questions.
<P>
	The real answer to the question is that we will. If the hon. 
member listened to the throne speech, youth unemployment was a 
key part of it and she will have to listen to the results that come up 
later on.
<P>
	We have committed to a balanced budget. We have committed to 
two-year rolling targets. We have not only done that, we have met 
our targets which is something new in this country.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, youth 
unemployment is key but there is no sense lending money to kids 
and then charging it back later, that much plus interest. It is 
scandalous.
<P>
	The government has tried to make a $17 billion deficit sound 
like a victory and a $12,000 a year internship amount sound like the 
key to fighting and winning against a 16 per cent youth 
unemployment rate.
<P>
	The reality is that Canadian young people are less likely to find a 
job now than when the government took office in 1993. What is 
more, any young person lucky enough to even find a full time job 
will be paying more taxes than they can ever expect to receive in 
benefits from health care, social assistance and public pensions.
<P>
	Why is the government condemning Canadian youth to a life of 
unstable employment, higher taxes and reduced benefits by its 
stubborn refusal to balance the books now?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would love to to see 
their budget this year. We did not get a chance to.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="236"> 236 </A></B>
<P>
	Last year they put out their ideas and those ideas would have 
condemned Canadians to lower pensions. It would have 
condemned Canadians to less social benefits. It would have 
condemned Canada's youth to even higher levels of 
unemployment. We are doing something. The Reform Party is just 
talking.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as the hon. member knows, today the Minister for 
International Trade is in Washington meeting with his counterpart, 
raising the serious objections that we have expressed since we 
knew the bill was being considered by Congress.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is at a meeting of the Caribbean leaders in 
Grenada where he is working actively to try to gain their support 
for a statement. We are undertaking a number of initiatives with 
other countries to mount international pressure against the 
implementation of this bill.
<P>
	Within the bill itself-it has not been passed-there is room for 
discretion. The U.S. president can waive those parts of the bill that 
apply specifically to countries outside their boundaries.
<P>
	At this time we are really taking the leadership internationally in 
mounting pressure against the bill to convince the U.S. 
administration that the implementation of all articles of the bill 
would not be in its best interest internationally.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, considering that the American bill would obviously be in 
violation of international trade laws, will the minister commit to 
defending Canadians before the appropriate courts in this 
connection, should the U.S. Congress and the President pass this 
bill?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there are a couple of hypotheticals in that question: one, if 
the bill is passed and two, if the president does not implement the 
bill.
<P>
	Our position is that the most effective protection for Canadians 
is to insist that those parts of the bill that apply to Canadians and 
other countries not be implemented. That would save having to get 
into major legal wrangles or countermeasures.
<P>
<B>(1435 )</B>
<P>
	However, it is quite clear from what the Prime Minister and 
other spokespersons of the government have said that we will 
protect the interests of Canadians. We will look at all measures that 
are necessary to have that protection, but the first and most 
effective way of doing it is to see if we can convince the Americans 
not to go ahead with implementing those parts of the bill that apply 
extraterritorially.

it's not an issue would be incorrect. People remember us taking a 
very firm position''.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of National Revenue. Exactly 
what would be today's firm position on the GST? Would it be the 
pre-election position that her caucus came up with, which was to 
axe, abolish or kill the GST? Or would it be today's position, to 
replace and harmonize the GST into what amounts to a new super 
tax on consumer spending?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, our position on the 
GST remains completely unchanged. We said in the red book that 
we would replace it with a tax that generates equivalent revenue, 
that was fairer to consumers and to small business, that minimizes 
disruption to small business and promotes federal-provincial 
co-operation and harmonization. That was our position in the red 
book. That is our position now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I really 
wish the Prime Minister would embrace the merit principle when 
he picks his cabinet.
<P>
	I remind the revenue minister that two years ago she said of the 
GST: ``As Liberals we were elected to change the tax, abolish the 
tax, scrap it''. That is what the revenue minister said two years ago, 
six months after the election.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the minister of Defence. The events surrounding the 
mock terrorist attack on the Quebec Citadel, in 1992, brought back 
into the limelight the rather suspicious circumstances in which 
private Jonathan Brunet found a tragic death, in February 1994, at 
the Quebec Citadel. His mother does not believe he committed 
suicide and is asking for an independent investigation.
<P>
	Can the minister explain why the Canadian forces gave the 
soldier's mother three different accounts of her son's death, and 
why several reports, documents, and personal effects have not yet 
been turned over to the family following the department's 
investigation in this matter?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, normally I 
would not want to discuss matters of such a personal nature in the 
House of Commons. This deals with the very unfortunate death of a 
former member of the armed forces.
<P>
	There were a number of investigations. We particularly wanted 
to assure that the mother of the deceased was comfortable in 
knowing that the armed forces had dealt with the matter in the most 
appropriate of ways.
<P>
	There has been some concern about the personal effects of that 
individual. Those are being addressed. That is all I can really say at 
this time.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
contrary to the minister's answer, who wants to be reassuring and 
claims that an in-depth investigation was conducted, it has been 
confirmed by several sources that there was no such investigation.
<P>
	Unfortunately, these recent revelations bring back to mind the 
wave of suicides which was revealed last year and was, to say the 
least, highly suspicious. Is the minister going to act at long last and 
order an investigation independent from his department to get to 
the bottom of this matter once and for all?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if I felt there 
was need for an independent inquiry into such a matter I would 
have no hesitation, as the hon. member knows. We have launched 
an independent inquiry into the deployment of the Canadian Armed 
Forces to Somalia in 1993 so that is not really at issue.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	I do take umbrage with some of the comments made by the hon. 
member with respect to a suicide wave. We have dealt with this in 
the House of Commons. These unfortunate deaths plague society at 
large, not just in Canada but worldwide and run about half the rate 
of Canadian society as a whole. We have made documents public 
which show there is no undue tendency of members of the armed 
forces to take their lives out of step with the rest of Canadian 
society.

<P>

the sympathies extended by the member for Red Deer.
<P>
	I should report to the House that the Prime Minister has already 
written to the Prime Minister of Israel on behalf of the Canadian 
people to express his deep sympathy and his outrage at the actions 
that have taken place. Unfortunately there was another bombing 
attack this morning, the third in a row. In many cases the injured 
and dead are children which makes the situation even more serious.
<P>
	I will be making a statement in the House immediately following

support the peace process in Israel and to counteract the very 
malicious and violent acts of terrorism that seem to be so rampant 
and which are so destructive to all.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it seems to me

not think civilians are ever a legitimate target for such attacks.
<P>

<B><A NAME="238"> 238 </A></B>
<P>
	We all think of Mr. Gerry Adams and his refusal to condemn 
the IRA after the bombings.
<P>
	Will the minister take it upon himself to contact the ambassadors 
in Canada for all of these countries? If even one of them refuses to 
condemn these actions we could then call for an investigation and 
make it public in Canada and at least take some action. These 
activities demand some sort of action.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is no doubt at all that the increasing incidents of 
terrorism do demand the most intense and active international 
action we can possibly muster.
<P>
	I remind the House that just a few months ago my colleague the 
Solicitor General hosted a meeting of the P-8 countries in Ottawa 
to deal with counterterrorism. It was a major conference which 
looked at a number of aspects.
<P>
	It would certainly be our intention to promote some of those 
measures at the G-7 meeting which will take place this spring. It is 
something we can take some leadership on in trying to get the 
international community to act. As well, there are actions which we 
can take within our own country. As I said, I will outline some of 
those actions in a statement I propose to make later in the House.
<P>
	I certainly welcome the points of view expressed by the member 
for Red Deer on behalf of his party. We all want to look at ways in 
which we can try to stamp out terrorism or restrain or limit it so 
that it does not become something that will destroy what is good in 
the country. It is a case of the bad driving out the good. We will

<P>
	In the speech from the throne, the government clearly states that 
it intends to create a Canadian Securities Commission.
<P>
	Is the Minister of Finance aware that the securities business is a 
field of exclusive provincial jurisdiction in which he is not allowed

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International

Securities Commission was mentioned in the speech from the 
throne. Its genesis was from the suggestion of the provinces. We 
were quite clear that it is a provincial jurisdiction but several 
provinces have been asking us about it. We have put forth an 
optional proposal to the provinces and they will be allowed to opt 
in or opt out.  Anyone who has ever worked in the securities 
business in Canada realizes that the proliferation of agencies one 
has to go through is a dreadful thing. A national Canadian 
securities commission would be appropriate and would be of great 
benefit to Canadian business and the Canadian people.
<P>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the secretary of state. It is incredible. He said 
that there is a proliferation of agencies and yet, the federal 
government is going to create new ones, top-loading the securities 
business. Mr. Daniel Johnson, who was Quebec Premier in 1994, 
wrote a letter to the minister or to the secretary of state, stating that 
Quebec and the then labour minister were adamantly clinging to 
the securities area. So, why this plan to create securities 
commissions?
<P>
	How can the government say in the speech from the throne that it 
is going to withdraw from areas of provincial jurisdiction and, at 
the same time, that it is going to interfere in these areas, claiming 
there is a certain proliferation? Such an argument does not make 
any sense.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International

forgets that the provinces that do not want to follow this can opt 
out. Is that a compulsory system? Certainly not. Many provinces 
have wanted to opt in to a Canadian securities commission. It will 
replace the provincial securities commissions for those provinces 
that do want to opt in. It is an excellent measure and one that all 
Canadians should support.

province of New Brunswick and their constituents to streamline 
that program to make sure that it is available to all Canadians in the

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Health.
<P>
	The Minister of Health has recently added a page to this 
government's book of horrors when he stated that the health care 
system would be severely threatened once Quebec has achieved 
full sovereignty.
<P>
	Since his department is a perfect example of duplication through 
federal interference in an area under provincial jurisdiction, will 
the minister not agree that it would be preferable to make cuts 
within his own department, which has 8,000 employees and spends 
more than $1 million a year, rather than in health services to the 
public?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am sure the hon. member is aware that the people in the province 
of Quebec overwhelmingly support the five principles of the 
Canada Health Act. In point of fact, in excess of 63 per cent of the 
people of the province of Quebec support medicare in Canada.
<P>
	I want to say to the hon. member that it is vitally important for 
all Canadians regardless of where they live, regardless of their 
socioeconomic status, that they have access to good quality health 
care. Many royal commissions which have been put in place by 
provincial governments across the country have said that the 
question is not one of funding, the question is one of management. 
There is no duplication between the various levels of government, 
and if there were we would move forward to correct it.

	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when the health 
minister was in opposition there was a huge uproar every time cuts 
to medicare took place. Now that he is in a position to put his 
money where his mouth is, will the minister stop this slow bleeding 
of health care? Do your job.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I presume that statement was meant for me, and I 
will.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we on this side of the House, Canadians in the province of Alberta 
and those people over there have been waiting patiently to ascertain 
the policy position of the Reform Party on medicare.
<P>
	On two separate occasions the leader of the third party as well as 
its critic have made conflicting views and statements with regard to 
medicare. It is high time the Reform Party came clean and told 
Canadians where it stands.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the regional minister from Winnipeg or for 
whomever else might answer for the proposed sale of Union 
Station in Winnipeg.
<P>
	The minister will be aware of allegations made in the local 
media that a proposed sale of Union Station was not only not 
tendered but that Liberal insiders were given privileged 
information with respect to the building.
<P>
	This deal fell through. However, can we have assurances that if 
this building continues to be for sale, although I do not think it 
should be, it will be for sale in an openly transparent tendered way 
so that everybody is given the same information? Will the 
government be asking the auditor general to investigate what 
happened the first time the place was put up for sale?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jon Gerrard (Secretary of State (Science, Research and 
Development)(Western Economic Diversification), Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member is making a whole series of largely 
unfounded accusations.
<P>
	The government has set up a number of instruments for 
economic development and we are using these in the most 
independent and impartial way possible to make sure Canadians 
have jobs and that our young people are better off. The hon.

	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the last eight days we have witnessed with horror and 
heartache repeated acts of terrorism in Israel.
<P>
	Today in the heart of downtown Tel Aviv a terrorist yet again 
carried out an attack against innocent individuals. Worse still, 
many of the casualties appear to be children.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	All Canadians vigorously condemn these acts of terrorism. We 
are with the people of Israel at this tragic time. The Prime Minister 
has written to Prime Minister Peres. I have also written to the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Barak, to express our support.
<P>
	Today, the Prime Minister of Canada asked the other heads of 
state meeting in Grenada to condemn the attacks in Israel and they 
agreed to.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Later this afternoon I will be meeting with members of the Israel 
committee to discuss their concerns. I will also be writing directly 
to PLO chairman Yasser Arafat to urge him to take all steps within 
his power to prevent further acts of terrorism.
<P>
	I acknowledge very clearly, as we all must, that Canada must 
also do its own part. I will be speaking to my colleague, the 
solicitor general, and to other ministers to review what steps can be 
taken by Canada to ensure terrorists find no home here.
<P>
	The issue of terrorist funding was raised in question period 
regarding the extent of the problem in Canada. We do not know 
how far, how modest or how great, but whatever the amount we 
know they can be important to groups themselves. Therefore we 
are committed to doing all we can to deprive terrorists of this 
funding.
<P>
	We will also be discussing with our counterparts in the P-8 group 
of nations what further actions we can take to root out terrorism.
<P>
	There is no doubt the terrorists who carried out these attacks had 
in mind one basic target, the Middle East peace process. It is tragic 
in today's world that the bad drives out the good and the extremists 
can force what was a positive, constructive development to turn 
this way.
<P>
	We should remind ourselves today of all that has been 
accomplished in the peace process. Israel is at peace with its 
neighbours Egypt and Jordan. It has with PLO chairman Yasser 
Arafat found a partner. Now these partners must work together to 
defeat those who seek to destroy all the peace process has 
accomplished so far.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We think that the peace process must continue. It is the best 
response to terrorism.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	Mr. Peres has carried on Yitzhak Rabin's peace efforts with 
courage and determination.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have learned that there are people who believe they can 
achieve acts of change by the sword. I think all of us in the House 
are of the opinion that it really is through words, discussion and 
dialogue that peace is brought about. The events that so deeply 
penetrate our hearts, just as the shrapnel and weapons penetrated 
bodies, we have to continue to ask why such senseless acts. We are 
a generation that has witnessed far too many such acts of violence 
and terrorism and have seen so many cut down.
<P>
	I am reminded of the words of Robert Kennedy when his brother 
was assassinated: ``What has violence ever accomplished, what has 
it ever created? No martyr's cause has ever been stilled by an 
assassin's bullet. No wrongs have ever been righted by riots and 
civil disorders. A sniper or a terrorist is only a coward, not a hero. 
An uncontrollable mob is only the voice of madness, not the voice 
of the people''.
<P>
	We are reminded this day of how fragile our societies are and 
how vulnerable to extremists, fanatics and true believers each of us 
really is. Even in our own country we receive some overtones of 
this.
<P>
	We offer our great hope for the continuation of that peace 
process. We offer to the people of Israel and to all the Middle East a 
great hope that this terrorism can be brought to an end and that we 
can all work together to bring lasting peace and stability to this 
very tortured and troubled region.
<P>
	It is my understanding that my parliamentary secretary has 
discussed matters with members of the opposition and they would 
be prepared to entertain a unanimous motion condemning the acts 
in Israel and offering our support for the peace process. We will 
circulate those for consideration during the period of motions. We 
ask the House to join us in expressing our deep concern.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on behalf of the official opposition, I wish to condemn 
this new terrorist attack against the Israeli people, which threatens 
the Middle East peace process.
<P>
	This bombing, which killed or wounded dozens of innocent 
victims, is the fourth one in Israel in less than 10 days.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="243"> 243 </A></B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois wishes to express its profound sympathy 
to the families of the victims, to the people of Israel, and to all 
Jewish people around the world, including the Jewish community 
in Quebec.
<P>
	This gratuitous violence threatens not only the long and difficult 
road to peace but also the negotiations on the eventual status of the 
Palestinian territories. We want to stress the need to resist 
provocation. The peace talks must continue. The fight against 
violence must prevail over the fight against peace.
<P>
	We cannot let Yitzhak Rabin's tragic death take with it the hope 
of a lasting peace between Israel and her Arab neighbours. The best 
response to radicalism is to continue and strengthen the peace 
process.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois hopes that these tragic and violent events 
will not hamper the pursuit of Messrs. Arafat and Peres' diplomatic 
efforts to establish a peace plan in the region. The process initiated 
must prevail over the radical currents that flout democratic values 
and promote violence.
<P>
	We were therefore happy to hear the PLO chairman state, and I 
quote: ``Today's crime reinforces our determination to pursue our 
policy of fighting terrorism here and abroad. We must work with 
Israel to destroy their structure and eradicate terrorism''.
<P>
	Chairman Arafat's Sunday announcement banning the military 
wings of the Muslim fundamentalist movements in the West Bank 
and Gaza also demonstrates this commitment.
<P>
	The Canadian government must offer its full co-operation in 
thwarting the efforts of those who seek to destroy the peace 
process. It can count on the official opposition's support in this 
regard.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I seek the unanimous consent of the House to 
observe a minute of silence in memory of the innocent victims of 
the fundamentalist movement Hamas.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what can I say 
that would give meaning to the senseless bombing of civilians that 
has taken place in Israel for the third time in the last week? Friends 
and families of victims have once again had their hearts broken by 
despicable terrorists.
<P>
	These cowardly acts are inexcusable and, while the vast majority 
of people throughout the world will condemn them, I would like to 
address those people and those countries who do not. To all those 
who make excuses for the bombers or who sit on the sidelines and 
give silent approval, you should look in the mirror. Do you like 
what you see? Do you not realize that you are the moral 
accomplices in the murder of women and children? We must hold 
these people accountable.
<P>
	The time has come for the international community to take 
strong, unequivocal steps to crush terrorism worldwide and 
severely punish those individuals and countries that finance 
terrorism.
<P>
	We all know that bombs, guns and supplies are not cheap. The 
money has to come from somewhere. Often it comes from abroad. 
If the world community can work together to cut off this financial 
backing, then hopefully many terrorist organizations will wither.
<P>
	Therefore I urgently request that the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
take a leadership role in punishing those individuals and countries 
that support terrorism worldwide. The Reform Party will support 
him in this measure and so will all Canadians. There is no time to 
waste. The victims of terrorism are demanding action now, and it is 
through our decisive action that we will create a deserving 
memorial in their honour.
<P>
	Once again, I would like to send my deepest condolences to the 
people of Israel and the Canadian Jewish community. I assure them 
that we will work with them to find justice for the victims and 
punish the terrorists who never should be allowed to hide and get 
away with their crimes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of the federal NDP caucus, I would like to express our 
outrage at this series of events, the most recent one being a few 
hours ago. I would like to express our condolences to the people of 
Israel and say that we share with them that sense of powerlessness 
that sometimes comes over us in the face of this kind of terrorism, 
in the face of radical evil, in the face of extremism.
<P>
	At the same time as we share that sense of powerlessness, we 
want also to share with them a determination to see the peace 
process through and to make sure that the terrorists do not succeed 
in derailing it.
<P>
	We say to the Israeli people, do not be divided by this event. Do 
not turn on each other. Let us not hear any cries of Perez next or the 
kinds of things that we have heard from certain elements in Israeli 
society. In spite of the pain, in spite of the terror, we want to see an 
Israeli people united and determined to see the peace process 
through.
<P>
	I think there is a special place in hell reserved for people who use 
children as hostages and who make children the objects of terrorist 
attacks. I do not care whether it is a Muslim hell, a Christian hell or 
a Jewish hell. It is a special place in hell that is reserved for people 
who do this.
<P>
	We ought to reflect perhaps on the way in which we are all part 
of the same mentality when we consider the way in which we held 
each other's civilian populations, including children, hostage to the 
nuclear deterrent for 40 years. It is part of the modern age and it is 
something  we all have to shake. When we see it in its raw, brutal, 
obvious form we condemn it. Let us condemn it wherever we find 
it.

	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.)</B> moved for 
leave to introduce Bill C-218, an act to amend the Criminal Code 
and the Young Offenders Act (capital punishment).
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, the purpose of the bill is to impose the 
death penalty on adults convicted of first degree murder. Canadians 
are demanding fundamental changes to our criminal justice system, 
and almost 70 per cent have called for the reinstatement of capital 
punishment.
<P>
	The bill provides additional safeguards against miscarriages of 
justice by allowing questions of both fact and law to be considered 
throughout the appeals process. Evidence for whether capital 
punishment is a deterrent for other murderers is not conclusive, but 
at least criminals guilty of premeditated first degree murder will 
not be back on the streets to kill again.

<P>
	Too many Canadians have died at the hands of violent criminals 
who show no remorse for the victims of their crimes. These people 
will never be rehabilitated, no matter how long they stay in prison.
<P>
	The bill also addresses the growing public concern over light 
sentences for violent young offenders. It calls for a range of stiffer 
minimum penalties for youth convicted of first degree murder.
<P>
	I recommend that the government allow a free vote on the bill 
and encourage all members to seek actively the views of their 
constituents on this important issue.

C-219, an act to amend the Canada Labour Code (severance pay).
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, the purpose of the bill is to remove from 
the Canada Labour Code the provision that denies severance pay to 
employees who at the time they are terminated from employment 
are entitled to a pension under certain plans or legislation.
<P>
	Currently, no matter how inadequate a pension may be, it

	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP)</B> moved for leave 
to introduce Bill C-220, an act respecting the Energy Price 
Commission.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to introduce the bill 
respecting the energy price commission. The bill responds to the 
concerns and complaints of millions of Canadians about unfair gas 
pricing, unjustifiable price increases for gasoline and government 
tax hikes on gasoline.
<P>
	The bill establishes an energy price commission to regulate 
wholesale and retail prices of gasoline. The purpose of price 
regulation is to avoid unreasonable increases that affect the cost of 
living, agricultural production costs and depressed business 
activity.
<P>
	The bill will facilitate reasonable consistency in prices from 
province to province, allowing for production and distribution 
costs. The regulation further minimizes the  risk of collusion in 
pricing and prevents dominant suppliers from setting unreasonable 
prices.
<P>
	The bill also links the issue of price control to competition. Any 
investigation of an alleged offence under the Competition Act that 
is related to gasoline pricing is remitted by the Competition 
Tribunal to the commission for investigation and a report to the 
tribunal before it makes a determination or order on the matter.
<P>
	Every one penny increase in gasoline takes about $375 million 
out of the economy. This commission will make sure the money is 
either justified or not.

	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.)</B> moved for 
leave to introduce Bill C-221, an act to amend the Competition Act 
(illegal trade practices).
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, the bill would amend the Competition Act 
by creating an offence for manufacturers and distributors of motor 
vehicles and farm equipment to engage in certain marketing 
practices with their dealers. In most cases franchise agreements 
provide that a dealer shall not carry any other line or ``dual'' 
without the written permission of the manufacturer. In practice that 
permission is rarely forthcoming.
<P>
	The consequences of this restrictive arrangement are that the 
dealer's investment in one line of motor vehicles or farm 
equipment may substantially exceed the investment actually 
required to efficiently supply the sales and servicing demands 
faced by a particular dealer in his or her market.
<P>
	By allowing the dealer to offer one or more new lines of new 
motor vehicles or farm equipment I believe the bill would produce 
two positive results. First, the investment of the dealer would be 
utilized more efficiently and effectively and, second, the public in 
the dealer's market would be better served.
<P>
	I urge all members to support the bill for the benefit of Canada's 
business community.

	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I move that the first report of the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs, presented to the House on Friday, 
March 1, be concurred in.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="247"> 247 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I understand the motion before us is a debatable motion and 
therefore I would like to offer the following in debate.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	If adopted by the House, the motion would establish the 
membership of the standing joint committee of the House. The 
Reform Party does not oppose the membership of any of the 
committees, but we do oppose the way the committees have been 
run over the first session of the 35th Parliament.
<P>
	We have every reason to believe that there is nothing likely to 
change in this regard during the second session. The main question 
we are asking here is why this love-in between the Liberal benches 
and the Bloc Quebecois. We cannot answer that question. That is 
why we have taken the route to have a debate on the matter to 
expose some of the problems we see.
<P>
	This situation is particular galling when it comes to the public 
accounts committee of the House which can be chaired and is 
chaired by a member of the opposition. In spite of our efforts we 
have found that the Liberal benches have deliberately contrived to 
have that chair taken by the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	We have nothing against the individual members of the Bloc 
Quebecois. They are competent, professional people. What we 
have against it is that they are separatists. They want to divorce 
Quebec from Canada and we as federalists say this is wrong. It is 
wrong for the government benches to be saying yes, let they have 
all the vice-chairs, particularly the chair of the public accounts 
committee.
<P>
	This is being done, led by the chief government whip, in spite of 
some of the quotes from the Prime Minister. In January 1994 he 
said: ``I know very well that if members of the official opposition 
keep talking about separation and constitutional problems they are 
not living up to why they are here''.
<P>
	More recently he also said: ``My blood is boiling when I see 
those separatists in front of me because I fought them all my life''. 
The <I>Globe and Mail</I> quotes the Prime Minister as admitting that he 
would rather have the Reform Party leader as his official opponent. 
It was one of the few times that the Prime Minister has been so 
publicly clear about his displeasure over the powerful separatist 
role in Parliament. The words of the Prime Minister obviously do 
not square with the actions of his party, led by the chief government 
whip.
<P>
	During the first session we attempted to bring these concerns to 
the attention of the House through various points of order. Each 
time our concerns fell on deaf ears. The Speaker's refusal to 
entertain our points of order has left us in a catch 22.
<P>
	When we raised questions about the election of committee chairs 
and vice-chairs at the committee, we were told the Liberals were 
simply backing the Bloc because it was tradition. We have then 
been summarily dismissed by the Liberal majority. This leaves us 
with no choice but to take the issue up as points of order in the 
House. Having done that, they have all been summarily dismissed 
to date. We have been on this merry-go-round for two years and our 
members are frustrated. One can tell by the look on their faces that 
they have had it.
<P>
	It is important for me to clarify once again that this frustration is 
not personal but is professional. Reform members are frustrated 
not for themselves but for the vast majority of Canadians who 
support a united country yet cannot have their views adequately 
represented in the committee hierarchy because of the persistent, 
unexplainable love-in between the government and the Bloc 
Quebecois.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. The member raised 
an issue which is completely contradictory to the ruling of the 
Chair with regard to the position of the official opposition. Given 
the ruling by the Chair as to who constitutes the official opposition, 
the rules of procedure and the House rules clearly state the 
provisions with regard to chairs and vice-chairs of committees. The 
member clearly is arguing a matter which is challenging the ruling 
of the Chair and contrary to the standing orders.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> With great respect to the member for 
Mississauga South, I think the matter he is raising is one of debate. 
However, when the member for Nanaimo-Cowichan uses words 
like ``summarily dismissed'' it seems they are a veiled reflection 
that the Chair did not rule carefully on the matter. I ask him to 
avoid terms in further remarks that suggest the Chair was not doing 
its job.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> The summary dismissal I was talking of was on 
the part of the government benches and not of the Chair. 
Incidentally it may be clear that I simply do not accept the last 
argument put forward either.
<P>
	From day one of the 35th Parliament the Liberals have displayed 
a total lack of regard for the legitimate election process by blindly 
backing the Bloc candidates while under the watchful eye of the 
government whip. In election after election of committees we have 
seen Liberals dismiss qualified Reform candidates. This trend has 
continued into the second session.
<P>
	For example, on February 29th the procedure and House affairs 
committee held its organizational meeting for the purpose of 
electing a chair and two vice-chairs. At that meeting my Reform 
colleagues and I again attempted to secure the opposition 
vice-chair position. During the election process last week not one 
Liberal member attempted to determine which candidate was  best 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="248"> 248 </A></B>
<P>
qualified for the post. There were no questions about the candidates 
background or character, only the same tired arguments we have 
heard for more than two years.
<P>
	The main argument put forward by the Liberal whip in defence 
of his unabashed support of separatists over federalists is one of 
tradition. According to the chief government whip it is 
parliamentary tradition for the opposition vice-chair to be filled by 
a member from the official opposition. To hear the government 
whip argue this point one would think the practice of electing an 
opposition vice-chair goes back hundreds of years. This is simply 
not the case.
<P>
	Standing Order 106(2) governs the election process and in part 
states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Each standing or special committee shall elect a Chairman and two 
Vice-Chairmen, of whom two shall be Members of the government party and the 
third a Member in opposition to the government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	No reference to official opposition; simply opposition. This 
standing order came into effect only in May of 1991, not five years 
ago. Later that month the committees were established and held 
elections for chairs and vice-chairs. During those elections a 
member of the NDP, the third party in the House at that time, was 
elected the vice-chair of the Standing Committee on Human Rights 
and the Status of Disabled Persons. A reading from the minutes of 
that meeting of May 29, 1991 will help illustrate my contention 
that this position is not reserved for the official opposition. 
Following the election of Dr. Bruce Halliday to the chair he stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I believe the new standing orders call for two Vice-Chairmen, one of whom shall 
be from an opposition party.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Notice the chair referred to an opposition party, not the official 
opposition.
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	I will quote from the same chair moments later: ``We need a 
second vice-chairman who should be somebody from one of the 
opposition parties''. The minutes of that meeting then indicate the 
member for Beaches-Woodbine, a representative from the third 
party, the NDP, was elected opposition vice-chair.
<P>
	The minutes of this meeting clearly counter Liberal arguments. 
They demonstrate a precedent and show this practice has been in 
effect only since May of 1991. Further research shows that since 
this standing order was adopted in the third and last session of the 
34th Parliament there was only one round of elections. That is 
because the committee chair and vice-chair appointments from the 
initial election of May 1991 were continued until the dissolution of 
that Parliament through a motion adopted by the House on 
September 21, 1992.
<P>
	<I>The Concise Oxford Dictionary</I> defines tradition as a custom, 
opinion or belief handed down to posterity; an established practice 
or custom. Given the evidence I have  just laid out it is clear the 
Liberal claim of tradition is faulty at best. The only tradition is the 
one the Liberals are creating and have been creating these last 
couple of years, and it is a dangerous one.
<P>
	I also believe it is important for unity minded Canadians to know 
which Liberals are supporting separatists over federalists. We will 
continue to keep count. At the meeting of procedure and House 
affairs last week, which I referred to earlier in my speech, the 
following government members rejected a federalist in favour of a 
separatists: the members for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, 
Mississauga West, Kingston and the Islands, Ottawa Centre, 
Ottawa-Vanier, Ottawa West and Edmonton North. So listen in, 
Canadian public, to your members who are supporting a separatist 
vice-chair.
<P>
	I will have to throw in another little bit to illustrate some of the 
intrigue that goes on in committees when they are electing chairs. 
Committees are masters of their own fate. For example, their 
members can agree to a secret ballot. We have proposed secret 
ballots in these committees to give the Liberal backbenchers who 
might be inclined to support a Reform vice-chair a chance to vote 
without incurring the wrath of their whip or their leader.
<P>
	On every occasion we have proposed a secret ballot it has been 
rejected and the whip has put his firm hand on the Liberals saying 
no secret ballot.
<P>
	What we are talking about is democracy, our ability as an 
opposition party to function properly within the committees of the 
House. We are being frustrated in them and we resent it.
<P>
	I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion before the House proposed by the government be amended 
by deleting all the words after the words ``March 1, 1996'' and substituting the 
following: ``be not now concurred in, but that it be recommended to the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The motion is receivable.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I simply want to make a few comments. Let us go back to 
the beginning of this Parliament, after the election held on October 
25, 1993, because some discussions took place between the parties 
at that time.
<P>
	I want to tell you about two statements that were made back 
then. One was to the effect that the Bloc Quebecois was coming to 
Ottawa to impede the proceedings of Parliament. However, as we 
have seen for a little over two years now, those who are guilty of 
filibustering are not Bloc members, but Reformers.
<P>
	Since the very beginning, we have complied, rather closely I 
would say, with British parliamentary tradition.  To be sure, our 
views differ from those of the Liberal Party. However, we agree to 
play by the rules. This is obvious to me, and I should point out that 
Quebec's National Assembly, which is the oldest parliament in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="249"> 249 </A></B>
<P>
America, agreed to follow the same rules as the British Parliament 
as early as 1791.
<P>
	I also want to say that I participated in the negotiations that took 
place between the parties to bring some changes in this House. We 
tried to settle the issues of office allocation, and Heaven knows 
how long that took, House agenda, speaking order in the House, as 
well as committee membership. At that time, the Bloc Quebecois 
showed that it was very open-minded and said: ``Yes, we are 
prepared to give up a number of vice-chair positions''. The Reform 
Party told us: ``We want to provide the chairperson for the public 
accounts committee and the vice-chairpersons for finance, foreign 
affairs, national defence, agriculture and trade. Period. We will not 
accept anything else''. How about some apple turnover with that?
<P>
	This proposal made no sense. And with its ``we take that or 
nothing'' position, the Reform Party ended up with nothing, 
because it did not know how to negotiate.
<P>
	Now, we are told about a love affair between the Liberals and the 
Bloc Quebecois. Those who see a love story between the members 
opposite and the Bloc Quebecois certainly do not follow current 
politics very closely. Sure, we respect each other, but our views and 
our goals are certainly different. The only such attempt took place 
between the hon. member for Sherbrooke and the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robichaud: </B>It was not consummated.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> It was 
never consummated, no. Absolutely not. It was wishful thinking, 
but they never got together. Out of sight, out of mind. The House 
was not sitting when this came up.
<P>
	Looking at the way things have developed since then, we see that 
the Liberals in committee have just about all voted the same way, 
with a few exceptions when they could not agree on who to elect as 
chair or vice-chair.
<P>
	The Bloc has always voted the same way and in each of the 
committees Reform members have all taken the same position and 
voted the same way. All the same. I would imagine then, if they are 
able of their own free will to think things through themselves and 
reach the same conclusions, that others are allowed to do so as 
well.
<P>
	What is in question here and what is more problematical, I might 
say even with the potential to become dangerous if taken to the 
extreme, is that, regardless of personal qualities, regardless of the 
fact that they have been elected like everyone else, what is being 
said is that positions will be awarded according to what people 
think. From the outset, it will be decided that access to positions 
away will be denied certain people.  That is the situation. They will 
say: ``The people in the Bloc are competent and hard working, but 
they are separatists''. Such a situation would be dangerous.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	I suppose there is the risk that we would win all of Parliament 
over to our point of view. We do not expect that much, but we do 
think we have a point of view that deserves to be heard and that it is 
worthwhile for Canadians to hear, for the first time.
<P>
	But now they have gone so far as to say that the ideas we espouse 
would keep us from those positions and, when it comes down to it, 
the whole concept of democracy is being jeopardized. What is the 
solution? They tell us there will be a secret vote. That is the only 
solution I have heard for changing the procedures, but it is 
tantamount to preventing the public from knowing how its elected 
representatives have voted. We, however, are not afraid to rise in 
this House to express our ideas, to be judged on our ideas, because 
there will be an election some day-there is one about every four or 
five years. We would then be told that we can sit in the House of 
Commons but, when the time comes to vote, we would not dare 
make a public statement. That is the Reform Party's position.
<P>
	I think that this would be dangerous for democracy. There is an 
assumption that members who are not from the Reform Party 
cannot vote as they see fit, that we should hold secret ballots 
instead of publicly expressing our ideas. I will close by saying that 
this may be why an editorial in the Montreal daily <I>The 
Gazette</I>-which, as you know, is a staunchly sovereignist 
newspaper-expressed the hope that the Bloc Quebecois would 
win the election in Lac-Saint-Jean. Although it was an easy wish to 
make, <I>The Gazette</I> nonetheless felt that, at least, they would then 
be sure that the Reform Party would not be the official opposition.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to speak to and support the motion to amend the government 
motion concerning the list of chairs and vice-chairs of all the 
standing committees from the Standing Committee on Procedure 
and House Affairs.
<P>
	The points I want to make are all about common sense and 
fairness. The House leader of the Bloc Quebecois seemed to be 
saying that we were picking on the Bloc party. That is not the case 
at all. At least I am not speaking on this issue for the purpose of 
picking on the Bloc.
<P>
	I want to point out that what is important in parliamentary 
tradition in a democracy is fairness, common sense and looking at 
the total number of seats in the House. As we all know, the 
government of the day is formed by the party that has the greatest 
number of seats. In this Parliament that is the Liberal Party. Thus, 
we have Mr. Chrétien as Prime Minister.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="250"> 250 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It must be monotonous to hear, but we 
are not allowed to refer to colleagues by their first or last names 
in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I stand corrected. I would have been 
okay if we had had only four weeks off. That extra three weeks 
totally threw me and I have forgotten some of the rules.
<P>
	The party that forms the official opposition is the one that has the 
second highest number of seats. When we came here in October 
1993 that was the Bloc Quebecois and they formed the official 
opposition. We were the third party. Any party that has less than 12 
members is not recognized as an official party in the House of 
Commons. Those are the rules and they are good rules. I stand by 
them and I would defend them.
<P>
	Now there has been a drop in numbers. Representation in the 
House has changed since prorogation and at this time both 
opposition parties, the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party, have 
the same number of members. We both have 52 members. I 
personally do not disagree with the ruling of the Speaker as to 
which party should be the official opposition.
<P>
	Now I proceed to standing committees. There is a difference 
between how the rules operate here in the House and how they 
operate in standing committees. As the House leader of the Bloc 
tried to point out, we negotiated in October 1993. The Bloc 
negotiated from a position where they had two more members than 
the Reform Party. Now we have the same number of members. 
When it comes to standing committees, each committee elects its 
own chair. It makes sense to me that the chair of each of those 
committees should be a member from the government side with the 
exception of public accounts because that would be construed as a 
conflict of interest. The chairman of the public accounts committee 
should be a member of an opposition party.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	It does not say a member of the official opposition should be 
vice-chairs anywhere in Beauchesne. The standing orders do not 
refer to official opposition, it just says opposition. I wish members 
opposite in the government would look that up. I challenge them to 
quote me differently and quote me the standing order that says 
official opposition.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It does not say official.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> It has now been acknowledged that it does not say 
official, it says opposition party. To apply some common sense, if 
Reform has 52 members and the Bloc Quebecois has 52 members, 
somewhere along the line out of 27 standing committees just one of 
the vice-chairs should be a member of the Reform Party. That does 
not happen. Not one committee has a Reform Party member as a 
vice-chair. The Reform Party and the Bloc Quebecois have the 
same number of seats. We have never had that.
<P>
	We may have negotiated away one or two vice-chairs in October 
1993, and I do acknowledge that did happen, but the Bloc members 
then had 54 members and we only had 52 members.
<P>
	The House has been prorogued, now it is back and all new 
members and new chairs have been assigned. Some parliamentary 
secretaries were fired, chairmen of standing committees were fired 
so new ones were needed. That has been done and all new members 
were assigned.
<P>
	In those standing committees now vice-chairs are supposed to be 
picked. There is a procedure to follow. The same procedure was 
followed as the first time around. They did not have any kind of 
duly conducted election that allowed members of both opposition 
parties because when it gets to committee we are not talking now 
about official opposition and third party, we are talking about 
opposition parties. It just so happened that all the vice-chairs went 
to the Bloc Quebecois again.
<P>
	In defence of this the chief government whip, and boy does he 
ever change his mind when he is in government from when he was 
in opposition. Witness his defence of Motion No. M-1 that is also 
being debating today and how he flip-flopped on that issue. Now all 
of a sudden it is democratic to do that.
<P>
	He is arguing that what the government is doing in naming all of 
the Bloc members as vice-chairs is democratic and is based on 
tradition. Tradition says opposition. That does not mean official 
opposition. If tradition says whoever is official opposition gets all 
the vice-chairs, fine, but we are now tied.
<P>
	The Bloc has been named by the Speaker as the official 
opposition but in standing committees we have 52 members, they 
have 52 members. Why would the chief government whip not 
concede or consent, in the spirit of fairness, in the application of 
common sense, that maybe one or two Reform Party members be 
vice-chairs. There is precedence for this.
<P>
	I do not know if my colleague, the current whip, has mentioned 
this but a member of the third party was a vice-chair in a standing 
committee of human rights and status of disabled persons on May 
29, 1991. There are lots of examples where members other than the 
official opposition were vice-chairs. The chief government whip's 
assertion that they are just following tradition is faulty at best.
<P>
	In the history of this country it has never been so crucial that we 
have some people representing the interests of all of Canada. If the 
Reform Party cannot be the official opposition, that is fine because 
of numbers and incumbency, but at least in standing committees 
perhaps Reformers could have a couple of vice-chairs. That would 
make sure the interests of all Canadians are being looked after, not 
just those interests that the separatist party of Quebec now 
represents. They would be only dealing with those issues, only 
trying to get those  witnesses, only asking those questions which 
help to tear this country apart, not to hold it together. They are only 
interested

in showing that it is in their best interests to break away from 
Canada and to break up this country. Because it is not traditional to 
have this kind of a quirk in parliamentary history, we have a party 
sent to Ottawa from a region that is unhappy with the intrusion into 
their lives by the federal government, and justly so. In fact they are 
so unhappy that they sent a lot of them here to send this 
government a message. The message is: Do something about our 
problem. Do something to protect our interests.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	That is no different from the Reform Party where the majority, 
with the exception of one lone Reformer from Ontario, my 
colleague who sits beside me, are all from the west. We were sent 
here to send a strong message to the federal government that it has 
intruded into our lives and that we want changes.
<P>
	This is all about change. It is also all about change in the 
standing committees. It is about time that some of the government 
members grew up and applied a little common sense and fairness to 
this whole business. They cannot continue to believe in one thing 
and say another. I do not believe they can be in opposition and say 
that they believe in one thing-for instance, about reintroducing 
government bills after prorogation and the hue and cry that they set 
out here when they were in opposition-and then go over to the 
other side and say it is okay. At which point were they right? Are 
they right now and wrong when they were in opposition or are they 
wrong now and right when they were in opposition?
<P>
	I state unequivocally that it is wrong when two opposition 
parties are tied, each having 52 members, that one party gets all the 
vice-chairs and the other party gets none. There has to be 
something wrong with that. Somebody coming from the outside 
who knows very little about it would say: ``What are the rules? 
How come the Reform Party has none?''
<P>
	The Prime Minister has even said that he would like to see more 
balance in the House of Commons. As a matter of fact when I first 
looked into what the Liberal members said when they were in 
opposition they also held the view, Mr. Speaker, that in the position 
that you are in right now that the Speaker should come from the 
government, duly elected, unlike what the House leader for the 
Bloc said. It should be by secret ballot, which is very democratic. 
The Deputy Speaker should be from the government side and 
perhaps an assistant deputy speaker should be from the government 
side. However they also maintain, and there is a paper to this effect 
that some cabinet ministers and Liberal members have written and 
believe in, that the other two speakers, deputy or assistant deputy 
speakers should be, guess what, from the opposition parties. That is 
what they said in opposition.
<P>
	It is now two and a half years later in the second session of the 
35th Parliament. The House has prorogued and come back. The
<P>
Liberals had their second opportunity, their second chance to get it 
right. This is their second chance to keep the promises they made, 
the systemic changes they put in their red book. It is in the red book 
where they talk about giving more recognition to the opposition 
parties in Parliament. Do you know why they said that, Mr. 
Speaker? Because they sat on this side of the House for eight years. 
They were frustrated by closure. They were frustrated by time 
allocation. They were frustrated by how they were assigned 
vice-chairs and how they did things. They were frustrated by who 
got to sit in that chair to monitor proceedings and to make sure the 
rules were followed.
<P>
	They made all these promises to the Canadian public and they 
have not kept one. On democratic reform they have not kept one of 
their promises.
<P>
	Perhaps I should write the Prime Minister a letter on the red 
book and ask him where he stands on these promises. Where does 
the Prime Minister stand on these promises he made of changes in 
the House and in the deputy chairs?
<P>
	What I feel as a member of Parliament is very unfortunate. There 
is no way that we can hold the government accountable for the 
promises it made until the next election. It seems to me that the 
Prime Minister is proud of that. It seems to me that the Prime 
Minister is happy that he has all this time to not keep those 
promises, to renege on those promises.
<P>
	He will not get another chance now to fulfil the promise he made 
on how we should be operating the Speakers in the chair and how 
two of them should be from the opposition parties. He will not get 
another chance to keep those promises that he would protect the 
civil service, yet 45,000 of them were let go.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	When people make promises, when they say that this is what 
they plan to do, will do, given the opportunity to do it should they 
not do it? Should people not follow through on their promises?
<P>
	Here we are with two opposition parties equal in the number of 
seats yet in standing committees, each and every one of them 
belongs to one party. Had the ruling been the other way, had the 
Speaker ruled that the Reform Party was now the official 
opposition, does anyone think for a minute that we would have 
asked for every vice-chair in the committees? The Bloc would have 
had some vice-chairs.
<P>
	The irony is that here we have an important standing committee 
like public accounts where there are audits and reviews of the 
government expenditures. The auditor general submits a lot of 
work to that committee. I must admit right now that the member 
who represents the Bloc was the chair of that standing committee 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="252"> 252 </A></B>
<P>
and he did  a fine job. He was an excellent chair of that committee. 
I am not picking on him as an individual. I want to make that very 
clear.
<P>
	Having said that, I do not believe that in the public accounts 
committee the chair should go to a member of a party that has the 
equal number of seats as another party but which only represents a 
small regional, specific interest which is to take a part of the 
country out of this democracy, out of the union. I object to that. 
That is one area where the Reform could have been chair. Once 
again, the chair of that committee has done an excellent job. He 
was a good chair. That is not my point. I want to make that 
perfectly clear, because I do not want to hurt anybody's feelings.
<P>
	The feelings I want to hurt are the Prime Minister's and those of 
the chief government whip because of the promises they made. 
They are the ones who are breaking their promises. They are the 
ones who are operating this House in a dictatorial fashion. Even the 
backbenchers cannot say anything. Government backbenchers 
cannot criticize the government. We see what happens to those 
members. They are left out; they are shoved out; they are put out.
<P>
	That is not the way democracy should work. How can it ever hurt 
to have a few people who want to have a flat tax, to have a few 
people who want to get rid of the GST, to have a few people who 
want to protect the civil service? How can it possibly hurt when the 
government has the majority of members? It cannot.
<P>
	To summarize, the tradition of the committee election process 
needs review. This whole issue should be reviewed by the 
procedure and House affairs committee. We have had filibusters in 
the past two years. In the year that I was the whip for this party I 
had to attend some fiascos in some of the standing committees.
<P>
	Autocracy and heavy handedness was used by some of the 
chairmen from the government side, probably through ignorance 
because they did not know the rules. Nevertheless, they treated all 
members with disdain, just appointing and going through the 
election process without a concern. I was there. The chief 
government whip walked into the meeting and would say that this 
person would be the vice-chair: Bloc, vice-chair; Bloc, vice-chair; 
Bloc, vice-chair; Bloc, vice-chair; 23 times.
<P>
	That is not a process whereby members of the standing 
committee are empowered to elect their chair and vice-chair. We 
know who should be chair; that is not a problem. But we could have 
had a couple of elections for vice-chair. We never had a serious one 
to put a member of the Reform Party there and we are now tied. It 
did not happen. It was all a sham and a scam.
<P>
	No matter what the chief government whip tries to say to defend 
this, he knows what he told his people. The chairman of each and 
every standing committee, with the exception of public accounts, 
knows what he was told to  do. What happened is a distortion of the 
democratic process. It is unfair now because we do have 52 
members, the same as the Bloc.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	Yes, the Bloc is the official opposition and it is welcome to the 
job, but in standing committees we should have a few vice-chairs. 
That is all we felt we should have. The signal and the sign we 
wanted to see from the government was that perhaps it was willing 
to accept the fact that some standing committees could use a 
vice-chair from the Reform Party. However, Liberal members were 
told what to do from on high and on high said no. They were not 
allowed to make vice-chairs of any of the Reform Party members 
who wanted and who sought to attain that position.
<P>
	As it turns out, this government is behaving in the worst fashion. 
It is even worse than the previous government of the eight years 
before the Liberals took power. With all the things this government 
when it was in opposition said about the Conservative government 
and what it attacked the Conservative government about, prime 
ministerial travel, time allocation, closure, the Tory GST, nothing 
has changed. Only the faces have changed. We have not changed 
the system and until that happens, this country will pay a heavy 
price for it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, what I have 
been hearing here for a little while now is both surprising and 
disappointing to me. I have heard two of our friends from the 
Reform Party claim that, because we advocate the sovereignty of 
Quebec, we Bloc members do not have the interests of Canada at 
heart, that we want to break or destroy Canada and that we are, 
therefore, not making a full contribution in committee but 
defending only very narrow interests instead.
<P>
	I take issue with such statements because every Bloc member 
who sits on a committee carries out competently and honestly, not 
only as an individual but also as a representative of our party, the 
Bloc Quebecois, the duties that we have been assigned as the 
official opposition.
<P>
	In committee, members take turns examining the various 
witnesses who come and share their views with us. Each opposition 
party usually has about ten minutes to examine a witness, with the 
official opposition party leading off, followed by the second 
opposition party; then, the government party, the Liberal Party, 
gets to examine the witness.
<P>
	Sometimes our questions complement one another, they are 
along the same lines. Other times, one party or another asks 
questions which, while going in a different direction, benefit the 
debate and broaden our outlook on the issues raised by the people 
who appear before us. But in any case, we are committed to 
identifying the informative parts of the evidence presented to us. 
Of  course, we are also committed to identifying those aspects 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="253"> 253 </A></B>
<P>
which have an impact on our region in particular. This is true not 
only of Bloc members, but also of members of all parties. I have 
seen-and there was nothing wrong with that-members from the 
Toronto area represent views and argue matters that were of more 
particular concern to the people of their ridings. That is their duty, 
and it is my duty to raise issues of more pressing concern to my 
constituents.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	When I hear Reformers claim that it is not right for me to do so, I 
tell myself that they have an extremely narrow view of what true 
democracy is all about. This concerns me; it makes me sad. I 
cannot accept it in this House. This is the reason why I rose today: I 
want to set the record straight.
<P>
	Let me also say that a Bloc Quebecois member has as much right 
to fill the position of vice-chair as a Reformer. I have nothing 
against a Reform member being a vice-chair, but do not tell me that 
Bloc members cannot do a good job as vice-chairs because they 
happen to be sovereignists. I strongly object to that. This is not only 
totally inaccurate, it is also an insult to our integrity and to 
democracy itself.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you will recall that in the days of the iron curtain, 
people strongly condemned those communist countries that 
prevented individuals from expressing themselves on the grounds 
that they held dissenting opinions. Some people were imprisoned. 
Thank goodness this is not the case here, but I refuse to be muzzled.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you and I know-and so do many members 
here-that civilization and society thrive on the exchange of ideas. 
If everyone held the same views, this would still be the cave age. It 
is because someone, somewhere, said ``We must get out of the 
cave'' that civilization started to make progress. The Bloc's role in 
this House, and within the Confederation right now, is to promote 
an idea and put it up against other ones, in a democratic, respectful 
and constructive fashion.
<P>
	This is why I refuse to be muzzled by Reformers, simply because 
we do not share the same views. I respect the fact that they do not 
share our views, but they should do likewise.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have been accused of wanting to break up Canada. Nothing is 
further from the truth. What we have been offering and 
reoffering-I am bidding it once again-is a new partnership, 
politically and economically with the rest of Canada.
<P>
	The actual political situation we live in through Confederation is 
outmoded and obsolete. It is very expensive and unsatisfactory 
from sea to sea to sea. We are offering a new vision of what the 
economical Canadian space could be. We want to confront it 
verbally  and democratically with those who have other ways of 
seeing things. This should construct a better solution. It is not as 
Reform members would suggest in saying to all Canadians that we 
want to break up the country that they are helping the solution to be 
found. On the contrary, it is through constructive debate that a 
solution will occur.
<P>
	I cannot accept the attitude of the Reform Party toward the Bloc 
Quebecois. The electors, the voters, the people from my riding 
have the same democratic values as the people from the riding of 
any Reform Party member. The fact that half the Quebec 
population thinks sovereignty is an avenue to be pursued just 
stresses how important this vision is and it should be respected by 
all members here, including my friends from the Reform Party.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	From a democratic standpoint, people in my riding have the 
same value as those from the riding of a Reform Party member. 
Again, I have nothing against a Reform member being vice-chair of 
a committee, but I ask that we respect the integrity and honesty of 
Bloc members; I ask that we respect democracy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I should 
like to put a question to the member for Portneuf whom I have 
enjoyed getting into debate with outside the Chamber. I consider 
him to be a reasonable person, although obviously I do not 
appreciate the direction he would take Canada.
<P>
	I bring him back to the question at hand. He has said, and this 
was by translation: ``We do not accept that we be muzzled''. It is 
not the intention of the Reform Party to muzzle the Bloc 
Quebecois. Unlike the Liberals who have chosen to muzzle the 
Reform Party in committee, it is not the idea of the Reform Party to 
muzzle the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	Is it not rational, reasonable and responsible, as put forward by 
the member for Calgary Centre, that if his party and my party have 
52 seats each, the Reform Party should not be muzzled as is 
presently happening because of the collusion of the Liberals?
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question of my 
colleague. However, as he well knows, the Reform Party is not 
muzzled within a committee. The fact that we are a vice-chair just 
gives us the right to ask the first question in the first 10 minutes. 
After that they are second. They are not really muzzled. That is the 
answer to item <I>a</I>.
<P>
	On item <I>b</I>, I have never believed that the Reform Party should 
not be a vice-chair in any committee. As far as I can see, it is up to 
Bloc members to decide whether they can or cannot be vice-chairs. 
We have one member in most committees whereas the Liberals 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="254"> 254 </A></B>
<P>
have many  members. When the vote is taken we are not the ones 
who decide.
<P>
	Why have they favoured us? That is the right question to ask. 
You should find the right answer; you might be in for a surprise. 
Why are we preferred as a vice-chair rather than you? What have 
you not done right to impress them? That is the right question. It is 
up to you.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> My hon. colleague has spoken such good 
English that I hate to suggest he should not use the word you. He 
should refer to them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
a great deal of respect for the hon. member for Portneuf. We have 
worked together on committees before and on a number of other 
parliamentary affairs.
<P>
	He said something today which I think is very important and 
took be aback. He said in his intervention that the Bloc Quebecois 
was not here to break up Canada. I believe that is very important.
<P>
	There are people who purport to speak on behalf of the Bloc. 
This past weekend, on a political commentary panel which 
discusses these issues week after week, Josée Legault of <I>la Presse</I> 
said that the Bloc had been fighting. She tried to find words. It was 
not distinct society. It was not veto. It was not special partnership, 
as the member would suggest. Josée Legault said very clearly that 
in her view Quebec wants nationhood. That statement flies directly 
against what the member has said.
<P>
	Would the member address the position of Ms. Legault regarding 
nationhood and what he said today to the House, that the Bloc is not 
here to split up Canada?
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, we are just on the edge of the 
motion but it is an interesting debate. I will try to answer the 
problematic question my hon. colleague has put forward.
<P>
	Whatever Ms. Legault thinks or writes are her own beliefs. I 
cannot read her thoughts so I will not try to do that. However, I 
know the specific agenda of the Quebec government and the one 
we are proposing. It is a partnership with Canada.
<P>
	When the member talked about nationhood, the Quebec people 
as a whole are a people. As such they have a culture of their own, a 
way of seeing things of their own which does not preclude alliances 
with other people in Canada. I am not only talking about English 
Canada but also about the aboriginals.
<P>
	We have to open our minds and find a way to build something 
that will answer the needs and the expectations of all people on this 
portion of the continent, not only for ourselves but for our children 
and the children of our children.
<P>
	If I were to go any further I would certainly go beyond the nature 
of the motion in front of us, so I will stop now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
important for Canadians to understand the significance of these 
vice-chair positions and the chair position with respect to public 
accounts which the Reform Party is talking about in the House.
<P>
	We are talking about the group, the chair and the two vice-chairs 
who form the core of the steering committee for the committee as a 
whole. These are not just window dressing positions, or certainly 
should not be just window dressing positions.
<P>
	Therefore the fact that the government whip and the Liberals 
have chosen to freeze the Reform Party out of vice-chair positions 
on committees is to freeze the Reform Party out of the ability to be 
able to act as an effective opposition in the absence or in the 
vacuum of an official opposition because of the specific regional 
interests of the Bloc Quebecois. The significance is that the 
Liberals have chosen to freeze the Reform Party out of the ability 
to be an effective opposition.
<P>
	It has been said that a government is only as good as its 
opposition. It is for that reason the Liberals do not want the Reform 
Party to have any ability to come forward, to take charge and to be 
involved in any area of control within their jurisdiction. It is doing 
everything it can at the expense of our nation to freeze us out of that 
ability.
<P>
	Lest there be any question about this point, I have in my hand the 
report of the public accounts committee on September 27, 1995. It 
is particularly instructive. I went to that committee as a member of 
that committee and took the floor at the start of the meeting which 
was convened to vote for and appoint the person who was to be the 
chair of the public accounts committee.
<P>
	To expand on the comments of the member for Calgary Centre, 
the purpose of the public accounts committee is to take a look at 
well over $1 billion of current public spending that happens 
annually in Canada. The public accounts committee works very 
closely with the auditor general so that the people of Canada and 
their affairs are being looked after from a fiscal point of view.
<P>
	It seemed grossly illogical to myself and to my colleagues in the 
Reform Party that the Liberals would be forcing a situation where 
we would have a separatist who would be the chair of that 
committee, because of the very confined and defined interests of 
the Bloc Quebecois as they have come to Ottawa.
<P>
	We went to the meeting. We immediately put forward the name 
of my colleague, the hon. member for St. Albert, for the position of 
chair. It was really quite instructive because neither the 
government whip nor the Bloc Quebecois were in the room at the 
time I made that motion. Immediately following that there were 
people  scurrying around, running around all over the place: ``Oh, 
my, what are we going to do? What is going to happen now?'' 
Whereupon the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="255"> 255 </A></B>
<P>
government whip appeared in doorway and all was saved. Very 
shortly behind him came the Bloc Quebecois whip.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	We then entered into a process of debate on the issue. My 
colleague, the hon. member for Fraser Valley East, had the floor. 
For simplicity and so that we do not run afoul of the rules of the 
House, I will refer to the whip and I will refer to the Reform 
member. The whip said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I was wondering if our colleague would entertain a brief question. If this is an 
attempt to filibuster the committee, and he can indicate so right now, quorum 
will immediately cease.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Before I quote him further, the absolute arrogance of the 
government whip should be noted when he came walking into the 
room and said: ``If this is not going the way I want then I am going 
to cease quorum''. He went on:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There was an agreement between whips duly approved, ordered, and signed 
that we were meeting today to elect chairs. If this is a breach of that agreement, 
which it is on the verge of becoming, I'd like to know now. My colleagues and I 
will leave the room and quorum will cease. This meeting will not exist. Yes or 
no.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The absolute arrogance of this man is quite astounding. My 
colleague said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I don't think you can ask me questions anyway-I don't think that's your 
place.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The whip said: ``Thank you''. My colleague said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>You can do what you like. I'm trying to address the concerns of the people-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The whip said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>You don't need a <I>Hansard</I> any more, clerk.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Now he is telling the clerk who is in charge of this committee: 
``You don't need <I>Hansard</I> any more. I am here; I have taken over''. 
Terrific.
<P>
	Then my colleague said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-about the election of the vice-chairs. So it's certainly within my prerogative 
to do that.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	An hon. member said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>You can talk all day long. You're alone.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Then the government whip got his members in line and they 
dutifully followed him out of the room. The hon. member for 
Fraser Valley East was continuing to talk in the meeting when the 
whip from the Bloc Quebecois said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Chairman, on a point of order, I would like to see if we have a quorum. If 
we don't, we should end this meeting.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The clerk said: ``We only have three members here. I guess 
everybody has left''.
<P>
	We should note the absolute arrogance of the government whip 
representing the Liberals, coming into that meeting, taking over 
that meeting and saying: ``It is not going the way the Liberals 
wanted so therefore we are down''. For the Liberals to turn around 
and try to convince Canadians that they are not completely in bed 
with or in total collusion with the separatists is bit beyond 
description.
<P>
	Let us talk about the Canadian heritage committee; I think that is 
the title of the committee. The decision was made there by the 
Liberals to anoint a Bloc Quebecois member as a vice-chair of that 
committee. Let us see what happened in that committee if only 
from the point of view of the record of attendance. I have in my 
hand the record of attendance which shows that the chair of that 
committee was there 13 times. Presumably there were 13 meetings.
<P>
	We then have the record of myself, the hon. member for 
Medicine Hat and the hon. member for Edmonton Strathcona, 
totalling 11 of the 13 meetings. We have zero for the Bloc 
Quebecois member from Quebec. The person who was anointed to 
be the vice-chair of that committee by the Liberals, the hon. 
member for Rimouski-Témiscouata, was there five times.
<P>
	It has been reported to me by the hon. member for 
Edmonton-Strathcona that the Canadian heritage committee 
could not even have had a meeting and that there would not have 
been a member of the opposition had the Reform Party not turned 
up. Yet the Liberals have the audacity to keep on putting the Bloc 
Quebecois into these positions with the specific idea of freezing the 
Reform Party out of the ability to be able to do the job of an 
effective opposition. There can be absolutely no other reason I can 
think of that the Liberals might have.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	I believe that the Liberals want to keep Canada together every bit 
as much as the Reform Party wants to keep Canada together. They 
may not have any idea how to do it. They may keep on flying trial 
balloons. They may keep coming up with all sorts of wonderful 
ideas, flying flags and all sorts of things because they do not have 
anything of any substance, but I do not question their fundamental 
intent to keep Canada together.
<P>
	What I do question is the wisdom of the government whip. I do 
question the wisdom of the so-called brain trust of the Liberal Party 
in continuing to freeze the federalist Reform Party out of the ability 
to be an effective opposition.
<P>
	I speak in the most forceful terms. I consider the actions of the 
Liberal government whip to have been out of control and over the 
top. I would hope, because the Reform Party has brought this 
matter so forcibly to the floor at this time, that as we get down to 
appointing committee chair and vice-chair positions that they 
would rethink their very foolish and ill thought position.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="256"> 256 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville-Milton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
find it strange that the previous speaker, who obviously is a new 
member of the heritage committee, probably appointed in 
September 1995, would choose to use the attendance record as 
reasoning behind his quest to have a member of the Reform Party 
as the vice-chair of that committee.
<P>
	As a person who sat on that committee for the 18 months 
previous to his arrival, I would like to point out that should he have 
regarded the attendance records of the first 18 months, he would 
have found that the Bloc Quebecois members were most regular in 
their attendance and surprisingly it was the members of the Reform 
Party whose attendance was highly questionable.
<P>
	May I also point out that the Bloc Quebecois members in the 
first 18 months not only attended the public hearing sessions of that 
committee, not only attended the briefings by department officials, 
but they also attended the in camera sessions when for weeks we 
were seriously working on a written report about the future of the 
CBC. It seemed rather strange to me that the Reformers came to the 
meetings when the press was in attendance but not one meeting 
when the press was not in attendance.
<P>
	As far as I am concerned, I think the vice-chairs of committees 
must be committed not just to those sessions of the committee 
meetings when the press is in attendance but also when the solid, 
quiet work of the committee is done in camera.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps that says something about the 
content of the meetings that took place last fall when only five out 
of thirteen meetings were attended by the vice-chair of the heritage 
committee, the member for Rimouski-Témiscouata. 
Furthermore, the member for Quebec did not turn up at all. I can 
only guess that in the judgment of the Bloc Quebecois, the heritage 
committee meetings in the first 18 months actually had some 
substance whereas in the second half, according to the way the 
member is thinking, only five out of the thirteen meetings had any 
significance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
take a slightly different attack on this problem.
<P>
	In my mind, the issue of who should become the vice-chairman 
of a committee is one that rests with the committee. With respect to 
the election of a chairman and vice-chairman the standing orders 
state: ``Each standing or special committee shall elect a chairman 
and two vice-chairmen, of whom two shall be members of the 
government party and the third a member in opposition to the 
government''.
<P>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	This can become a very partisan debate, trying to weigh one 
opposition party against another. Frankly I do not think it should be 
just that. My suggestion for the government is very 
straightforward, that the election of the vice-chairmen be just that, 
an election and not a  coronation. How many Bloc members would 
likely be vice-chairmen in that instance? Maybe all of them.
<P>
	Surely there should be an opportunity in Parliament for a proper 
election, an election with hands raised so that the individuals 
making the choice would be known. My real question is: Why not 
an election? Why not an opportunity to at least say that these two 
parties, which are very close in numbers-after the byelections we 
hope to be ahead-would have that opportunity? Is that not fair? 
Why not be fair?
<P>
	To the Canadian public, why would this choice even be in doubt? 
Why would we not have this election? Could there be a reason that 
is better for the Liberal Party? Could there be a reason that is better 
for the country?
<P>
	I drew a little graph. Down one side of my graph, I put some of 
the reasons: balance, a powerful federalist opposition. Would it be 
better for a Bloc member to be a vice-chairman? Would it actually 
be better for the Liberals to have the Bloc in those vice-chairs? 
How could it possibly be better in every case to have that party as 
the vice-chair? Is there no room for an alternate?
<P>
	I have come to the House with a fresh view of Parliament, a view 
that I hope is balanced. I have asked myself what the committee 
structure is really designed to do. Before I came here I had heard 
that the committees were the spot where the real work of 
Parliament was done. I have stood back from that and asked 
whether that is true. Are committees where the work of Parliament 
is really done? My answer is: Not true. They are not where the 
work of Parliament is really done.
<P>
	I am going to give an example of an experience in committee. 
Our committee was faced with a challenge. We had order in council 
appointments placed before us which were to be voted upon. These 
were for individuals holding positions on very important boards. I 
asked when there had been a review of an order in council how 
often the appointee had been turned down. The answer I received 
surprised me: never in Canadian history had that occurred. There 
had never been a single appointee turned down.
<P>
	The obvious question I asked then was why we did the review. 
What was the purpose of a review if there has never been an 
individual turned down? The response was that this system was not 
like the committee review system in the U.S. I then asked, should 
we not be reviewing order in council appointments at the 
nomination stage rather than at the appointee stage? A committee 
was struck to review that very issue but I said it was surely 
something the committee could decide that day.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	It makes sense that if we are going to committee to review this 
issue that we bring the appointees to the committee. The committee 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="257"> 257 </A></B>
<P>
would look at them all and say which individuals were acceptable 
to the committee.  The committee would go back to the PMO which 
would from those names pick the number of individuals needed. If 
the committee found that there were one or two people who were 
not acceptable for whatever reason, the residual names could be 
sent back. The power would still rest with the PMO. No power 
would be taken away.
<P>
	However, a committee had to be struck. It sat through the 
summer and reviewed the issue with all the previous order in 
council appointments. It came to the very same conclusion in five 
minutes: that the review of orders in council should take place at 
the appointee stage rather than at the nomination stage.
<P>
	I did a little review with a high school class at home. I asked 
them: How long would it take you to figure out at what stage to do a 
review of a group of people who were coming to sit on a committee 
of Parliament? Would you review it at the appointee stage or at the 
nomination stage? It took these grade 11 students about 15 seconds 
to decide the issue. And how long does it take the Parliament of 
Canada to come up with a decision? It has been six months in 
review.
<P>
	I have watched very carefully. What has happened to the 
decision of the health committee on that issue since? We are now 
another 18 months down the road and the decision has fallen into 
the black abyss, the black hole of parliamentary gobbledegook. 
Who knows where it has gone? It was to go to the committee on 
procedure and House affairs. It was to be reviewed, but it is gone. 
And for what? So that the PMO can say that nobody can review any 
of the names, that the review is not real? This a problem with the 
committee structure. I tell that story so that no one can say I think 
the committee structure is perfect.
<P>
	Since I am talking about committee structure problems, I 
watched to see how witnesses came to the committees. I sat on the 
HRD review committee which was looking at social program 
renewal in Canada. I tried to figure out who called and how the 
witnesses reached the committee.
<P>
	I was disappointed to find that most of the individuals who had 
access to the committee were non-governmental agencies that had 
a lot of connection with government. Many received funding from 
the government. Many received payment from the government to 
come to the committee. I believe that their testimony may have 
been skewed. It is difficult for the average citizen who knows 
nothing about these issues to have a fair hearing. I do not think they 
have the lobby groups that would allow them to get a fair hearing.
<P>
	The committee structure would be very easy to improve. It 
would be very easy to look at it from the standpoint of what should 
happen in Canada. Let me now go to what I think in a positive sense 
we should do to improve the committee structure.
<P>
	The government is going to control the committee. The 
government will have a chairman and the first vice-chairman. 
Accept it. That is what the numbers allow. Why would we not have 
an election for the position of second vice-chairman which would 
usually go to the official opposition but might go to a meritorious 
individual in another party, the fourth party, another party 
completely? A meritorious election for vice-chairman.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	I would hope order in council appointments could be made at the 
appointee stage rather than the nomination stage. I am convinced 
we could seek witnesses at these committees who are not so biased 
or narrow and who are not tied into the government agenda.
<P>
	Is this a partisan issue? For me it is not. This is an issue of 
balance and fairness, for if every single vice-chair came from the 
official opposition and nowhere else, on merit, I would nod my 
head to those members and say bien.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	However, if a committee vice-chair absolutely must be a Bloc 
member, that is certainly not equality. In my opinion, it is very 
clear that we ought to have the opportunity to vote in order to elect 
another member to the position of committee vice-chair.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Canadian people are not willing to stand idly by and watch 
Parliament function in a way that is not fair. That is all this issue is 
about.
<P>
	I ask, directly to the government, to allow for, conduct, and 
appropriately oversee a proper election for each vice-chair. That 
would satisfy me. It would satisfy my party. More important, it 
would satisfy the people of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ): </B>Madam Speaker, allow me to 
be the first member to make reference to your presence as the new 
Deputy Speaker of this House.
<P>
	In response to the representative of the Reform Party, I must 
state that I am somewhat astonished to see in this House today that 
the Reform Party is concerned about will form the official 
Opposition and who will be vice-chairs, when we will be engaged 
this week in a debate of the highest importance on the budget 
speech. I must say that I would have expected instead that the 
members of this House would have focussed their energies, or 
husbanded their energies, for addressing the real problems Canada 
is facing, that is the attitude the Liberals across the way have taken 
toward managing the debt. In this connection, I believe that the two 
parties on this side can combine their actions to force the 
government to move, or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="258"> 258 </A></B>
<P>
at least to reflect. But I have  trouble understanding how there can 
be a drawn out debate on the choice of vice-chairs.
<P>
	I thought Canada operated according to a certain tradition, with 
this or that responsibility for the official Opposition. That this was 
normal and that was how we operated.
<P>
	As far as I am concerned, I can tell you that being from Quebec , 
yes, and I have nothing to hide in this regard, being a representative 
of the Bloc Quebecois, I defend a certain ideology, whether certain 
people like it or not, and it is important for the rest of Canada to 
know that. If we have become the Official Opposition and have 
certain related responsibilities to assume, that is not our choice but 
how democracy works. So I have difficulty understanding why 
there is this protracted debate. It seems to me to be superfluous.
<P>
	Once again, as Mr. Bouchard himself has said in this House, 
perhaps the Reform Party is short on ambition. Rather than 
focussing on becoming the official Opposition, rather than seeking 
what goes along with that position, they ought instead to be seeking 
to combat the true scourge here, in other words attacking the 
Liberals, the Government. But no. It might be said that they have 
set their sights too low.
<P>
	I would like to again express my astonishment on this, but this 
time about both sides.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	While the third party in the House tries to diminish the 
importance of the work of the official opposition by saying that you 
do not have to be a member of the official opposition to be 
vice-chairman in this House, the new Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs-I think I am allowed to mention his 
name since he has not been elected yet, Stéphane Dion-says: 
``The distinct society status is not really a special status and will 
not bring any special powers''.
<P>
	The third party in the House says that the official opposition does 
not really have the attributes of the official opposition. At the same 
time, a government spokesperson says that what was voted on 
before Christmas does not really mean what it means.
<P>
	So allow me to express my surprise as a member of the Bloc 
Quebecois and to ask: How is it that the bills that were voted on do 
not mean what they mean? How is it that the attributes of the 
official opposition, such as the office of vice-chairman, do not 
necessary apply because we are the official opposition? Maybe the 
time has come to tackle the real issue, to call a spade a spade, to go 
back to the basics, to look at who built Canada, that is the notion of 
two founding peoples, to try to understand and to respect the rules.
<P>
	There are a lot of things I do not agree with in the way Canada is 
run, but I respect the rules. I hope that the third party in the House 
will respect the rules also and  that we will close this debate which, 
I must say, I find totally useless. I hope we can get on with what is 
important, that is to prepare our response to the budget speech.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill:</B> Madam Speaker, there is no question in this speech, 
but if possible I would like to read the following paragraph from 
our Standing Orders:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Each standing or special committee shall elect a Chairman and two 
Vice-Chairmen, of whom two shall be Members of the government party and the 
third a Member in opposition to the government-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It does not say a member of the official opposition, but simply a 
member in opposition.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-in accordance with the provisions of Standing Order 116, at the 
commencement of every session and, if necessary, during the course of a 
session.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Why is it always a member of the official opposition? It is not in 
the Standing Orders. I simply want a vote in private on the subject. 
Is it not possible? I personally think it is necessary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, to start 
with, I would like to congratulate you on being elected to this 
position you are occupying this afternoon for the first time. We are 
doubly fortunate in that it is an Acadian and a woman who was 
selected to preside, at least in part, over the proceedings of this 
assembly.
<P>
	This being said, I would like to ask my hon. colleague a 
question. I assume that when he mentions that he would like the 
vote to take place in private, he is referring to a secret vote. 
However, members of Parliament are accountable to their voters. 
People in my riding have the right to be aware of the decisions in 
which I took part and to know how I voted. As soon as a vote is 
secret, people in my riding will no longer be able to find out how I 
voted and, consequently, whether I represent their interests 
appropriately. The whole democratic process must be transparent. 
Transparency requires open votes where each and every one clearly 
expresses his or her opinion.
<P>
	If the kind of private vote my colleague is referring to was to 
deprive my voters, the citizens of my riding, of the ability to know 
how I voted, then I would say that it violates democratic principles. 
I would like him to clarify his position.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Madam Speaker, the issue for me on this 
vote is so that each member might be able to vote for somebody 
with merit. I am trying to get away from the idea that this must be a 
specific party member.
<P>
	Surely merit is better than party membership. The rules have 
said very clearly the second vice-president should come from a 
member of the opposition. We in Reform are members of the 
opposition.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="259"> 259 </A></B>
<P>
	The Canadian public would accept very well for every single 
vice-chair to be a member of the Bloc if there were an opportunity 
for that election to be based on merit, for surely there are members 
from the Bloc of great merit; but equally the chance that there 
might be a member in the Reform Party with some merit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
welcome to the chair. We wish you the best in your new 
responsibilities.
<P>
	The debate before us focuses on two very basic things. One is the 
question of parliamentary reform with respect to committees. The 
question must arise of whether the committees have the authority 
and the independence to choose their chairs, their vice-chairs and 
other such formats of the committees independently of external 
authority either from the Prime Minister's office or through the 
Liberal government whip.
<P>
	The other question is what we observe as this unfortunate 
support the government gives to the separatist party for the 
positions in those committees, the vice-chair positions, chair 
positions with regard to the public accounts committee.
<P>
	The member for Mississauga South earlier said that by tradition 
the vice-chairs went to members of the official opposition. I can 
understand why he said that. The Liberal whip continually gives 
the impression that is the way it is, that other opposition members, 
representatives of the Reform Party or from the NDP or the 
Conservative Party, are not part of the official opposition and 
cannot be one of the vice-chairs. That is the presentation the 
Liberal whip made to his own caucus and it is believed that is the 
way it is.
<P>
	It is not that way. Some of my hon. colleagues have pointed out 
very clearly in the House that it is not tradition that the official 
opposition gets the chair or the vice-chair positions. I make that 
very clear. It is just one of the ways the Liberal whip is able to 
again have this love-in, as I call it, with the separatist party and 
provide it support in having a position of authority or power in the 
Parliament of Canada. I do not accept that in any way.
<P>
	Speaking to these two points, parliamentary reform and more 
independence for the committees to choose who should be their 
chairs and vice-chairs, that is where the authority should lie. My 
hon. colleague from Macleod pointed that out very clearly.
<P>
	In the 33rd Parliament the McGrath report was presented. 
Through that report a number of parliamentary reforms were 
brought into the House of Commons. I commend that report. I 
commend the 33rd Parliament for accepting a number of those 
recommendations.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	One of those recommendations related to the independence of 
the committee. It also said the  committee could establish its own 
agenda without interference by the government. Prior to the 33rd 
Parliament the government set the agenda for the committees. Any 
subject or matter referred from the House of Commons by the 
government to the committees was discussed. The committee had 
no latitude beyond that to make decisions, which was wrong.
<P>
	In the 33rd Parliament the McGrath report changed that so that 
committees could set their own agenda, call the witnesses they 
wanted and at the same time elect their chairs and vice-chairs in an 
independent way. It was set up with that mind, but did it happen? It 
did not happen.
<P>
	My time spent on the finance committee was a good experience. 
The chair was a good leader and allowed for flexibility within the 
committee work. We carried out a number of the recommendations 
of the McGrath report in a responsible way. Beyond that, what was 
happening?
<P>
	I say to the people at home watching, they should be aware of 
how committee chairs are chosen by standing committees. The 
rules allow for an election, which is the way it should be. A 
member is nominated and then there is an open vote. If that motion 
is defeated another name is put forward until someone is elected 
chair.
<P>
	Although our committee system has evolved with respect to 
what a committee can do, the Prime Minister in the instances here 
and during the current 35th Parliament, through his whip, still 
controls who shall become the chair. That person is told by the 
Prime Minister's office. The other Liberal members on the 
committee have to vote for the Prime Minister's choice. We in the 
committee do not operate independently or have the right to choose 
who that person is.
<P>
	The backbenchers on the Liberal side do not have the 
opportunity to stand for chair if the Prime Minister has not chosen 
them. That is it. They have no choice. There is a vote but it is just 
going through the exercise. Certainly that is unacceptable.
<P>
	We must well recognize that the Prime Minister has a lot of 
authority in appointing his cabinet, in appointing parliamentary 
secretaries, in appointing senators and in appointing a whole range 
of other political appointees. That is a lot of appointees.
<P>
	Why does the Prime Minister interfere with the choice of chairs 
for House of Commons committees? That should be the 
responsibility of the committees, not the Prime Minister. The 
format is certainly there. Some of hon. members say that it is. 
However, we well know that before we sit down as a committee the 
Prime Minister's choice will be nominated by the Liberal whip, and 
if anybody gets out of line the Liberal whip will deal with them 
later.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="260"> 260 </A></B>
<P>
	All Liberals members are required by edict through the Prime 
Minister's office to vote for his choice. The Liberal whip sees to 
that in a very undemocratic way.  That is the way it is and that is the 
concern we have here as members of the House of Commons.
<P>
	In what sense can a committee be really impartial when we have 
such an external influence on our actions? There must be a change 
in attitude with regard to that matter. It is time to free up the 
backbenches of the Liberal Party so those members can choose 
who they want for chair, who they want as vice-chair. It does not 
happen.
<P>
	If we really want parliamentary reform, if we want to again 
implement or reimplement the McGrath report, there must be a 
change in attitude and we must look at things differently in the 
House. The Prime Minister, the Liberal government, the Liberal 
backbenchers must look at this in a more open, democratic manner 
so that parliamentary reform can be meaningful at the committee 
level.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	I talked about the appointment of chairs. It is the very same type 
of thinking for vice-chair positions. How much credibility does a 
committee chair or a vice-chair have if two people, the government 
whip and the whip for the Bloc Quebecois, get together and decide 
on who the vice-chair positions will be and what the committee 
positions will be?
<P>
	Even a government backbencher should be offended by that kind 
of action. If I were a government backbencher and thought I would 
make a vice-chair, I would hope I would need only to seek the 
support of committee members and not have to rely on this sort of 
kowtowing to the government whip.
<P>
	With a truly democratic process through which members would 
be free to vote for whomever they wanted, all choices would be 
acceptable because it would be done democratically. Even if a 
member did not support the one who got elected, it would be 
accepted because it was done properly.
<P>
	Not all members of the House voted for the current Speaker, but 
all members give him the respect he deserves because it was done 
in a very democratic way. It was a secret ballot and not even the 
Prime Minister could influence members in that process when we 
first selected a Speaker for the 35th Parliament.
<P>
	The other reform to our rules occurred in the last Parliament 
where for the first time there was a requirement to have one 
member from the opposition in either the vice-chair or the chair 
position. In the beginning of this new procedure and the only other 
time there was a set of elections outside this Liberal dominated 
Parliament, a vice-chair went to third party standing. In that 
Parliament, the third party had half the seats of the official 
opposition compared with the equality of seats in this Parliament.
<P>
	For some reason the precedent of that Parliament is not in this 
Parliament. The Liberal whip and the Liberal members are 
convinced that the only person who can fill the vice-chair is a 
member of the separatist party.
<P>
	There is precedent for something different. How can we continue 
to say in this Parliament that it should not be that way again? Since 
then, this Parliament has been operating on the notion brought 
forward by the chief government whip that electing official 
opposition members to all vice-chair positions was the tradition.
<P>
	How is it a tradition when the only other time it was done it was 
not done that way? There is a tradition here, the support of this 
chief government whip on the other side of the House for the 
separatist Bloc Quebecois. That is the tradition that is really being 
set at this point.
<P>
	We see it every day in committee and in the House. In any 
procedural argument the government runs to the defence of the 
Bloc. Even when Bloc members have little stomach for debate the 
government whip and his former sidekick, the member from 
Kingston and the Islands, come running to their aid. We saw that in 
an earlier debate.
<P>
	They have the experience and the procedural know-how. They 
are absolutely happy to support Bloc members in their many 
efforts. Parliamentary reform was moving ahead, albeit slowly. 
Since the Liberals have taken over government, parliamentary 
reform has gone backward in time to the days of Mr. Trudeau who 
ruled his caucus with an iron fist.
<P>
	That fist was beginning to loosen starting in the 33rd Parliament 
with the McGrath report and a little more in the 34th Parliament 
with other studies of the procedure and House affairs committee.
<P>
	The Liberals do not know any means of governing except by way 
of past experience. No wonder this has happened. They dismissed 
and ignored not only all the parliamentary reform that was 
discussed on the floor of the House and in committee for years but 
also their own parliamentary reform ideas.
<P>
	Let us not forget the recent reminder when the Prime Minister 
refused to appoint opposition members to junior chair positions as 
promised in the Liberal red book. This happened only a week ago.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	It is time government backbenchers had a look at what is 
happening. There should be some consideration for back to 
parliamentary reform. We should also look at freedom in 
committees whereby committee members are free to choose chairs 
and vice-chairs. It is also time in the House to stop, and Canadians 
want it stopped, the bias between the government and the Bloc 
Quebecois in all that happens on the floor of the House and in 
committees.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="261"> 261 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, every member of Parliament knows the Bloc is 
being favoured as official opposition. Any objective analysis 
would also demonstrate and come to the very same conclusion. 
This is a growing, daunting realization by the Canadian public. 
Whenever we have that kind of circumstance there is a reaction 
somewhere down the road. The government should think about 
that very seriously.
<P>
	The government has its own agenda and I am not exactly sure 
what it is. However, with the majority the government holds it has a 
unique time in our history to really create a circumstance for 
democratic freedom and for improving the way this place works, 
but it is blowing it.
<P>
	We have heard some very weak arguments from the Bloc, 
especially in my critic area of aboriginal affairs, as to how effective 
they are in the rest of the country. The Bloc has been happy to run 
around Canada encouraging spending and the inherent right to 
self-government among aboriginals as long as they are not in 
Quebec.
<P>
	At the same time, I and other members in my party have as a 
matter of course worked in Indian country in Quebec where the 
Bloc has totally dropped the ball. Do we trumpet this from the 
trees? Do we run around making speeches about what a great job 
we have done in the province of Quebec? No. This is a much more 
heartfelt item than that. This is beyond politics. The whole area of 
aboriginal affairs should in many respects be beyond politics.
<P>
	There is hardly a single thing done by the Bloc where the 
motivation is not to further the separatist vision of Quebec.
<P>
	Why should I have to go into committee knowing full well that 
as an opposition member the government wants to favour that other 
party member over me? I have sought to remedy the electoral 
unfairness or favouritism which I observed in committee last 
September. This was very difficult. Committees are supposed to be 
masters of their own house and, for very good reason, the Speaker 
is reluctant to interfere.
<P>
	The problem starts with the numbers. Government members on a 
committee outnumber the combined opposition members. The 
whip can orchestrate what happens in committee.
<P>
	We obviously need a secret ballot in committee. How the House 
of Commons, where our federal democracy is supposed to be 
expressed, does not adopt this bit of progress to prevent the 
possibility of government backbench coercion is beyond me, other 
than the government likes everything that happens around here to 
be in its full control. To elucidate some of my concerns, I would 
like to read a bit from my submission of September 20 last fall to
<P>
demonstrate my observations on  trying to even nominate a Reform 
chair or vice-chair to the Standing Committee on Aboriginal 
Affairs.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This committee has a history of past irregularities, including the case to 
which I have drawn your attention. The irregularities from yesterday are as 
follows.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>First, as soon as the clerk's gavel fell I submitted a motion to elect a chairman. 
As Your Honour knows, under the standing orders the first item of business for 
an organizational meeting is the election of a chair for the committee. However, 
the clerk acknowledge my speaking and asked me to wait until he had read his 
first item of business. I asked that he recognize that I had given notice of a 
motion. After the clerk read the item of business he proceeded to recognize 
someone else first.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Typical. Very typical.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Second, once the chair was elected my colleagues repeatedly attempted to 
move a motion to elect a vice-chair, but the chair appeared to be intent on 
stalling so that a motion to elect a member of the Bloc could be put forward by 
the Bloc or by the government for the so-called opposition vice-chair.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The chair stalled by insisting that we were going to consider motions for 
government vice-chair. This is a false distinction. The standing orders do not 
recognize a government vice-chair per se. The standing orders only require that 
two of the three positions go to the government side.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As soon as a motion to elect a vice-chair is put forward, whether to elect a 
government or opposition member, that motion is surely in order. The chair 
made it clear that he was accepting no motions from the Reform.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Third, once a member of the government moved to elect the Bloc to the 
vice-chair, my colleagues and I asked for debate on the motion. We were not 
only cut off; we were not allowed to debate at all. As Your Honour knows, 
Standing Order 116 makes clear that there is no limit on debate on a regular 
motion in committee.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Fourth, when we put forward a motion to overturn the election of the Bloc 
member as vice-chair, the chairman refused to entertain the motion, which was 
surely in order. The chairman then summarily adjourned the meeting.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We appeal to you, Mr. Speaker, to uphold the standing orders and our rights. 
This kind of conduct by committee chairs is surely less than acceptable.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is just one more time when we ran into this but it is one that 
is documented. That is why I thought I would re-enter it into the 
record.
<P>
	Why does the government want to regulate and control every 
aspect of activity in Parliament? Canadians are not being served. 
There is no long term vision being displayed of how non-regional 
representation can lead to the irrelevancy of this place. In the minds 
of many Canadians this place is irrelevant now and by carrying on 
this kind of behaviour it is only contributing to that perception of 
irrelevancy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="262"> 262 </A></B>
<P>
	Why do the procedure experts in the Liberal government take 
such great delight in supporting the Bloc at every move and in 
every one of their tricks in this place to the detriment of 
democracy?
<P>
<B>(1735 )</B>
<P>
	As I explained before, with the majority the government has, it 
has a unique opportunity, one that has not been seen for a dozen 
years, to implement considerable improvements in how 
committees work. That opportunity has not only been lost, but the 
committee structures, committee elections, and all that goes with it 
have taken a step backward. As long as this charade continues those 
committees are becoming more and more irrelevant.
<P>
	When I go to committee I have very little influence on the 
agenda and subject matter to be looked into. The committee that I 
sit on, aboriginal affairs, has a whole classification of people who 
live under the Indian Act. They live under one department. There 
are no checks and balances beyond that department. The 
government is not only in control of the committee and the 
department, they are in control of those people's lives. If there is 
one place where opposition members need an opportunity to pry off 
the lid, to really try and get to the bottom of the serious things 
going on that are counterproductive to the aboriginal community 
and Canadian society as a whole, it is that committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Right on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> The non-partisan things that go on there are 
controlled and manipulated by the government. I am sorry, there is 
no other way for me to say it.
<P>
	Our committee wasted a long time, in my opinion, looking into 
what was really the minister's prerogative, which was 
co-management in Saskatchewan. Because the minister obviously 
has an agenda, the opposition role becomes one of damage control 
rather than trying to be a productive member of the committee, 
particularly if we have a point of view that is obviously quite 
different.
<P>
	This gets away from the whole system of checks and balances 
that are crucial to the proper operation of government on an 
ongoing basis. The checks and balances in the Canadian system 
are, assuming that the committee system worked properly, already 
much less than the checks and balances built into other 
democracies. One that comes foremost to my mind is the one due 
south of us.
<P>
	We need to scrutinize what this place is all about and where it is 
going. This is a crucial time in Canada's history. We are a young 
country. This is the wrong time for us to be creating so-called 
traditions that are anti-democratic, that we have been hearing about 
for the last while on this debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
want to speak against the motion. Like my  colleagues, I am very 
concerned about the message that this motion sends. There is a real 
cynicism in the country today that is caused by many factors, not 
the least of which is the perception, and the fact, that MPs have 
become very unaccountable. Governments have become very 
unaccountable.
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	That perception can only be strengthened by what the 
government is proposing to do, continue on with same slate of 
vice-chairmen that we currently have in the standing committees. It 
is absolutely ridiculous. To illustrate why that is so wrong it is 
important to go back through what happened on the committee I 
was sitting on when we chose a vice-chair last time to show where 
some of the problems are.
<P>
	I was sitting on the Canadian heritage committee. It is important 
to remember what committee I was on. When it came time to 
choose a new chairman and vice-chairman the hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, the chief government whip, 
showed up at the meeting. That never happens. When the whip 
shows up in a committee you know the fix is in. The whip is there 
to keep people in line and that is exactly what happened. The whip 
is there to crack his whip.
<P>
	The whip came in, sat at the table and the Liberal members were 
sitting beside him. The chair was chosen first. The chair took his 
place and we immediately moved a motion asking that a Reform 
member be nominated to sit as the vice-chair. We were told no, that 
was not going to happen. The chairman was not ready despite what 
the standing orders say, despite what the rules say, and our motion 
was ignored.
<P>
	The Bloc motion was recognized and subsequently a Bloc 
member was chosen to be vice-chair of the Canadian heritage 
committee, the one committee that is dedicated at least in part to 
helping keep the country together. Where is the common sense in 
that?
<P>
	Madam Speaker, if you go to Antigonish, Nova Scotia, Bathurst, 
New Brunswick, Sooke, B.C. or Brooks, Alberta and you ask 
people if that makes any sense at all they are going to ask what is 
the matter with MPs? No wonder Canadians are so cynical about 
this place. Should we have a separatist sit as the vice-chair of the 
Canadian heritage committee? That is ridiculous.
<P>
	Last fall the committee was to travel across the country to hear 
from Canadians about how to keep Canada together. Are we really 
going to have a separatist chair that committee going across the 
country to talk about how we can keep the country together? Do 
you think that makes sense? Do you not think it is really contrary to 
what most people would regard as common sense? I certainly do.
<P>
	In the wake of the referendum we heard that certain hon. 
members from the Bloc Quebecois were talking to  members of the 
Canadian military about starting an armed forces in Quebec after 
the referendum campaign. Does it really make sense in the wake of 
the referendum to have a vice-chair on the defence committee from 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="263"> 263 </A></B>
<P>
the separatist party? That is absolutely nuts. It is crazy and yet here 
are these members across the way defending it.
<P>
	We are sitting in Parliament, an institution that should reflect the 
wishes of Canadians. It should be an institution where the rules and 
procedures allow for the scrutiny of government, allow people to 
have their say through their elected representatives, first with 
respect to the issues, but also with respect to whom they want 
representing them on the various committees that are an offshoot of 
the House of Commons. Of course we do not have that despite the 
commitments that the government made in their red book.
<P>
	The Liberals were elected because of the red book. They 
appeared in ads and said: ``We have the people, we have the plan'' 
and they flashed the red book around. In the red book was a 
commitment to change the way committees work. They said: ``We 
want to make them more democratic. We want to give committees 
more power''.
<P>
<B>(1745 )</B>
<P>
	What did they do? They said they wanted to make them more 
democratic and wanted to give them more power, but what they did 
was completely different. They brought the chief government whip 
in, the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell who seems to 
have a love affair with the separatists. They sat him down in the 
Canadian heritage committee, and he made sure the Liberal 
members voted for a separatist to sit as vice-chair of the Canadian 
heritage committee. That is absolutely ridiculous.
<P>
	There we go again, another broken Liberal promise. Just like the 
GST, just like the NAFTA and just like all the others, it is another 
broken promise. How cynical of them to sit over there and assert 
that we should accept that again in this session of Parliament. It is 
absolutely ridiculous.
<P>
	Often we send delegations around the world to monitor elections 
in other countries as though we have some special expertise on 
democracy. What would happen if someone sat in on one of these 
committee meetings and watched how things were conducted, 
particularly when it is time to elect chairmen and vice-chairs for 
the committees? This is after we have seen the Liberal red book 
commitment which said that the vice-chairs would come from the 
opposition parties. We saw that even in the event of the debate over 
the Speaker's chair, but we need not go into that again. They made 
that kind of commitment. How ironic that we should be sitting here 
voting to send people around the world to monitor other people's 
elections. It is absolutely crazy. All we have to do is go to one of 
these committee meetings to see how ironic that is.
<P>
	Not very long ago the Deputy Prime Minister, who is now the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage, argued that we needed to return to 
the spirit of 1967. She was referring to the year that Canada 
celebrated its 100th anniversary, the year when there was a great 
national celebration. We all felt very patriotic about our country 
and very sentimental about some of the things we valued in the 
country. That is a very noble idea. Some of the government's 
approaches toward achieving that are completely out to lunch. It 
seems to think somehow heritage flows from the government down 
to the people and not the other way around.
<P>
	Setting that aside for a moment, I want to ask the Deputy Prime 
Minister rhetorically how this decision to have a member of the 
separatist Bloc Quebecois sit as a vice-chair of the Canadian 
heritage committee squares with her sentiment that we should 
return to the spirit of 1967.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Maybe a Reformer should sit on the 
membership of the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> There is an idea. Maybe we should have a 
Reformer sit on the membership of the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society. 
I do not know. Perhaps that makes complete sense. As somebody 
said, maybe it makes sense to have Jack the Ripper in charge of a 
knife store. I do not know.
<P>
	That is the argument members across the way are making. We 
need to have the separatists in charge of Canadian heritage. It is 
completely ridiculous. We should have the separatists in charge of 
the defence committee which, in light of what happened after the 
referendum or just before the referendum, is something that needs 
serious examination. If I were the defence minister I would be a bit 
concerned about that. I would be questioning my own members and 
saying: ``Are you sure you really want to do that?'' He has a 
responsibility to do that, in my judgment, after what happened.
<P>
	Let me conclude by saying the Liberals made some promises. 
They made a promise to reform institutions like committees so that 
they were allowed to reflect the wishes of members of the 
committee. In other words, they wanted to give members of 
Parliament more power. They denied that by giving the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, the chief government whip, almost 
absolute power to go in there and say: ``If you don't support the 
separatists then you will be in big trouble''. We have seen what has 
happened to members in the past, where they have been kicked off 
committees because they voted the wrong way.
<P>
	The second point I want to make in conclusion is that we have a 
situation today where people are deeply cynical about the way 
politics work. They are deeply cynical and very pessimistic about 
their futures. When we have a situation where promises of all kinds 
made in the red book are completely forgotten two years later we 
can understand why they feel that way. The government has  helped 
contribute to the great pall of pessimism that has fallen across the 
land.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="264"> 264 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	Third, this is a democratic institution. In this place of all places 
people should have the right to elect the people they want to elect 
without interference from the government. We raised a question of 
privilege the other day on the issue of the government interfering in 
the business of Parliament. In that case there was a very serious 
accusation, but we see it happen in all ways, shapes and manners in 
this place because the government keeps resisting the need to 
change.
<P>
	The fourth point I want to make is from a common sense point of 
view. We have a separatist vice-chair on the Canadian heritage 
committee, the committee that is supposed to be in charge of 
helping to keep the country together. We have a Canadian unity 
committee that has sprung out of the Canadian heritage committee 
and we have a separatist vice-chair who is part of that committee, 
who will be helping to run that committee. It is absolutely nuts. We 
will have a separatist as a vice-chair on the defence committee as 
well. In light of what has happened that is ridiculous.
<P>
	In conclusion, the attitude of the government was betrayed when 
Mr. Speaker very wisely ruled not long ago that based on 
parliamentary precedent the status quo had to be accepted in terms 
of leaving the Bloc-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Unfortunately.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> It was very unfortunate, but he very wisely ruled 
that according to precedent he had to maintain the Bloc as the 
official opposition.
<P>
	However what happened after that spoke volumes. When 
members of the Liberal Party applauded it said more in a few 
seconds than all the members in the House could say in an eternity. 
They applauded because they favour the separatists in the official 
opposition chair, none more than the hon. member 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell who has made it a point to make 
sure every vice-chairmanship has gone to the Bloc Quebecois, the 
separatists, no matter how damaging it has been to the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I have 
heard enough of this information. I have heard that separatists are 
unfit to vice chair the Canadian heritage and defence committees.
<P>
	I pay taxes. The people of Quebec pay taxes to Canada, up to $30 
billion a year. Moreover, soldiers from my riding have given their 
lives in Bosnia. As long as soldiers from my riding or from Quebec 
are giving their time, their health and their lives for Canada, Bloc 
Quebecois members should be and will be able to be vice-chairs of 
the defence committee. They have that right and no one can take it 
away from any Bloc Quebecois member.
<P>
	Furthermore, 400 years ago ancestors of many Bloc Quebecois 
members arrived in this country. They started a relationship with 
the autochtones. The heritage we have from sea to sea to sea is not 
only the one they have in the west. It is also the one we have in the 
east and which our ancestors have built over centuries.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	Who in the House has defended culture more than the Bloc 
Quebecois, whether in the printing business, the CBC, Société 
Radio-Canada or any other subject. Culture is something we 
understand and have understood for centuries. My father and 
grandfather were from the west. They were French speaking and 
contributed to that heritage in French.
<P>
	I believe we have a right to contribute to the defence and the 
promotion of Canadian heritage because a large part of it is Quebec 
heritage, the heritage of our ancestors.
<P>
	For Quebec taxpayers, our ancestors who donated all they had to 
build what we have today and the soldiers from Quebec who gave 
their health and their lives, the member's apology should be in 
order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member will be waiting 
a long time. The one who should be making apologies in the House 
is the one who is trying to rip the country apart.
<P>
	The hon. member is arguing on the one hand that they should be 
allowed to sit as vice-chairs on these committees because of the 
great Canadian heritage they have helped to uphold. On the other 
hand he is saying that he would take his province out of Canada.
<P>
	Let us not look backward for a moment; let us look forward. Are 
we saying that we want to put someone in charge of the Canadian 
heritage committee when we are sending a Canadian unity 
committee of that committee across the country to talk about ways 
to hold the country together? That is absolutely nuts. That is 
ridiculous.
<P>
	We would be irresponsible if we did not note that leading up to 
the last referendum the defence critic for the Bloc Quebecois wrote 
a letter on his leader's letterhead to the Canadian military in 
Quebec and asked them to consider coming over to them in the 
wake of a referendum. If we did not take some steps to protect 
ourselves from what could happen as a result of that, we would be 
completely irresponsible.
<P>
	The member is talking about talking Quebec out of 
Confederation, but let him not think that we should accept that. In 
his words, because he and the members of his riding are taxpayers 
somehow they have the right to sit as a vice-chair on any 
committee to propose things that would rip the country apart. That 
is nuts.
<P>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> There are four 
minutes remaining for questions and comments. Does anyone else 
wish to speak? The hon. member for Charlevoix.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I think 
that, this afternoon, the Reform Party has been attempting to skirt 
the issue. Before the House recessed for Christmas and before the 
prorogation of Parliament, they had put forward a motion in which 
they asked to be recognized as the official opposition. You will 
recall that they had asked the Speaker to rule on a motion claiming 
the status of official opposition.
<P>
	Last week, the Speaker of the House of Commons came back 
with an excellent ruling, stating that the Bloc Quebecois had 
achieved official opposition status in 1993, after the elections, and 
was the second party in the House of Commons. In the event of an 
equality of seats, and this is purely mathematical, and of our losing 
one seat or of the Reform Party gaining one, they will become the 
second party, or we might remain the second party.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	I suggest that we wait for the result of the March 25 byelection, 
at which time the Bloc Quebecois' position will be consolidated, 
with at least 54 seats.
<P>
	I think that the masks should be taken away from the Reform 
Party members. I think that playing this role, this afternoon, and 
raising this issue about the chairmanship or vice-chairmanship of 
committees, is basically a back-door method of showing that the 
Speaker was wrong and should have designated the Reform Party 
as the official Opposition. They are trying to send to English 
Canada the message that the Speaker made a mistake.
<P>
	Again, I maintain that the designation of the official opposition 
is purely mathematical. The advantage for us of having a Bloc 
member as vice-chair of a committee is, as the member for 
Portneuf explained, that it gives us priority for the first five 
minutes of questions to witnesses who appear before the 
committee. The vice-chair also sits on the steering committee that 
determines priorities on the agenda.
<P>
	We have wasted a lot of time. We have been discussing this issue 
since oral question period ended, at 3 p.m. The Reform Party 
makes an issue of who should be vice-chair and who should be 
chair.
<P>
	We are told that the interest on the national debt increases at the 
rate of $1,000 per second. The Reform Party should realize that, 
while we are arguing about who should fill the positions of 
vice-chair and chair, the interest on the debt has gone up $10,800.
<P>
	We should be discussing job creation, programs and the future of 
our young people. Instead, the Reform  Party is using roundabout 
means to try to show Canadians that the Speaker erred when he 
ruled that the Bloc Quebecois will remain the official opposition.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Madam Speaker, obviously I will not respond to 
everything because it would take too long. It is understandable that 
the Bloc members would like to assume all these chairmanship 
positions. That makes sense to me. I understand why they want 
that. Ultimately they want to go and become emperors in their own 
country. That is fine. They can pursue that.
<P>
	The point I want to make and which we have been trying to make 
here is they should not be aided and abetted by the Liberals. They 
should not be turning the rules on their head for a party is 
committed to the separation of Quebec from this country. That 
party should not be using those rules to seek its own ends.
<P>
	That is exactly what the Liberals have done. They have entered 
into this alliance, into this little intrigue with the Bloc Quebecois, 
with the separatists. They applauded them when the Speaker ruled 
that they should be maintained as the official opposition.
<P>
	That speaks volumes of what is happening here about the 
commitment of these people to have federalists sit in the opposition 
and help guide the agenda. I understand where these people are 
coming from. We will never agree with them. We will never agree 
with the Bloc, but the conduct of the Liberals is unbelievable.

<P>
	Taxes account for some 52 per cent of what Canadians pay for a

In the last 10 years, the price of gasoline has gone up by a

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BUSINESSOFTHEHOUSE">BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of Motion No. 1.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased today to address government Motion 
No. 1.
<P>
	As we are well aware, Motion No. 1 would reinstate bills which 
died on the Order Paper at the exact same stage they were at prior 
to prorogation. According to Précis of Procedure, 4th edition, 
prorogation means that the pending legislation would be abolished. 
The government seeks to overturn that practice through motion 1.
<P>
	Motion No. 1 would see bills resurrected as though prorogation 
had never really occurred. Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 235 
states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In recent years it has become common, by consent, to reinstate certain bills on the 
Order Paper of a new session at the same stage that they had reached before 
prorogation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This practice was started by the previous Tory government. As 
we have noticed over this 35th Parliament, there does not seem to 
be much difference between the policies of the old Tory 
government, which Canadians came to hate so much and which the 
Liberals when in opposition railed so much against, and the 
practices of the Liberals now that they are in government.
<P>
	Coming back to citation 235, we should pay particular attention 
to the phrase ``by consent''. As members know, particularly 
members of the Liberal Party, many of whom have been here for 
quite some time, unfortunately, anything is possible in the House 
by the means of unanimous consent. However, did the Liberals 
seek any consent from Reformers with respect to the resurrection 
of the bills for the second session? The answer to that is they did 
not. We discovered the Liberals' true intentions in an article in the 
<I>Hill Times</I> one day. In the article the government House leader 
discussed the possibility of introducing such a motion. At no time 
did the government contact the other parties in the House to discuss 
the possible reinstatement of the bills.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	Some of the things I am going to say have been said before by 
some of my colleagues in this debate but they were so profound I 
think they bear repeating. The Liberals gave a tough time to the 
Tory government over this same thing in the last Parliament. When 
the Tories bowed to these tactics in 1991 there were howls of 
outrage from the Liberals when they sat in opposition. They 
complained of anti-democratic measures and the destruction of 
parliamentary traditions. Perhaps it would do them some good 
tonight to reflect on some of their own protestations and arguments 
against the use of these tactics.
<P>
	I am happy to see that the member for Kingston and the Islands 
is present tonight. He played a huge part in this. He always gets a 
real charge out of hearing his words reflected once again in 
Parliament. We will attempt to do that again tonight.
<P>
	The member for Kingston and the Islands has been known for his 
bombastic outrage and outpourings and his pious reflections. In 
May 1991 he said to the Tories: ``It is still morally wicked of the 
government to proceed with this motion and particularly when it 
applies closure to the motion''.
<P>
	As a Reformer, I agree with that 100 per cent. I am happy that in 
1991 the member for Kingston and the Islands had the integrity and 
the fortitude to stand up and demand that democracy be done, to 
talk about how morally wicked and wrong it was. I congratulate the 
member for saying that. He went on to say: ``I suggest it is perhaps 
one of the worst outrages that has been perpetuated in this House in 
many years''. Again, I congratulate him for those profound 
utterances.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="268"> 268 </A></B>
<P>
	The member for Kingston and the Islands did not stop there. 
He went on and it got even better. The lamentations of the member 
for Kingston and the Islands climbed to even higher levels. He 
said that the Tory motion represented a national disgrace and that 
the Canadian Parliament would become the laughing stock around 
the world because of the outrageous conduct of the government 
in introducing the motion. That was a wonderful oratory he gave 
in 1991. I am so impressed.
<P>
	I would like to summarize the arguments put forward by the 
member for Kingston and the Islands. Motions of this nature are 
atrocious, unethical and unparliamentary. They make the Canadian 
government look disgraceful both here and at home. I wish I could 
claim originality to those words but unfortunately I cannot. I 
borrowed them from the member for Kingston and the Islands. He 
spoke them so eloquently here in 1991 as he railed against the 
outrageous, the morally wicked and the morally wrong practices of 
the Tory government. I could not agree with him more. I can think 
of no better.
<P>
	Let us bring it to the present using that member's very own 
words when he sat in opposition to the despicable Tories who had 
control of the country back then. I can think of no better words to 
use to describe the government and its behaviour over the course of 
the entire 34th Parliament. But he was not alone in his criticism of 
the former government's actions. He had a lot of help from other 
Liberals when they sat here. The member for Halifax stated that the 
Tory government should ``hang its head in shame for daring to 
introduce such a motion''. I love that one.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	I am sure some of the great defenders of democracy who have 
left this earth and gone on to the great Parliament in the sky are 
hanging their heads in shame right now, particularly if they 
happened to be Liberals when they were in this place. They must be 
hanging their heads in shame when they see the undemocratic 
policies of the government.
<P>
	I am getting to the best part. I have to quote the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell who is my very favourite Liberal. In 
1991 when he talked about the Tory motion, he wondered out loud: 
``If this precedent is allowed to proceed, then what on earth is 
next?'' What could follow? Mr. Speaker, let me tell the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell exactly what is next. Next is the 
Liberal government saying and doing exactly what it denounced 
five years ago. This is déjà vu all over again.
<P>
	Considering the comments from the member for Kingston and 
the Islands, the member for Halifax and the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, I have reason to believe, and it has 
been confirmed, that fried crow was served for lunch in the 
government lobby today. Considering the behaviour of the 
government, one truly must believe that the Liberals are getting 
accustomed to eating crow.
<P>
	It is funny how when sitting on this side of the House the 
Liberals had a monopoly on political morality. They had a 
monopoly on democracy. They had a monopoly on talking about 
integrity, honesty and doing things right. It was so easy to talk 
about it when they sat over here. Once transferred to the other side 
of the House however their democracy became bankrupt, their 
integrity became bankrupt and as a government they have become 
morally bankrupt.
<P>
	Turning back to the issue of Motion No. 1, the government will 
argue that it is necessary to save time since all these previous bills 
will not have to be reintroduced again. However the government 
has done nothing but waste time during its entire term in this 
Parliament.
<P>
	Proroguing the House removed the entire month of February 
when we could have been dealing with government business. The 
fall 1995 session was filled with take note debates and 
inconsequential bills. In fact, the government has done nothing of 
any value since becoming the government. We have done nothing 
but house cleaning since the government took office. Canadians 
want more than that. Important issues have been left on the back 
burner and Canadians have been left with no sense of direction 
from the government.
<P>
	I assume that prorogation provided the government with an 
opportunity to deliver another throne speech in order to provide 
some sense of direction, but Canadians will take little comfort from 
the contents of the throne speech we heard the other day. The 
government had a lot of time to prepare for this but the throne 
speech only differed slightly from the one delivered on January 8, 
1994. The Liberals' record on delivering on the promises made in 
the first throne speech quite frankly does not inspire much 
confidence in their ability to deliver on the promises made in the 
second throne speech.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	The first throne speech stated that the highest priority was job 
creation and economic growth. We found out in the second throne 
speech how the Liberals really felt about that. We found out what 
they intend to do. They intend to take their failed job creation 
program and pass it on to the backs of the private sector. That is 
typical for a tax and spend government. If the government cannot 
deliver through its own ingenuity, creativity and programs, then 
pass it on to those it can wrest a buck from.
<P>
	Since the Liberals took office the Canadian debtload has 
increased about $70 billion. During the campaign I told the electors 
of Prince George-Bulkley Valley that in the term of office of the 
Liberal government, according to the Liberals' red book and using 
their very own figures, the national debt would increase by $100 
billion and the interest payment on that debt would increase by $10 
billion. Many people said it could not be true because the Liberals 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="269"> 269 </A></B>
<P>
said they were going to get the  economy in shape. I told them to 
get a calculator and do a little figuring.
<P>
	This government has made what I say come true in spades. I can 
go back to the people in my riding and tell them that we are only a 
little under three years into this Parliament and already we are up to 
$70 billion.
<P>
	The Liberals have raised taxes. Here is a government that agreed 
with Canadians before the election that taxes were too high. They 
listened to Canadians. They heard the cries of the Canadian middle 
class worker who is paying most of the bills in this country. They 
heard the cries about the high taxes and they said they were going 
to do something about it. They did. Since the government has taken 
office, it has raised taxes by $11.4 billion and unemployment 
hovers around 10 per cent.
<P>
	The Tories brought in the much hated GST. Go back in Hansard 
and there are volumes of what the Liberals said about the GST. 
Many members in this House spoke most eloquently about this 
disgusting extra tax that the Tories were bringing in.
<P>
	During the pre-election campaign the Liberals were saying: ``We 
are going to abolish the GST. We are going to scrap it. We are going 
to do away with it. We are going to send it to that happy hunting tax 
heaven in the sky''. However, when the Liberals got to writing that 
down, when they got to having to put it down on paper and in a red 
book, all of a sudden the words abolish, scrap, do away with, end, 
cease, desist got magically replaced by the word replaced. They 
were going to replace it. They used the word harmonize. They used 
words that meant something totally different from scrap, abolish.
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister said in her election promises that if 
the government did not get rid of the GST in the first year of its 
term in office, she was going to resign. Reformers and many 
Canadians are still waiting and she is still very much here in the 
human form. We wonder if they do not understand the words, 
abolish, scrap and do away with. Obviously they cannot understand 
the word resign.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	The best the Liberals have come up with is the word 
harmonization. They are going to take that tax and put into some 
other tax. But a tax is a tax is a tax. It does not matter what it is 
called or where it is put. As long as the Canadian people still have 
to pay it, it is still a tax. Replacing it or harmonizing it or changing 
the name really does not accomplish anything. It certainly does not 
give any credibility to the words the Liberals spoke: abolish, do 
away with or scrap.
<P>
	The first throne speech also talked about the need to bring down 
interprovincial trade barriers, something Reformers have been 
talking about for years. Interprovincial trade barriers cost 
Canadians about $5 billion within our country.
<P>
	The 1982 Constitution mentions having a process to do away 
with interprovincial trade barriers. That is 14 years ago. The 
Liberals wrote the Constitution and they have spent some time in 
government since they wrote it.
<P>
	We have a party here that says one thing and does another. It is a 
typical Liberal government that sits on the fence and is afraid to 
make any firm commitments that can be counted on by Canadians.
<P>
	Again I remind the House of the words of the member for 
Kingston and the Islands in 1991 when he said: ``It is still morally 
wicked of the government to proceed with this motion and then to 
apply closure to the motion and thereby curtail debate on it''. 
Profound words then. But this is now. When the Liberals resort to 
these kinds of tactics somehow it is no longer morally wicked.
<P>
	In conclusion, I believe that Canadians are getting tired of this 
hypocrisy. They want a government that not only promises to 
govern with integrity but does govern with integrity. They want a 
government that not only makes promises but keeps them. They 
want a government that not only talks about democracy but also 
practices it.
<P>
	The member for Kingston and the Islands said in 1991 of the 
Tory government: ``I must say that I am getting rather tired of 
having to deal with closure and its effects and the way that this 
government mistreats the precedents and the practices of this 
House''. With the government's behaviour would anyone expect 
Reformers to say anything less?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
interesting when you come to this Chamber that there are many 
references one can make for speech content. Probably one of the 
most profound orators, certainly he waxed eloquent as Captain 
Canada, was none other than the the Hon. Brian Tobin in this 
Chamber on May 29, 1991. The only thing I am changing here is 
the reference to the Conservative Party because Liberal-Tory, same 
old story. I am just going to be putting in the words Liberal Party 
instead of Conservative Party.
<P>
	Here goes the speech. And what does this government do? Does 
it attempt to lay bare before the people of Canada its agenda? Does 
it attempt to persuade the people of Canada and the elected 
representatives of the people of Canada of the value of its agenda? 
Does it say that it has a vision for Canada such as a profound belief 
in our vision for Canada that we are prepared to debate it and 
defend it? No. It uses the tyranny of the majority. It uses the 
temporary trust given to this party as a consequence of an election 
two and a half years ago to bulldoze its legislative measures 
through the Parliament of Canada, to deny the people of Canada a 
chance to be heard, to deny the elected representatives of the 
people of Canada not an opportunity to speak, but their obligation 
to speak, their responsibility to be heard in the proper examination 
of bills.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="270"> 270 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1835 )</B>
<P>
	We may as well be blunt in this Chamber. What do we have? We 
have in Canada today the worst possible combination of 
governmental systems. We have a Prime Minister who wants a 
presidential system, a Prime Minister who wants to rule with 
absolute power and assumes that the members of the Liberal Party 
are automatically supporters of every government measure, a 
Prime Minister who takes for granted that the members of the 
Liberal Party will support any and every government measure, a 
Prime Minister who sees not a government with all it entails, but 
sees purely a majority, a Prime Minister who has hauled off the 
velvet glove and exposed the brutal fist of a party with a majority in 
a parliamentary system who wants to behave in a presidential 
fashion.
<P>
	How prophetic are those words. Here we are repeating them only 
five years later. They were spoken by that great orator of this 
Chamber, the Hon. Brian Tobin, about the then most hated Prime 
Minister of his day, Brian Mulroney. I ask the members in the 
House, what is the difference or indeed is there any difference 
between the actions of the Liberals and this Prime Minister and the 
actions of the Conservatives and their Prime Minister?
<P>
	It is absolutely astounding to me that the member for Kingston 
and the Islands can laugh in the face of the member for Prince 
George-Bulkley Valley saying: ``Let us hear those words some 
more'', when he was railing against the government of the day. He 
is sitting in his chair laughing. The Deputy Prime Minister, the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage, laughs every time she is reminded 
that she said that she would resign if the GST was not replaced, not 
harmonized, but the word she used was abolished. When we bring 
up the word abolished she sits there and laughs.
<P>
	I suggest that the government has shown absolute and total 
contempt for the people of Canada in the way it has conducted the 
affairs on this, the very first motion of the second session of 
Parliament. Liberal members have shown absolute contempt. 
When they were on this side they made speech after speech 
condemning the former government. Now they turn around and 
walk away from what they said. Is there any wonder that the people 
of Canada are so cynical about somebody who would call himself 
or herself a politician?
<P>
	What about the person who carries out the will of the Prime 
Minister in this House? What about the whip of the Liberal Party? 
His words on May 28, 1991: ``Finally, if this precedent is allowed 
to proceed then what is next? I ask the question rhetorically. If one 
can resuscitate five bills with this motion or four bills, what stops 
one from resuscitating all legislation from the past? That is a good 
question. Why do we not just get everything back together and the 
things we like we will just resuscitate it''.
<P>
	He raises a very logical point. He says, carrying it to the next 
level: ``What stops us from adopting a motion today deeming that
<P>
all bills have reached third reading? What stops us from 
resuscitating a bill from 1977 saying that a particular bill has now 
reached third reading and we are going to vote on it right now? As a 
matter of fact, we could actually pass a motion stating that it has 
completed third reading and debate.
<P>
	``What we are in fact doing is amending completely the rules of 
the House by adopting this motion were we to do so. Or were this 
motion to be ruled in order, the implications of ruling this motion 
in order would be such that I fear we would render, if a government 
wanted to, and I am not saying it does, this House of Commons 
totally irrelevant and redundant''.
<P>
	What prophetic words. The whip of the Liberals when he stood 
in this House said that if the Speaker of that Parliament ruled the 
motion to be in order that it would make the House of Commons 
totally irrelevant and redundant. How prophetic because he in fact, 
as a result of the former Speaker making that ruling, has done 
exactly that.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	This government whip has made the House irrelevant and 
redundant. We would simply deem everything and anything to have 
been passed, to have been at third reading or to have been at any 
stage if for any reason the government did not want to proceed with 
other stages of the bill.
<P>
	It is very frustrating. It is exceptionally frustrating. It is 
frustrating not only because of the heavy handed approach of the 
Liberals, not only because of their gross arrogance. We expect that 
of them. What is frustrating is for them to have sat on this side of 
the House and to have said these words and then to move to that 
side of the House for us to have a stack of things they have been 
talking about, and what have they done? They have laughed all day 
long at their words being thrown back at them.
<P>
	This is a very sad way to start the second session of the 35th 
Parliament of Canada. We can only hope the people of Canada will 
not only pay attention but will talk to each other and say it really is 
Liberal-Tory, same old story. It really is government as usual. It 
really is politicians taking us for granted. It really is the 
government running a four-year dictatorship.
<P>
	When the people of Canada start to realize this is what is 
happening in the House of Commons, these people will feel even 
more heat back in their constituencies when they go home.
<P>
	I guess we will find out what the legislation will be between now 
and June. They assume all of their trained seals will stand up and 
bark at the appropriate time, the legislation will go through, and 
there you go. It is a very  sad realization that in Canada this 
Chamber has stooped to this level.
