<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SMALLBUSINESSLOANSACT">SMALL BUSINESS LOANS ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration from October 26, 1995, of the 
motion that Bill C-99, an act to amend the Small Business Loans 
Act, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is an honour and a privilege for me, as the member for 
London-Middlesex, to address the House of Commons this 
morning on a very important subject, Bill C-99.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am very pleased to speak on Bill C-99 this morning as the 
member for London-Middlesex. We like to think that London is 
the unofficial capital of southwestern Ontario. Our business 
community is quite diverse, with small business being an important 
part of it.
<P>
	With Your Honour's indulgence, I must confess that as you 
called for a moment of silence this morning my thoughts then and 
even now are with people from all across Canada and many people 
from the London area. I know my staff worked very hard to 
organize 11 buses from London and area. They are on their way to 
la belle province of Quebec to tell the people there how much we 
understand that they face a very crucial decision and that our 
prayers and our hopes are that they will remain a part of Canada.
<P>
	It is with some mixed thoughts that I stand this morning to speak 
on the subject of Bill C-99 when frankly I would like to be with 
friends and fellow Canadians from all parts of Canada who are on 
their way to Quebec to make it clear to our fellow Canadians in 
Quebec that we sincerely hope they will continue the partnership 
and the great country we have built together. I did not feel that I 
could launch into debate on Bill C-99 without sharing a few 
personal thoughts.
<P>
	Bill C-99 is very important. It continues the process of 
modernization and improvement that has moved the Small 
Business Loans Act program to a full cost recovery. We could ask 
ourselves what is so important about the bill since we deal with so 
much legislation in the House and most of it, if not all of it, is 
important and significant. I believe it is particularly important 
given that we are discussing it at the end of 1995 and as 
parliamentarians we face the enormous challenge of trying to help 
the country prepare for the 21st century. As I have already said, we 
certainly hope it will be a united country that heads into the 21st 
century with all members of the family intact.
<P>
	We obviously need an economic recovery. We have made some 
steps in the right direction toward it over the past couple of years. 
Quite candidly, we have had some backward steps in that regard. It 
has not been a steady progression forward as we would all like. It 
has been a two steps forward one step back process. However we 
must continue and we must persist in an economic recovery as we 
prepare the nation for the 21st century.
<P>
	There is no area of greater importance in my mind as a Canadian 
and as a member of Parliament than the area of small business. In 
times past we would lure a large employer to a community who 
would create 1,000 jobs. It seems appropriate to use a baseball 
analogy with the World Series going on. We used to look for the 
grand slam home run in economic terms in wanting a major 
employer. I have several in my riding such as General Motors 
Diesel and 3M, to name two.
<P>
	The days are gone of attracting major employers to our cities, 
except for rare circumstances. We will not see situations in which 
we instantly gain 500, 1,000 or more jobs. It seems evident that our 
number one crisis is the job crisis. The debt and deficit are very 
crucial. My colleagues opposite certainly know that, as they speak 
to it all of the time. While we may differ on the pace of the deficit 
reduction as part of economic recovery, I do not think we differ on 
the goal.
<P>
	In spite of the importance of the debt and deficit, the number one 
crisis in the country we all love is the inadequate number of jobs. 
The best way to solve that crisis is through encouraging small 
business. It will be through new small businesses starting up and 
employing three, five, ten or twenty Canadians that we will create 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15910"> 15910 </A></B>
<P>
new employment. We would love to see the large  corporations 
coming in and suddenly creating 1,000 jobs, but I do not think we 
will see that happen too often.
<P>
	The evidence is clear that Canadians can succeed in small 
businesses but they need help. That is what the act is specifically 
designed to do. In my riding many women, for example, have 
shown great entrepreneurial spirit, have launched small businesses, 
have been successful in that regard and have employed three to five 
people who before were unemployed.
<P>
	There is a fairly significant immigrant population in my riding. 
There are many Arab Canadians and a large Polish Canadian 
community, people from all parts of the world. I see evidence time 
and again of how immigrant Canadians come to Canada and 
successfully launch new businesses. Despite the xenophobia 
Canadians are from time to time perhaps prone to engage in, I can 
give many examples where new Canadians have come to Canada, 
started businesses and employed three to five Canadians who were 
born here in their quite successful businesses. The evidence is there 
that small business will really be key to economic recovery and to 
solving the jobs crisis in Canada. That is not totally new but it is 
much more obvious to us now that it will be the case.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	Since 1961 more than 400,000 SBLA loans totalling close to $16 
billion have been made by financial institutions to small 
businesses. The SBLA helps entrepreneurs whose firms have less 
than $5 million in annual sales.
<P>
	I should like to speak about that number for a moment. Within 
my party there has been considerable discussion about this subject. 
None of the businesses that I referred to earlier do $5 million in 
annual sales. Some small businesses of three, four, five or ten 
employees do not do $5 million a year in business. We might have 
to look at that number as we fine tune. What is a small business? 
Does it need sales of up to $4.5 million to $5 million to be 
considered a small business? I think not. We should have a look at 
that definition.
<P>
	The program success both as an economic development tool and 
as an example of public and private sector co-operation has 
inspired similar guaranteed programs at both the federal and 
provincial levels. The program will engender new approaches to 
encourage small business in Canada. That will be one of its most 
important purposes.
<P>
	I will share with my colleagues in the House today-we are not 
as numerous as normal because many of our colleagues are on their 
way to or already in Montreal to make their feelings known about 
Canada-that the city of London has two important initiatives in 
the area of small business worth mentioning. The first is the 
advanced manufacturing technology centre that we hope will soon 
come to fruition. The groundwork has been laid. It is our 
government that announced it. It looks like we might  have to scale 
it back somewhat because of the economic times we face.
<P>
	However, at the research park at the University of Western 
Ontario in the city of London we are awaiting very anxiously, along 
with municipal and provincial government officials, the 
completion of the advance manufacturing technology centre. It will 
be located in an existing research park and will be a very important 
part of helping to encourage innovative technologies and business 
opportunities as it combines with research opportunities available 
at the university right now.
<P>
	There has been quite a bit of time spent on the project. It will 
come to fruition soon and is anxiously awaited in London. I have 
been very pleased to spend quite a bit of time working on the 
project along with my colleagues in London. It will be a big benefit 
not only to London, Ontario, but to the whole region of 
southwestern Ontario.
<P>
	In southwestern Ontario the agri-food industry is a major 
industry. We ought not to forget there are many opportunities in 
urban centres and in the agri-food industry for small business. The 
centre is awaited with anticipation.
<P>
	The second successful venture that has been under way for 
several years in the riding of London-Middlesex is a small 
business centre just inside the eastern part of the city of London. It 
is a converted plant that closed some years ago. It was formerly 
called Prototool. I remember it well, being that it was my first 
summer job. I was there recently for a ribbon cutting ceremony 
because they had refurbished and expanded the centre. I made the 
point that every time I went there, as much as I enjoyed it, it 
seemed as if I was going back to work. In sense I was that day.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	The small business centre is located in the George Stewart 
building which was named in honour of a well known Londoner 
who has poured many, many years into the facility. It is a business 
incubation centre. The centre helps those people who are starting 
up a business with one or two employees. These people need 
mentors. They certainly need start-up capital. They need the help 
which is available to them largely through the voluntary efforts of 
London's successful business people who are now mostly retired 
and are willing to help younger people launch small businesses. 
The small business centre in my riding of London-Middlesex has 
been very successful. It is an example of the type of program the 
SBLA meshes with very nicely.
<P>
	I look forward to the visit of the industry minister to this centre 
in November. He will see firsthand the success we can have with 
this kind of program. It is an excellent example of why our 
government must continue to consider small business as a key part 
in our attempt to get the economy moving again.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15911"> 15911 </A></B>
<P>
	In recent years the SBLA program had been running at an 
annual government cost of some $20 million to $30 million. 
Significant changes were made in April 1993. There was a major 
increase in activity from some $500 million to over $4 billion in 
1994-95. In historical loss rates, this increase in lending was 
projected to cost over $100 million which was obviously a threat 
to the program in these economic times.
<P>
	It is a very correct change to the program and a wise move by our 
government to move to full cost recovery on this program. We 
might say it is a bit of a user pay concept, which I think we are 
seeing more of at all government levels. My previous government 
experience was at the municipal level in London, Ontario for 13 
years. There is certainly a call for more of a user pay concept at all 
government levels.
<P>
	I would never subscribe to the user pay concept for things like 
health care. Certainly we on this side of the House would not 
subscribe to the user pay concept in health care and in certain other 
fundamental core services which as Liberals we believe must be 
available to all Canadians regardless of their ability to pay. There is 
however a place for the user pay concept in our society.
<P>
	Moving the SBLA program to full cost recovery is employing 
that concept. I applaud the effort of the government in that move. 
To this end, the government initiated a review of the program 
which included extensive consultations with major stakeholders 
representing both borrowers and lenders. Likewise we heard from 
the Standing Committee on Industry and the small business 
working committee. All of these groups were unanimous in 
recommending to the government that we proceed on a full cost 
recovery basis which is exactly how the government has 
responded.
<P>
	Two major changes have been made through regulatory 
amendments which came into effect on April 1. First, a new 1.25 
per cent annual fee was levied on each lender's average outstanding 
balance of SBLA loans made after March 31, 1995. Second, the 
maximum rate a lender can charge under the SBLA has been 
increased by 1.25 per cent to the prime interest rate plus 3 per cent 
for floating rate loans and to the residential mortgage rate plus 3 
per cent for fixed rate loans.
<P>
	Bill C-99 will continue the process of renewal by putting in place 
additional changes to the Small Business Loans Act. As I said at 
the start of my remarks, if we are to make a serious attempt at 
solving the job crisis and getting the economy moving again on a 
steady basis, we will have to focus our efforts on small business.
<P>
<B>(1020 )</B>
<P>
	I applaud the government for the changes in the bill. It clearly 
indicates the intention of our government. That is what I am 
hearing from Canadians. In all parts of Canada people are speaking 
out with that kind of message. Certainly in my riding of 
London-Middlesex  new business opportunities and job creation 
are happening in the smaller micro-firms with one to four 
employees. The government is moving in the right direction.
<P>
	We need to consider what is a small business. Five million 
dollars strikes a lot of people whom I know in business as a pretty 
big number to achieve. They would be thrilled with that, but they 
do something like $750,000 or $1 million worth of business each 
year. We have to continue to look at that number to determine 
exactly what constitutes a small business.
<P>
	I want to say very clearly that this bill is a major step in the right 
direction. I am pleased as a member of the government to be part of 
the team which recognizes that we have to make this a priority.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to start by 
thanking the hon. member for London-Middlesex for expressing 
these thoughts inspired by our prayers this morning. I share them. I 
think the people of Quebec are focused on this crucial moment in 
their lives and accept the mark of affection shown by anglophones 
today.
<P>
	We are sure that this demonstration of affection, friendship and 
even love, as some were saying, will last more than one day. Indeed 
we are confident that this demonstration of love and friendship will 
last for more than one weekend and that the best way to ensure that 
it does is to accept and respect the decision of the people of Quebec 
and thus transform these marks of friendship into acceptance of a 
rewarding and effective partnership between our two nations.
<P>
	As far as the bill is concerned, I must deplore one thing. It is true 
that the bill raised the maximum for small and medium size 
businesses. However, one of the main problems for job creation, 
especially in Quebec, is the fact that very small businesses do not 
have access to these loans because the criteria have become more 
restrictive.
<P>
	We must not forget that nearly 90 per cent of all new jobs, 
according to the figures for Quebec, are created by very small and 
medium size businesses. They should be helped. These are not 
businesses that require start up capital in excess of $250,000, 
$500,000 or one million dollars.
<P>
	Last month, I witnessed the birth of thirty or so very small 
businesses in my riding, started by people who were on 
unemployment insurance, people who had decided to take the 
initiative and create their own jobs, set up their own business. In 
the process, they created some forty new jobs, and they were able 
to get started thanks to loans which, in most cases, did not exceed 
$10,000.
<P>
	In other words, what we need to help these small businesses is 
not a higher maximum. There was nothing wrong with the 
maximum. The problem is a lack of more  flexible criteria that 
would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15912"> 15912 </A></B>
<P>
give these very small businesses access to more readily available 
venture capital.
<P>
	I do not think the bill makes any provision for this, although in 
some respects it is well intentioned. I think the bill will not do 
anything to promote very small businesses. I would appreciate the 
hon. member's comments.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
comments.
<P>
	He addressed my remarks about the outpouring of affection-I 
think that is the right word-and concern of other Canadians that 
Quebec remain part of the Canadian family. He spoke about his 
wish that this would continue. I fully support that. I fully and 
completely support that as a francophone who for most of my life 
has understood and appreciated the importance of Quebec in this 
country.
<P>
	Every chance I get I emphasize to people in my riding that we 
need to make clear that we understand and realize the importance 
of Quebec in this country. I can assure the hon. member that if the 
vote is a no vote, as I hope it will be, I will continue to say that after 
Monday. I applaud that sentiment.
<P>
	I disagree with the hon. member when he spoke about the need to 
forge a new partnership. I simply ask him and all Quebecers to 
reflect on the fact that we have had a successful partnership in 
Canada for a long time. Yes, we have had our problems. We have 
had our quarrels as families will, but we have been able to work 
through them. We have worked them out. It was not lightly or 
easily that Canada was recognized as the best country in the world 
in which to live.
<P>
	I ask him and all Quebecers, as the Prime Minister has done 
much better than I can do, to reflect very carefully on the fact that 
together we have built the best country in the world. It would be a 
tremendous risk and gamble to vote to break up our family. I 
sincerely hope Quebecers will not do that when they vote on 
Monday.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the member for 
London-Middlesex speaking on Bill C-99, an act to amend the 
Small Business Loans Act.
<P>
	I conducted a survey of my constituents. In my householder I 
asked questions about increases in government spending. There 
were some increases in the area of regional development loans, 
particularly western diversification which affects my part of the 
country and also FORD-Q and ACOA.
<P>
	People in my riding were very opposed to these loans being 
offered to regions outside of our area of the country. Even on loans 
granted through western  diversification which affected them, there 
was about a 50-50 division on whether it was the right procedure.
<P>
	I would like the member to comment on the problems loans 
based on regional development are causing in the country and 
perhaps some of the divisions we are dealing with in the 
referendum campaign which perhaps have been caused by the 
regional development approach. Maybe the better route would be 
to put more of our eggs into this type of basket, a national program. 
This would affect small business right across the country on the 
same basis with the same rules rather than dividing the dollars into 
regional development programs, often loans, particularly to 
Atlantic Canada through ACOA or to western Canada through 
WED.
<P>
	Those programs are causing hard feelings. Western Canada has 
looked at ACOA and said it has not worked. We have been 
pumping regional development dollars either through grants or 
loans into Atlantic Canada and unemployment is rising in Atlantic 
Canada. We have been pumping dollars for regional development 
into Quebec and some Quebecers want to separate. We are hoping 
less than 50 per cent want to separate, but it is not creating national 
unity by putting dollars through grants or loans into regional 
development.
<P>
	Would it not be better to put money into loan guarantees for 
small business on national programs? It might make us feel as if we 
are all playing on a level playing field rather than making people 
angry by dumping some money into western Canada, some into 
Atlantic Canada, some into Quebec and some into the north.
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague's 
questions and comments on this program. I do not think he used the 
phrase but I think he is questioning the efficacy of the whole 
concept of regional economic expansion.
<P>
	I come from southwestern Ontario, which is a rather successful 
part of Canada when we look at the full nation, although we 
certainly have some problems to solve such as unemployment. We 
are doing our best in that regard.
<P>
<B>(1030 )</B>
<P>
	My colleague opposite comes from the province of 
Saskatchewan and he understands that his part of Canada is quite 
successful. However there are some problem as well.
<P>
	The question my colleague puts is an either/or. Should we put all 
of our attention on to the small business loans approach or should 
we continue with the concept of sharing economically through a 
regional economic sharing of resources? Frankly, as a Canadian I 
reject the choice. I do not think it is an either/or. The answer to my 
colleague is that we should do both. I believe there is a place for 
both.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15913"> 15913 </A></B>
<P>
	The people I represent by and large understand and appreciate 
that they are economically in an advantaged part of Canada. They 
are quite prepared and magnanimous enough to share with other 
Canadians as part of the price to pay to have a nation from coast 
to coast.
<P>
	I will be candid and say that we had a little dispute recently about 
the idea of some workers coming from Cape Breton. The question 
was never where the people came from. We have thousands of 
Atlantic Canadians and Canadians from all other provinces living 
and contributing to the community. The only question was to what 
degree the trip would be subsidized.
<P>
	As far as the concept of sharing and being open to Canadians to 
come to our city or sharing our resources with people from coast to 
coast, the people I represent endorse that. They see it as an 
important part of being a Canadian. It is a small price to pay to be 
part of the great nation we all live in.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> That concludes the portion of the debate of 
20-minute speeches and 10 minutes of questions and answers. 
What we are going into now-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	From now on, those wishing to speak will have ten minutes, but 
there will be no questions and comments.
<P>
	Resuming debate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to rise today to support Bill C-99, an act to amend 
the Small Business Loans Act. This legislation is just part of the 
whole Liberal approach to government.
<P>
	Members may recall the current Liberal government was elected 
on a jobs and growth agenda as promised in the red book. Two 
years ago the government was given a mandate to revitalize 
Canada's economy. All Canadians, including the people of Quebec, 
are benefiting from these promises.
<P>
	Our economy is still recovering from one of the worst recessions 
in our history. The recession was not only just a slowdown of our 
economy but a massive reorganization of how our economy 
operates. It has been a painful journey.
<P>
	The previous government led us down this debt ridden path but 
we are getting Canada turned around and moving back toward 
prosperity. The Liberal government through its jobs and growth 
agenda is creating an economic atmosphere conducive to job 
creation. Over the last two years we have created approximately 
half a million full time jobs.
<P>
	The main pillar of our approach is to reduce the deficit. By 
reducing the deficit the government will break the crutches that are 
slowing down our economy. The  federal government, as we all 
know, is under tremendous financial strain. Some people criticize 
our cuts, they are not enough or they are too much. But the 
government is committed to a balanced and a realistic approach. In 
contrast, the third party proposes devastation through its plan to 
eliminate the deficit in three years. I am no economist but I know 
that such a plan is much too severe and would do more harm than 
good.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	Our deficit reduction plan is based on credible analysis of our 
situation. We have instituted short term goals that have been 
reached. We are on the track to achieving this year's target of $32.7 
billion. In next year's budget we will reach our election promise of 
a budget deficit of only 3 per cent of GDP.
<P>
	It will not stop there. We will continue to set short term goals and 
before the end of the century we will see the light at the end of the 
tunnel.
<P>
	The proposed amendments to the Small Business Loans Act 
follow our plan. Some may ask how. We did not call our red book 
``Creating Opportunity'' for nothing. These amendments will 
create more opportunities for small and medium size businesses to 
access the capital they need.
<P>
	More entrepreneurs will obtain loans to make their business 
dreams become a reality. Through these new private sector 
initiatives, made possible by the Small Business Loans Act and the 
proposed amendments in Bill C-99, new jobs will continue to be 
created.
<P>
	As some of my colleagues have already pointed out, the Small 
Business Loans Act is not new. However, earlier this year we made 
regulatory changes to the act in order to make it more effective and 
accountable. Only those who truly need our assistance will receive 
it.
<P>
	The fee structure introduced in April of this year serves to 
encourage those applicants who are more financially secure to seek 
capital loans directly from financial institutions without the federal 
guarantee. It will also provide an incentive for borrowers to down 
the road seek normal commercial financing as soon as possible.
<P>
	This is consistent with the many other policies we have 
introduced. Our government believes that it must carefully review 
all government activities, to recognize areas where we can achieve 
our objectives more effectively.
<P>
	We conducted one of the most, if not the most, extensive 
program reviews by any federal government. This is one of those 
areas and we have made some necessary changes. Due to the 
competitive environment of the financial sector, we believe that the 
new fee structure, whereby the administration fee is incorporated in 
the interest rate, will improve the effectiveness of the program.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15914"> 15914 </A></B>
<P>
	A further step has been taken by the amendments contained in 
Bill C-99. We have already made the program more effective and 
accountable on the user side of it, but now our side must be 
streamlined. Bill C-99 addresses that matter. With the 
implementation of this bill, the program will be a full cost 
recovery program. As I mentioned earlier, we are reducing our 
deficit. It is through changes like these that allow us to reach our 
deficit targets.
<P>
	We will also be improving the loan guarantee coverage for low 
volume lenders. This is an important aspect that should not be 
overlooked. Better coverage for the smaller lenders will strengthen 
our financial sector. These financial institutions may be small, but 
collectively they count for a significant portion of the loans 
administered by this program.
<P>
	Previously these lenders in relative terms were vulnerable to a 
greater proportion of losses. Due to the existing regulations, these 
institutions were limited in the amount of losses that could be 
claimed to the federal government. The new provisions create a 
more equitable arrangement for these small lenders.
<P>
	On Tuesday I heard some members from across the floor state 
that this bill violates the democratic process. On the contrary, 
extensive consultations were held to get the views of all sides of the 
issues. We reviewed the report of the Standing Committee on 
Industry. What more do they want? We listened to the Canadian 
Federation of Independent Business. We listened to the Canadian 
Chamber of Commerce. We listened to the Canadian Bankers 
Association, to name a few. Through those consultations we 
obtained substantial support for proposed changes.
<P>
	Furthermore, some of the provisions of this bill were a direct 
result of the report from the industry committee. On going back to 
the red book, we promised to regain the confidence of Canadians. 
We want Canadians to be able to believe in the political process.
<P>
	Over the last two years we have been reintroducing integrity into 
the political process. Again, someone might ask how. It is by 
holding consultations with Canadians, by listening to Canadians, 
which is more than I can say for official opposition members. They 
are so busy listening to themselves that they cannot hear 
Canadians, including Quebecers, telling them they want Quebec to 
stay in Canada.
<P>
	The Small Business Loans Act plays an important role in my 
province of Prince Edward Island. In the previous fiscal year loans 
under this program totalled $21.8 million. This is a substantial 
amount of money for a small province. Our economy is seasonal by 
nature. Any initiatives to create business operations that can 
counter the seasonal aspect of our economy are very welcome. 
Small firms wanting to expand can do so with financing under this 
program. Entrepreneurs with dreams of  owning a successful 
business are given a chance under this program.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	Our economy has an abundance of small and medium size firms. 
The Liberal government acknowledges this reality and knows how 
to address the concerns of Atlantic Canadians. When it comes to 
small business, a loans program is not the only solution. This is just 
part of a larger package. We have refocused our regional 
development programs on small businesses, in particular I am 
referring to the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency. ACOA has 
been instrumental in assisting small businesses in Atlantic Canada 
and it has done so through many varied ways.
<P>
	I would like to point out a few recent activities of ACOA. Just 
last week ACOA hosted a delegation of trade representatives from 
the Russian federation. The delegates were here to pursue joint 
ventures between Russian and Atlantic Canadian firms. Among the 
topics discussed were geomatics, aquaculture, agriculture products 
and current trade activities in other sectors.
<P>
	This is an important step for business in Atlantic Canada. We are 
becoming more aggressive in pursuing world markets and the 
Russian federation, although poor economically in many standards, 
is open for investment opportunities.
<P>
	In September the Atlantic Canada Home Program was held in 
Halifax. The program was designed to take advantage of 
opportunities created by the deregulation of building standards in 
Japan which permits a wider range of home construction. Prince 
Edward Island was represented there by the provincial minister of 
economic development and tourism.
<P>
	Canada is always searching for new markets to access 
throughout the world. Our economy is geared toward exports. Our 
relations within the global economy are what is helping to drive the 
Canadian economy.
<P>
	The government is working with the private sector and the 
provincial governments to open up new markets abroad, to ensure 
that Canadian firms have access to markets they need to grow and 
create more jobs. We need to do all we can to assist in that aspect 
and Bill C-99 in part does just that. We are improving a federal 
program so that it can adjust to current demands and be more 
flexible to meet our future demands.
<P>
	Last week, on the eve of small business week, the Association of 
Atlantic Women Business Owners hosted a conference, trade show 
and an Atlantic Hall of Fame for Women Entrepreneurs, a 
ceremony sponsored in part by ACOA. The theme of the 
conference was ``New Markets and Opportunities for Growth''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15915"> 15915 </A></B>
<P>
	To me that sounds a lot like our jobs and growth agenda. Is it 
not funny how our approach is similar to private enterprise? I 
believe that would suggest that we are going about our business 
in the correct fashion.
<P>
	Earlier in the fall also in Halifax key stakeholders in the Atlantic 
Canada economy discussed the business support system for young 
entrepreneurs. This was hosted again by ACOA. It was designed to 
highlight the needs and challenges facing our young entrepreneurs 
and establish services to meet those needs as well as to encourage 
young people interested in starting their own businesses. These 
young people are the future of the country.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I thank you for allowing me the time to speak in 
support of this bill because I believe it will give to the small 
business community the impetus it needs to get up and get going.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is an 
honour for me to speak on Bill C-99, an act to amend the Small 
Business Loans Act.
<P>
	Along with my colleague from London-Middlesex this 
morning, I extend my thoughts to those people who have travelled 
from our various communities today to the heartland of Quebec, to 
Montreal. Our thoughts are with these people. We all share the 
same common sentiment that we want to have Quebec remain a 
part of us and share the business climate we have in this country 
come Monday of next week.
<P>
	As the member of Parliament for Huron-Bruce, representing a 
small yet mostly rural riding, I do not have large municipalities. I 
do not have large urban centres. The largest community in my 
constituency is the town of Goderich which has 8,000 people. In 
Goderich there are two main plants, which employ 900 people: 
Champion Road Machinery, a manufacturer of road graders and 
other roadbuilding equipment, and Sifto Salt Mines, which 
produces the third largest quantity of salt in North America.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	As a rural constituency, the businesses we have are largely small 
in nature. Many of the businesses are agri-related. When I was 
elected to be the member of Parliament for Huron-Bruce, I 
believed, as do all members of the House, that we were elected to 
create a climate of employment in Canada. We spoke about jobs 
and growth. This bill goes a long way in helping us to achieve those 
goals.
<P>
	How do we create jobs? Government cannot by itself create jobs. 
Government jobs are largely jobs that do not contribute to the GDP 
of our country. While government cannot create jobs, government 
can certainly create an environment in which business can grow 
and prosper. The importance of Bill C-99 is that it becomes another 
avenue for small business to access capital and operating moneys.
<P>
	As I said earlier, I represent a small rural constituency. We have 
many resources in our riding. Most of them are rural agricultural 
resources: wheat, hogs, beef and all the other commodities we 
grow so well in Huron-Bruce. The riding produces more dollar 
value in agricultural products than any riding east of Winnipeg. I 
therefore speak with a great deal of pride as I speak about my riding 
this morning.
<P>
	The greatest resources in any riding are the youth of our 
communities. When we closely examine the resource of youth we 
find that many of these young people upon completion of their 
secondary education move on to other communities. For the most 
part they leave to further their education and then go on to careers 
often in large urban centres simply because job opportunities are 
not as plentiful today as perhaps they were a decade ago, certainly 
not in small communities.
<P>
	Some of these youth are now returning to their communities of 
origin simply because jobs in the urban centres are not as plentiful 
as they once were. The young people are returning to their 
communities, in some cases to enter into a partnership with a 
family business or to enter into a partnership with an established 
business. In some cases they are coming home to seek the future 
they have dreamed of, a career of choice based on and related to the 
training and educational background they have achieved.
<P>
	This is where the banks and the lending institutions become 
involved. Allow me to give a personal example. About eight years 
ago our two sons had a dream. Upon completing their secondary 
education they wanted to pursue a business career. One of the first 
things they had to do was find the capital required to begin a 
business. That was the first experience. Of course they had to visit 
the bankers. They found that the bankers were not all in agreement 
with their dream. In many cases they were turned away. However, 
there was one banker who, because of his appreciation for young 
people, sensed that there might be merit in the dream and that it 
might go somewhere. He invited them in. He asked their father to 
sign a few papers and these two young men began a business.
<P>
	It has been eight years since they began the business. They have 
realized their dream. The dream will continue. It was only six 
months after they had begun the business that they asked the banker 
to remove their father's name from the papers. People are realizing 
their dreams in the country. This is an example of what can happen 
when we take those dreams to the ultimate end. Now that they have 
established their business it is the bankers who are knocking on 
their door to see if they can lend them a bit of money.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	My point is that the risk in doing anything is always great but I 
believe we have to take some of these risks. When I chose this 
position in Parliament I accepted a  risk. I was walking away from a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15916"> 15916 </A></B>
<P>
business that had given me 21 years of fruitful employment. My 
background in small business and in the agricultural sector gave me 
an appreciation for and insight into the borrowing needs of small 
business.
<P>
	Early in my new career as a member of Parliament I quickly 
became aware of the inability of entrepreneurs to gain access to 
business capital. If there has been one area of frustration in my 
career as a politician it has been that of my being unable to resolve 
the matter of banks and small business.
<P>
	A few months ago Bluewater Fibre Inc., with 150 employees in 
the northern part of my riding, found itself in the very untenable 
position of risking closure of its plant if a resolution of a border tax 
was not found. To the credit of the Minister of Finance's 
department, this issue was resolved and the jobs of 150 people were 
ensured.
<P>
	Another situation concerns Tackle Windpower, a manufacturer 
of rotor blades for windpower electricity generation, which just 
recently began manufacturing in Huron Park in the southern part of 
my riding. Before this company turned one employee hour in its 
plant it had $9.5 million in guaranteed orders for a product it was 
about to build, but it had difficulty in obtaining a $500,000 
operating loan. Through much difficulty and a great deal of effort 
on the company's part and a small effort on my part, financing was 
finally procured. This company started with two, three, four 
employees, and has now reached 28 employees and is quickly 
moving to full employment of 70.
<P>
	Stories like this go on and on. How many members here would 
have believed that so much of our time would be spent on helping 
small business achieve funding and financing?
<P>
	There are two million small businesses in Canada, and 82 per 
cent of new jobs created are created by small businesses. When one 
puts these numbers in perspective it puts a new importance on 
entrepreneurialism. If every small business would employ just one 
more person we would eliminate unemployment.
<P>
	This is an important bill for two reasons: the increase in the 
maximum size of the loan to more accurately reflect the realities of 
doing business, and the movement of the SBLA to full cost 
recovery, a measure in keeping with our promises as a government 
to maintain fiscal management policies.
<P>
	Given the extensive consultations with the major stakeholders, it 
is imperative that we seek swift passage of this bill for the benefit 
of all small businesses in Canada. I look forward to supporting this 
bill at a future time in the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for St. Boniface has the floor. 
As you know, dear colleague, you will start your address and will 
finish it after question period. Agreed?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> So, Mr. Speaker, I shall 
have two speeches.
<P>
	I am pleased to speak today on the Small Business Loans Act. I 
shall address the key principles rather than its details, which some 
of my colleagues with an in depth knowledge of this field have 
already done.
<P>
	I wish to point out that this bill is part of a total strategy for 
supporting the growth of small businesses, particularly their access 
to capital. This must be clearly understood. We wish to provide 
more help to small business so that they may grow, have greater 
access to capital and thus create additional employment. We are 
very much aware that the bulk of jobs created over the past decade 
have been in small and medium size businesses. The figures 
indicate 85 to 90 per cent. This is very impressive.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	This bill was proposed after much consultation with lenders and 
borrowers. It is not something that we just decided to impose. It is 
not something where we are just going ahead without consultation, 
without advice from all sides, because we believe that the way to 
have an excellent bill, with a better chance of success, with a better 
chance of being accepted by those targeted by it, is to ensure that 
there have been consultations. This has been done country-wide 
with the groups I have referred to.
<P>
	Another very important aspect of this bill is self-funding. Yes, 
costs will be higher, because we want it to be self-sustaining, but 
this is in keeping with two government policies. The first is to 
decrease, if you will, grants and subsidies to business. We realize 
that, in today's reality, there is less financial flexibility and that we 
must reduce the costs of government. Reducing these financial 
supports, if you will, to businesses is one way of being proactive 
and attaining that objective.
<P>
	Another objective is reduction of the deficit and the debt. Since 
this program will be self-supporting, there will be less government 
money going to businesses. This will have a positive impact on the 
deficit and the debt. I must add that the new program will provide a 
better response to businesses needing funding. This is very 
important.
<P>
	We are well aware that 30 or 40 per cent of businesses receiving 
assistance at this time can go to a bank or a caisse populaire and 
have their needs met by those institutions. So, if 30 or 40 per cent 
go elsewhere for  solutions to their financial needs, more financial 
assistance will be getting to the businesses that need it.
<P>

<P>

was a step in the right direction. This is an example of a federal 
government initiative which is country-wide, an example of what 
we can do together. I will close on this and pick up where I left off 
later on.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Thank you, dear colleague. It being 11 a.m., we 
will now proceed to statements by members.

through a project called ``Cher ami'', 5,000 children in my riding

	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday 
constitutional lawyer Peter Hogg and former deputy minister of 
justice Ian Binnie appeared before the Senate justice committee on 
the gun control bill. These two respected lawyers stated 
unequivocally that the government has not consulted with the 
aboriginal people, as required by section 35 of the Constitution. 
According to this testimony the constitutional rights of the 
aboriginal people have been abrogated by the government. Bill 
C-68 will directly affect aboriginal treaty rights and therefore they 
should have been consulted.
<P>

<P>
	Mr. Binni went on to say that Bill C-68 indicates that the 
government did not consider how the legislation would affect 
aboriginal people and called it an abdication of their responsibility.

nothing could be further from the truth.

to say to Quebecers that they want to stay together, they want to 
stay united. They are also reminding Quebecers of the seriousness 
of the vote.
<P>
	Canadians are asking Quebecers to say no to destroying our 
political union, to say no to destroying our economic union, to say 
no to destroying Canada as we know it and as it has existed for 
many years.

Canadian political leaders against being vengeful following a 
victorious yes vote in the referendum on Monday. He called on 
them to act responsibly and to negotiate with Quebecers, saying 
that millions of Quebecers want a different relationship and 
different recognition by Canada, and so serious discussions will 
have to be undertaken.
<P>
	Mr. White acknowledged that it was in Canadians' and 
Quebecers' interest to establish an economic and political 
partnership. Given the size of the stakes involved, it would 
probably not be hard to find support among business people to 
defend and promote a partnership with Quebec.

finally negotiate with their Canadian partners as one people with

	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (St. Boniface, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Parti Quebecois claims it will save $3 billion in an independent 
Quebec through the elimination of the overlap and duplication of 
the federal system.
<P>
	How does Premier Parizeau expect to achieve this objective 
when he is promising to hire the thousands of federal public 
servants living in Quebec? Premier Parizeau said in August of this 
year that an independent Quebec could not hire all the federal 
public servants working for the departments of agriculture and of 
the environment, for example, because Quebec's departments in 
these areas are already fully staffed.
<P>
	The so-called promise the Government of Quebec is making to 
hire federal public servants living in Quebec reminds me of the 
generous collective agreements the Parti Quebecois accorded 
Quebec public servants prior to the 1980 referendum. Following 
the rejection of the referendum question, the Parti Quebecois 
government then cut provincial public servants' salaries by some 
20 per cent. Federal public servants have therefore every reason to 
mistrust the Parti Quebecois promises.

<P>
	As the director general of elections in Quebec reminded us, all 
these referendum related expenses by the federal government and 
private enterprise violate Quebec's referendum act, since any 
service that promotes a referendum option constitutes a regulated 
expense. The Liberal Party of Canada and the federal government 
are supporting these illegal referendum expenses.

with Quebec should start without delay.
<P>
	Politicians in the rest of Canada should do likewise to ensure the 
stability of Canada and Quebec the day after a yes vote. Yesterday,

I think it would be appropriate for the minister to be accurate and

<P>

all the people on the yes side have always said, on every occasion, 
that they would respect the verdict of the people, the outcome of 
this democratic process.
<P>
	My question, and I would appreciate a straight answer, is this: 
Why, when it is about their side, does the Prime Minister seem 
unwilling to commit himself to respecting the democratic process, 
going so far as to say: ``If those are the results for the no side, we 
agree, but if the same figures turn up for the yes side, we do not''?

make preambles in which he says things that are inaccurate, makes 
statements that do not correspond with the facts and indulges in 
innuendo directed at those involved in the campaign, as he just did 
in my case.

will be able to continue to implement reforms in Canada.

but the minister will not get off that easily. I am entitled to three 
questions, and so for the third time I will ask him to make his 
position clear to Quebecers, to set aside his customary arrogance 
we have seen enough of and give a clear answer to Quebecers.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, who is speaking 
on behalf of the government today, explain clearly, honestly and 
frankly how the Prime Minister of Canada can say: ``Fifty per cent 
plus one for the no is fine. I can go along with that. Fifty per cent 
plus one for the yes, I am not sure''. What explanation does he have 
for an attitude that is so obviously unacceptable? I would like an 
answer.

Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, this day and the next few days are too important for us to 
waste our time  responding to invective from the opposition. Their 
attitude is not very parliamentary.
<P>
	On the fundamental issue, we have always said that we recognize 
the democratic right of Quebecers to vote in a referendum, but we 
have also clearly indicated our position and the fact that we believe 
the no side will win.
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition has indicated that if it is a no, he 
would not accept the outcome, so why does the hon. member for 
Roberval not talk to his own leader and tell him that his answer is 
not democratic because he does not accept the answer given by the 
people, while we believe our position is democratic, especially 
considering that 32 per cent of Quebecers have indicated that a yes 
vote means they very properly want the province of Quebec to 
remain a part of Canada.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleagues, I am sure that today, like all 
other days, we will always show respect in speaking to each other 
here in the House of Commons.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let us make things perfectly clear. The Leader of the 
Opposition has said that he would respect the decision of the men 
and women of Quebec, which does not prevent our continuing to 
battle for our ideals as in 1980. René Lévesque kept his word, 
which the Prime Minister of Canada did not, and once again will 
not. If the minister cannot see the difference between continuing to 
fight for one's ideals and implementing a legal decision, he has a 
big problem, and it is not from the neck down.
<P>
	The Prime Minister, who is seeing the choice of Quebecers being 
increasingly confirmed, has been quick to abandon the attitude of 
openmindedness and understanding adopted in his message to the 
nation, an attitude that is unusual for him, and has reverted to his 
true nature, menacing and vengeful toward Quebec.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
Does the Prime Minister's attitude augur well for the day after the 
referendum, when we already see him threatening not to respect the 
result, the referendum verdict, showing his true colours as a 
non-respecter of democracy, allowing the Quebec referendum act 
to be violated with impunity, non-respecter of democracy that he 
is?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I believe that history speaks for itself and that our Prime 
Minster has shown over his thirty years in politics that he is a 
democrat. He has expressed his opinions clearly, expressed his 
options clearly, and has never backtracked; he has never changed 
political affiliations during his career; he continues to believe in the 
values in which he believed in the past; he has always defended 
both Quebec and Canada, and continues to do so.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15922"> 15922 </A></B>
<P>
	The arguments of the Bloc and the PQ will not do anything to 
change reality. The reality is that our Prime Minister has defended 
both Quebec and Canada well, and will continue to do so. A no 
is a no, one which will again work in favour of Quebecers, and 
Quebecers will come to see that it is in their interests to continue 
to make the reforms and changes they want within the federation, 
as they did during the first quiet revolution.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister has said two things that are true. First, the 
Prime Minister has not changed his opinion; he continues to mock 
Quebecers and to do things behind their backs. He has not changed. 
Second, when the minister tells us there will be a second quiet 
revolution, he is right and that revolution will start with a yes on 
Monday.
<P>
	I am asking the minister how Quebecers can trust the Prime 
Minister when he engages in doubts and threats to force them to 
choose Canada, rather than admitting that the days following the 
yes vote have already been anticipated by the government, which 
will have to adopt a responsible attitude toward the international 
financial market for once, as Quebec certainly will?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Once 
again, Mr. Speaker, I think that no one will accuse our Prime 
Minister of not having made his thoughts clear, and of not having 
changed his way of thinking as he went along.
<P>
	But I have a quote to offer to you, Mr. Speaker, and it is as 
follows:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``I am a Canadian. Who will doubt that? I was born a Canadian 
and we have been Canadians since 1636 in Quebec. I am very 
proud to be a Canadian.''
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In English, the quote is: ``I am a Canadian. Who will doubt that? 
I was born a Canadian and we have been Canadians since 1636 in 
Quebec. I am very proud to be a Canadian''. Who said this? Lucien 
Bouchard.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Once again I ask you not to refer to hon. members 
by their names but by their titles in the House. I know you will 
respect that.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, throughout the Quebec referendum campaign Reformers 
have made every effort to show Quebecers that Canada is open to 
real change, change that is not  founded in the exaggerated 
promises of the separatists and change that is not found in symbolic 
constitutional amendments.
<P>
	We want a no vote on Monday to mean a mandate for a new 
Confederation, a decentralization of power and the reform of 
federal institutions. Reformers and provincial governments are 
going to work for those changes. The tens of thousands of 
Canadians who are going to Montreal will work for those changes.
<P>
	On the eve of the Quebec vote, does the federal government have 
anything more substantive and constructive to say on its agenda for 
change, something that would persuade a soft sovereignist or a 
discontented federalist to vote no on October 30?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think the Prime Minister has indicated on a number of 
occasions this week that he is ready to continue to implement 
change and to consider further change.
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	What he has said about the distinct society and the right of veto 
are important announcements in terms of constitutional change. 
What is as important is that a number of provinces, including 
Newfoundland, have now passed resolutions on distinct society to 
indicate their respect for the province of Quebec and their desire 
that they continue to work in a strong and united Canada.
<P>
	In terms of non-constitutional change, which is as important, we 
have indicated in the budget that we are ready to revise programs 
and jurisdictions in order to let the level of government which is 
most efficient do the work. We intend to continue in that direction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thought the minister might have said that one of the most 
important changes the government could initiate the morning after 
a no vote would be to start real reform of this institution, the House 
of Commons.
<P>
	Canadians inside and outside Quebec want their priorities and 
their concerns to be better represented in the Chamber. That can be 
achieved through a simple government commitment to freer voting 
in the House and the exercise of less party discipline by the 
governing party. Are these the sort of practical and positive 
changes the government would be willing to vigorously pursue 
after a no vote on October 30?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I agree with the leader of the third party that we have to 
increase the amount of change we are making in this country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15923"> 15923 </A></B>
<P>
	I remind him again that we did program review and the budget 
downsized the government by 20 per cent. We started to reform 
the various programs in order to make the federal government 
more efficient. We indicated very clearly that we want to change 
and we want to listen to what Canadians tell us.
<P>
	In terms of the House, I only have to indicate the reforms which 
have taken place to reduce its costs and increase its efficiency. We 
hope to continue in that direction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the most compelling reason for making changes in the 
Chamber have been provided by the Quebec referendum debate 
itself.
<P>
	Here we have a debate on the future of federalism and the 
country itself, but where has it occurred? Not directly, not 
forcefully, not thoroughly on the floor of the Chamber, but 
everywhere else. While the number one priority of the agenda of 
the people has been the future of their country, formal debate in the 
Chamber has focused on manganese as an additive to gasoline and 
the national horse act. That is why the House must change if the 
federal government is ever to lead change in the country.
<P>
	Is the government open to changes in this institution so that the 
agenda of the people and the country becomes the agenda of the 
House?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the debate about the referendum has taken place mostly in 
Quebec because it is a Quebec referendum.
<P>
	I certainly agree with the leader of the third party that all 
Canadians feel personally involved. I am especially happy to see 
that desire for involvement has finally been met by the huge rally 
which is presently taking place in Montreal. It shows that all 
Canadians from every part of the country consider that the choice 
being made in Quebec is the choice of their own country. That 
choice affects them personally and is one in which they want to 
have a voice.
<P>
	I am proud so many people have found it possible to go to 
Montreal. They are expressing not only their love for Quebec and 
their desire to stay together but also their view that Quebecers and 
the rest of the Canadian population will be able to go through 
problems in the future much better if they stand together, which is 
what we hope will happen, than if they divide.

	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs earlier quoted Lucien Bouchard as 
saying he was proud to be a Canadian. He neglected, however, to 
add that this statement was made before Meech Lake, that is, 
before the hon. Jean Chrétien's fancy tactics to sabotage the accord.
<P>

<P>
	The director general of elections for Quebec, Pierre F. Côté, 
criticized those offering paid holidays or lower priced tickets for 
demonstrations in connection with the referendum debate. 
According to him, it is making a mockery of the Referendum Act, 
it is a real expression of contempt. He went on to say that this sort 
of behaviour encourages civil disobedience.
<P>
	How could the federal government itself contravene the Quebec 
Referendum Act by allowing subtle arrangements to be made for 
its employees to be away from work in order to go to a 
demonstration in Montreal without loss of salary?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first, I will deal with part of the hon. member's opening 
remarks, when he talked about the statement by the Leader of the 
Opposition, which was made in 1988, that is, well after the start of 
the Meech Lake accord debate.
<P>
	Here is a quote that indicates the transparency of his statements 
now. When Mr. Bouchard, when the Leader of the Opposition, 
pardon me, spoke on Wednesday, he spoke in French and English. 
In French, he said: ``Alliances-thanks but no thanks''. A total 
refusal. In English, he said: ``I am deeply committed to this 
partnership''. So, once again, when opening remarks are used to 
deliver messages, they should not be based on the misleading 
appearances created.
<P>
	As regards the rally currently going on in Montreal, we must 
remember that Canadians and Quebecers are equally proud of 
demonstrating their patriotism in Montreal and are doing so on 
their own initiative. The federal government did not organize the 
gathering. It was born of a desire by Canadians, inside and outside  
Quebec, to express their pride in Canada, and the federal govern-
<P>
<HR>

<P>
ment is not paying their way. On the contrary, a Treasury Board 
directive provides that, if they go, they must take leave to do so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the alliances the 
hon. Leader of the Opposition was talking about were the alliances 
René Lévesque had had with the other provincial ministers before 
the night of the long knives. This is the sort of alliance the Leader 
of the Opposition was alluding to.
<P>
	How does the minister explain that federal government 
managers were informed by telephone that they should allow their 
employees to go to Montreal after they signed an insurance form. 
Even this leave is paid by the government.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the federal government is operating today. Offices are open from 
coast to coast. In accordance with common practice which has 
existed for time and is in the collective agreements, if employees 
want a day off, they can ask for a day off.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> All together, all at the same time?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eggleton:</B> Yes, they can take it as a vacation day. They can 
take a vacation day if they want. They can do it today, on Monday, 
or any other time of the year, providing they get the permission of 
their manager. In each case it is a personal choice. Nobody is being 
forced to do anything.
<P>
	A lot of people who work in the public service feel strongly 
about the country and want to be part of today's rally in Montreal. 
They are doing it all in accordance with the rules, practices and 
collective agreements of the federal government.

Canadians. Reformers have proposed a series of constructive 
alternatives to solve the problems with our health care system for 
all Canadians. What changes are the minister and the government

Quebecers, feel more at home in this Confederation?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
a lot of work is ongoing with the federal government in 
co-operation with the provincial ministers of health and their 
officials.
<P>
	One which is ongoing is the work on the vision for the future of 
the health care system in Canada. Many actions are being 
contemplated. We are very optimistic that we can continue to 
deliver first class health care in Canada and that we can make that 
health care equally accessible to all residents.
<P>
	Even people who live in Quebec appreciate our medicare 
system. They too are concerned that rapid changes would decrease 
their ability to access equitably a health care system when they 
need it. The government is committed to ensuring equitable access 
for everyone.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, like Reformers, Canadians affirm the value of medicare. 
We desire medicare to be a core set of national standards. We desire 
a system that is publicly funded and universally accessible, 
regardless of one's ability to pay, but that system must make room 
for choice to be sustainable. Is the minister open to this kind of 
change?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we are open to any kind of change that will make our health care 
system better.
<P>
	We are committed to equitable access, access based on the need 
of the individual person and not on his or her ability to pay. That is 
one of the essential cornerstones of medicare in Canada. We 
believe it is that particular form of medicare which makes Canada 
the very best country in which to live.

various sources since June. The draft bill is dated October 10, 1995.
<P>
	Will the minister admit that the bill on UI cuts is indeed ready, as

being delayed by the government to hide these cuts from Quebecers

<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council

	Regarding unemployment insurance, we announced in the last

for us, after promising to overhaul social programs, including 
unemployment insurance, to be working on it.

from testifying before this important commission? Why?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member knows full well there is no truth to that assertion.
<P>
	The government has nothing to hide with respect to the 
engagement of Canadian forces personnel to Somalia. It was this 
government in opposition that had asked the former government to 
set up a board of inquiry. That was long before the election. We did 
that once the court martials were dealt with.
<P>
	However, what happened this week is rather unfortunate since 
the tone of a letter sent by a Department of Justice official has 
given the wrong impression to the various counsel. The chairman 
of the commission has called for the various counsel to discuss this 
matter and to make sure the impression the hon. member has 
reached that somehow we want people not to come forward is 
dispelled.
<P>
	The lawyers for the respective individuals before the 
commission and the commission lawyers themselves are working 
this matter out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
indeed I would really love to see that impression dispelled. In a 
hierarchical society such as the military, even subtle signals from 
the top permeate down and can  cause an undesired effect below. In 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15927"> 15927 </A></B>
<P>
this case it is telling the troops to keep quiet. The commissioners 
are doing their best to send the soldiers the signal that the inquiry is 
open, but the assurances must come from the very top. The very top 
in this case is the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	Will the minister put himself in the position of our uniformed 
troops and recognize that he has a responsibility to reassure the 
military personally that all is fine, they can speak as they will.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, no one has ever 
accused me of being unduly subtle. Every member of the Canadian 
Armed Forces has an obligation to come forward to that 
commission. The government will not tolerate any intimidation 
toward any of those people.
<P>
	I hope the hon. member understands the message. Certainly the 
members of the armed forces understand it.

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	Yesterday, the minister refused to admit that a document from 
his department entitled ``Serving Canada's Seniors'' does indeed 
show the direction his government intends to follow in 
restructuring old age security programs.
<P>
	The government has been saying since its budget of February 
1994 that it would table a document unveiling its new approach.
<P>
	How can the government justify that, after reviewing Canada's 
old age security program for over 18 months, the human resources 
minister still claims that he has not yet made a decision on the new 
direction to be taken? Mr. Speaker, it has been 18 months.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I believe the answer sought by the hon. member is 
included in a statement made last night by the Prime Minister to 
Mr. Mongrain, regarding the issue of pensions. The Prime Minister 
said: ``What I do know is that, if people vote no on Monday, all 
those who receive pension cheques will still get the same cheque. 
Some tried to make me say that I was going to cut pension cheques. 
I clearly said in the House of Commons that there will be no 
statement in November to the effect that the government is cutting 
pensions, and  that the February budget will include no changes to 
old age pensions. I cannot not be any clearer than that''.
<P>
	This quote shows that we looked at the issue of old age pensions 
and that we arrived-as the Prime Minister clearly said-at a 
conclusion which is valid now and for next February.

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
both Reform members and Canadians, we sincerely believe in a 
strong and united country now and in the future. I am confident that 
the Liberal government shares our vision of decentralized powers.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. What changes in the powers and responsibilities 
attached to social programs will he offer the provinces to show 
them that a no vote is not a vote for the status quo?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I think that, in the past two years, our government has 
indicated very clearly that it is upholding the Liberal tradition of 
supporting the most vulnerable members of our society. We are 
forced to do so in a context of financial and economic constraint. I 
feel that we have assumed our responsibilities within a responsible 
fiscal framework by stating in the February 1995 budget that we 
would continue to help the neediest in our society.
<P>
	There is no question that, in order to help the most vulnerable in 
our society, we must overhaul our social programs to make them 
more effective, efficient and productive, and that is what we are 
doing. The changes under way to improve government will also 
help us convince Canadians, including Quebecers, that the 
Government of Canada looks after the interests of all its citizens, 
including Quebecers, and that it is in their interest to vote No on 
Monday.

<P>
	This year, revenues related to tourism increased by 18 per cent in 
our country. Clearly, a united Canada, in which the provinces and 
the federal government co-operate, is the best thing for Canadian 
tourism. It is definitely an argument in favour of a no vote on 
Monday, so that we can indeed have a united country and the best 
possible environment for tourism.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Parliamentary Secretary to the 
President of the Treasury Board has the floor. He has six minutes 
remaining.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will repeat 
the key points I made earlier and continue my speech. I said that the 
Small Business Loans Act was part of a global strategy by the 
government to boost the growth of such business, and more 
particularly its access to financing and capital. I also said we did a 
lot of consulting, before we went ahead. I said, as well, that this 
project would be self-supporting, and that the government's action 
was in keeping with two of its policies: to reduce subsidies to 
business and to reduce the deficit and the debt.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	I also indicated that the new program would better suit 
businesses with a greater need for access to capital, because, 
according to our research, 30 per cent to 40 per cent of businesses 
are getting from the existing program capital which could be used 
elsewhere. I added that I had talked to many business men and 
women in my riding of St. Boniface, who told me this was a step 
forward.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15929"> 15929 </A></B>
<P>
	I concluded the first part of my speech by saying that this was 
the sort of government initiative that reached across the entire 
country-an example of what we can accomplish together.
<P>
	Now for the second part. Speaking of what we can accomplish 
together, let us have a look at what we have already done in 
Canada. We all know that Canadians are respected around the 
world, for a number of reasons. We all know that we are the best 
country on the whole planet, and we are not the ones to say so. 
Organizations are saying so. We all know that people in many 
countries, in the vast majority of countries, would like to join us.
<P>
	We are a pretty formidable economic power, since we rank 
seventh based on our gross domestic product. We know that the 
government is evolving, and even when people do not have the 
same philosophy of government, I think they should realize that 
governments and government institutions evolve and change. And 
that is exactly what this government has done for the past two 
years. To put it another way, it has embarked on a review of the 
federal government's mandate and that of other levels of 
government in order to eliminate duplication and overlap.
<P>
	It has done so while respecting the authority of other levels of 
government and at the same time reducing government 
expenditures. it has taken steps to ensure that this initiative will be 
able to continue, because we still have some way to go.
<P>
	Consider what we have done together so far. If we look at the 
past two years, we see that more than 600,000 jobs have been 
created. That is a lot, but it is not enough. We must create more 
jobs. We need a climate that is conducive to job creation. Our 
objective with respect to the debt and the deficit is a case in point. 
We wanted to ensure that the deficit would not be in excess of 3 per 
cent of the gross domestic product. We think we can achieve that.
<P>
	Interest rates are among the lowest we have seen for a long time. 
The inflation rate is much lower than it was. Consider our growth 
figures. Economic growth has increased by 33 per cent. Exports 
have gone up by 5.2 per cent; investment in materiel and 
equipment, for instance, has increased 11.6 per cent; deliveries in 
the manufacturing sector have gone up 10.9 per cent.
<P>
	Quite frankly, we have done remarkably well in a pretty difficult 
situation. Our concern, and this includes both government 
members and the members of the opposition, should be the results 
of the vote on October 30. Because we must continue to do well.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	These successes improve Canadians' quality of life. These 
successes can assure us of growth, of keeping our number one 
status, if you will, as the best country in the world. I have a few 
quotations here I wanted to share on  the successes we have 
enjoyed, the successes others have applauded us for.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For example, Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Nesbitt Burns, 
responded to the drop in September's unemployment rate to 9.2 per 
cent by saying:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Today's buoyant job report is yet another arrow in the quiver of economic 
recovery.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That was on the CP wire on October 6.
<P>
	Andrew Pyle, Path International senior economist, responding to 
the drop in September's unemployment rate to 9.2 per cent said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>One would expect in October barring any surprises we should see even better job 
growth.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Robert Fairholm, chief economist with DRI/McGraw-Hill, in 
reacting to the Statistics Canada report showing that the country's 
GDP increased by 0.1 per cent in July, said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Pull out a microscope and you'll see growth in July. But it's an improvement and 
that's encouraging for the markets.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Gordon Thiessen, Governor of the Bank of Canada, said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I know the economy is not booming along, but it is performing in such a sound 
way, such a basically sturdy way.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I could go on. I have another dozen quotes from influential, 
knowledgeable, insightful people that show the country is working. 
As has been said by the Prime Minister on many occasions and by 
many colleagues, it is not perfect but it is the best country in the 
world. The commitment of all of us, whatever our political 
preferences, political values or political ideologies, ought to be to 
make this country, which is the best, better still.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For this reason I hope from the bottom of my heart that the 
Quebecers who see all of those Canadians rallied together in 
Montreal will listen to their heartbeats, listen to what they have to 
say. Some would like to have us believe this is not real, not 
spontaneous. It is real, it is spontaneous.
<P>
	There is a deep affection for Quebec, for Quebec men, and for 
Quebec women, and that affection is being manifested today in 
Montreal. If on October 30 we can have a no vote to separation, to 
the breakup of this country, we are going to continue to improve the 
quality of life of all Canadians, whether they live in Quebec or in 
other parts of the country. This is why I want a no vote, and I hope 
from the bottom of my heart that is exactly what the answer will be. 
No to separation, no to breakup, so that we can continue to 
progress.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to speak to Bill C-99.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15930"> 15930 </A></B>
<P>
	Since taking office two years ago the government has created 
an economy of employment that has grown. Good fiscal 
management is the foundation of the government's jobs in a 
growth agenda. The 1995 budget marks a decisive turning point, 
making $7 in cuts to government spending for every new $1 of 
tax revenue raised. The deficit is being reduced, as planned, and 
the red book target of 3 per cent of GDP by 1996-97 will be met.
<P>
	Small business has been the engine of job creation in Canada in 
the last decade. To fulfil its promise to help them compete, the 
government has cut red tape and has increased access to 
government services, financing new technologies and export 
markets.
<P>
	Our trade missions to China and Latin American led by the 
Prime Minister brought home $10 billion in trade deals for 
Canadian businesses and positive jobs for Canadians. Barriers to 
trade within Canada are dropping, thanks to the agreement on 
interprovincial trade. These efforts help Canadian businesses find 
markets for their products and services at home and abroad.
<P>
	Changes to the Small Business Loans Act is one of the most 
significant efforts of the government toward a strong economy and 
creating opportunity for growth. The changes made by Bill C-99 
will enable the completion of the process of modernization and 
improvement that has brought the SBLA program to full cost 
recovery. This renewal will relieve the financial burden of the 
program on Canadian taxpayers while enabling the SBLA to 
continue to provide its benefits to small business.
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	Over the years the program carried out under the Small Business 
Loans Act has been very successful. The SBLA was passed in 
1961, and since then more than 420,000 SBLA loans, totalling over 
$15.5 billion, have been made to small business.
<P>
	The benefits of SBLA are widely recognized. It provides needed 
help to small businesses, which are so important to the Canadian 
economy. The program is open and simple to administer. It is 
delivered by private sector lenders who have great expertise in the 
granting of credit and the monitoring of loans.
<P>
	The program's success both as an economic development tool 
and as an example of public sector and private sector co-operation 
has inspired similar guarantee programs at both the federal and 
provincial levels in Canada.
<P>
	In recent years the SBLA program has been running on an annual 
government cost of $20 million to $30 million. However, following 
a significant program change effective April 1, 1993 the annual 
activity increased from $500 million to $2.5 billion in 1993-94 and 
to over $4 billion in 1994-95. Assuming a continuation of the 
historical loss rate, this meant that the annual program  costs would 
increase by over $100 million. Clearly this was a threat to the 
sustainability of the program.
<P>
	Both the potential costs of the program and the government's 
overall need for deficit control required that the program be 
brought to full cost recovery. Consequently the government 
initiated a review of the program. Extensive consultations with 
major stakeholders representing both borrowers and lenders were 
held in October and November 1994. Recommendations were also 
provided by the industry committee and the small business working 
committee of the House of Commons. The views of the federal 
Liberal caucus task force on small business were taken into account 
as well.
<P>
	The major recommendation of all those consulted was 
unanimous: the government should act quickly to put the SBLA 
program on a full cost recovery basis. We have responded.
<P>
	Two major changes were made through regulatory amendments 
that came into effect on April 1, 1995. First, a new 1.25 per cent 
annual fee was levied on each lender's average outstanding balance 
of SBLA loans made after March 31, 1995. Second, the maximum 
rate a lender can charge under the SBLA was increased by 1.25 per 
cent to the prime interest rate plus 3 per cent for floating rate loans 
and to the residential mortgage rate plus 3 per cent for fixed rate 
loans.
<P>
	These changes have put the SBLA program on a sustainable cost 
recovery basis for all loans made after March 31, 1995. Now Bill 
C-99 will continue the process of renewal by putting in place 
additional changes to the SBLA. It will grant an authority 
respecting the release of security, including personal guarantees 
taken by lenders for the repayment of SBLA loans. It will grant an 
authority to make regulations for the establishment of a claims 
processing fee.
<P>
	Bill C-99 will improve government guaranteed coverage for low 
volume lenders. It will enable the SBLA program to respond more 
quickly in future to changing economic and program circumstances 
by allowing the guaranteed percentage to be adjusted by regulation, 
and it will potentially accelerate an already legislated decrease in 
the percentage of an SBLA loan that is guaranteed by the 
government from 90 per cent to 85 per cent.
<P>
	The changes that will be brought about by Bill C-99 will 
complete the transformation process that has made the SBLA 
program sustainable. Putting the program on a full cost recovery 
basis has caused the cost of loans made under the SBLA to increase 
slightly. However, the federal government's consultations with all 
parties recognize the need for the program to be self-sustaining.
<P>
	The changes we are making are entirely in keeping with the need 
to reduce subsidies to business and the overall need to get the 
deficit under control. These changes actually mean the SBLA will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15931"> 15931 </A></B>
<P>
be better positioned  to target its loans toward those small 
businesses that really need its help.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	At present, an estimated 30 per cent to 40 per cent of SBLA 
loans go to enterprises that are able to take advantage of normal 
business financing. Without the subsidy implicit in the present 
interest rate, the higher cost of SBLA loans will mean that these 
financially strong businesses will probably now switch to lower 
cost commercial financing.
<P>
	Even the most successful programs must be kept relevant and 
responsive and must be run in an effective manner, especially in 
these days of deficit fighting and limited government resources. 
The increase in government costs resulting from the surge increase 
in SBLA activity was a challenge that had to be met if the SBLA 
was to continue to serve the needs of small business. That 
challenge was met, and now the changes we are proposing will 
further enhance the administration of the SBLA program.
<P>
	I bring to the attention of the businesses and people in Quebec 
who have been part of this program and who have participated in it 
in an effort to better not only the economy of Quebec but also the 
economy of Canada that this is very beneficial to the province of 
Quebec. Obviously we hope that all those businesses, when it 
comes to voting on Monday in the referendum, will recognize the 
importance of staying within Canada and vote with the rest of 
Canadians with a resounding no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
appropriate that we discuss Bill C-99, an act to amend the Small 
Business Loans Act, at this time because this week is small 
business week.
<P>
	We know that small business is the lifeblood of our economy. 
Statistics tell us that 99 per cent of businesses in Canada have 
fewer than 100 employees. Because of their numbers in small 
businesses they tend to drive the economy. Growth in small 
business means economic growth, but the bottom line is that the 
government does not create jobs, businesses create jobs. Small 
businesses create almost 80 per cent of new jobs in Canada.
<P>
	Government plays a very key role. It creates the climate and 
builds the framework for economic growth. The Liberal 
government has taken important steps to create the right climate.
<P>
	We have reduced regulation. We have eliminated 250 regulations 
already and amended another 300-plus. The process continues to 
eliminate paperwork and regulations and streamline the cost of 
doing business.
<P>
	We have improved the access for small businesses to technology 
through programs like the technology partnership program.
<P>
	We have reduced the paper burden and red tape that small 
businesses struggle with. Ten business service centres have been 
opened up across Canada from coast to coast, which provide 
24-hour a day services.
<P>
	We have just announced the business networks initiative, which 
brings businesses together. Networks and working together with 
people makes things happen and makes business grow. We have 
introduced a single window business number at Revenue Canada so 
businesses can make one call instead of four.
<P>
	We have introduced new legislation like Bill C-102, which 
creates the equivalent of free trade zones in Canada and allows 
Canadian businesses like those close to the U.S. border in my 
riding to compete against the U.S. companies head on. This bill 
will also assist businesses throughout Canada, wherever they may 
be.
<P>
	We have the team Canada trade strategy aimed at helping 
businesses export. SMEs produce only 10 per cent of our exports, 
and only about 4 per cent of the small business sector exports. We 
need to improve this record. We need to make continuous 
improvements in assisting small and medium size entrepreneurs to 
export. This is where government can play a key role.
<P>
	As a member of Parliament I have been able to work with a 
committee in the St. Catharines-Niagara area to help small 
business understand what it takes to export and how really easy it is 
if you know the system. By teaching this system the committee is 
trying to assist some 350 small exporting companies in my area.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	This leads us to a problem, because we know it takes money for 
small business to expand. Business needs access to capital. One of 
the largest problems facing small business people and 
entrepreneurs is financing. Here too government has played a 
major role. The industry committee of the House has studied this 
issue extensively. It was very interesting to see the participation of 
all parties, the Bloc, Reform and the government members, 
working together on improving the system within the industry 
committee, such that we could make more improvements for all 
businesses no matter where they are located in Canada.
<P>
	Banks have responded to introduce codes of conduct and an 
alternate dispute resolution system and some have ombudsmen. 
Maybe there has been some picking on the banks and maybe it was 
required, but they are also working with many of the small 
businesses and many of the community committees to really get at 
making things happen.
<P>
	Government also plays a direct role in lending to small 
businesses. We do this through the Business Development Bank 
and the Business Development Corporation. We lend through the 
Small Business Loans Act.

	The Small Business Loans Act creates an economic 
development tool for the government. The act was first passed in 
1961. Since that time more than 420,000 loans have been made, 
totalling over $15.5 billion.
<P>
	Recently the SBLA has been running at a cost of $20 million to 
$30 million per year. This is a cost the government incurs; in other 
words, it is a cost to taxpayers. As lending has increased over the 
last couple of years, we are now looking at a loss of over $100 
million annually. Over five years the program will be tripled, from 
$4 billion to $12 billion, and then we are looking at a potential 
liability of $12 billion plus. That represents a problem for the 
government and for the taxpayer. That is why the government 
initiated a review last year and consulted with borrowers and 
lenders from across the country and the various agencies and 
institutions involved.
<P>
	For a government that is tackling the deficit and the debt, we 
know that we cannot sustain this SBLA program on taxpayers' 
backs forever. The government has had to reduce its spending. We 
have cut overall expenditures by 19 per cent, the public service by 
14 per cent, transportation subsidies across this land by some 97 
per cent, business subsidies by 60 per cent. This is only a small 
sample of our cuts to reduce the deficit.
<P>
	The important item I would like to bring forward to the House is 
that while we have been doing this cutting, we have done it in a 
progressive manner. We have done it by getting input from all the 
people involved and understanding the facts that are required as we 
go through these cuts.
<P>
	Yes, we are making changes, and for the last number of weeks 
changes seem to have really hit the House. We have been making 
those changes a little at a time, not going from one extreme to the 
other but making those continuous improvements that are so 
important to industry.
<P>
	The reason we have Bill C-99 before us today is to make the 
small business loans program revenue neutral for the government 
over time. When this legislation is implemented, we will be able to 
recover the cost of the program and the burden will not be placed 
only on taxpayers.
<P>
	As has been mentioned, several actions have already been taken 
as of April 1, 1995. There is a new 1.25 per cent annual fee levied 
on lenders' average outstanding balance of loans made after March 
31, 1995. The maximum rate a lender can charge increased by 1.25 
per cent, the prime interest rate plus 3 per cent for floating rate 
loans and for residential mortgages it is rate plus 3 per cent for 
fixed rate loans. This means the program has been put on a cost 
recovery basis for all loans made after March 31.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-99 makes further changes to the Small Business Loans 
Act. The amended act will grant authority respecting the release of 
security, including personal guarantees taken by lenders for the 
repayment of the SBLA loans. It will grant authority to make 
regulations for the establishment of a claims processing fee. The 
bill will also improve government guaranteed coverage for low 
volume lenders.
<P>
	The bill will enable the SBLA program to respond more quickly 
in the future to changing economic and program circumstances by 
allowing the guaranteed percentage to be adjusted by regulation, to 
be adjusted as mentioned as the future unfolds. As things change 
around the world, we are in the global economy and we will be able 
to adjust and make those changes on an ongoing basis. As has been 
said over and over, in this world nothing stands still; everything 
changes slowly and continuously.
<P>
	The amended act will potentially accelerate an already legislated 
decrease in the percentage of an SBLA loan which is guaranteed by 
the government from 90 per cent to 85 per cent.
<P>
	The theme for small business week this year is: New Markets-Opportunities for Growth. The government wants to help small 
businesses grow and expand. I have outlined the many ways in 
which we are doing that. However, we are not doing a favour to 
businesses if we hand them money while increasing the deficit 
which thus reduces the strength and growth of our economy.
<P>
	We are working to get the basics in place. We are providing 
several sources of income to small businesses which have difficulty 
attaining access to capital through other sources. We are improving 
and refocusing these programs so they will better target those who 
really need them.
<P>
	Without the subsidy in the SBLA program's present interest rate 
the higher cost of these loans will mean financially strong 
businesses will switch to lower cost commercial financing. More 
funding will be available to small businesses that really need the 
programs. We will be doing this in a revenue neutral manner which 
will not cost taxpayers extra dollars they do not have.
<P>
	This is important legislation which builds on the government 
agenda to help businesses succeed. We want a strong and vital 
growing economy and we need businesses to grow to accomplish 
that. This bill means financing will be available to help the small 
business person and it will be provided without an additional cost 
to taxpayers.
<P>
	The government has put forward many programs to assist small 
business. Community groups, of which I have one in my 
community called the FMP group, are excited about the changes 
this government is bringing forward to help small business.
<P>

<P>
	I urge all members in the House to join me in support of Bill 
C-99, an act to amend the Small Business Loans Act, so that we 
can work together across the country. We have shared across this 
country and have made improvements across this country. 
Likewise, I hope that when the people of Quebec, including 
Quebec's business people, come forward on Monday they will 
vote no in order to continue to share and make improvements in 
this great country of ours.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jean Payne (St. John's West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to add my voice to those of my colleagues today in 
speaking on Bill C-99, an act to amend the Small Business Loans 
Act.
<P>
	As parliamentarians we are frequently called upon by our 
constituents to assist in the creation of employment in order to 
boost the economies of our ridings and subsequently the economy 
of our country.
<P>
	Often two very significant areas, increased employment and 
minimal debt, are found to be in contrast with one another. Bill 
C-99 will provide a vehicle whereby businesses have greater access 
to capital which of course in turn creates more employment 
resulting in a healthier economy.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	In my riding of St. John's West, the community of Argentia was 
struck about a year ago by the closure of the U.S. naval base. The 
closure of that base caused the residents of the area a great deal of 
distress. However, they did not roll over and die at the thought of 
losing their jobs. Instead they decided to build on what had been 
left on the base by the Americans.
<P>
	With the very generous assistance of this government, they are 
now slowly beginning to open a few new businesses. One of the 
greatest setbacks to many of those new businesses is the inability to 
obtain financing in order to keep the businesses going. They seem 
to be having difficulties obtaining the required financing because 
of the size of their businesses. This new act will be a major asset to 
them.
<P>
	Bill C-99 is a vehicle those people will be able to use hopefully 
in the very near future so they can continue to keep their businesses 
operating. This loans act is a part of the government's overall 
strategy to provide a positive environment for the growth of small 
business, especially with regard to accessing financial capital.
<P>
	The SBLA came into effect in 1961. Its purpose was to continue 
to increase the availability of loans for the establishment and 
improvement of small business enterprises. Since then more than 
420,000 loans totalling over $15 billion have been made to 
businesses. For over 30 years the SBLA has been helping such 
businesses obtain capital for improvements and expansion. This 
government is committed to maintaining the basic nature of this 
successful program.
<P>
	The goal of the program is to assist small businesses in obtaining 
fixed asset financing which is otherwise unobtainable because 
businesses lack sufficient collateral, they are too new, or they are 
not located in large growth areas such as central Canada. Of all 
SBLA loans, 35 per cent go to start-ups and a further 20 per cent go 
to businesses under three years old.
<P>
	As I stated earlier, the SBLA is particularly significant in my 
riding of St. John's West because it does provide funding for the 
formation and stabilization of an economic foundation based on 
small enterprise. The benefits are widely recognized. It helps small 
businesses which are so important to the economy right across the 
country. They are the foundation for economic strength and 
stability. The future economy of our country has been built on 
small business and it will continue to depend on them.
<P>
	The cod fishery off the coast of Newfoundland has suffered a 
destruction and now there is a moratorium. Alternate measures 
must be found to promote the economy of that area. The SBLA 
mandate provides for funding to be targeted toward small 
businesses which are lacking collateral, which are not new and 
which are not located in the large centralized or industrial areas of 
Canada.
<P>
	Newfoundland is a province with an abundance of culture, an 
educated populace and an international accessibility through trade 
due to its coastal location. Throughout my riding of St. John's 
West, industry based resources are abundant. There are natural 
harbours, forestry, and watershed management, to name a few.
<P>
	Since April 1993 activity under the program has increased 
dramatically. A potential program deficit of over $100 million 
annually based on the 1994-95 activity levels was threatening the 
sustainability of the SBLA. The proposed changes would decrease 
the costs and increase the efficiency of the SBLA. The resulting 
strengthening of the program will enable it to continue to provide 
benefits to small businesses.
<P>
	The proposed legislation was developed after extensive 
consultation with lenders and borrowers alike. Recommendations 
of the Standing Committee on Industry and the small business 
working committee have also been addressed. The major 
recommendation of all those consulted was unanimous: the 
government should act quickly to put the SBLA program on a full 
cost recovery basis, a move initiated by a regulatory change 
effective April 1, 1995.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	Bill C-99 moves to initiate full cost recovery. The regulatory 
amendments of April 1 include a new 1.25 per cent annual fee 
which is levied on each lender's average outstanding balance on 
loans made after March 31, 1995. The second amendment states 
that the maximum rate a lender can charge under the SBLA is 
increased by 1.25  per cent to the prime interest rate plus 3 per cent 
for floating rate loans, and to the residential mortgage rate plus 3 
per cent for fixed rate loans. These changes have put the SBLA 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15934"> 15934 </A></B>
<P>
program on a sustainable cost recovery basis for all loans made 
after March 31, 1995.
<P>
	In addition to full cost recovery incentives, Bill C-99 provides 
for improvements relating to borrowers and low volume lenders. 
These changes are secondary to the major regulatory changes of 
April 1, 1995 which introduced a new annual fee on lenders and an 
increased maximum interest rate.
<P>
	Bill C-99 will continue the process of renewal by putting in place 
additional changes to the SBLA. It will permit the release of 
security, including personal guarantees, taken by lenders for 
repayment of the loans. It will also permit the establishment of a 
claims processing fee by regulation. It will improve government 
guarantees for coverage for low volume lenders, to improve 
competition among lenders particularly in the smaller 
communities, such as those in my riding.
<P>
	Bill C-99 will permit the SBLA program in the future to respond 
more quickly to changing economic and program circumstances by 
allowing the guarantee percentage to be adjusted by regulation. It 
will accelerate a previously legislated decrease in the percentage of 
an SBLA loan which is guaranteed by the government from 90 per 
cent to 85 per cent.
<P>
	These changes are of particular importance to my riding of St. 
John's West because of the emphasis on smaller communities.
<P>
	In addition, new resiliency clauses which will be implemented 
into the SBLA are tailored to help small business respond more 
quickly to changing economic circumstances.
<P>
	In summary, the changes incorporated into Bill C-99 will ensure 
that the program will continue to be successful in assisting small 
businesses in obtaining the financing which they so badly need for 
expansion and the creation of jobs throughout the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to speak in support of Bill C-99, an act to amend the 
Small Business Loans Act.
<P>
	I could start out by stating the obvious, that we are reminded 
daily that the future of jobs in Canada is to come from small 
business. We are reminded daily that it is the fastest growing sector 
with respect to job creation. In fact, it is that sector of our economy 
where there is opportunity for work. I have been reminded three 
times in the last six days of the importance of the small business 
sector.
<P>
	Last Saturday I met with the chamber of commerce in my riding. 
In a brief which was submitted to me it was stated that there is 
nothing that can replace a job created by a small enterprise. We all 
agree with that.
<P>
	On Wednesday night I was in the city of North York and had the 
opportunity to attend a small business fair which took place at the 
city hall. There was a large display by support agencies. There were 
all types of computer consultants and business consultants. It is 
important to note that the banks were also there in large numbers. 
There are groups within the communities which are willing to 
facilitate ongoing small business and are willing to work with 
people who want to create small businesses.
<P>
	Last evening in my riding of Sarnia-Lambton the board of 
directors of Lambton College agreed to proceed with an innovative 
international trade centre. I am quite pleased to say I have been 
actively involved in this project. I started it with the college in 
conjunction with my neighbour across the river in the United 
States, Congressman David Bonior from the 10th congressional 
district of the state of Michigan.
<P>
	We are working together on both sides of the border to facilitate 
small businesses in order that they can find markets on both sides 
of the border. We want to work in partnership so we have linked 
these two centres located at community colleges in Canada and in 
the United States by modem. Now a Canadian small business 
person can find a partner and can obtain the kind of information he 
or she needs to enter the American marketplace.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	There are 40 million people living within an hour's drive of my 
riding. That is 40 million. There are 80 million people within an 
eight-hour drive. The marketplace is not just within Canada for 
small business. Indeed, for many of us it is in the United States. I 
am pleased to say that small businesses are awakening to this 
marketplace.
<P>
	I know of one small business operator in my riding who employs 
17 people. He was able to increase his business by some 35 per cent 
by working actively in the city of Port Huron in the state of 
Michigan, 400 yards away from Canada.
<P>
	The marketplace out there is huge. I know of another gentleman 
who employs two other people making ice boats. His market is in 
the area surrounding the city of Detroit on Lake St. Clair. He is able 
to do that from Canada.
<P>
	There is a huge marketplace out there for small business but 
there are two areas of specific need that must be addressed to assist 
small business people. First, small business needs access to capital. 
That is stating the obvious. We must remember that job creation in 
the private sector requires an investment. It can vary.
<P>
	I am talking only about the private sector. In the high tech 
business, the cost of creating a job, if I can put it in such blunt 
terms, is $750,000. In other words, that corporation must, to add a 
person to it, often invest up to $750,000.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15935"> 15935 </A></B>
<P>
	In manufacturing in a general sense that number is somewhere 
between $750,000 and $1 million. That means a corporation must 
have several million dollars of capital invested to employ people. 
For those that are specialized the numbers increase even more. 
I can speak firsthand of the petrochemical and refining industries 
where the investment required of the corporation can be anywhere 
from $1 million to $1.5 million.
<P>
	Changes in the way large industry works are in fact changing that 
ratio. Across North America we are undergoing a phenomenon 
known as restructuring. Large corporations examine their 
workforces and they tend to remove those who are not tied directly 
to production so that the ratio of job to investment is increasing all 
the time.
<P>
	It is because of this that we have to look to small business where 
we know jobs can be created when an entrepreneur invests 
anywhere from $3,000 to $25,000. It is because of numbers like 
those that tells us the future of the job market is in the small 
business sector.
<P>
	We all know also that access to funds is the number one obstacle 
encountered by small business. The Small Business Loans Act is 
there to support lenders and in turn help small business obtain debt 
financing often otherwise inaccessible to them.
<P>
	I state the obvious when I say that if one reads any number of 
newspapers one will note there is, across this country, often 
complaints of the lack of access to funds. Although this will not 
remove every obstacle, it is working toward it.
<P>
	It is important to realize that the Small Business Loans Act 
program is delivered not by government agencies but by private 
sector lenders. We know the Small Business Loans Act has been 
around for some 34 years now and this bill simply reflects what the 
realities of today are from a fiscal perspective.
<P>
	Organizations such as the Canadian Federation of Independent 
Business, which I should point out is a group which never is 
hesitant to express its opinion, have supported this bill. That is an 
important factor to point out. There is support for this bill not just 
in the House but where it really counts, within the business 
community and especially within the small business community, a 
great number of whose representatives are members of the 
Canadian Federation of Independent Business.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	As a result it is important that the House support Bill C-99. It 
has, since 1961, resulted in a program which I suggest has been 
successful. We are told that there have been some $16 billion lent 
by banks under the Small Business Loans Act since 1961. In many 
people's opinions it is not enough when one considers that in other 
economies around the world much greater numbers are spent on an 
annual basis on small business expansion. However, it is important 
that this tool be  there. It is there as an economic tool and it is there 
as an example of public sector and private sector co-operation and 
partnership. That is becoming in government at all levels more and 
more important.
<P>
	It is also important to remember that government costs 
associated with this program have escalated quite dramatically in 
recent years to the point where its sustainability has been called 
into question. This, quite frankly, is the reality of government 
today.
<P>
	As a result, the government has initiated a review of the program 
and extensive consultations were held over a year ago involving all 
concerned parties. It is not a unilateral consultation. It is a bilateral 
consultation involving the public and the private sectors. We are 
certainly aware of the valuable input that the industry committee 
provided on this subject.
<P>
	It is safe to say that the overwhelming consensus from all the 
major stakeholders is that the government must act swiftly to 
transform the Small Business Loans Act program into a full cost 
recovery situation. It must be operated on a full cost recovery basis.
<P>
	The bill accomplishes this objective and will grant authority 
respecting the release of security, as many other speakers before 
me have laid out the technical details of it. I believe that the 
changes contained in Bill C-99 will complete a transformation 
process to make the Small Business Loans Act sustainable and 
realistic and a program that has the support of small business and 
business associations across the country.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to add my support to everyone in Montreal today 
for the walk for unity. Canadians have come from all parts of 
Canada and I truly wish the best for everyone in Montreal 
especially today. This is truly a reflection of our great Canadian 
spirit and our great Canadian family.
<P>
	I am pleased to speak on Bill C-99, an act to amend the Small 
Business Loans Act. For almost 35 years now, the Small Business 
Loans Act program has provided a valuable means of assisting 
Canadian small businesses to obtain the financing they need for 
capital, improvements and expansion.
<P>
	The government is firmly committed to maintaining the basic 
nature of this successful program. This act is truly important for the 
riding of Lambton-Middlesex. I represent a rural riding with the 
largest urban centre being Strathroy with a population of about 
11,000. My riding depends on the small business for economic 
growth and success. Businesses vary from the manufacturing of 
clothing and footwear to food processing and auto parts, to name a 
few.
<P>
	The Small Business Loans Act encourages financing for small 
businesses which typically have difficulty in securing fixed asset 
loans financing for the establishment, expansion and/or 
modernization.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15936"> 15936 </A></B>
<P>
	Under the SBLA, the federal government guarantees loans up 
to $250,000 which are made to small businesses by private sector 
financial institutions. New and existing businesses which are not 
farms or religious or charitable enterprises are eligible for Small 
Business Loans Act loans as long as their annual gross revenues 
do not exceed $5 million annually. It is safe to say that the SBLA 
has been to some degree responsible for the dramatic success of 
the small business sector in helping keep the Canadian economy 
vibrant.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Job creation is one of the most important economic contributions 
made by the small business sector. Since the late 1970s, smaller 
firms have been the key contributors to net job creation. Between 
1979 and 1989 alone, businesses with fewer than 100 employees 
created over 2.3 million net new jobs in the Canadian economy, 87 
per cent of all growth in private sector employment during that 
period. The self-employed added a further 400,000 new jobs to this 
total.
<P>
	The role that the SBLA plays in nurturing small businesses, 
particularly start-up businesses, is significant. The objective of the 
act is to assist in the establishment of small businesses and the stats 
indicate that this objective is being met. From 1990 to 1994, 40 per 
cent of SBLA loans were made to start-up companies, which 
together with other very young businesses, those three years old or 
less, have been obtaining about 50 per cent of all SBLA loans.
<P>
	The SBLA is meeting its goals and objectives in other ways as 
well. As is intended, the average size of loans made is modest. 
From 1989 to 1993, the average size SBLA loan was $38,000 and 
38 per cent of the loans were $20,000 or less, 63 per cent were 
$40,000 or less. In 1994 the average loan size increased to $58,000, 
mainly because of an increase in the permissible maximum loan 
limit.
<P>
	While these stats confirm that the program is serving start-ups in 
young business and providing loans of smaller amounts, there is 
other evidence to show that the SBLA is promoting the 
establishment and expansion of businesses in other ways. In a 
review carried out by independent consultants in 1992, some 60 per 
cent of the borrowers surveyed indicated that they would not have 
been able to obtain a bank loan without the assistance of the 
program. The review cross-checked and confirmed this finding 
when lenders surveyed reported that 50 per cent of the loans would 
not have been granted in the absence of this program.
<P>
	Another study of the SBLA was undertaken in 1994 by a team of 
analysts under Dr. Allan Riding of Carleton University. Dr. Riding 
surveyed SBLA loan files and also worked with the Canadian 
Federation of Independent Business survey data. Dr. Riding found 
that the SBLA borrowers tend to be those targeted by the act and, as  
intended, their businesses tend to be smaller, more risky and with 
fewer resources than the non-SBLA borrowers.
<P>
	Dr. Riding concluded that some 50 per cent to 70 per cent of the 
SBLA loans are truly incremental; that is, the lender and the federal 
government as guarantor are demonstrating confidence in the 
borrowers because of the risky nature of his or her business.
<P>
	The SBLA program is an important one for small businesses and 
a popular one. A fivefold increase in the use of the program has 
resulted in a potential annual program deficit of $100 million or 
more. Clearly this would have been an intolerable burden on the 
taxpayer, one which would have made the SBLA program 
unsustainable.
<P>
	The importance of the program to small businesses required that 
it be updated and modernized so that it can continue to provide its 
benefits. In particular, the program needed to be truly sustainable 
through a move to a full cost recovery. Full cost recovery was 
supported by all those who made their opinions known, both 
borrowers and lenders, during the extensive consultations that 
preceded both the changes before you today, as well as the changes 
of April 1, 1995.
<P>
	Significant action has already been taken by the government to 
achieve cost recovery. Effective April 1, 1995, a new annual fee of 
1.25 per cent was introduced on lenders' outstanding balance of 
SBLA loans made after March 31, 1995. The maximum interest 
rate charged by lenders was increased by 1.25 per cent to the prime 
rate plus 3 per cent for floating rate loans and to the residential 
mortgage rate, plus 3 per cent for fixed rate loans.
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	Bill C-99 will institute a second set of changes, some of which 
relate to program improvement and others to the recovery of the 
program cost. These changes include accelerating already 
scheduled decreases in the government loan guarantee from 90 per 
cent to 85 per cent. They will grant authority to make regulations 
for the establishment of claims processing fees and regarding the 
release of security, including personal guarantees taken by lenders 
in repayment of SBLA loans. They will improve the government 
guarantee coverage for low volume lenders.
<P>
	Furthermore, they will enable future changes to the level of 
government guarantees to be made through the regulatory rather 
than the legislative process. This will add flexibility to the program 
and permit easier fine tuning in the future.
<P>
	The move to cost recovery for the SBLA and the introduction of 
a new fee structure were announced in December 1994 when the 
Minister of Industry presented the paper ``Building a more 
innovative economy'' to the House of Commons. After 
consultations with all stakeholders the annual 1.25 per cent fee was 
deemed  necessary 
<P>

<B><A NAME="15937"> 15937 </A></B>
<P>
to achieve immediate cost recovery on all new loans made after 
March 31, 1995.
<P>
	The losses being incurred annually under the SBLA program 
were threatening to spiral out of control. They were in excess of 
$100 million a year. The SBLA shortfall was also adding 
considerably to the overall deficit the government is determined to 
reduce. The program is a good one. The SBLA performs a valuable 
service, one that should be continued.
<P>
	With the changes being brought about by Bill C-99 the move to 
bring the SBLA to full cost recovery will be completed. Efficiency 
in making future changes to the SBLA will be improved. 
Unnecessary subsidies to businesses will be ended and a significant 
advance will be made in the government's fight to control the 
deficit.
<P>
	I urge all members of the House of Commons to work for swift 
passage of the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives 
me pleasure to speak to the debate today. I have been involved in 
the question of how we provide financing to small business for 
some time and it is my feeling that the act in some way is 
somewhat misnamed.
<P>
	If we reflect on it for a moment, perhaps we should call it the 
Canadian banking system failures act, because it is the failure of 
our banking system to adequately provide support to small 
businesses that makes the act necessary.

	In the late 1980s and early 1990s I had the privilege of 
co-chairing a task force on the Manitoba economy which travelled 
the length and breadth of the province. It held meetings with 
chambers of commerce, town councils, small business people and 
large business people from all over the province of Manitoba. The 
one thing we heard over and over again was that for small, remote 
centres access to financing was extremely difficult.
<P>
	We must ask ourselves why that is. We have a comprehensive 
system that the government has supported since the creation of the 
country. Banks throughout the country function in an oligopoly and 
have incredible protection from competition. They have the ability 
to fall back on the government and the taxpayers to bail them out 
whenever they make a mistake in a foreign country.
<P>
	Why cannot banks, which as a result of that protection have 
become incredibly profitable, adequately meet the needs of small 
business? That is an important question we must ask ourselves and 
must keep asking the banks until we get an answer. We are 
correcting a flaw that should be corrected by the banking system.
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	We are talking about raising the loans, capital or equity available 
to small business to an average level of about $4 billion a year. We 
say that will cost us, if it spirals the way it has been, about $100 
million a year. I  ask members to reflect on what percentage of last 
year's bank profits is $100 million. If they do the mathematics they 
will find that it is something less than 1 per cent. Is it too much to 
ask the Canadian banking system to invest 1 per cent of its profits 
in Canadian small businesses? Why is it incapable of meeting this 
challenge?
<P>
	An example that comes to mind is a small business in south 
central Manitoba in the riding of the member for 
Lisgar-Marquette. It had 12 employees and made electrical 
equipment. It designed a yard light. The principal of the business 
was something of an amateur inventor. He developed a number of 
successful products that are now being marketed throughout the 
world and can certainly be found in almost every farmyard in 
western Canada.
<P>
	Through ingenuity and hard work he managed to convince a 
giant company, Quebec Hydro, of the efficiency of one of his 
products. Quebec Hydro gave him an order. It is a huge company 
that is certainly capable of paying its bills. The first order in the 
series was something like $9 million. However there was a catch. 
He had to meet the just in time requirements that are quite common 
in today's business world. He had to run up his inventory to a level 
that would meet the demand requirements of the order from 
Quebec Hydro.
<P>
	Despite the fact he walked into the bank he had been doing 
business with for 20 years with the signed contract in hand, he 
could not get the bank to lend him the money. It could not happen 
because it was larger than the bank's policy for that area or because 
the bank did not understand that a business capable of doing that 
amount of business could exist in a small rural town in Manitoba. 
Whatever its rationale the bank did not respond to his need.
<P>
	The banking system that we protect, that we bail out when it gets 
into trouble, that we protect because we want to have secure access 
to capital available for the economy, could not respond to his need. 
It is a tragedy.
<P>
	If we look at whom we are talking about here and we look at the 
Carleton study we see the average business which received funding 
under the legislation had 7.5 employees. They have annual sales of 
roughly three-quarters of a million dollars and before tax profits of 
just under $50,000. These are the small businesses of the country.
<P>
	On average 88 per cent of the businesses that received funding 
under the act created 5.3 new jobs. They did what we have claimed 
small business would do. If we give them access to capital they will 
create the jobs and they will create per dollar more jobs than will 
large corporations. That is one of the reasons we agreed to increase 
the total lending available under the legislation.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="15938"> 15938 </A></B>
<P>
	Nearly 30 per cent of small businesses reported that as a result 
of the loans they were able to obtain they became more efficient 
and decreased their costs, and 41.7 per cent reported their loans 
helped their firms to survive.
<P>
	I support the legislation. It is a necessary and important change 
that makes it possible for small businesses in Canada to continue to 
fulfil a role in our community that is important to all Canadians, 
the creation of jobs, allowing people to obtain work and live in 
dignity. This is the foundation of the economy. Why cannot large 
banks, the banks with the billion dollar profits, find it within their 
operations to fill this niche? Why cannot they find resources within 
their huge operations to meet the needs of small businesses?
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	We have a real problem. I was disappointed today to hear the 
question of the member of the Reform Party from Lloydminster 
who spoke strongly against regional economic development and 
against the provision of capital to businesses in western Canada. It 
showed a profound misunderstanding of some of the problems 
businesses face.
<P>
	Another example I will use that came across my desk recently is 
of a company in Winnipeg, not a small town but a relatively large 
centre with some financial strength. It is extremely profitable and 
doing very well in the construction sector. It has lots of work and 
has never been at risk. All of a sudden its credit lines were changed. 
It had not defaulted on anything. Its business was still strong. It was 
doing well. It inquired into why there was a change in the payment 
of certain bills from 90 days to 30 days.
<P>
	The answer had nothing to do with western Canada. It had 
nothing to do with that business. The answer was that losses had 
been sustained in southern Ontario.
<P>
	There is a real problem. If we talk to people with medium size 
businesses in western Canada we find there is a serious problem. 
They can grow to a certain size but to get above that the capital is 
not there. Or, if it is there, they have to work harder and pay more 
for it than a similar business in Toronto. That is not right. That is a 
failure of the market in the same way that the legislation represents 
a failure in our banking system.
<P>
	Those are the places where government can play a role. Those 
are the places where government can act to ensure that the 
necessary resources are available so small businesses continue to 
produce the jobs members of Parliament and our constituents want 
them to produce.
<P>
	I support the legislation I am sure all members of our caucus 
support it. We will be voting for the legislation when it comes 
forward. We are saddened by the fact that the banking system has 
been unable to respond to this need. We feel it is such a vitally 
important area that the government must continue to be involved 
and strengthen its involvement in support of small business.
