Question No. 19-<B>Mr. Charest:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What is the estimated total dollar impact that will result from individuals 
making a capital gains election to secure a lifetime exemption for gains accrued 
prior to the budget day for (a) the guaranteed income supplement, (b) veterans 
allowances, (c) the child tax benefit, (d) the old age security repayment, (e) the 
age credit repayment, (f) the alternative minimum tax, (g) the GST credit, (h) 
other non-refundable credits, (i) other programs and other features of the tax 
system; and, in each case, what is the estimated number of people affected and 
the average increase in taxes or loss of benefits; and what is the overall total 
effect of this?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance):</B> The precise dollar impact that the election for the 
$100,000 lifetime capital gains exemption will have on the 
various provisions mentioned in this question, such as the child 
tax benefit or the alternative minimum tax will depend on the 
number of people and the income and age characteristics of 
those who choose to use the election.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4094"> 4094 </A></B>
<P>
	The election allows individuals to exempt up to $100,000 of 
capital gains. In most cases the cost associated with using the 
election will be relatively small compared to the potential tax 
savings of exempting capital gains. Nevertheless, it will be up to 
the individual to determine whether he or she wishes to utilize 
the election.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House note the proactive work of the government, in co-operation 
with farm organizations, industry representatives, and the provinces, to enhance 
the agriculture and agri-food sector of the Canadian economy, contributing to 
the well-being of farmers, food security for consumers, sustainable agriculture, 
economic growth and jobs, and building the sector to be among the best in the 
world.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Madam Speaker, allow me to begin debate this 
morning by saying what a pleasure it is for me to be back in 
Canada and back in the House after my recent travels on behalf 
of Canadian agriculture and agri-food.
<P>
	In mid-April I went to Morocco with my colleague, the 
Minister for International Trade, for the signing of the new 
GATT agreement and to continue our very difficult negotiations 
with the United States on a variety of bilateral trade issues in 
agriculture between our two countries.
<P>
	After Morocco I was in east Asia with the Governor General 
and 15 Canadian farm leaders and agri-business leaders to 
promote trade with the countries of that particular region of the 
world. It was a great honour to be part of that state visit. It was a 
pleasure to meet personally and directly with so many of 
Canada's major international customers and to hear directly 
from them about what they are looking for from us.
<P>
	Canadians have a good reputation in the Asia-Pacific region 
based upon our past history of friendship with the countries of 
that part of the world and based upon our strong reputation as a 
supplier of the world's highest quality products. Our delegation 
was warmly welcomed at every stop. I think we helped to 
solidify our bilateral relations in each of the countries that we 
visited.
<P>
	Still there is no place like home and I am indeed happy to be 
back. I feel I should warn hon. members opposite that having 
dined in Asia upon worms, sea slugs and scorpions, I am ready 
for any challenges that might arise in the House.
<P>
	Our government has been in office now for six months. We 
were elected on a platform that we put forward in our red book. 
We have spent the first half year implementing the fundamentals 
of that platform. We promised job creation, fiscal responsibility 
and a more responsive government, a government committed to 
integrity. We have been delivering on those commitments.
<P>
	Job creation for Canada is inextricably bound up in the issues 
of international trade. Our top priorities have been concluding 
trade agreements and developing new markets. The trips I have 
made in the last month or so to Morocco and the Far East and our 
extensive round of bilateral negotiations with the United States 
are important parts of delivering on that job creation promise.
<P>
	We have also made a number of key moves on fiscal 
responsibility, particularly the budget presented in February by 
my colleague, the Minister of Finance. While I am speaking 
about the Minister of Finance, I would like to thank him and 
thank all my caucus colleagues for pinch-hitting for me last 
week in the agriculture debate which was called while I was 
away.
<P>
	As far as responsive government is concerned, we are 
involved in extensive consultations in all areas of government 
every day with Canadians from across the country, not just with 
businesses and organizations but with all Canadians: workers, 
farmers, students, people who make the country function day by 
day. Of course we still have a lot to do. As they say, Rome was 
certainly not built in a day. However I believe we have laid the 
foundation and we are getting on with the job in agriculture, 
agri-food, and a broad range of government priorities. As the 
Prime Minister said last week, we are offering Canadians a good 
government and we will try very hard to continue to do so.
<P>
<B>(1015 ) </B>
<P>
	In the agriculture and agri-food sector we promised to pursue 
financial security for farmers, food safety and security for 
consumers and a sound environmental policy over all.
<P>
	The motion before the House today talks about making our 
agri-food sector one of the very best in the world. That is our 
goal and nothing less will do.
<P>
	Last night I had the opportunity to attend in Toronto a final 
meeting of the Agri-Food Competitiveness Council of Canada. 
It is a group of individuals representing a broad cross-section of 
the agri-food industry in this country. They have been at work 
over the course of the last three years to develop the concept of 
competitiveness in the agri-food industry and to describe how 
that concept can be incorporated in the establishment and  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4095"> 4095 </A></B>
<P>
functioning of government policy and how that concept can be 
used to enhance the quality of our agri-food sector in Canada.
<P>
	The Agri-Food Competitiveness Council has established for 
itself the objective of making Canadian agriculture and 
agri-food number one in the world in comparison with its 
international counterparts. That is a goal and an objective which 
I share, and this government shares, an objective which is 
embodied in the motion before the House today.
<P>
	I consider it my great good fortune to have been asked by the 
Prime Minister last November to preside over the very 
important agriculture and agri-food sector of the Canadian 
economy. This sector is vibrant and exciting. It is a very 
important part of the Canadian economy, accounting for a 
significant portion of our gross domestic product and a 
significant portion of Canadian jobs. It is also an area that I 
believe has huge potential for the future in terms of economic 
growth and job creation which were the fundamental 
underpinnings of our red book commitments in 1993.
<P>
	However, this portfolio is no place for a faint heart. This 
sector is entering a period of change and reform of significant 
proportions. Our government has spoken often of the major 
reforms we anticipate in such fields as social security, which has 
been the subject of previous debates in this House.
<P>
	The changes to be expected in agriculture and agri-food, 
while perhaps less talked about than some other areas, are of a 
similar magnitude and importance for the farm and food sectors 
of Canada.
<P>
	Let me deal for a moment with the issue of financial security 
which I mentioned is part of our red book commitments.
<P>
	Farmers constantly tell me that they want to earn their 
incomes from a decent marketplace and not from the high levels 
of subsidies that have prevailed in agriculture over the last 
number of years. They do not want handouts. They want a decent 
market. However, they will continue to need some reasonable 
degree of protection as a matter of public policy against the 
vagaries of the market, the weather and external disasters which 
are beyond their control.
<P>
	Therefore, we are pursuing a two-pronged approach to 
financial security. As our platform promised, we are working on 
developing a new safety net system for agriculture in Canada 
based upon the income of the whole farm to replace the ad 
hockery of the past and the current, very expensive patchwork of 
programs.
<P>
	This idea, the whole farm income concept, has won the 
support of farm organizations and the provinces. A national 
farm safety nets committee and federal and provincial officials 
are pressing forward with a number of proposals that will be 
presented for consideration at the next meeting of federal and 
provincial ministers of agriculture which will be held in 
Winnipeg in July.
<P>
	The fundamental principles underlying our work with respect 
to the safety nets programs and this concept of whole farm 
income are as follows. First, to the largest extent possible, what 
we do in farm safety net programming must be GATT consistent 
so that we do not in future trip over trade rules that can destroy 
the best domestic programs.
<P>
	Second, our programs must be production and market neutral 
so that farmers are making their own production and marketing 
decisions and those decisions are not driven by this or that 
subsidy from a government.
<P>
<B>(1020 ) </B>
<P>
	Third, the programs must be actuarially sound and fiscally 
responsible. That goes without saying, given the economic 
context in which all governments in this country find 
themselves at the present time.
<P>
	Finally, our programs must be user friendly from the farmers' 
point of view so they are effective, affordable and easily 
understandable by farmers.
<P>
	While we are working on the safety nets front, at the same 
time we are also working very hard to ensure that the agriculture 
and agri-food sector has access to the domestic and 
international markets which will ensure prosperity for the 
future. That is why we plunged into the GATT negotiations and 
in the short time available to us, between the date our new 
government took office, November 4, and the conclusion of the 
GATT negotiations in the middle of December, in that very short 
time span I believe we came out of the process with a deal that 
does meet the fundamental needs of our country.
<P>
	Searching for those good international markets is also the 
reason why I have travelled to Mexico, South Korea, China and 
Hong Kong in the last few weeks promoting trade and helping to 
open doors to our exporters.
<P>
	For the same reason the Minister for International Trade and I 
have sat eyeball to eyeball with our U.S. counterparts to try to 
settle some long standing bilateral issues in agricultural trade 
between Canada and the United States. That trade amounts to 
something in the order of $12 billion a year in total. It is big, it is 
important, it has been growing and it is mutually beneficial on 
both sides of the 49th parallel. It is obviously advantageous if 
we can arrive at an overarching framework agreement that will 
in the final analysis lay to rest the disputes that we have been 
working on once and for all and allow our trade opportunities 
between these two countries to grow and flourish in the future.
<P>
	The negotiations have been difficult. The issues at stake here 
are not easy to resolve. In the process of the negotiations I 
believe that Canada has been fair and flexible. Our approach has 
been to try to maintain existing levels of trade between our two 
countries and to work toward enhanced levels of trade wherever 
reasonable and realistic.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4096"> 4096 </A></B>
<P>
	This process started last November in our negotiations with 
the U.S. and it has been a difficult process. As a matter of 
principle, we have committed ourselves not to get into any kind 
of horse trading of one group of farmers against another, or one 
region against another, or one commodity against another. We 
believe that the various issues on the table for resolution need to 
be dealt with on their own merits, individually in their own 
right, without any tradeoffs as between commodities, regions or 
farm groups.
<P>
	We are ever mindful of the fact that we are here in this 
government and at the negotiating table on behalf of Canada to 
serve the whole country and not just one part of it.
<P>
	In the bargaining we will not roll over and play dead. We will 
not sign a deal that does not respect Canada's national interest. 
If the United States should decide at some point to act 
unilaterally against Canada with what we consider to be unfair 
or punitive measures, then Canada will fight back to defend its 
vital national interests.
<P>
	That having been said, however, I would like to emphasize 
that we are not spoiling for a fight. I will keep talking at the 
negotiating table as long as there is something useful to talk 
about. As Winston Churchill once said, jaw, jaw is better than 
war, war. Of course he was not talking about a trade war but I 
think the quote applies just as well in our present circumstances.
<P>
	If we can have a good agreement it would obviously be in our 
interest to have one. Canada is prepared to keep the negotiations 
going constructively until we arrive at the most reasonable 
result.
<P>
<B>(1025 ) </B>
<P>
	When the new GATT agreement is in place some time in 1995, 
we will have at long last an effective, rules based trade 
environment in the world for agriculture. To help position 
Canadians to take maximum advantage of our agri-food trading 
opportunities, our platform suggested two initiatives.
<P>
	One initiative is the establishment of an agri-food industry 
council to advise the government on all matters related to 
improving Canada's market position and the promotion of 
economic growth and jobs.
<P>
	As I mentioned a moment ago, there has been an institution in 
place over the last three years that has been focusing on the 
competitiveness issues in agriculture, namely the Agri-Food 
Competitiveness Council. That council will be going into the 
sunset, if you will, in June 1994 because it was scheduled to 
wind down at about that time.
<P>
	However, building upon the good work of the Agri-food 
Competitiveness Council over the last three years and building 
upon the other consultative efforts that have been undertaken by 
the government in our first few months in office, we can see in 
the months ahead the foundations upon which we will build our 
agri-food  industry council as suggested in our red book at the 
time of the election last year.
<P>
	The other proposal we talked about in the red book was for a 
foreign agri-food marketing service. This service would 
enhance the ability not only of the government but of the private 
sector to identify international market opportunities. It would 
receive the best possible market intelligence from around the 
world and would position Canadian exporters to the greatest 
advantage possible to take advantage of those marketing 
opportunities. That is another proposal from the red book on 
which I propose to move in the months immediately ahead.
<P>
	In implementing both of these initiatives, we are seeking to 
achieve an objective which the agri-food industry has already 
established for itself. That is the objective of increasing 
agri-food exports from Canada by 50 per cent over the course of 
the next five or six years.
<P>
	The industry wishes to see our present level of exports, which 
is in the range of $13 billion annually, rise to a level in the order 
of $20 billion annually by the turn of the century. Our initiatives 
in terms of agricultural competitiveness, trade and marketing 
will be aimed toward helping our private sector and our farm 
organizations achieve that ambitious export objective.
<P>
	While I was in Asia over the course of the last two or three 
weeks, I was discussing with our buyers and potential buyers 
what we need to do in Canada differently or better in order to 
expand our trade. There are a couple of important messages that 
flowed from those discussions overseas.
<P>
	First of all, we must take every possible opportunity to 
diversify our marketing potential and our marketing 
opportunities. We have perhaps in this country over the last 
number of years been preoccupied with our trade prospects on 
the North American continent. The reason for that is 
understandable. Markets in North America are close to us. They 
are well understood by us. They are reasonably easy to access. 
The infrastructure is there. The personal and cultural links are 
already in place. The trade in North America is rather simple and 
easy for us to comprehend and exploit.
<P>
	It is more complex and more difficult to seek and pursue and 
exploit markets that are overseas in Japan, Korea, China, Hong 
Kong, in the whole Asia-Pacific region or in Latin America. 
While we would never want to diminish our trading 
opportunities in North America, we have to be very mindful of 
the huge opportunities that exist elsewhere in the world, 
particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, which is the fastest 
growing economic zone on the face of the earth, and in Latin 
America, which is the second fastest growing economic zone on 
the face of the earth. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4097"> 4097 </A></B>
<P>
We have to broaden and diversify our trading horizons in order 
to take those vast markets elsewhere into account.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	Second, we need to listen very carefully to what those markets 
are telling us. I think we have had a tendency in this country to 
say that we should simply go out there and sell whatever it is we 
might choose to produce. Maybe we have to turn that equation 
around the other way and think more of how we can produce 
what it is the world wants to buy. We have to listen to our 
customers, listen to our markets and make sure that we are 
producing, processing, further processing and adding value in a 
way that will tailor make our products and our commodities to 
suit the markets into which we wish to sell them.
<P>
	Third, we have to put ourselves in a position to deliver into 
those markets in a timely way. We in this House and in the 
Canadian grains industry all know that in the last couple of 
months we have had some enormous difficulties in delivering on 
time. That is an issue that not only the grains industry but this 
government takes very seriously.
<P>
	In that spirit over the course of the last number of days I know 
the subcommittee of the House Standing Committee on 
Agriculture and Agri-Food and the subcommittee of the House 
Standing Committee on Transport have been conducting very 
useful hearings. They have come forward with some ideas they 
wish the government to consider. They may rest assured the 
recommendations coming from those subcommittees will be 
given very careful consideration as we try to get to the bottom of 
what has gone wrong in terms of grain handling and 
transportation in this country over the course of the last number 
of months and producing the formula that is needed to solve 
those problems and to correct the situation for the future.
<P>
	Furthermore, I have invited many of the major players in the 
Canadian grain handling and transportation system to meet with 
me on Monday of next week at a private meeting in Winnipeg. 
The doors will be closed, our jackets taken off and sleeves rolled 
up to focus expressly on this problem this year and to find out 
what we together can do to resolve the difficulty.
<P>
	I am not interested in finger pointing and blame laying. That 
is an exercise that is a mug's game that quite frankly gets you 
nowhere. I want a good, thorough, candid, honest assessment of 
the facts. I want practical solutions to deal with the problem so 
we can alleviate the situation as much as possible this year and 
then for future years make sure that this country does not get 
itself into that kind of jackpot again.
<P>
	It is a serious problem and I want all involved to know that the 
Government of Canada takes it very seriously.
<P>
	Beyond the meeting next Monday in Winnipeg I also hope to 
engage the western grains industry in some broader discussions 
that go beyond the immediate problem with delivering our 
products through the congestion on the west coast. I want to 
involve the grains industry in an exercise of coming together to 
develop a  common vision of where we want this industry to go 
in the years ahead.
<P>
	I want to invite farm leaders and those who are involved in 
operating various parts of the system to think about the year 
2000. What kind of a grains industry and a grain handling and 
transportation system do we want as we turn the century and 
look toward the future.
<P>
	Let us begin planning and working together now to develop 
that system so that when we get to the turn of the century we 
have positioned our country in the most advantageous way to 
take advantage of our marketing opportunities around the world.
<P>
	Our meeting on Monday in Winnipeg is partly to deal with this 
initial urgent situation on the west coast and partly to begin that 
process of looking toward the future and building toward the 
future in the kind of grain handling and transportation and 
marketing system we want to have by the year 2000.
<P>
	Let me just say a word about orderly marketing. That has been 
a very vital topic of discussion from time to time in this House 
and in the standing committee on agriculture.
<P>
<B>(1035 ) </B>
<P>
	One of the great success stories in the Canadian agri-food 
sector over the last few decades has been the supply 
management concept that was invented by a previous Liberal 
government about a quarter of a century ago. Supply 
management has helped the agri-food sector in eastern Canada, 
especially Quebec, to prosper.
<P>
	Knowing how important supply management is to the Atlantic 
provinces, Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia, our 
government made a very special effort to ensure that it is 
protected under the new international trade regime. We will 
have to make some changes to supply management in the wake 
of the GATT just as we expect other countries will have to adjust 
some of their practices and systems to conform with the new 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
<P>
	The agreement that we achieved in Geneva and signed in 
Marrakech allows us to impose strong tariffs in place of what 
used to be import border controls. Those systems of tariff 
equivalents will ensure that our orderly marketing systems can 
continue to function successfully in this country for as long as 
we domestically want them to do so.
<P>
	Quite apart from the GATT there are other changes that will be 
required in our supply management systems if those systems are 
to thrive into the future and to contribute effectively to 
economic growth.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4098"> 4098 </A></B>
<P>
	We need to find a new domestic consensus on how our supply 
management system should operate, a consensus that removes 
some of the rigidities that are currently threatening to destroy 
the supply management system from within, never mind any 
international trade rule changes. Perhaps the largest challenge to 
our system is not international but in fact domestic and finding 
that domestic political will and that domestic consensus to allow 
our systems to function into the future.
<P>
	My parliamentary secretary, the hon. member for Prince 
Edward-Hastings, is heading a small federal-provincial 
industry task force on orderly marketing that will make 
recommendations to federal and provincial ministers of 
agriculture when we meet in Winnipeg in July.
<P>
	That task force has been hard at work since last January. We 
have already received one interim report from the task force. 
The work has been well received to date. Obviously more 
remains to be done. My provincial colleagues and I are anxious 
to receive the final output from the task force process so that we 
can position ourselves to meet the GATT requirements well in 
advance of the implementation dates in 1995.
<P>
	I want to say a word about food safety and security. Canadians 
have been blessed over the years with the world's best and safest 
food supply. Our platform promised to maintain this standard of 
excellence.
<P>
	Maintaining our exceptionally high food safety record and 
our internationally recognized animal and plant disease status is 
critical to consumer and foreign customer confidence in food 
supply. It is an essential selling point in marketing our agri-food 
products both at home and abroad.
<P>
	My department's food production and inspection branch is 
working now with industry on a business plan that will ensure 
the health and safety of our food supply while at the same time 
trying to improve efficiency.
<P>
	At present the federal, provincial and municipal levels of 
government all have a role to play in food inspection. The 
responsibility is further divided among agriculture and food 
departments, health departments and consumer and corporate 
affairs departments.
<P>
	We are seeking a national inspection system that would 
streamline delivery among all of the various jurisdictions and 
inspection agencies. It would also provide equal treatment for 
imported products which under current rules sometimes escape 
inspection.
<P>
	We will not compromise on the excellent food safety record 
that Canada enjoys but I believe we can reduce costs and better 
help our industry to compete.
<P>
	The motion before the House today also deals with the 
environment. There is no subject more important over the long 
haul than the environment. When future generations write the 
history of this century, they will look back at our generation and 
judge how we have discharged our responsibilities to maintain 
the  environment that we inherited. More than any other 
generation that has gone before us we have it in our power to 
ensure the sustainability of our environment. We can no longer 
claim ignorance of the consequences of our actions.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	Our agri-food platform placed a high priority on conserving 
our soil and water resources. It stressed the importance of 
integrating economic and environmental goals. Now we are 
working with all interested parties to do just that, to develop 
long term approaches to sustainable agriculture that integrate 
our environmental goals and our economic and social goals.
<P>
	Our rural areas and farming communities must be safe, 
healthy and vital places now and long into the future. These long 
term approaches will guide us as we develop a new national soil 
and water conservation program. This involves reviewing our 
programs on the economic side, for example, for their 
environmental impacts. It involves continuing to help our 
agri-food industry acquire the environmentally sound input 
products, technologies and practices that the sector needs to 
meet our goals for a sustainable industry.
<P>
	In this regard I am working now on improvements to the 
present regime governing pesticide availability and use in 
Canada. Again, my parliamentary secretary is playing a large 
role in this endeavour to ensure that Canadian producers are not 
placed at a competitive disadvantage in the marketplace.
<P>
	Alongside our concern about the environment and our desire 
to be competitive and to reach out into global markets goes our 
very great emphasis on research and development in Canadian 
agriculture. There are those who might believe that R and D is a 
kind of exotic frill that you throw aside when times get tough 
and hope you can pick up again when you are feeling more 
affluent. But science, research and development are not 
something you can turn on and off like a tap. It requires 
persistency and consistency of focus and effort and financing.
<P>
	That is why in dealing with the budget for the Department of 
Agriculture for the current year, while we have had to absorb the 
same kind of restraint that applies to every government 
department across the board, in making our spending and 
priority and allocation decisions we have tried very hard to 
retain our emphasis on research and development, absorbing 
some deeper cuts elsewhere in order to preserve R and D. I think 
we have been able to do that in the budget for 1994-95.
<P>
	In addition to that we are launching some new initiatives with 
the private sector, some joint ventures in research and 
development funding with the private sector to leverage more 
private dollars into agricultural science. We are thereby 
building the pot bigger and deeper for the funding that is 
necessary for research and development in this vital part of the 
Canadian economy. Only by being on the leading edge of 
international  science will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4099"> 4099 </A></B>
<P>
we be able to retain our position on the leading edge 
economically of agriculture and agri-food in the world.
<P>
	I want to say a brief word about rural renewal. That is a 
responsibility that falls to me under the mandate given to me by 
the Prime Minister. Shortly after the election he asked that I 
establish within my department a rural renewal secretariat to 
provide a focus within government and between governments 
for rural issues and rural people. That rural renewal secretariat 
is now up and running within my department.
<P>
	Part of its job is to co-ordinate the activities of the federal 
government on issues that relate to rural Canada. Part of the job 
is to act as a liaison between federal departments, between the 
federal government and the provinces and between governments 
and a whole range of agencies and organizations in the private 
sector so that we can clearly identify the thrust that we want to 
achieve on behalf of rural Canada.
<P>
<B>(1045 ) </B>
<P>
	Within my department a variety of programs bear on the 
question of rural renewal. There is of course the system of farm 
debt review boards across the country. There is the farm 
business management program. There is the Canadian rural 
transition program. There is the rural opportunities initiative. 
There is also the Farm Credit Corporation which has, as of last 
year, undergone an expansion in its mandate to make it more 
flexible in dealing with issues that relate to financing in rural 
Canada.
<P>
	There are also other related agencies such as the PFRA, the 
Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration, which has a long 
history stretching back to the 1930s in western Canada in rural 
development and rural renewal. There is also the co-operatives 
secretariat within my department as a method by which 
government can bring a special focus on the co-operative 
movement and how co-operatives, especially in rural Canada, 
can be involved in economic development, renewal, growth and 
jobs in the future.
<P>
	I have established for myself an agenda for the balance of this 
year to review all of these various programs and initiatives that 
already exist within government to determine whether they are 
achieving the objectives that were originally established for 
them and to try to bring to all of these programs, agencies and 
initiatives a clear, sharp focus on the real issues of rural renewal 
and adaptation in rural communities. We will be focusing 
especially on value added, community based, economic 
diversification and development as an augmentation, if you will, 
to mainstream agricultural programming and policy. We want to 
have this special focus on the opportunities and the future for 
rural Canada.
<P>
	Last October Canadians put their trust in this new 
government. Of all of the options available during the election, 
Canadians decided we were best equipped to lead Canada at this 
crucial time in our history.
<P>
	In one of my first addresses as Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food I told members of the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool last 
fall that we could not be all things to all people. We would be a 
sincere and honest government that would work very hard to 
earn the public's trust and try to be down to earth, fiscally 
responsible, open, accessible and accountable.
<P>
	I also said that as minister I want to be a pragmatic problem 
solver. I do not want to get hung up on dogma or philosophy. I 
want to put myself in a position to act in the best interest of 
farmers and the Canadian agri-food sector. That is still very 
much my approach and the government's approach.
<P>
	As I have travelled across the country in the last six months I 
have been struck by what I sense is a new feeling of optimism 
and confidence among Canadians and among farmers. I believe 
that Canadians generally support the direction that the 
government has taken in its first six months in office.
<P>
	I believe that if we continue to implement our agri-food 
platform as described in the red book at the time of the election, 
four years from now our agri-food sector will have taken its 
place, as this motion before the House today suggests, as among 
the best in the world.
<P>
	In closing I want to thank and to pay tribute to the members of 
my caucus, especially the rural members, who have been so 
vigilant, hard working and constructive in their pursuit of good 
agriculture policy. They are making a very solid contribution as 
they represent the vital interests of their constituents. I thank 
them very much for that hard effort.
<P>
	I also want to invite the members of the opposition to play a 
positive role as well. No doubt we will come at some issues from 
very different perspectives, but I hope the bottom line will be 
that we all have the best interests of Canadian agriculture at 
heart.
<P>
<B>(1050 ) </B>
<P>
	In the debate today and in all agriculture debates I hope we 
can set aside the partisan bickering, avoid the rhetoric and cheap 
shots and focus instead on the real issues. I want to assure 
members of the opposition that positive advice offered 
constructively will get a fair hearing from me no matter where in 
the House it comes from.
<P>
	Having said that, I look forward to listening to the debate 
today. I hope it will make a positive contribution to the 
development of agriculture and agri-food policy for Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	Before I take my seat I would advise the House that cabinet is 
meeting this morning and I may have to slip away in a few 
minutes to participate in the cabinet meeting. I hope members 
will understand that does not represent on my part any 
disinterest in what is going to be said today in this debate. I will 
only be absent for a few moments and will be following the 
debate very closely through the balance of the day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> I rise on a point of order, Madam Speaker, to ask 
unanimous consent of the House to ask questions of the 
agriculture minister.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I wonder if the minister 
heard your point of order. He has just said he had to leave for 
cabinet. Do we have unanimous consent for the minister to stay 
for questions?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it is a great honour for me to speak on agriculture.
<P>
	I extend my best wishes to the Minister of Agriculture on his 
return from his Asian trip. He has returned determined to act in 
the agricultural sector. I know that this is a very difficult field in 
which to work, and I also know that the Minister is beyond 
reproach, a person of high calibre in the world of agriculture.
<P>
	This motion that the government is proposing to us today, 
dealing with agriculture and agri-food in Canada, must be read 
carefully. It must be read very carefully because it is made up of 
mere generalizations about Canada's farm economy, good 
intentions, statements of fine and good intentions that, for the 
most part, hide the tough reality that this country's farmers are 
facing.
<P>
	It is fine with me if the government is bursting with fine and 
good intentions about agriculture and if, through its Minister, it 
makes promising statements about agricultural development; 
but can the spinelessness, the inertia, the near-paralysis that this 
government has shown in several fields since being elected 
barely six months ago be hidden? Can the iniquity that the 
federal government has shown toward Quebec for many long 
years be hidden?
<P>
	In the motion we are debating today, for example, we read, 
and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House take note of the proactive work that the government is 
doing- to enhance the agriculture and agri-food sector of Canada's 
economy-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	But I ask you, Madam Speaker, what proactive work has this 
government done lately? Is it the signing of the GATT, which 
from several standpoints has been a deep disappointment for 
Canada's supply-managed sectors, and which has produced for 
us, among other things, a worrisome situation in the poultry 
sector? Is it the studies and reports, however manifold, by the 
kindly officials at Agriculture Canada? Is it the objective of 
increasing  Canadian exports by 50 per cent in order to reach $20 
billion by the year 2000?
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I am quite prepared to be optimistic, like 
Canada's Minister of Agriculture, and it is quite all right with 
me if his fine intentions bear fruit, but all his fine words hide 
another reality: we must not ignore the fact that agriculture, in 
both the western and eastern parts of this country, is 
experiencing many significant, serious structural difficulties.
<P>
	For example, the Minister has just trumpeted the fact that he 
spent three weeks in Asia to stimulate Canadian farm exports. In 
fact, the Minister signed one single contract with Korea: one 
small contract for 50,000 tonnes of feed grains, with a country 
that has been an established export market for Canada for 
several years. The Minister hastened to tell us that he has 
developed, in addition to this small firm contract, several new 
export possibilities; I stress that they are new export 
possibilities only, with no firm contracts.
<P>
	Elsewhere, when we read the media dispatches recounting the 
ups and downs of his trip, what strikes us most clearly are the 
criticisms by the Japanese and Chinese of Canada's grain 
transportation system. That is no small thing, coming from the 
Japanese and the Chinese, and at a time when we in Canada want 
to expand our Asian markets. These longstanding customers had 
so many doubts about our western Canadian grain transportation 
system that the Chinese, in particular, did not sign a new wheat 
contract, and the Japanese decided to look elsewhere, to the 
Australians, for their canola supply; until now, Canada had a 
near-monopoly in canola exports to Japan.
<P>
	All this happened because, in 1994, Canada has a grain 
transportation system that is no more effective than it was in 
1908. Is this a reasonable objective, then: is it reasonable to 
increase Canadian farm exports by 50 per cent in order to reach 
$20 billion by the year 2000 while, right now, we are incapable 
of meeting existing contracts because there is a crisis in 
transportation on the Prairies, costing the entire Canadian 
economy a great deal of money? This year alone, $35 million 
will be spent in demurrage costs of ships waiting to load in the 
port of Vancouver.
<P>
	Canada has already lost sales of approximately 200 million 
tonnes of wheat because of this ineffective and poorly-run 
transportation system. Listen, getting to and from the port of 
Vancouver by train is, on average, no faster today than it was 80 
years ago. That does not mean that it is not in Canada's interest 
to increase its exports to Asia. That is even desirable, but if we 
use plain common sense, should we not first ensure that we have 
an adequate transportation system enabling us to meet our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4101"> 4101 </A></B>
<P>
existing contracts with foreign countries before compromising 
ourselves in contracts we will be unable to meet?
<P>
	That is as if a business person were trying to double his or her 
customers while not being able to meet the demand from present 
customers. That thinking shows a certain lack of logic. We can 
also wonder what Agriculture Canada, the federal government, 
and the Department of Transport are doing about grain 
transportation, because this system has been ineffective for 
more than a decade. It has not been ineffective for only a few 
months, as the Minister said.
<P>
	In the 1970s I was an assistant to one of the greatest ministers 
in Canada's history, Mr. Eugene Whelan, and the grain 
transportation problem existed then too.
<P>
	There have been at least three separate federal statutes, two 
government agencies, two departments, and several other 
interested parties governing grain transportation: such an 
administrative mishmash that one wonders whether any 
planning has taken place.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	At least, it is obvious that no one can take responsibility for 
the present crisis. Mr. Warren Joly of the Western Canadian 
Wheat Growers' Association said, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association said: ``We 
are in this mess because of a disastrous policy and now we are 
trying to address it with an inefficient, knee-jerk system''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The minister has received a dozen suggestions for improving 
the system, a very inefficient system. I would even be tempted to 
ask him to set up a commission of inquiry to find long-term 
solutions to setting up a transportation system in the West that 
would meet the needs of Canadians.
<P>
	And to think that in spite of the crisis the port in Thunder Bay 
and the St. Lawrence are not used at full capacity. Over the past 
ten years their use has decreased by nearly 50 per cent. In fact, 
the seaway is steadily losing quantities of grain to the detriment 
of eastern ports. Since 1984, the amount of grain transshipped 
has dropped from 12 million to 6 million tonnes. However, a 
Great Laker can carry an amount equivalent to 250 railway cars, 
and the turnaround time in Thunder Bay is four days shorter than 
it is in Vancouver.
<P>
	According to Mr. Glen Stewart, president of the St. Lawrence 
Seaway Authority, the Western Grain Transportation Act 
encourages pouring grain into the Pacific ports, and this is 
detrimental to the St. Lawrence. The situation is understandable 
up to a point, because we do have more clients now in the Orient 
than we do in Europe. But this does not explain how grains going 
to Africa and Europe first go to Vancouver and are then sent 
through the Panama Canal. Even though there is a crisis in the 
western grain transportation system, only 35 per cent of the 
grain goes through Thunder Bay and the St. Lawrence.
<P>
	Are we to conclude that Agriculture Canada is unable to 
develop a good western transportation system, or must we 
conclude that Agriculture Canada is promoting western 
agriculture to the detriment of the east? Canadian products are 
of high quality and world renowned, but it is obvious that 
Agriculture Canada, a part of this federal government, is doing a 
less than satisfactory job.
<P>
	As a department, Agriculture Canada has a long history. 
Initially, its primary responsibility was to ensure western 
development and, to some extent, Agriculture Canada's 
attention has remained focussed on the interests of western 
Canada. Frequently, this duty to promote western development 
was carry out in a manner that was extremely prejudicial to the 
interests of Quebec.
<P>
	We just have to look at the estimates for Agriculture Canada 
over the past 10 or 15 years. In 1980, for example, Quebec 
received $300 million from the federal government, and the 
west, that is, the prairie provinces, received $1 billion-55 per 
cent of Agriculture Canada's budget. In 1987, Quebec received 
$410 million, while the West received $4 billion-76 per cent of 
the total budget. Last year, Quebec received $372 million, while 
the West received $1.5 billion-more than 50 per cent of 
Agriculture Canada's budget.
<P>
	The federal government's unfair treatment of Quebec is 
demonstrated in a variety of ways.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	In the 1980s, for instance, federal spending went up eight 
times faster in the West than it did in Quebec. In 1987, Quebec 
contributed more than $1 billion in taxes for the development of 
western agriculture. Quebec spent twice as much money on 
western agriculture as it did on its own agriculture, through the 
Quebec government.
<P>
	Grosso modo, from 1980 to 1992, the amount of aid to the 
West increased from 42 per cent of the federal budget to nearly 
64 per cent, and the amount of aid to Quebec went from 30 per 
cent down to only 10 per cent; this means that the 25 per cent of 
Canadians who live in Quebec pay into a system that gives back 
only 10 per cent. This is not very profitable for farmers in 
Quebec.
<P>
	Speaking of grain transportation, why is it subsidized all the 
way to the Pacific going west, but only as far as Thunder Bay 
going east? And still speaking of transportation, why are so 
many railway lines being shut down in Quebec, on the pretext 
that they are not cost-efficient, while nearly 25,000 km of lines 
are maintained in the West, even if they are not cost-efficient, 
on the pretext that they are essential for the Canadian economy?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4102"> 4102 </A></B>
<P>
	Agricultural diversification is yet another situation where we 
find Quebec has been unfairly treated. While the federal 
government has been investing for many years in western 
diversification, Quebec has received nothing. Over the past ten 
years, the area used for potato crops in the West has increased 30 
per cent, while in Quebec, it has increased only 2 per cent. And I 
could add a number of other examples.
<P>
	In 1988, a report produced by the Coopérative fédérée du 
Québec, the Union des producteurs agricoles, and the Ministry 
of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, summed up perfectly the 
effects of the federal government's discriminatory policies 
toward Quebec by saying, and I quote: ``The inequitable policy 
affects the level of competitiveness of Quebec farmers in 
comparison with their counterparts in the West, particularly in 
terms of grain and livestock production. Canada's agricultural 
policy contributes to the displacement of livestock production 
from the east to the west of the country''.
<P>
	A further illustration of Agriculture Canada's feeble defence 
of Quebec's interests is the case of Grand Pré milk, produced by 
the Groupe Lactel. Grand Pré milk has been sold in Puerto Rico 
for 15 years, accounting for 40 per cent of the Puerto Rican 
market. In 1991, the Americans changed the health standards. 
Grand Pré milk lost this lucrative market.
<P>
	A change in health standards was tantamount to the 
Americans' imposing a non-tariff barrier on us. In spite of this, 
the federal government did not respond. They could have taken 
certain measures, but they decided to do nothing, and their 
inaction led to the consequences I mentioned.
<P>
	Why did the federal government not take action to protect a 
sector that was lucrative for Quebec, whereas in other 
sectors-there are many examples-the federal government 
took immediate action, such as the recent case, for example, of 
American beer in Ontario. In this case, the federal government 
responded very quickly in protecting the interests of breweries 
in Ontario. The interests of Quebec do not prompt the same 
response in the Department of Agriculture.
<P>
	The most recent example of the government's spinelessness 
and inertia is, of course, the GATT. Article XI of the GATT was 
important for producers working under a quota system and of 
extreme importance to Quebec, since 42 per cent of its 
agricultural monetary earnings come from such products.
<P>
	The Minister had promised to protect article XI, but he came 
back empty-handed with nothing but tariffs that are supposed to 
have the same effect, but that bring the whole supply 
management system into question again. We can see its effects 
in the poultry sector; a trade war has arisen between Quebec and 
Ontario.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	With the new tariffs, farmers will have to adapt to an entirely 
new system within six years. That is a very short time for those 
farmers.
<P>
	Earlier, the Minister of Agriculture was telling us how he 
wanted to negotiate with the Americans, sector by sector, 
following the GATT agreement. In fact, that is not what he is 
doing; he is negotiating a package deal with the Americans 
because, when all is said and done, he has not succeeded in 
establishing clear directives under the GATT. Even the new 
tariffs of 300 to 350 per cent have succeeded in flooring 
consumers once again: they have the impression that they are 
paying too much for their food products when that is not the 
case.
<P>
	In its negotiations with the United States, Canada seems to 
want to fold once again where products affecting Quebec, 
including ice cream and yogurt, are concerned. According to all 
reports on the negotiations, Canadians appear to be giving the 
Americans greater access to the Canadian ice cream and yogurt 
market, in order to protect the volume of wheat exports from the 
West. Is this not another case in which Quebec comes out the 
loser in federal agricultural negotiations?
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is warning the federal government. We 
will never agree that the interests of farmers in eastern Canada 
should be sacrificed in order to allow better access to the 
American market for Canadian durum wheat. We will oppose 
any tradeoffs between the regions in order to reach an agreement 
with the Americans.
<P>
	Agriculture Canada appears to have a carefree and careless 
attitude toward the development of agriculture in Canada. That 
attitude is surely not the fault of the present Minister. And we 
are well aware that agriculture is not a very easy sector of 
activity. No doubt the present Minister has many problems with 
his party, because it seems that, when agricultural issues arise, 
they are always set aside or not given as much attention as issues 
affecting other sectors. So it is not the fault of the present 
Minister, but we have a system that seeks to make cuts to farm 
programs, at a time when great changes are taking place in 
agriculture.
<P>
	Basically, Agriculture Canada is operating in a laxist mode, 
letting market forces take over. Instead of protecting farmers 
and encouraging the infrastructure in order to increase the 
number of farmers, it lets market forces take over and seems to 
encourage the largest integrated companies that have ever more 
control over the agricultural sector. This means that farmers will 
eventually become employees, not independent managers. It 
should be noted that farmers have very low incomes and work an 
abnormally high number of hours, and that 73 per cent of them 
declared off-farm income in order to supplement their income.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4103"> 4103 </A></B>
<P>
	Half of the farmers' wives have no income for the work they 
do on the farm, because farm businesses do not generate enough 
income. Farmers are not rich operators. In 1992, nearly 22 per 
cent of farms lost money. This trend toward loss of income and 
loss of farms is part of a longstanding pattern. There are fewer 
and fewer farmers in Canada, and active farmers are less and 
less well off financially. It cannot be said that this is a passing 
phenomenon; it is a trend that has been evident for a some years.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	Who then can say that farmers are well served by Agriculture 
Canada? Surely not Quebec farmers. How can the government 
claim in the motion before us today that it is contributing to the 
well-being of farmers and to job creation?
<P>
	This government, which claims to be concerned about the 
well-being of farmers, is in the process of dealing another blow 
to the farm economy. A tax on food, a proposal currently being 
discussed by the government, could have a disastrous effect on 
farmers. Imposing a tax on agriculture, which is already in an 
extremely tenuous situation, would be tantamount to taking an 
additional one billion out of farmers' pockets. One billion more 
to be subsidized by farmers. As a result, a great many of them 
could be forced into bankruptcy.
<P>
	Despite the uncaring and unfair attitude of the federal 
government, Quebec farmers have rallied solidly behind their 
association, the UPA, and have shown that they can compete on 
world markets. They are eagerly looking forward to Quebec's 
sovereignty because they already know that the money Quebec 
spends to support agriculture in Canada will be available for 
Quebec farmers. In view of the federal government's actions 
over the past ten or fifteen years, Quebec farmers have had to 
band together and build a strong organization. The way in which 
they have organized themselves has proven to be the envy of 
other provincial farm organizations. Their organizational ability 
is their strength.
<P>
	Farmers also realize that they will be the first ones to benefit 
from sovereignty since the Quebec government will then have 
money to spend in the regions. It will begin by shoring up the 
regions with money from new taxes and it will ensure that 
structures and support systems for farmers are in place. This 
group will be first in line to benefit from this situation and that is 
why they are eagerly looking forward to this day. They have 
already established several organizations in anticipation of 
sovereignty.
<P>
	At a Montreal gathering in 1991, farmers recognized the 
importance of decentralization. They called for powers to be 
redistributed from the top down to give regions more autonomy 
and more decision-making authority. I am confident that this 
will prove to be the strength of Quebec farmers.
<P>
	In conclusion, I have to say that the government's motion, 
however well-intentioned it may be, is full of  oversights and 
neglects the problems which Quebec farmers are facing. I am 
proud of Quebec's farming community and I know that it will be 
the first to benefit from the money flowing from Quebec 
sovereignty.

	<B>Mr. Easter:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The 
minister made it clear this morning that he would not get caught

that is more a point of debate than it is a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Madam Speaker, I thank 
the minister for this open debate on agriculture, a debate which 
is truly needed.
<P>
	I believe that government involvement in agriculture over the 
past 20 years has created one disaster after another. I say this 
with absolutely no intent to attach blame or to point a finger but 
rather to emphasize the need for well-focused changes in the 
direction and the relationship among government, farmers and 
agri-business.
<P>
	I appreciate the minister's speech this morning and I agree 
with much of what he said. The real test of course is in the 
interpretation. It is my greatest hope that his interpretation is at 
least similar to mine.
<P>
	We urgently need a change in the direction of our agriculture 
policy. We must all put aside partisan politics and old 
disagreements and work together toward policies which 
demonstrate that we have learned from the mistakes of the past 
and recognize the new realities of the future. When I say we, I 
mean everyone who has a stake in agriculture at all. This 
includes farmers, businesses which buy, sell or process farm 
products, government agencies and regulatory bodies and the 
various levels of government.
<P>
	I must also stress the need for all members to really listen to 
the ideas presented by the members of the other political parties. 
One thing I know for sure is that we all have the best interests of 
farmers in mind as we go through this debate today. I have no 
doubt about that at all.
<P>
	Because we are all sincere I believe we owe it to each other 
and to the people we represent to try not to distort the intent or 
the proposals and the ideas that each of us present here today.
<P>
	Farmers tell me that they are frustrated with farming because 
they have little control over their business and have too few 
choices when it comes to buying and selling. They feel they have 
too little control over factors such as unfair restrictions and 
access to markets due to trade wars between Europe and the 
United States and unfair import restrictions into Japan and 
Korea; a grain handling and transportation system which fails 
them  again and again and is much too expensive; safety net 
programs which do not work well and are ever-changing caus-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4104"> 4104 </A></B>
<P>
ing instability; and high taxes and high input costs which make it 
difficult to compete.
<P>
	They feel they have too few choices because marketing 
systems restrict their options and because overregulation limits 
their ability to find alternatives to dysfunctioning programs. 
With these concerns in mind I will briefly outline the principles 
which guide Reform agriculture policy.
<P>
	Canada's agriculture policy should focus on allowing a 
self-reliant, market driven industry to develop. Reformers 
believe that all sectors of agriculture can be competitive if given 
a fair environment in which to operate both within Canada and in 
the world marketplace.
<P>
	The role of government in this market driven industry is 
twofold. First is to provide market responsive education and 
training, infrastructure and regulation which will allow farmers 
and the rest of the agriculture industry to become and remain 
self-reliant. Second is to support and defend farmers and 
agri-business against situations over which they have little 
control such as unfair foreign subsidies, trade distorting 
influences and certain natural hazards.
<P>
	Government should not be a partner with farmers or 
agri-business because government has proven very clearly in 
the past that it is a partner that farmers cannot afford and one 
that cannot be trusted.
<P>
	During my speech today I will present an overview of Reform 
agriculture policies under the headings of safety nets, marketing 
reforms, transportation and grain handling, research and market 
development, and creating a healthy business environment for 
agriculture.
<P>
	As I present our policy I will point out specific examples of 
lessons we can learn from certain policy initiatives of the past 20 
years. Emphasis will be placed on the need to reduce regulation 
and legislation which has a negative impact on the industry by 
limiting options.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	Also there is a need to reduce overlap between federal 
departments that affect agriculture, between the federal 
government and other levels of government, and between 
government and industry. Removing regulations and reducing 
overlap will reduce the size of government and reduce costs. 
Removing these hurdles, barriers and red tape will also increase 
the bottom line for farmers and agri-business.
<P>
	Increasing farmers' profit margins will reduce the draw on 
safety net programs. Government involvement in safety net 
programs may be necessary to support and defend farmers 
against the negative effects of circumstances over which they 
have little or no control. These situations arise from foreign 
subsidies and other trade distorting actions, natural hazards and 
to some extent market cycles which occur in the open market.  
Safety nets must be market neutral and available in an equitable 
way to all sectors of the industry.
<P>
	To this end, Reform has proposed three safety net programs: 
first, a trade distortion adjustment program; second, an income 
stabilization program; and third, an improved crop insurance 
program. We also propose keeping the Advance Payments for 
Crop Act to reduce the cash crunch induced selling in the fall, 
and vigorously enforcing countervail duties where dumping can 
be demonstrated.
<P>
	The trade distortion adjustment program would compensate 
farmers from all sectors for damage done by subsidies in other 
countries, or limited access to markets through unfair import 
tariffs and the like. The program would include automatic 
triggering mechanisms based on the historic volume of exported 
products. It will not require producer premiums and will 
compensate farmers for a predetermined percentage of damage 
done by a subsidy on a competing commodity, or by unfair 
restrictions to market access.
<P>
	It is our sincere hope that future GATT agreements will 
eventually reduce the amount of funding needed under this 
safety net program.
<P>
	The Reform income stabilization program would shelter 
farmers in all sectors from the impact of market cycles which 
occur in an open market environment. This program could use 
NISA as its base, but would be modified and expanded in the 
following ways.
<P>
	It would apply to all commodities in all sectors, that is, it 
would involve the whole farm approach. Supply managed 
sectors will have access to this program as tariff levels are 
reduced enough that the uncertainty and the instability of the 
marketplace creep into their pricing system.
<P>
	Contributions would be based on gross margins in a way 
which would apply fairly across all sectors. The 3 per cent 
interest bonus would be replaced by tax deductible 
contributions.
<P>
	The total level of government matched and unmatched funds 
will be subject to a regenerative cap which will be equitably 
applied across all sectors. There will be no limit on the level of 
contribution per farm unit so we would not discriminate based 
on size.
<P>
	Upon a farmer's retirement these funds may be transferable to 
an RRSP or a RRIF.
<P>
	The Reform Party also proposes as a part of the safety net 
package an improved crop insurance program to protect against 
some of the damage caused by natural hazards. The 
requirements of this program are: getting enough farmers 
involved in a particular area to make it administratively sound; 
maintaining present federal-provincial farmer funding 
arrangements and being actuarially sound within that 
arrangement; providing all risk yield loss protection; and a 
nationally consistent design across all sectors.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4105"> 4105 </A></B>
<P>
	In implementing these or similar programs there are some 
important lessons we can learn from past and present programs.
<P>
	Take GRIP, please. I have heard this a lot over the past few 
weeks from my constituents. There are more holes in GRIP than 
there are gopher holes in Saskatchewan, and that is a substantial 
number.
<P>
	I could spend the rest of my time complaining about the flaws 
and problems with GRIP, but I know that most members already 
understand these problems and see the flaws. Besides, it would 
definitely ruin my day, probably everyone's day. Let us not get 
into finger pointing, but let us make sure we learn the lessons 
that have to be learned from programs like GRIP.
<P>
	That is a brief summary of our safety net proposals. As for 
marketing reforms, we believe they are required to allow 
farmers to build more profitable, self-reliant industry.  The 
Reform Party supports the right of farmers to form and operate 
co-operatives, commissions and marketing boards, as long as 
these bodies receive their direction from the farmers they serve. 
Farmers must be free to build a viable, self-reliant, market 
driven industry in which they can make their own decisions 
about how products are marketed. Government need only 
provide the basic rules and minimum scrutiny of these groups.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	Most of the farm organizations and marketing boards in place 
could continue to operate under the policy we are proposing. 
Some organizations will however need substantial changes to 
make them work well in the world marketplace. Two examples 
are the Canadian Wheat Board and supply management.
<P>
	There is substantial support across the prairies for major 
reform of the Canadian Wheat Board. Farmers feel stifled and 
unfairly limited by the monopolistic powers of the board. While 
there is considerable support for maintaining some aspects of 
the Canadian Wheat Board, farmers want the ability to bypass 
the board when they feel it is not doing a good job of marketing 
or when they see better opportunities which they can access 
either directly or through a grain company.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board then should be reformed in the 
following ways. First, farmers should control the board. A board 
of directors should be elected by farmers and replace the 
appointed commissioners. This board of directors could choose 
to keep all or some of the commissioners. Those who argue that 
the wheat board advisory committee already gives farmers some 
control over the Canadian Wheat Board are wrong because the 
wheat board advisory committee has absolutely no power.
<P>
	Second, the mandate of the Canadian Wheat Board should be 
expanded to include any grains, oilseeds or specialty crops that 
it chooses to handle, but farmers must be allowed to compete 
with the board through grain companies or directly.
<P>
	The third change to the Canadian Wheat Board would be that 
farmers have the right to choose between a pool price or a daily 
cash price. Some of the current wheat board powers should be 
maintained, for example the power to pay out advance payments 
on grain and the power to provide loan guarantees as long as 
other countries continue to use this practice.
<P>
	I have received a few form letters from people worried that I 
am proposing the abolition of the Canadian Wheat Board. Of 
course that is not my intent or the intent of Reform. I want to 
take this time to assure them that I do not believe the wheat 
board should be abolished but rather improved to serve farmers 
better. Farmers want more choices and they must be given more 
choices.
<P>
	I believe these changes to the Canadian Wheat Board will 
increase the price farmers get from the marketplace. This 
increase in market revenue will reduce payments needed for the 
safety net programs.
<P>
	Since the first Reform task force met in 1990, of which I was a 
member, Reformers recognize that with new GATT deals supply 
managed sectors will need to adjust to freer trade within a global 
marketplace.
<P>
	As a farmer it has been extremely difficult for me to watch as 
governments have pretended supply management can remain as 
it is. This stand has been taken mainly for political purposes and 
is a disservice to supply managed farmers. It is time for 
politicians to be open and honest with farmers from the supply 
managed sectors and help them prepare for the reality that as 
tariff levels drop they will be forced to compete especially with 
American producers.
<P>
	On a positive note, a huge American market will open up to 
Canadian farmers. The extremely high tariff levels currently 
allowed under the GATT agreement will most likely be reduced 
at a faster rate than is projected right now. The free trade 
agreements, pressure from the Americans, and possibly new 
GATT agreements will cause this accelerated reduction in 
tariffs.
<P>
	Canadian supply managed farmers can compete with anyone 
in the world if they are given the opportunity to do so. I 
encourage the government to do what is right instead of what is 
politically easy. I encourage the government to prepare supply 
managed farmers and to allow them to prepare themselves for 
the new challenges and opportunities ahead.
<P>
	I would like to talk a bit now about what is wrong with the 
transportation and grain handling system. Simply put, it does 
not accomplish what needs to be done, that is move farmers' 
grain. It is one of the most heavily regulated parts of the 
agriculture industry. There is too much legislation and too many 
bodies involved to properly manage the system. There are no 
incentives or penalties in place to make it work better.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
	A few days ago there were about 1,000 cars of canola meal 
sitting near Lloydminster. Why, at a time when the industry 
desperately needs more cars to deal with the problems in moving 
grain, should there be 1,000 cars sitting on a siding near 
Lloydminster? I will bet a brand new pair of cowboy boots that if 
the system had the incentives and the penalties in place this 
1,000 car mistake would have never happened. Or, if by chance 
it did, it certainly would have been dealt with very quickly. We 
need the incentives and the penalties.
<P>
	At the joint agriculture and transportation subcommittee 
meetings on grain held last week there were two interesting 
proposals for dealing with this highly regulated and 
overadministered system.
<P>
	The Grain Workers Union suggested that there be a czar who 
would be a type of overseer for the entire system. While the GTA 
was intended to be that czar it did not succeed partly because of 
interference from the Canadian Wheat Board. We tried the czar 
solution and it has not worked, at least so far.
<P>
	The second proposal came from United Grain Growers. It 
suggested deregulating the industry and putting into place a 
system of initiatives and penalties to increase efficiency. 
However, when asked if a better solution would be to let 
railways take control of car allocations, the representative from 
UGG agreed.
<P>
	With these changes guidance would come from the National 
Transportation Act as it does for others involved in 
transportation. To make this work it would be necessary to put 
the Crow benefit directly in the hands of farmers, either through 
our trade distortion adjustment program, a similar program or 
some type of pay the producer option. This would be a more 
viable solution to persistent grain transportation problems.
<P>
	Reform's policy on transportation subsidy is to direct the 
Crow benefit into our trade distortion adjustment program. This 
takes care of the dilution problems that arise from some of the 
pay the producer options. Our policy will still provide for the 
benefits the pay the producer options provide by forcing the 
railways to become competitive. Furthermore, it will encourage 
more value added on the prairies through diversification and 
further processing. If the government were serious about jobs it 
would pursue a method of giving farmers control over the 
transportation dollars. That would create real jobs, long term 
jobs and productive jobs on the prairies.
<P>
	Reformers believe that the grain handling industry should be 
deregulated, that railways should be responsible for car 
allocation, and that they should be administered through the 
National Transportation Act.
<P>
	Problems in the grain handling part of the system contribute 
to problems in grain movement. Frequent and unnecessary 
strikes and lockouts have cost Canadian farmers through lost 
sales, demurrage, et cetera. Strikes should not be allowed in the 
grain handling system. A mechanism must be put in place to deal 
with labour disputes before a contract expires. This solution will 
work well for grain handling companies, for workers and most 
important, for western Canadian grain farmers.
<P>
	I would like to touch on two more areas in conclusion: 
research and development and creating a healthy business and 
trade environment. Research and development must be a top 
priority in any agriculture policy. Private industry depends on 
research and marketing agriculture products for its very 
existence. Therefore it is important that government work to 
co-ordinate its research with that of the private industry.
<P>
	The auditor general's report stated that there are over 800 
research projects funded by Agriculture Canada. These projects 
seem to be uncoordinated and improperly priorized. While 
Agriculture Canada has been moving in the direction of private 
industry guidelines, there is a need for more of the stimulus 
behind these research projects to come from the private sector.
<P>
	Reformers strongly support and promote an open market 
system as a type of economic system within which business 
operates best. Reformers recognize that to make an open market 
system work well there must be some regulation. The 
government's role is important in dealing with certain 
situations, for example unfair trade practices on the part of other 
countries. That is why Reform proposes much tougher 
anti-combines and fair competition legislation and recognizes 
the need to enforce import control regulations when dumping 
occurs. We believe this type of system works much better than 
the heavily regulated system of substantial government 
involvement that we currently have.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	In summary, having proposed these substantial agricultural 
reforms, my greatest concern is that the government has and will 
continue to make cuts in agriculture spending before it has 
released farmers from the burden of overregulation. For 
example, the government followed through with the 10 per cent 
cut to the Crow benefit which was implemented by the former 
government. This reduction in spending was not preceded by the 
necessary changes in regulation which would free up the 
transportation system and let farmers get around the heavily 
regulated system.
<P>
	I cannot stress enough the importance of getting farmers and 
farm related businesses more choices through less regulation 
and better co-ordinated programs as funding in agriculture is 
decreased. Better targeted spending with fewer and more 
co-ordinated programs will allow for further spending cuts of 
between $150 million and $200 million with about the same 
amount of money going to farmers.
<P>

<P>
	Once again, I thank the minister of agriculture for allowing 
this very important debate. I urge him to examine carefully the 
alternatives we present on this side of the House, as well as the 
alternatives from members of other political parties.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque):</B> Madam Speaker, I enjoyed 
listening to the remarks of the hon. member for Vegreville, but 
there was a considerable number of contradictions in them. I 
refer specifically to the case the member mentioned about 1,000 
cars of canola meal that sat on a siding in Lloydminster for a 
month. There is no question that was a problem for the 
transportation system.
<P>
	The member was talking about how well a deregulated system 
would work. In fact the reason those 1,000 cars sat on that siding 
was that some private individual or company tried to gain 
advantage for itself, was able to load those cars and get around 
the regulatory system. As it so happened the ship was not in port. 
The product could not be moved. While it was trying to obtain 
individual gains, complications for the system as a whole were 
caused.
<P>
	As the committee recommended, the rules under the Western 
Grain Transportation Act need to be applied more vigorously. 
The GTA did not do its job. In the regulatory system the rules 
and the penalties need to be applied. In its proactive way the 
subcommittee on transport and agriculture made the 
recommendations to get around the problem. I am sure the 
ministers will act on them next week.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Madam Speaker, I would have been very 
surprised if the hon. member had not stood and made a comment 
or two. I appreciate his comments.
<P>
	I see no contradiction in what I said about the cars sitting near 
Lloydminster. I have proposed in my speech that there should be 
a system of penalties and incentives in the system. Right now we 
have hopper cars that have been paid for by the taxpayers of 
Canada and by farmers directly through the Canadian Wheat 
Board. Yet there is no way the system can charge railway 
companies or shippers demurrage or some other kind of penalty 
for not using these cars properly. If we had that type of 
mechanism in place this absolute blatant abuse of the system 
would not happen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I agree with the member for Malpeque who listened 
closely, as I did, to the comments of the member for Vegreville.
<P>
	The comments were riddled with contradictions. One of the 
biggest was early in his remarks when he talked about the fact 
that governments should not be a partner with farmers or with 
agri-business. Then he went on to outline the Reform's 
three-point program which puts the government in partnership 
with farmers and agri-business. It did not make sense.
<P>
	Would the member qualify or further explain what he meant 
by saying that there should not be any partnership and why he 
called for a partnership?
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	At the same time I would like him to deal with the issue of the 
majority deciding an issue. Clearly in Saskatchewan the 
majority of farmers who attended government sponsored 
discussions on transportation, clearly those who have attended 
the conferences of the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, the National 
Farmers Union and other farm organizations in Saskatchewan 
have spoken in favour of the status quo for grain transportation 
and the maintenance of the Crow benefit.
<P>
	Yet the member who believes very strongly in letting the 
majority decide continues to argue that the interests of the large 
corporations and the large farmers should be put above the 
ordinary producers throughout Saskatchewan and other parts of 
the prairies.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member who speaks eloquently about 
agriculture and other issues to explain these things to me and 
other members of the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> Madam Speaker, I have never been accused of 
speaking eloquently before. I appreciate that very much.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vanclief:</B> But accused of other things.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> I have been accused of a lot of other things, that 
is right.
<P>
	First of all, in terms of the majority of farmers deciding, it is 
very simple to deal with. The hon. member feels he is right, I 
have a good feel for what the majority feels. Let us hold a 
plebiscite and decide the issue. It is as simple as that.
<P>
	In terms of a partnership, my concept of a partnership is two 
or more bodies that work very closely together and have equal 
control. I believe the safety net programs the Reform Party is 
proposing take that government control and interference out of 
the safety net mechanism, so it is not a partnership. This is 
money provided by taxpayers to help farmers deal with 
situations which are largely beyond their control. I think that is 
legitimate, but it is not a partnership, nor should we have a 
partnership.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food):</B> Madam Speaker, I hate to prolong 
this discussion on the contradictions in the hon. member's 
speech, but I do not know how we can do anything but.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4108"> 4108 </A></B>
<P>
	In one minute within his speech, as the previous member from 
the other side has just suggested to him, he goes on and on about 
government involvement. Then, as has been well said, the 
member for Vegreville certainly has not answered very well on 
how he separates his comments about no government 
involvement.
<P>
	It reminds me of a phone call I had from the hon. member's 
province two or three weeks ago. It was from an individual who 
said there had been a meeting of 150 randomly selected farmers. 
They did not want anything to do with supply management. 
They did not want anything to do with any type of organized 
marketing in any way, shape or form. They did not want 
anything to do with any government support. They did not want 
anything to do with the NISA program. I said: ``You do not want 
anything to do with government''. He said: ``That is right. All 
we want is government there if there is a trade war and if there is 
a weather problem''.
<P>
	I ask the member to comment on whether this is how he feels 
the government should be involved in support in a safety net 
program for agriculture. As I said to that gentleman, it seems he 
did not want to have fire insurance on his barn, but if it started to 
burn down he wanted the right to go to town and the insurance 
company would be obligated to sell him a policy at that time.
<P>
	Is that the way the hon. member thinks a government should 
plan ahead for the future of this important industry? We as a 
government are in the safety net. We are meeting with farmers. 
The majority of the people in the national safety net are key 
players, participants from the grassroots in putting that plan 
together, the task force on orderly marketing in the dairy, egg 
and poultry industries, all of the players involved in that 
industry are around the table.
<P>
	I suggest to the member that he notice what is being done. 
Government's role is to listen to opposition, listen to the 
grassroots and facilitate with the restrictions, legislation and 
financial restrictions in a responsible manner for the good of all 
Canadians. I would suggest that is being done.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoit:</B> I appreciate the comments from the hon. 
parliamentary secretary to the agriculture minister.
<P>
	For such a strong attack on what I said, I am not so sure that in 
the area of safety nets we have such different ideas. I guess that 
will be determined down the road.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	However, both prefer some kind of whole farm approach to 
the problem. I have never said no government involvement. I 
said this industry is tremendously overregulated. There is much 
too much government interference. We can get rid of a lot of it. I 
believe the safety net programs that I outlined will cut down on 
the amount of government involvement tremendously. It will 
take the market distortion out of the system that is there now.
<P>
	I did not want to get into the flaws of the GRIP program, but 
GRIP has just demonstrated almost everything that can go 
wrong with a government program. It really has. It was supposed 
to be market neutral and it is far from that. It encouraged farmers 
to grow wheat at a time when the market said not to grow wheat. 
There were flaws in the basic design of the program and there 
were lots of flaws in the administration and in the overlap of 
administration between the federal government and the 
provinces.
<P>
	GRIP is a program that interferes in farmers' business and in 
their decision making process way beyond what any government 
program should.
<P>
	I am saying there is a matter of degrees here. I assume with 
our difference in philosophy the programs the Liberal 
government comes up with to replace the programs in place now 
will involve too much government involvement but I am going 
to continue to give input along the way. Hopefully I can at least 
affect somewhat the outcome of this process.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil):</B> Madam Speaker, pursuant 
to Standing Order 43(2), I will be sharing my time with the 
member for Gatineau-La Lièvre.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I am delighted to speak in this debate on 
agriculture, since it is a subject of vital importance to my 
constituency of Vaudreuil, which is largely rural. Most of my 
constituents earn most of their living from agriculture: dairy 
farming and grain farming.
<P>
	Overall, agriculture in Canada and in Quebec is modern and 
efficient, very much thanks to the partnership established by the 
government and the agricultural community. These structures 
are the results of adaptation. In a context of ongoing change, this 
sector must continue to adapt. In its policies and programs, the 
Canadian government will continue to help this sector adapt to 
new market conditions and improve its competitiveness.
<P>
	Our government will maintain and even increase its strategic 
investments in research, infrastructure development and skills 
development. Partnership with the farming community and the 
provinces will help us determine the best way to use these 
resources. Partnership is essential if the industry as a whole is to 
take full advantage of the opportunities the new trade 
agreements offer.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The agri-food industry is a pillar for the Canadian economy. 
All Canadians and Quebecers profit from investments in this 
industry. Our government is committed to helping farmers in 
every region of Canada, but we must recognize that this kind of 
support comes in many different ways.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4109"> 4109 </A></B>
<P>
	The federal government's intention is to act in the best 
interests of the agri-food sector. This commitment applies just 
as well to farms in Quebec and in the prairies, for they are all 
essential elements in the whole Canadian agri-food system.
<P>
	Statistics do not reveal the whole picture and can often be 
deceiving. We must look beyond the numbers and the columns. 
Government support in the agri-food sector cannot be evaluated 
solely on direct payments to producers through various different 
programs. We must take into account indirect transfers such as 
research or market development and those governed by controls 
such as border control for quotas.
<P>
	Canada is recognized world-wide as a healthy and high 
quality agri-food producer and exporter. Agricultural producers 
across Canada profit from this fine reputation. Quebec's 
agri-food sector holds a predominant place within the Canadian 
economy. This is a very tangible factor, one which many regions 
seek to emulate.
<P>
	On average a Quebec producer earns the highest net income in 
the country. In 1993 the income produced by agriculture 
activities reached $3.8 billion. This represents 16 per cent of 
total Canadian revenues, while manufacturing brought in $11 
billion. In the last 12 years in financial terms, the global income 
of Quebec farmers has increased 67 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	In 1993 the value of Quebec's agri-food imports reached $1.2 
billion or 9 per cent of the total Canadian export market 
proceeds. Quebec's hog industry holds 32 per cent of the 
Canadian market and is the number one seller abroad. In 1992 it 
accounted for $294 million or 40 per cent of all Canadian 
exports in this sector.
<P>
	I am not taking into account the enormous potential of 
world-wide commercial markets. The hon. minister of 
agriculture has seen it himself when he recently travelled to 
Asia. Some of Quebec's industrial leaders such as the president 
of the Union des producteurs agricoles, Mr. Pellerin, and the 
president of the Coopérative fédérée de Québec, Mr. Massicotte, 
were part of the commercial delegation travelling with the hon. 
minister of agriculture.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There are 38,000 farms in Quebec; they help supply over 
1,000 processing plants and 12,000 food stores. Quebec 
agriculture and the Quebec agri-food industry account for 15 
per cent and 21 per cent respectively of Canada's gross domestic 
product in those sectors. Hundreds of thousands of 
jobs-415,00 jobs-depend on the Quebec agri-food sector: 
that figure represents 22 per cent of jobs in Canada's agri-food 
industry, and 14 per cent of all jobs in Quebec.
<P>
	In the processing sector, the Quebec food and beverage 
industry accounts for 25 per cent of the Canadian market. That is 
a vital market. Among Quebec manufacturing industries, the 
processing sector is in first place in terms of value added and 
deliveries, and in second place in terms of direct jobs.
<P>
	The processing sector has grown by 24 per cent in seven years. 
Nearly one-third of deliveries from the Quebec agri-food 
industry are destined for the rest of Canada. Agri-food sales to 
the provinces are three times higher than exports of the same 
products on world markets.
<P>
	It must be recognized that this success of Quebec's 
agriculture is the result of the work of the people in the 
agricultural community. The performance I have just 
highlighted, however, was made possible by the support of 
public administrations. Indeed, the two levels of government 
have been intimately linked to that prosperity. And, whatever 
the Opposition may say, the federal government plays a role of 
the utmost importance in the agri-food sector. It carries out its 
mandate in a fair manner, taking into account the special needs 
of each region in the country. We provide energetic support for 
the expansion of industry by working in partnership with the 
provinces, the sectors of this industry, and the farmers.
<P>
	Our income security programs, our research initiatives, our 
agreements with the provinces, our food inspection program, 
and our commitment to rural regions and to the environment are 
designed to ensure the vigour and growth of this industry. Our 
government works with the industry and the provinces in order 
to ensure long-term stability for producers. Together, we shall 
develop an income protection system that will meet the basic 
needs of all sectors without distorting market signals, a system 
that will allow farmers to make enlightened decisions based on 
co-operative advantage, not government programs.
<P>
	The agri-food sector is an important source of jobs and 
economic activity. That is not the result of chance, after all! The 
federal government is a key player.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	We have a role to play and we will play it, now and in the 
future. We will continue to help the industry to grow by setting 
up programs to promote the development of new products and 
new markets and improve productivity, programs to help 
processors, programs to promote training and programs to 
provide easier access to credit.
<P>
	As far as GATT is concerned, the rules may have changed 
somewhat, but the Canadian government has successfully 
negotiated an agreement that protects supply management and 
its foundations. The Canadian economy and the economy of 
Quebec will benefit substantially under the agreement 
concluded at the GATT talks, and it is also a good agreement for 
Canadian and Quebec agriculture. In the course of the GATT 
negotiations, the Canadian government was able to  obtain tariff 
levels that will ensure not only the survival of supply 
management, as I men-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4110"> 4110 </A></B>
<P>
tioned earlier, but also its future prosperity. The tariffs will be in 
effect long enough to provide a stable and secure framework for 
producers in the industry.
<P>
	The case of our trade relations with the United States is a good 
example of this government's determination to defend the 
interests of the Canadian agri-food industry. Our firm response 
to the Americans and their threats of trade sanctions against 
Canadian wheat was praised by the industry. If necessary, we 
will react as promptly and vigorously in any other sector. We 
will not play off one region against another or one group against 
another group.
<P>
	The Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food has 1,400 
employees in Quebec. At the national level, 23 per cent of the 
department's employees are francophones, and the federal 
government invests an average of $360 million annually in the 
agri-food industry in Quebec.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I will share my time with the hon. member 
for Gatineau-La Lièvre. He will need a little less time, and I 
will now start my concluding remarks, since I have about a 
minute or two left.
<P>
	I would like to quote very briefly a number of revealing 
figures: Federal investments worth $42 million annually in the 
food inspection sector whose 850 employees are spread 
throughout Quebec's regions, and $27 million annually plus 415 
jobs in research. Incidently, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada 
has had a network of research establishments in Quebec since 
the beginning of the century. We are everywhere: 
Saint-Hyacinthe, Lennoxville, La Pocatière, Sainte-Foy and 
Normandin, to name only a few.
<P>
	The federal department also spent $65 million in recent years 
on building or updating its research facilities in Quebec. The 
federal government also finances many research and marketing 
projects under the Canada-Quebec agreement on agri-food 
development and the agreement on regional development. The 
list of programs and agreements is a long one, representing tens 
of millions of dollars, and this does not include the dairy 
subsidy, $107 million for Quebec in 1992-93, and the fact that 
the agri-food sector in Quebec benefits from research carried 
out elsewhere in Canada, and vice-versa. Research funding 
provided by Agriculture Canada benefits all Canadians and all 
Quebecers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In closing, our mission is quite clear. Under the auspices of 
consultations and through a policy of dialogue the welfare of all 
Canadians will be served by maintaining the wholesomeness 
and the marketing value of agri-food products, by developing 
the region's potential and diversity and by protecting agriculture 
resources and the environment.
<P>
	Yes indeed, the agri-food industry is facing great challenges 
but we will meet them together. We will carry out our program in 
a spirit of partnership and respect for provincial jurisdictions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for Vaudreuil. There is no doubt that with 
regard to research, Quebec is not unfavourably treated at 
Agriculture Canada, but that may well be the only one where it is 
not at a disadvantage. This business of federal spending inequity 
between Quebec and Western Canada is old news.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	For the hon. member for Vaudreuil's information, inequities 
have existed for decades, in the sense that the federal 
government has been giving Quebec much less than its fair share 
by comparison with Western provinces. In Quebec, organizers, 
the Ministry of Immigration and farm organizations have met on 
several occasions in 1988, and in 1991, to denounce this ongoing 
inequity.
<P>
	I want to tell the hon. member for Vaudreuil this inequity 
turned out to be for the best. The fact the federal government 
was not as involved as expected and not contributing as much as 
it should drew Quebec farmers closer together. That is why in 
Quebec, farm organizations are so well organized, motivated 
and aggressive; they never had the chance to grow as dependent 
on the federal government as some other provinces.
<P>
	That is why these organizations can courageously and 
confidently seek harvest markets abroad. It is also why Quebec 
farmers are waiting with anticipation for sovereignty, because 
then, they will benefit from investments made in their regions to 
strengthen infrastructures that will help them. There is no doubt 
farmers are among those who stand to gain the most from 
sovereignty.
<P>
	A second comment regarding GATT. The hon. member for 
Vaudreuil praised this agreement, like all government members 
do. He said farmers would benefit from tariffs that would help 
support the supply management system for a good while. But the 
transition period is one of the terms and conditions so poorly 
negotiated by the government. Six years is a rather short 
transition period. To compensate for article XI, the government 
could have obtained at least ten years to give time to the 
agricultural industry to adjust.
<P>
	Farming is not like toy manufacturing; it is an extremely 
complex industry that requires a very long time to adjust to new 
conditions. We must admit that the Canadian government has 
shown weakness in the GATT negotiations by accepting a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4111"> 4111 </A></B>
<P>
transition period of only six years. This is one aspect among 
many in which the federal government was not fair to Quebec 
farmers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> Madam Speaker, I am not sure that a question 
was asked. If the hon. member wants to ask me a question, I will 
be pleased to answer it. So far he has only made comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau-La Lièvre):</B> Madam Speaker, 
of course, agriculture is a crucial sector in our country's 
economy. Like the industrial and technological sectors, it plays 
a capital and inescapable role. That much is crystal clear. The 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade better known as GATT 
will come into effect in 1995.
<P>
	For the first time in the history of international trade, GATT 
will subject the agricultural sector to a set of predetermined 
trade rules that will apply to all countries.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	Article XI has been replaced with customs tariffs that will 
allow our supply management systems to survive in a new era of 
international trade.
<P>
	It is impossible to overstate the importance of the agriculture 
or agri-food sector in our national economy, and I listened with 
interest to my colleagues opposite, the hon. members for 
Québec-Est and Vegreville, whose criticisms were not 
unjustified, far from it. I agree with them that there is certainly 
room for improvement and, as the hon. member for Québec-Est 
talked about grain transportation, there is no question that this 
government must resolve the issue of grain transportation.
<P>
	It is true that it does not make sense, that there are no excuses 
in the world. But let us not forget that the problem has been 
around for years. We are not more responsible than others, 
except that our government has a duty to find a solution.
<P>
	Although the grain and wheat sector was extremely 
important, previous governments let the situation deteriorate 
from month to month. There is no excuse and I am sure that the 
Minister of Agriculture and the Prime Minister are very aware 
that solutions must be found.
<P>
	We cannot let a sector of our economy suffer as was the case in 
the past. There are so many issues at stake in the agricultural 
sector but I just want to address a few that were mentioned by 
our colleagues.
<P>
	The hon. member for Québec-Est said that the failure of 
GATT with article XI-well, a failure-when all the countries in 
the world agree on an issue and want a trade agreement, it would 
be rather difficult for us to go against an agreement signed by all 
the other countries. Some claimed that the six-year transition 
period was too short, but I think that six years is more than 
enough time to adjust, especially with today's technologies.
<P>
	Let us consider the little time we had to adjust to free trade. I 
do not want to start an argument with my colleague, but you used 
to belong to a political party that was in favour of free trade and 
you did not criticize the fact that we had very little time to adjust 
to the changes caused by free trade.
<P>
	Free trade came in at a bad time and many Canadian 
companies were affected. The hon. member's own leader was 
one of those who favoured that free trade agreement-even your 
other colleagues in the Parti Quebecois did all they could to 
elect the previous government in 1988.
<P>
	In any case, that transition period was so short that we have 
suffered the consequences. We must be consistent and know 
what positions we took in the past. So your argument about six 
years for agri-food does not stand up. I think that six years is 
reasonable. It is one of the factors.
<P>
	Our colleague from Québec-Est also mentioned a company. I 
do not know if it is just by chance or because the field interests 
me, but he referred to a Quebec company called Interal 
Marketing Inc. which produces Grand Pré milk. This Quebec 
company exported its product to Puerto Rico where it held 40 
per cent of the market and provided a good return to Quebec.
<P>
	This problem arose a few years ago and I was interested in it. 
When I was in the opposition, I had the opportunity to raise the 
issue in the House and to make representations for the company.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	I spoke many times with the company president, Michel 
Gilbert, and very recently I wanted to find out what the decision 
was. A panel of Canadians and Americans was set up to solve 
this problem, since Grand Pré makes its product in accordance 
with hygiene and other standards. I wish to inform my colleague 
from Québec-Est that I received a letter from Mr. Gilbert which 
says: ``Thank you very much, Mr. Assad, for following up the 
above-mentioned matter. As a result of your efforts, the 
minister''-meaning the former minister, Mr. Wilson-``finally 
decided to refer the matter to a panel''.
<P>
	This question of Grand Pré is an important factor. They went 
to the panel. I heard recently that this panel's decision will be 
known in a few weeks. Like the officials at Foreign Affairs who 
are dealing with this issue, I am sure that the decision will be 
favorable and that Grand Pré products will be back on store 
shelves in Puerto Rico and regain the market which they held 
before. This is an important point.
<P>
	Since the free trade agreement, many Canadian companies, 
not only industrial companies but also agri-food, have had 
difficulties. We know that the Americans have used tactics to 
limit access to the U.S. market because they knew that we could 
compete and had quality products.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4112"> 4112 </A></B>
<P>
	As our minister said, the quality of Canada's agri-food is 
probably among the best in the world. That is no exaggeration; 
we know it is true.
<P>
	As regards the part of the Department of Agriculture's budget 
allocated to the West, to Quebec or to any other region, the hon. 
member for Québec-Est said that the situation may be a blessing 
in disguise, because since Quebec farmers were receiving less, 
they set up various co-ops such as the UPA, an organization with 
which I worked in the past when I was a member of the National 
Assembly. This may provide part of the answer; it may be true. 
However, I am not prepared to say that Quebec did not get its 
share.
<P>
	Let us go back to the days of Eugene Whelan, the former 
Liberal Minister of Agriculture who created the supply 
management system and quotas for dairy products. I know that 
the hon. member for Québec-Est worked for Mr. Whelan's 
department then. When milk quotas were established, which 
province got the lion's share? It was Quebec of course. That 
province was providing 48 per cent of the total dairy production. 
This was a major component of the province's agricultural 
sector. I knew many Quebec farmers who had milk cows. This 
was a phenomenal success for these people. Their family farm 
increased in value, they had a guaranteed income, and things 
were going well. This is something which must not be 
overlooked when you look at the situation of Quebec's 
agricultural producers.
<P>
	Indeed, it is a blessing in disguise that we have to create 
various bodies. I attended several meetings held by the UPA and 
other agricultural organizations in the riding I represented as 
member of the National Assembly, and it is true that many 
initiatives were taken by our farmers in Quebec, but this is to 
their benefit because the market is very competitive right now. 
The technological sector has a major role to play. This past 
experience will certainly help us in the future.
<P>
	As regards horticulture, I had a meeting a few days ago with 
officials from a Quebec provincial organization. I was told that a 
fantastic market exists, just south of here, in the Boston region 
and certain parts of New York State, where the population 
exceeds 15 million people. There is a very short but very 
important period during the year for Quebec producers, 
especially in the field of fruits and vegetables, when they can 
meet the demand.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	Over the years, the agricultural sector has taken an 
increasingly important place in our economy. I even said before 
that agriculture has become more important than national 
defence. If we leave that sector in the hands of our neighbours or 
other foreigners, we will pay for that and the price might be very 
high. Consequently, I believe it is necessary, and in fact it is this 
government's responsibility, to correct the mistakes made in the 
past. I am convinced, considering the Minister of Agriculture's 
determination, that we can arrive at solutions.
<P>
	I hope that the hon. member for Québec-Est will stop 
comparing the East and the West, or Quebec and the West, 
because this simply does not solve our problems.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, but the hon. 
member's time has expired. We now move to questions and 
comments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Madam Speaker, I have a 
question for the hon. member.
<P>
	He pointed out during his debate, quite proudly it seemed, that 
Quebec had received a lion's share of quota under supply 
management particularly in the dairy and that it was probably 
more than a fair share. Does the member feel that it is fair for 
any part of the country to get more than what would be 
considered a fair share of any type of program, or quota in this 
case?
<P>
	Does the member feel that is one of the problems with the 
present supply managed system as it is now in that it will not 
allow one part of the country, which maybe can compete and 
should and does have a natural advantage of some type or some 
other type of competitive advantage, to improve 
competitiveness to gain a larger share of the market?
<P>
	Does the member feel that this is part of the problem with the 
system, at least as it is now?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Assad:</B> Madam Speaker, I must say to our colleague from 
Vegreville that I have always been sold on the system we have 
whereby we have control of the markets and the production. I 
have always been sold on that aspect of it.
<P>
	The member posed the question: Is it good that one section 
can benefit by this and another section will suffer? I do not 
believe so.
<P>
	To go back to the member's first question, I mentioned that 
when we came in with the gestion de l'offre-I forget the term in 
English unfortunately, but marketing boards or whatever it is. It 
is true that when it came to milk production, Quebec was the big 
winner with 48 per cent of the production in Canada. At that 
particular time in our development, yes Quebec was the big 
winner, but I do not think we expected it to be the big winner all 
of the time and it was not. There were other times when it came 
to agriculture in Quebec that it was not the big winner. It was 
probably the west that benefited. However, that was another 
particular time.
<P>
	Over a period of 25 to 30 years, if we have in mind to correct 
the shortcomings, we will all benefit. We cannot feel that at one 
time we benefited more than at others. It just so happened that 
the milk production and the way we had structured it was very 
favourable for Quebec. But it was very favourable for the whole 
of Canada also in the way that our farmers were guaranteed a 
price and they could produce a product that was second to none 
from the point of view of quality and otherwise.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4113"> 4113 </A></B>
<P>
	I do not see any problem. We have to look at the long term in 
agriculture. That goes for our attempts by our new Minister of 
Agriculture to open up in Asia and elsewhere. It is going to take 
time. In time we can solve our problems providing we all work 
together and not one against the other.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it is actually a comment. In general, I am completely in 
agreement with the member for Gatineau-La Lièvre. There is 
little disagreement. The member for Gatineau-La Lièvre is a 
highly respected member of the Committee on Agriculture and 
Agri-Food.<B></B><B></B>
<P>
	I simply wish to say that, yes indeed, concerning the milk 
quota, Quebec was given very generous treatment, but that may 
be the only sector in the federal system in which Quebec was so 
favoured. For example, unfortunately, in 1991, the sales of 
Grand Pré milk to Puerto Rico were lost. The member told us 
that he still hopes to win back this market for Grand Pré milk, I 
hope so too. Now that we have a new Minister of Agriculture, 
perhaps he might be persuaded to assist this industry, which 
accounted for 40 per cent of the Puerto Rican market.
<P>
	In conclusion, article XI was concerned with free trade, but 
there is a difference between an open market and free trade. But, 
to start with, since we are speaking of Article XI, six years may 
not be long enough in the sectors that have quotas for such a 
fundamental structural change.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Assad:</B> Madam Speaker, I would just like to bring to the 
attention of our colleague that the period is long enough, I am 
convinced, to adapt to new international regulations. The 
problem with the six years does not lie there.
<P>
	What I am concerned about in the six-year period, is whether 
our neighbours to the south will really follow the rules of the 
game. I do not wish to prejudge, but we have seen in the past that 
our neighbours to the south, the Americans, do not always 
follow the spirit of the agreement. The issue of Grand Pré milk 
that you have raised is a classic example. In my opinion, they 
found unfair tactics to prevent Grand Pré from keeping its 
products on the shelves of stores in Puerto Rico.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am honoured to speak to you about agriculture today. 
I am very pleased to see that the Government has followed the 
example that the Official Opposition set for it by focussing the 
debates on agriculture. I feel that this subject is very important 
and goes beyond partisan matters.
<P>
	The Official Opposition's first day this year was devoted to 
agriculture, and we now have another opportunity to make our 
views known. This is rather the way I see it, an opportunity to 
say what we feel the government should do with respect to 
agriculture in the years to come.
<P>
	I will be speaking about this issue as a representative of the 
riding of Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, whose long 
agricultural tradition makes people very proud. This can be seen 
in the dairy industry, where producers have made their mark and 
have distinguished themselves among organizations across 
Canada as being very competent; the same is true in other 
production sectors. There is also a riding where there are 
institutions such as the Institut de technologie agricole and the 
federal government's experimental farm in La Pocatière, which 
certainly played a role in the development of agriculture in our 
region in the past.
<P>
	However, I feel we should draw attention in the House to the 
fact that agriculture in Quebec reflects to a certain extent the 
situation elsewhere. We have gone from a protectionist system, 
a Canada-wide protected system in which Quebec's production 
was concentrated more in the dairy industry, and the West had 
certain other advantages. Now we have moved to an open system 
in which we will compete with the rest of North America, the 
Americas and the entire world. In this open system, the 
divergent interests that can be found in the various regions of 
Canada will be even more present than in the past. In a closed 
system, there were certain rules within which we were able to 
interact, but now, we will no longer be in control and we will 
have to ensure that each region is able to find its place in the 
scheme of things.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	Another point is that we had a centralized system under which 
milk was trucked in to be processed near the markets. Under the 
new system, the open system, we will have to maintain a 
centralized approach for mass production, but at the same time, 
we should allow for something that does not exist today, namely, 
decentralizing milk supplies to small processors of agricultural 
products.
<P>
	For instance, in Saint-Jean-Port-Joli, in my riding, we have a 
factory that processes organic milk. Near Trois-Pistoles, a small 
cheese factory, the Fromagerie Petit Loup, has started producing 
cheese for local markets.
<P>
	In the maple syrup sector, there has been a substantial 
increase in exports, but there is still room for expansion. I think 
the minister should realize it is important to leave room for new 
players on our export markets. A number of large co-operatives 
have been involved in exporting maple syrup for a long time, but 
there could be room for small operators as well. In my own 
riding, la Cuvée de l'érable would like to develop the equivalent 
of an ``appellation contrôlée'' which already exists for wine. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4114"> 4114 </A></B>
<P>
These people have good ideas. They do not have much  money, 
but they manage. What they need is some help in reaching those 
export markets. Right now, they are not always in a position to 
take advantage of these markets, and it would therefore be 
useful to have programs to help these small operators.
<P>
	It has been said repeatedly, and I heard this at the 
Bélanger-Campeau Commission from the present Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, that in the future, we will no longer enjoy the 
same protection for milk production in Canada. What happens if 
Quebec becomes sovereign? GATT and the free trade 
agreements have changed the rules. The answer is, of course, 
that we will have to manage on our own, because we no longer 
have any protection. When time comes, we will have to be able 
to compete and face foreign markets.
<P>
	In this connection, it will be very important for Quebec to 
diversify its products. I am thinking, for instance, of fresh lamb 
which has increased market share but should be able to take an 
even larger share of the market. This market would require 
Canada to look at what New Zealand, among others, is doing in 
that area, so that we could take a larger share of the market. This 
would have a beneficial impact on stabilization payments. At 
the present time, because we cannot sell our production in a 
more effective way, there are stabilization costs that could be 
avoided.
<P>
	Beef production is another sector where production 
diversification should take place. Quebec does not have its share 
of the Canadian production and now that the Canadian system I 
was mentioning earlier has collapsed under international 
pressure to open markets, we will have to find ways to have 
more beef processing in Quebec.
<P>
	There could also be a debate on hog production. There is a 
very hot environmental controversy in this area, because 
environment protection organizations want a production method 
that is not harmful to the environment. However, we know that 
production could be increased in Quebec and Canada, as we 
have developed a very enviable reputation in hog production. 
We should have the possibility, in the future, to intervene more 
adequately in that field. We should inform the whole population, 
because the debate around hog production is a very emotional 
one. The government has the responsibility to provide 
information where needed to ensure that people understand the 
situation.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	What I would like to say is that in the future-because we are 
really talking about the agriculture of the future-we should 
have flexible, focused and supportive structures, capable of 
reacting rapidly to changing signals in the market place. In the 
past, since we were in a protected system, we did not have to 
watch markets so closely.
<P>
	In the next few years, if we do not watch how the markets 
evolve, we may find ourselves in situations where we will 
produce things that consumers do not want. We are going to have 
to adjust very quickly, and it is very important for the 
government to understand that, in this area, its huge bureaucracy 
does not always respond with the necessary speed and that the 
impact on the economy could be disastrous, especially if we do 
not adopt adequate policies in that respect.
<P>
	The main criticism I have regarding today's motion is not so 
much the use of the words ``pro-active work'', but the fact that 
we are still in the consultation mode. Agriculture is a sector in 
which the government is going to have to stop consulting and 
quickly implement a global intervention strategy.
<P>
	It is all very well to say that we support producers, that we 
have a good relationship with all the organizations, but if we 
miss the boat, it will not solve our problems. We need an 
interesting global strategy.
<P>
	This strategy should first promote export assistance 
programs. We should pave the way for new players and, since 
they will no longer be protected, we should help those farmers 
who saw themselves only as producers, play an increasingly 
larger role in the food chain as a whole.
<P>
	Regional research and development is another issue dear to 
my heart. We already have the facilities. I mentioned the 
experimental farm in La Pocatière, but I believe that in the 
future, it will be important to establish adequate research and 
development institutions in regional areas to provide direct 
service to local stakeholders. We will have to avoid making the 
mistake of concentrating research and development 
establishments near major centres because, by so doing, we 
would prevent research and development from meeting the 
needs of local producers.
<P>
	There is a slightly more touchy issue I would like to raise 
regarding the government motion, namely the fact that the 
government should not forget the Quebec industry. Allow me to 
quote what Agriculture Canada said about the Quebec agri-food 
industry in its corporate intervention strategy. Page 5 contains a 
few words about the human and cultural side of the industry and 
they read as follows: ``Despite the efforts of the Canadian 
government to provide services in both languages, many Quebec 
entrepreneurs make too little use of the national development 
tools available to all Canadians. Canadian associations often 
have trouble adjusting to this reality. As a result, Quebec's 
industry often tends to withdraw into its francophone 
environment, a situation which presents an additional challenge 
for regional departmental authorities''.
<P>
	Mind you, these words were not written by nasty 
sovereigntists, but by Agriculture Canada's regional 
management committee for the Quebec region. We on this side 
are truly 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4115"> 4115 </A></B>
<P>
concerned that in the future, language  will not prevent Quebec 
farmers and stakeholders from getting the credit they deserve.
<P>
	I would also like to mention new areas such as big game and 
cattle production, backgrounding, ethanol production which has 
already been mentioned by other members from other regions, 
and feed exportation.
<P>
	These are areas in which we need to expand, something which 
was not necessarily done in the past, perhaps in light of the 
protectionist system in place. I mentioned the response to 
environmental challenges. I think it is rather obvious that if 
agriculture is to retain its favoured status with Quebecers and 
Canadians, it must meet the environmental challenges of the 
21st century. This is an important consideration.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	Human resources development is another important 
intervention sector where the Canadian government is much 
weaker, not because of the individuals in the system but because 
of the system itself. Perhaps more than other sectors, agriculture 
is one area that reflects the Canadian federal system's paralysis 
and inability to adequately meet human resources development 
needs.
<P>
	While Canada is one of the countries that spend the most on 
job training, it is also one of the countries that spend the least on 
the person being trained in the end. In an open system like we 
have today, it can be said that, at the end of the day, human 
resources are a country's only competitive advantage.
<P>
	Therefore, we have to give our agricultural labour force the 
training it needs to adjust to new crops and new market 
demands, to ensure that our people can deal with the changes. I 
think we must recognize our shortcomings in this respect.
<P>
	The current Canadian educational structure is very out of date 
and does not allow us to meet needs quickly, especially in 
agriculture where this type of adjustment will be needed in the 
next few years.
<P>
	I also think it is important to have an intervention tool flexible 
enough to accommodate various sectors such as dairy products, 
pork, horticulture, grain and maple syrup production, which all 
need their own intervention strategies. Our good old 
bureaucratic dinosaur may find it difficult to meet the needs of 
each sector and we must find adequate and effective ways to 
spend the money in the right places and to delegate to the right 
entities to avoid losing money in the bureaucratic channels and 
to give much more to the producers, the processors and those 
who put their products on the domestic and international 
markets.
<P>
	In conclusion, Canadian agriculture as it now stands gives me 
the impression that it will be very difficult if not impossible to 
have a Canada-wide balanced policy that would not put one of 
Canada's regions at a disadvantage. Access to markets to the 
South, North-South markets, whether in British Columbia, the 
Western provinces, Ontario, Quebec or Atlantic Canada, will 
necessitate a  number of very well-structured actions, and 
definitely not competition between provinces by which one part 
of Canada would gain something over another because of it has 
more political weight.
<P>
	In that area, we have reached the same point as with the rest of 
the free trade issue. In the 19th century, we used to need large 
government structures to create vast markets, with the political 
market and the economic market being one and the same. We 
have moved beyond that now. We no longer need these big 
political markets to create economic markets. This happens to 
be one of the reasons why Quebec as a whole has supported free 
trade, because the concept, the essence of free trade -not the 
transition phases but the very principle of free trade- would be 
beneficial to Quebec in that it would promote increased trade 
with other countries, the United States in particular, as well as a 
return to the direction development should always have had in 
North America, that is to say from the North to the South, as 
opposed to the more artificial East-West direction established 
by the Canadian confederation, which does not really meet the 
needs of the continent in terms of development.
<P>
	So, this is one thing we have to contend with in the 
agricultural industry, but I bet you that with their drive, farmers 
will manage to get by in the future. It would be important 
however that the governments support them appropriately. 
Whether you look at the future from a federalist standpoint for 
Canada or from a sovereigntist one like I do for Quebec, in either 
case, an extremely decentralized approach is called for. The 
centralized approach some may have known in the past will no 
doubt rebound on those who chose that particular approach.
<P>
	We need a different approach for the various regions of 
Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	We need a body that can make decisions quickly and we need 
integrated regional development. I will give an example from 
our area. A milk-processing plant in Trois-Pistoles closed. Now 
all we see are milk trucks going to Montreal and the processed 
milk comes back in plastic bags. This is very bad for regional 
development. A region is not there only to provide raw 
materials; it can also do processing and occupy markets. I think 
that free trade will be an opportunity if we take the time to adjust 
and can meet the needs of the market.
<P>
	In conclusion, I will simply reread an excerpt from article 31, 
which I mentioned last week during the opposition day debate 
on agriculture: ``The future depends on decentralized authority 
in the hands of regional decision-making bodies that are in 
touch with local reality. Unfortunately, the shared jurisdiction 
for agriculture and the very different interests of Canada's main 
agricultural regions provide poor support for the initiatives of 
Quebec farmers''. Quebec farmers are doing the same thing as 
the Bloc Quebecois; they are using the federal system so that 
Quebec gets as much out of it as possible. But like many other 
interest groups in Quebec,  they are beginning to realize that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4116"> 4116 </A></B>
<P>
sovereignty for Quebec is an essential tool if Quebec agriculture 
is to win on the markets of the 21st century.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened to the comments made by the hon. member 
opposite who uses sovereignty like sugar. Just as you put sugar 
on cereals and other things, the hon. member uses sovereignty 
here and there to try to sell it. However, he chose a very 
inappropriate time to do so.
<P>
	For example, he said that we no longer need major markets, 
referring to the East-West market. If the hon. member knows 
agriculture like he claims to-and I am convinced that he does, 
after listening to him talk about dairy trucks in his riding-he 
should also know that this same East-West market buys some of 
his province's milk production, since that production far 
exceeds the needs of Quebecers. There is nothing wrong with 
that; in fact, it is a good thing and we should not deny that this 
situation exists. We must not say, as the hon. member seems to 
imply, that it is bad. Why should it be bad for Quebecers to sell 
milk elsewhere in Canada? Why is the hon. member trying to 
deprive his own constituents of this benefit?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, I think I will have to start over 
again, because the hon. member does not seem to have 
understood very well. I referred to what the future holds, 
because we have to look to the future, not to the past. And if the 
government thinks otherwise, it will have to make some 
adjustments. In the future, the markets for our agricultural 
products, whether it is milk or anything else, will be the North 
American and international markets.
<P>
	There is no doubt that markets are necessary for these 
products. We approved the free trade agreement and insisted on 
having acceptable conditions precisely to have access to the 
largest possible markets. I never said that we did not want to sell 
milk in Western Canada. I said that the old system, which 
protected production, is being replaced by a new global market 
in which we will have to compete.
<P>
	The major part of my speech had to do with suggestions I 
made to the government concerning what, in the years to come, 
should be put in place in the agricultural sector. I only referred 
to the issue of sovereignty at the end of my speech, and I did so 
to clearly indicate that small economies such as Norway, 
Sweden and other countries with a population of less than ten 
million people can do better than the current federal system, 
which was not able to adjust over the years. I gave the example 
of vocational training where, again, the federal system was not 
able to adjust and avoid creating a situation in which there are 
about 1.5 million unemployed for 500,000 jobs available. Any 
system which gives such results deserves to be changed.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Madam 
Speaker, after listening carefully to the member opposite, I can 
tell you that he did not clarify anything. He said in his speech, 
and he can read it himself in <I>Hansard</I>, that the East-West trade 
in agricultural products was not proceeding naturally. He even 
said we were faced with an artificial situation.
<P>
	Earlier, he tried to make amends by saying: ``Well, I was not 
talking about the past, but about the future.'' Does the hon. 
member consider that the east-west trade in dairy products from 
Quebec to other regions in Canada is artificial? Because if that is 
the point of view of the Bloc Quebecois, I can assure you that it 
is not the opinion of Quebec producers.
<P>
	Interprovincial trade, in dairy products for example, seems to 
me very logical, but they want Quebec producers to believe that 
it would be better for them to have access to the bigger US 
market than to sell their milk elsewhere in Canada. To 
paraphrase Mr. Winston Churchill, who made sure he was using 
parliamentary terms, the opposite of the truth has never been 
stated so clearly before.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, I will not use the words ``bad 
faith'' because I believe they are not acceptable here.
<P>
	I have always maintained that, right now, the Quebec farm 
industry is ready to compete on international markets. That 
includes the Canadian market and the American market. And 
with the appropriate tools, we will be able to compete in the 
world market. However, to achieve this goal, we must be able to 
diversify our production and to go from a protected economy to 
a market economy where we will have more freedom.
<P>
	As far as our trade activities with Western Canada are 
concerned, I see no problem with that, but I hope that we will be 
able to improve the Canadian system which has often impeded 
on the marketing of Quebec products on foreign markets, 
because the networks needed to achieve the expected results 
were not in place.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Madam Speaker, I have a 
question for the hon. member.
<P>
	If his party's cause is successful and Quebec does separate, 
understanding that Quebec has a large share of market quota in 
dairy products now, how does he expect dairy farmers in Quebec 
will deal with the large loss in market share that will certainly 
occur with a separate Quebec?
<P>
	How are they going to deal with that huge loss of income and 
their lack of access to the Canadian market? I would assume that 
if supply management remains in place that the quota for the rest 
of Canada will be redistributed among the other provinces.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4117"> 4117 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, that is a very good question. 
Quebec farmers began to think about this question some years 
ago. What has been undertaken in Quebec is a diversification of 
production.
<P>
	There have been production increases, and I gave some 
examples of them in my speech, such as the diversification of 
production in the area of pork, for example. In the area of milk, 
there is also the issue of processing products better, as well as 
targeting specific niches.
<P>
	I gave the example of Saint-Jean-Port-Joli, where there is 
plant that processes biological milk, but in North America there 
are possible niches for this type of product, which will mean 
that, instead of selling the traditional quart of 1 per cent or 2 per 
cent milk and trying to market it to all of North America, we will 
be able to offer a product like biological milk processed into 
milk, cheese, etc., to a niche of the population interested in that 
type of product.
<P>
	The other factor aside from milk is that there are all the other 
kinds of changes. It is acknowledged, for example, that in the 
entire Lower St. Lawrence region, the whole St. Lawrence River 
region really, there is excellent land and production there can be 
diversified. I do not say that the federal system has 
``imprisoned'' Quebecers in milk, and that they were not pleased 
by this, I say that the advent of the GATT, of the international 
system, has led to changes and that it is necessary to face them.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	The way that can be done in a sovereign Quebec will be to 
have total control over the way in which we want to conduct our 
agriculture in the future and thereby reach the right markets, 
without being caught in a federal system that would have to 
defend not only our interests but the interests of the West, which 
is quite natural, and the interests of the Atlantic provinces, 
whereas for Quebec, those interests, in the future, will coincide 
less and less with those of the rest of Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to 
point out to the House and to all those who are watching, 
particularly the dairy producers in Quebec, that the member 
opposite in the last few minutes commented at one stage about 
wanting protectionism for the dairy industry. In one of his last 
statements he said: ``The Quebec dairy industry wants to move 
to a free market system''. I suggest that he cannot have it both 
ways.
<P>
	His colleague who spoke before him this morning made the 
statement that in his view the agreement that was reached at 
GATT has destroyed the orderly marketing system for dairy, 
eggs and poultry in Canada. There is nothing further from the 
truth. If anything, it  strengthened it considerably, compared to 
what it could have been had we not negotiated as a government 
as well as we did on behalf of and with the producers.
<P>
	In his very next statement his colleague said that the tariff 
protection that is there is going to make the product too 
expensive for consumers. I want to point out to people that the 
Bloc Quebecois seems to want it both ways. I suggest as the 
member for Vegreville said that if that is what they want and at 
the same time they want sovereignty and separation, they better 
start looking for markets.
<P>
	I have had a lot of dairy producers from other parts of Canada 
than Quebec approach me recently and make comments about 
where that quota is going to go if and when Quebec separates.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, I hope that I will have the same 
amount of time as the Member took to ask his question.
<P>
	I feel that in the whole range of trade between Quebec and the 
other provinces, be it in agriculture or other areas, it is very 
much in people's interest, especially in Ontario, to find out who 
the other's best customer is. Trade between Quebec and Ontario 
benefits both parties. The same holds true for the other 
provinces. When I say that we will have access in a sovereign 
Quebec to the North American market, I mean that Quebec will 
be a party to free trade agreements and the GATT as a sovereign 
state, as all other countries have done.
<P>
	Canada will be the first state to have an interest in Quebec's 
being a party to such agreements, because as long as it cannot, 
we will have a difficult situation on our hands. I would like to 
conclude simply by saying that it is important to point out that in 
the past, we operated according to a given system. We are now in 
a state of transition, and in the future we will have to interact 
with foreign markets. It is in this context that our agriculture 
initiatives must be as flexible and as mobile as possible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Malpeque.
<P>
	I have been listening to the most recent comments. While 
some members of this House feel that separation is a fait 
accompli, I can assure members that members on this side of the 
House do not share that point of view.
<P>
	I believe that the number one priority of government is the 
health and well-being of its people. This government is 
committed to promoting and sustaining the health and 
well-being of rural communities through agricultural policy 
renewal. Our agri-food industry is at risk and we must stop its 
erosion by using agricultural resources more effectively.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4118"> 4118 </A></B>
<P>
	This government is committed to rebuilding our rural 
communities by ensuring a more equitable share of the food 
dollar for farmers and their families. A healthy community is 
one that is not only economically viable but is also 
environmentally sustainable.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	One of the measures that this government will undertake 
toward this end is rural renewal. Rural renewal is a 
multi-disciplinary, multi-sectoral challenge that must be 
addressed through a multi-departmental approach. The 
challenge is to form effective partnerships to bring about 
healthy rural development.
<P>
	To encourage this the minister of agriculture has established a 
rural renewal secretariat that is working in partnership with all 
branches and levels of government as well as the private sector. 
The objectives of the secretariat are: to assist rural people in the 
realization of their developmental goals; to provide 
collaboration among various government programs and farm 
community organizations; and to promote and facilitate 
improvement in the economic, social and environmental 
conditions of Canada's agricultural communities and rural areas 
so that they may be sustainable and self-reliant contributors to 
Canada's economy.
<P>
	This rural renewal secretariat is being developed through a 
reallocation of government resources. No new money is being 
used. We are not reinventing the wheel. A myriad of approaches 
has been tried in the past with questionable results. What most 
of these initiatives have clearly discovered is that rural Canada 
cannot be sustained by government transfer payments and 
cannot be rejuvenated by top down policies and programs.
<P>
	The approach that shows the most promise is one which will 
promote and facilitate bottom up initiatives, recognizing that it 
is at the grassroots level where the ideas are found and the drive 
and dedication to make things happen occur.
<P>
	The role of the federal government must be to provide the 
policy environment and the tools for community driven rural 
development. This is the course of action this government has 
already embarked upon and this is the course of action that will 
bring results.
<P>
	The people who live in rural Canada must be the driving force. 
They are the key to building healthy rural communities. There 
are success stories out there, stories of people starting with an 
idea, creating a local business and providing employment for 
local people. It is the objective of the rural renewal secretariat to 
share these case studies to assist others in turning their ideas and 
their resources into sustainable businesses.
<P>
	The challenge this government has taken up is to create an 
environment which provides rural Canada with the necessary 
tools to give it the opportunity to succeed.
<P>
	In the red book this government committed itself to 
stabilization programs to reduce the impact of fluctuating 
markets. I am glad to report that this government has embarked 
on a consultative process to refurbish Canadian farm safety net 
programs.
<P>
	This government is also actively pursuing several research 
and development initiatives. The government realizes that 
research is a key component to competitiveness in the agri-food 
sector of Canada. Programs include the oat research program 
and the PSE pork research program; not only programs but also 
the actions and attitudes of the minister, his parliamentary 
secretary and my colleagues who are actively involved in the 
rural caucus.
<P>
	One thing is very clear. Members of the rural caucus, whether 
they are from the west, north, Ontario, Quebec or the maritimes, 
are dedicated and determined to ensure a high quality of life for 
the members of our rural and agri-food communities.
<P>
	While the agri-food industry is not part of my own 
background, I live in a small village, Mount Albert, which 
derives its existence from the surrounding farmland. As a 
member of Parliament I have had the wonderful opportunity to 
get to know individual agri-food producers.
<P>
	In the riding of York-Simcoe which I represent the First 
Nations people laid the foundation for our agricultural 
traditions. Later the United Empire Loyalists and Quakers were 
among the first settlers to break the land and till the soil. To this 
day the riding of York-Simcoe retains its agricultural heritage.
<P>
	The close proximity of the Toronto market contributes to the 
prosperity of local agri-food producers. Since the York region is 
the fastest growing area, the market for York-Simcoe 
agri-food producers is continuously growing. The wonderful 
infrastructure of highways enables local agri-food producers to 
reach their markets.
<P>
<B>(1305 ) </B>
<P>
	In addition, the close proximity of St. Lawrence Starch 
provides an excellent opportunity for corn producers to sell their 
corn.
<P>
	Potatoes grown in the Mount Albert region and the Alliston 
area are arguably the finest in the land. Although my colleagues 
from P.E.I. may differ, I believe York-Simcoe potatoes are 
superior.
<P>
	The geographical position of the riding and the nature of the 
soil enable farmers to cultivate a variety of crops. Lake Simcoe 
is an undeniable drawing factor to the region and part of the 
watershed that helps to sustain farms in the surrounding regions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4119"> 4119 </A></B>
<P>
	The tourists and cottagers will note the large number of dairy 
and beef farms that grace the landscape of York-Simcoe. There 
is also the world renowned Holland Marsh. Despite its small 
size, the Holland Marsh produces 85 per cent of Ontario's 
celery, 75 per cent of its onions, 95 per cent of its lettuce and 60 
per cent of its parsnips.
<P>
	The Muck Research Station is also located in the Holland 
Marsh. This station researches all aspects of vegetable 
production on muck or organic soils. Extensive weed, insect and 
disease control research trials are conducted in co-operation 
with industry, Agriculture Canada and the University of Guelph.
<P>
	In the Bradford district there is also the integrated pest 
management program which continues to develop and evolve. 
IPM encourages responsible crop management and a 
sustainable, quality food supply for Ontario. The IPM program 
now includes onions, carrots, celery, lettuce, potatoes and sweet 
corn. As a result of its implementation insecticide use in onions 
has been reduced by 80 per cent.
<P>
	With the assistance of Agriculture Canada, this program has 
become a leader in IPM development in Canada and North 
America. It is partnership programs like the Muck Research 
Station and the IPM program that Agriculture Canada needs to 
continue to sponsor in order to further world development.
<P>
	This government is tackling the rural renewal challenge in an 
open and honest approach based on consultation and fostering 
partnerships. Success or failure rests not in Ottawa nor in our 
provincial capitals. Rather, it rests within our rural communities 
so that they can become sustainable and self-reliant 
contributors to Canada's economy. If rural Canada prospers then 
all of Canada prospers.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the hon. member is to be commended for her speech, 
especially when she stressed the need to ensure that our rural 
communities will have a satisfactory quality of life in the future. 
She said at the beginning of her speech that no Bloc member 
should assume that sovereignty is a fait accompli. During the 
election campaign, we told Quebecers that we were 
sovereigntists and that we were there to defend the interests of 
Quebec, and what we have been saying this morning is part of 
that approach because, surprisingly, Quebec rural communities 
were practically unanimous in voting for the Bloc to represent 
them in the House of Commons. So we can at least respect the 
opinions of the people who elected us.
<P>
	I have the following question for the hon. member: Is she 
prepared to ask her government to include as part of its future 
policy on agriculture that farm products can be processed in the 
producing areas, so that for instance, if an area produces milk, 
beef and grain, first and second level processing can be done as 
much as possible in the  area, and that it would provide programs 
to encourage this approach?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Kraft Sloan:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for 
his comments. I would like to be assured with the fact that the 
Bloc is not working toward separation in Quebec.
<P>
	As far as the member's comments about having processing 
done locally, if we think of what community economic 
development is all about, it is ensuring that we have healthy 
local economies. By that I mean economies that serve the local 
community and do not contribute to environmental degradation 
but contribute to the ability of people to work locally so that they 
can spend money and spend time with their families locally.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	It is also very important when we are thinking of the agri-food 
industry to think of the effects of hauling raw materials over 
long distances and what that means for the quality of our food. 
That is a consideration as well.
<P>
	However, as the hon. member knows, it is not government that 
dictates the policy of the private sector. Therefore while we can 
look at measures that encourage local community economic 
development it is not the federal government's place to tell the 
private sector where it has to produce and how it has to produce.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murray Calder 
(Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened with interest to the hon. member's speech in which she 
alluded to the fact that rural Ontario has a lot of challenges in 
front of it.
<P>
	As a farmer I agree with her. In fact, one of the major 
problems, and I would like the opinion of the member on this, is 
a lack of education as to what happens in rural Ontario compared 
with what is happening in urban Ontario or Canada for that 
matter.
<P>
	I am wondering if the member would tell me what kind of an 
education process she envisions to better inform urban Canada 
of what happens in rural Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Kraft Sloan:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question.
<P>
	He probably has some understanding of my background which 
is in education and not directly in the agri-food industry. It is 
absolutely crucial that those Canadians who live in the densely 
populated urban areas understand the impact of our agri-food 
and rural communities on their health and well-being.
<P>
	The area of connection is around food. When we talk about the 
quality and sovereignty that this nation must have over its own 
food, when we talk about the right kind of price, fair pricing for 
our food, that is a point on which rural and urban communities 
can connect.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4120"> 4120 </A></B>
<P>
	There is a bit of a misconception out there that farmers are 
somehow benefiting greatly because of the price charged for 
food. If you look at what is actually given in terms of the farm 
dollar at the farm gate it is quite low in terms of all of the hands 
that this money flows through.
<P>
	When consumers go to a grocery store or a restaurant they 
may be concerned about the price of food, but that is an 
important area to start talking about, what actually happens 
within the processing food management, food growing system. 
That is one area of interaction.
<P>
	Another area of interaction is understanding the way our rural 
communities support our urban communities economically. 
What are the things our farmers need to have in order to have 
effective farms in agri-food businesses? What kinds of 
equipment and other supplies do they need? Also, there is the 
fact that they contribute to our towns and villages because they 
come into the larger centres and they shop and they buy.
<P>
	I think if we take a look at food, that interface and the 
economic contribution even though there are fewer and fewer 
Canadians who are directly involved in the agri-food industry 
we will see what a tremendous benefit it is indeed to Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
certainly a pleasure for me to rise on this debate in support of the 
proactive approach the minister and this government are taking 
to enhance the agriculture and agri-food sector of the Canadian 
economy.
<P>
	I might say in beginning that my colleague who spoke earlier 
should try some of those P.E.I. potatoes from that beautiful red 
soil. It is unlikely she would then go back to her own variety.
<P>
<B>(1315 ) </B>
<P>
	The proactive approach starts right here in the House of 
Commons with the new government and in committees with the 
participation of backbench MPs, both from the government side 
and members opposite. I believe there is a new sense of 
democracy in the land. As a government we said we would give 
members of Parliament more power and that we would give a 
voice to committees. That is evident every day in the 
discussions in the various committees and is quite a turnaround 
from the past administration.
<P>
	The tragedy of the past administration is that many of its 
policies are still ongoing today in the new administration.
<P>
	Let us look at the work of the agriculture committee. I think it 
adds to the leadership provided by the government. The 
estimates we had before us and are before the committee as yet 
still contain some of the policies of the past administration. It 
will take some time to get the new policies of the government in 
place.
<P>
	The agriculture committee has been very serious in doing an 
intense analysis of the department's estimates and looking at 
ways and means that the department can better deliver services 
to the farm community. We have been very open about that 
analysis. We believe that the views of all members are important 
and should be considered. In that way the government gives a 
renewed voice to primary producers, to the agri-food industry 
members, through their members of Parliament at the 
committee and House of Commons levels.
<P>
	Let us take a look for a moment at the aggressive direction the 
government has been taking in the past six months. Let me start 
with what is a very difficult issue, GATT article XI(2)(c). It has 
been raised by members opposite to a certain extent. They are 
claiming that we have undermined producers of their ability to 
survive and prosper in some areas. We did have a stacked deck 
against us, left there by the previous administration. We have set 
up a process to retain the benefits of the supply management 
system and at every opportunity we talk about how supply 
management could be used as a model of development for rural 
areas in other countries around the world.
<P>
	Changes that happen at the GATT negotiations are not without 
difficulty, but that is what leadership is all about and that is what 
this new Liberal government is showing. We have admitted up 
front to the loss of article XI(2)(c). We did not try to put a spin 
on it as previous administrations had tried to do. In fact, because 
we believe in primary producers and have great confidence in 
the farm community, we have involved them in a process to 
retain the benefits of the supply management system and move 
on to greater prosperity we hope in the future.
<P>
	At this stage I must address some of the points the member for 
Québec-Est made in suggesting that the government failed 
Quebec relative to article XI(2)(c). Nothing could be further 
from the truth.
<P>
	It is because of strong national policies that Canada has put in 
place over the years-most of those policies were started under 
a previous Liberal administration-that Quebec has been able to 
make the gains it has. For instance, Quebec's net farm income 
has grown steadily over the past 20 years as a result of the 
stability and the national programs that we put in place. In fact 
the member for Québec-Est on April 28 had this to say: ``With 
milk definitely we have had a certain advantage in Quebec over 
the west, that is for sure''.
<P>
	I do not mind admitting that the attempt of members opposite 
to try to misconstrue the facts and show that certain moneys are 
going west or going east and not going to Quebec are creating 
grave difficulties for us as a nation because the wrong 
impression is left. Let me tell you that this national government 
wants 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4121"> 4121 </A></B>
<P>
to ensure that dairy producers and chicken producers in all 
provinces retain the advantage that supply management has 
given them. We will continue to do so with the processes we  
have set up in order to see that supply management survives into 
the future.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	Let us examine the stance of this government versus that of 
the previous administration in terms of the trade action and trade 
rhetoric coming from our neighbours south of the border. The 
United States continues to challenge our agencies, our 
marketing of grain, ice cream and yogurt and other areas. It 
knows full well that we have won every trade dispute that has 
been put to any panel. We have won before the International 
Trade Commission, the General Accounting Office, the 
Binational Trade Panel under CUSTA and just recently under an 
international trade audit.
<P>
	However, instead of lying down and dying the government has 
said, as the minister said this morning: ``This minister will not 
lie down and die. Canada will fight back''. That is leadership. 
He is standing up for our producers and our nation and that is 
something new.
<P>
	Another example of the proactive policies of the government 
is that we recognize full well the trouble in the transportation 
sector in terms of the car allocations of grain moving west. We 
immediately came together and set up two subcommittees, one 
on agriculture and one on transport. These committees held two 
intensive days of hearings. Out of them we came up with some 
recommendations in which we basically suggested that the GTA, 
the Grain Transportation Agency, should apply the rules of the 
land.
<P>
	Where the previous administration failed to apply the 
penalties that should have been imposed on the railways for not 
moving product and not putting the capital investment on the 
rolling stock into place, this government and its members 
through the committees have said that the penalties should be 
enforced and that the GTA should live up to its responsibilities. 
We have recommended that to the minister and the minister is 
moving forward. The minister of agriculture is moving forward 
to a meeting on May 16.
<P>
	I have always been concerned about the policies that lead to a 
continuing reliance on off-farm income. Liberals will not be 
working toward removing more farm families from the land but 
rather working with them to strengthen their ties to the land and 
the farming community. The government will be working to 
ensure that farmers become less dependent on off-farm income 
which not only merely supplements family incomes but is often 
one of the pillars which ensures the very survival of farming 
operations.
<P>
	We are pursuing policies in which primary producers can 
achieve the majority of their income from the farm. We will 
work toward implementing marketing programs to do this.
<P>
	In conclusion, though the government has been very proactive 
and has provided strong leadership, one of the important factors 
is the minister of agriculture. Last weekend when the minister 
was in my riding he showed that he is a leader of the times, that 
he believes strongly in the Liberal policies that were in the red 
book during the election campaign. He is willing to sit down and 
listen to producers, discuss with them and build that strong rural 
community base in the interests of primary producers and the 
agri-food industry and businesses all across Canada that this 
country sorely needs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. 
member referred to off-farm income and that his Liberal 
government would do its best to ensure that farmers do not need 
as much off-farm income as now.
<P>
	I wonder if the member could explain to me exactly how the 
government will do that. Will it have policies that discriminate 
against farmers who have off-farm jobs? Just exactly what can 
be done in terms of policy to stop the movement to off-farm 
income or to stop farmers from supplementing farm income 
with off-farm income?
<P>
<B>(1325 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Easter:</B> Madam Speaker, members should look at the 
kind of policies we talked about during the election, the 
emphasis on supply management, the emphasis on 
strengthening and enhancing the Canadian Wheat Board.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board is a prime example. It is an 
agency that maximizes the returns from the marketplace back to 
primary producers and has shown that it does a reasonably good 
job of marketing. Certainly it has been having some difficulties 
as a result of the unfair use of the export enhancement program 
in many of our foreign markets, but it is still able to maximize 
returns to primary producers.
<P>
	The way we hope to achieve a lessening of the dependence on 
off-farm income is through good marketing structures, through 
assisting primary producers with better financial arrangements 
and through farm credit. As we get down the line and are able to 
put before the House of Commons more policies in the future, 
members will see the fruits of our labours in terms of giving 
primary producers the opportunity and the right to be able to 
earn the majority of their income from their on-farm operations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murray Calder 
(Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
enjoyed very much the hon. member's speech. In fact I would 
like to say to the hon. member that if he does have a deal on 
potatoes, I do not have my garden in yet. I would be more than 
happy to take him up on that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4122"> 4122 </A></B>
<P>
	One of the things I noticed as a new MP and a person who has 
lobbied for the farm perspective all the way through is that 
previous to the GATT negotiation and the signing of the 
agreement we have now, there was an us and them situation in 
agriculture, us being supply management and them being grains 
and red meat. The GATT agreement laid down a foundation for 
farm policy where it got rid of that situation within agriculture. 
We are now all beneath one umbrella working together.
<P>
	I would like to know what the member's opinion is on the 
direction we are heading right now under the new GATT 
agreement, looking too at the situation that all our policies if we 
are going to deal internationally have to be green.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Easter:</B> Madam Speaker, one of the endearing 
characteristics of this administration compared to the last is that 
when we run into some difficulties as we did with the supply 
management sector at GATT, it is willing to put its trust and faith 
in producers. It will bring producers together to try to have them 
understand directly the implications of some of the changes that 
are being made, to involve them in the process, to actually 
consult and to listen to those producers who are going to be 
directly affected by any changes that come about in the future. 
That is one of the characteristics of the government.
<P>
	We are seeing it through our committee structure. We are 
seeing it through the minister of agriculture and the 
parliamentary secretary to the minister of agriculture. It is an 
ongoing process, building on our strengths, knowing the rules 
and knowing the obstacles that are before us. In that way we are 
going to again reclaim and regain a strong primary production 
sector.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to advise the Chair that Reform speakers will be 
dividing their time with the exception of the leader of the 
Reform Party who will be speaking later in the debate.
<P>
	I would like to thank the hon. member for a chance to address 
the very important topic of agricultural reform. It is clear to 
many people that the counterproductive programs in place today 
cannot be fixed by simply cutting them without replacing 
existing programs with something else.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	Most hon. members would agree that changes are needed in 
how we help Canadian farmers compete in the world market of 
the 1990s. The question of what type of change has not yet been 
resolved.
<P>
	I would like to talk about the problem of subsidies and how 
they relate to transportation. We know that subsidies largely do 
not work. Not only do subsidies drain the public purse, they 
actually retard economic development.
<P>
	We are fortunate in Canada to be able to learn from the 
mistakes of other countries like New Zealand, which had no 
choice but to drastically slash its farm and transportation 
subsidies. Between 1979 and 1983, a period of just over four 
years, farm subsidies in New Zealand tripled from $440 million 
to $1.2 billion per year. The former president of the Federation 
of New Zealand Farmers pointed out that these subsidies had 
inflated land prices, made it difficult for younger farmers to 
enter the industry, and ate up much of the value of the land.
<P>
	The more the farmers received in subsidies, the more they had 
to pay in taxes for fertilizer, farm chemicals, machinery and 
transportation. The subsidies had a practical effect of limiting 
the choices of farmers when it came to deciding which products 
were the most economically viable to produce. Finally, the 
heavy subsidization paid for by the taxpayers of New Zealand 
encouraged wasteful and inefficient land and transportation 
practices.
<P>
	The former finance minister of New Zealand, Roger Douglas, 
has a warning for countries with heavily subsidized agricultural 
sectors. He said the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>New Zealand was able to demonstrate to the world the true effect of such 
subsidies, and I would say to those other countries: ``The results of your policies 
are that your poor are poorer than they need to be; your jobless are more 
numerous than they need to be; your taxes are higher than they need to be; your 
economic performance is worse than it needs to be; and your farmers 
nevertheless continue to go bankrupt''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Sounds very familiar to us here.
<P>
	In 1984 New Zealand ran into a debt wall. It was unable to 
borrow money to continue to fuel deficit programs and had to 
slash agricultural subsidies to almost zero. With no other choice 
the new New Zealand government withdrew agricultural 
subsidies and farm prices fell 40 per cent. The market values for 
some livestock fell to one-third of their original value and many 
farmers were driven off the land.
<P>
	In spite of the hardships created by the withdrawal of 
subsidies, New Zealand today finds itself in an enviable position 
in the world market. The economic growth rate of the country 
will probably be about 3 per cent this year, the second strongest 
in the OECD. New Zealand now boasts as many farmers as it did 
a decade ago. Perhaps most important, farmers are free to 
choose what types of produce are the most economically viable.
<P>
	The result of this is that New Zealand has diversified into 
many areas previously closed through directed subsidies and 
overregulation.
<P>
	I believe Canada can learn a lot from the New Zealand 
experience. Canada is fortunate to have more time to change 
than New Zealand did. If we use this time to make wise 
decisions, Canada will be able to achieve the benefits of a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4123"> 4123 </A></B>
<P>
market driven agricultural economy without facing many of the 
hardships suffered by New Zealanders.
<P>
	No matter how long we wait, Canada will still have to make 
the transformation from a centralized and over-subsidized farm 
economy to a market driven economy. If we wait too long we 
will not be able to assist our farmers in the transition.
<P>
	One thing is clear. We have to change our policies. Three 
factors external to the agricultural sector are coming together to 
force us to change.
<P>
	First, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade specifies 
that all members, Canada included, will have to modify their 
domestic agricultural programs to conform to a world of 
reduced subsidies and greater market access.
<P>
	Second, there is an urgent need to keep Canada's debt from 
growing. Agricultural subsidization has put an enormous strain 
on our national resources and has had a negative effect on the 
industry.
<P>
	Third and last, the Canadian agricultural industry needs to 
diversify if it is to survive.
<P>
<B>(1335 ) </B>
<P>
	The subsidization programs by previous governments forced 
Canadian farmers to produce and export only certain crops and 
only in an unprocessed form. Farmers want to be able to choose 
which products to develop and how to transport them.
<P>
	If there is a trade war in wheat but not in wheat products then 
it only makes sense to sell wheat products instead of wheat. In 
addition, these value added products will create additional jobs 
and will help us avoid trade disputes over grain.
<P>
	Reform believes that we have to change our agricultural 
policies to reflect a more market oriented approach and that we 
should do so with the least amount of disruption possible. 
Whatever their failings, free markets drive efficiency. Events in 
New Zealand are only the latest of many examples which 
underscore this fact. Markets allow farmers, grain companies 
and carriers the freedom to choose. Change and efficiency in a 
market oriented system are driven by the free choices made by 
the market participants.
<P>
	Also, it should be recognized that there are some 
circumstances, such as international trade disputes, that farmers 
cannot control. For problems like this we need to redirect the 
funds currently used to subsidize transportation toward a trade 
distortion adjustment program and crop insurance safety net 
system. To demonstrate how we think this can be done let me say 
a few words about Reform's policy on transportation.
<P>
	Under the present system trains loaded with U.S. bound grain 
are travelling as much as 1,400 kilometres out of their way so 
prairie shippers can take advantage of attractive federal freight 
subsidies. Ironically, at the same time we are told that farmers 
stand to lose over $200 million because there is poor grain 
movement.
<P>
	Clearly the present grain transportation act does not 
encourage efficiency in the transportation system. The WGTA is 
a direct federal subsidy on grains and oilseeds paid to the 
railways. Because it encourages farmers to export grain instead 
of shipping it to Canadian processors, the WGTA results in the 
creation of provincial programs such as the Alberta Crow 
benefit offset program set up for the purpose of counteracting 
the WGTA, subsidies to balance other subsidies.
<P>
	Second, the government currently subsidizes 57 per cent of 
the cost of shipping prairie grain by rail to various ports. This 
takes away any incentive for the railways to increase efficiency 
since they get paid anyway.
<P>
	The third point is one of the most important. Under the WGTA 
farmers are given no incentive to diversify into higher value 
crops or to ship to domestic processing facilities. I can think of 
no better job creation program than to allow the market to create 
its own jobs in our dying rural areas by allowing farmers to make 
the decision based on cost effectiveness as to where they want to 
ship their farm produce.
<P>
	Reform proposes that we do away with the WGTA subsidy and 
redirect funding to a trade distortion adjustment program to 
compensate exporting producers as a direct counter measure to 
foreign subsidies on competing products. This would force the 
railways to develop efficient methods of transportation and 
would allow farmers to choose which method of transportation 
is the most cost effective for them. At the same time it would 
encourage rural development by adding a market driven 
incentive to process raw goods into value added goods.
<P>
	Reform also suggests the deregulation of the rail 
transportation system and the elimination of regional 
development as a goal of transportation policy. The markets are 
far better at creating development than the huge bureaucracy 
which currently exists.
<P>
	Under the present system farmers can be held hostage to grain 
handling strikes at any time. The elimination of the WGTA and 
the creation of a more efficient system would allow farmers to 
seek alternative means of transportation if this occurred.
<P>
	Let me end by saying that Canadians involved in the 
agricultural sector can and will compete in the changing world 
economy if only given the chance to take control of their 
involvement in the market. External factors will eventually 
force the necessary changes with or without our agreement.
<P>
	Unlike New Zealand and other less fortunate countries, we 
have the chance to create a viable, self-reliant and market 
driven agricultural industry before we are forced to. Reform 
believes now is the time.

<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murray Calder 
(Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
enjoyed the hon. member's speech very much. In fact the 
subsidies she talked about are a basic pet peeve of mine.
<P>
	When they got into trouble in New Zealand, they had 
something they called welfare for sheep. That was the subsidy 
program they had. In 1984 when New Zealand had to realign its 
debt there was an 80 per cent write-off of equity in that country 
which I imagine the hon. member is well aware of.
<P>
	As a poultry producer dealing under supply management at 
the present time in my farming operation I collect two subsidies, 
the farm tax rebate and the fuel tax rebate.
<P>
	Since the early 1950s I have watched my industry go from 
producing a four pound chicken in 14 to 16 weeks to producing a 
four pound chicken in 37 to 41 days, a male or a female.
<P>
	Under this type of system our industry has had a capital influx 
into research and development, R and D, which is one of the 
most important things in agriculture today. As a farmer I know 
that is true.
<P>
	I am wondering what the hon. member thinks about supply 
management when she talks about the subsidy system from 
which we are not really collecting and being market responsive.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his question. I am sure he knows a great deal more about this 
subject than I.
<P>
	I think it is very clear given the trade agreements we are 
negotiating and have negotiated that supply management is no 
longer up for debate. It is going to be forced to be phased out by 
the requirements of the agreements we have negotiated with 
trading partners.
<P>
	We have to think ahead about how we can make it easier for 
our producers to move into these new market realities. That 
could be by way of measures to ease the transition for them and 
to assist them in finding better ways to manage and to compete 
in the marketplace.
<P>
	We agree with R and D. I think that R and D is one of the 
things this country needs and should continue to be encouraged 
by the government and by our tax system. We also could point 
out that more efficiencies have resulted as the hon. member has 
said. That again is proof positive we can do better when these 
things are managed properly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened with 
great interest as well to the hon. member's speech. I would like 
to remind the hon. member that Canadian grain exports were 
really not subsidized except through transportation until the late 
1970s and to some  degree in the 1960s. We responded to 
international pressures which created subsidies.
<P>
	In terms of the figures, the subsidies for grain exports are 
highest in the European Community and second highest in the 
United States. There was one country which did not compete in 
subsidies. That was Argentina which is an example the hon. 
member did not choose, choosing New Zealand which 
approached this more recently.
<P>
	Given the fact that the subsidization of grain exports in 
Canada apart from the transportation subsidy occurred after the 
1980s would the hon. member have taken a different course? If 
we had not subsidized grain at that point, is it not quite likely 
that Canadian grain exports would have diminished to the level 
of Argentina's during that period?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Madam Speaker, I think it is fair to say that 
when we are fighting in an unfair competitive position where 
trading partners are being heavily subsidized that we must find 
ways to assist our own industries. That is why we welcome the 
recent GATT agreement which diminished these international 
subsidies and allowed us to compete on a more level playing 
field.
<P>
<B>(1345 ) </B>
<P>
	At this point we are reversing that trend, as I understand it. 
Now the question is what we can do to make our industry more 
competitive in this new regime of freer and fairer trade.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to rise in the House today to 
address the subject of agriculture.
<P>
	Because of my rather extensive experience and background in 
agriculture I have a bit of trouble when I read the motion as put 
forward. It talks about proactive work of the government and 
uses phrases and words such as co-operation, enhance, building 
the sector to be among the best in the world, and sustainable 
agriculture. Sustainable is a good catch phrase. It is one that we 
as farmers have heard and used ourselves for some time now. 
Farmers are not looking for fancy catch phrases or motions but 
some assurance of where we are headed from this point.
<P>
	As I have said I was born and raised on a farm. As such I have 
had the enjoyment of learning firsthand about picking rocks on 
our land. I have been involved in farming virtually all my life. 
For many years I operated about a 3,000 acre grain farm with 
one of my brothers who continues our family farming tradition 
today.
<P>
	The farm was started by my father with the help of the 
Veterans Land Act shortly after the second world war. My 
family has quite a tradition of being on the land. Something I 
have witnessed and something I have personally felt is what I 
call the farmer's love of the land. The enjoyment of actually 
producing from one's own efforts is the very reason so many 
farmers today continue to struggle against all odds every year 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4125"> 4125 </A></B>
<P>
when the  economics of their business would dictate that in 
reality they should just give up and do something else, do 
something more profitable.
<P>
	This love of the land could be equated to the similar feelings I 
am sure aboriginal peoples have for their traditional lands, or 
that foresters feel for forests, or pilots for the skies. In short, 
farmers are happiest when they are working on their land or 
working with their livestock.
<P>
	Back home right now I know they have started preparing the 
soil and planting the 1994 crop. As I said earlier, they 
desperately need some assurance from the government that it 
intends to support those efforts with more than simply more 
empty rhetoric.
<P>
	Over the years I have been involved in many farm 
organizations working on behalf of my fellow farmers. For a 
while I was president of the B.C. Grain Producers Association. 
As such I served as the director responsible for grain with the 
B.C. Federation of Agriculture. I have had the opportunity to 
witness firsthand farm programs that I would say were designed 
by bureaucrats for bureaucrats. By that I mean programs that 
have been unnecessarily cumbersome and heavy in 
administration, programs designed more to justify an ongoing 
need for government jobs than for sustaining agriculture.
<P>
	The reality is that farmers are not asking for a handout. They 
never have and they never will. They just want to be able to earn 
a decent return on their investment and labour. In short they 
need to know if their industry will be protected from 
circumstances completely beyond their control.
<P>
	Because farmers sell their products on the world market they 
are price takers, not price setters. When our competitors, 
namely the EEC and the U.S., choose to continue the seemingly 
never-ending trade war, it is our farmers who are caught in the 
middle.
<P>
	City dwellers simply do not understand some of the sacrifices 
their rural cousins are called upon to make. I am speaking about 
the need for off-farm income. It has been well documented that 
in order to sustain farm operations farmers' wives are working 
off farm. Farmers may spend many days themselves in the 
wintertime away from their families just to sustain their farming 
operations. Also they have to make do with much lower 
standards of living in some cases than those of their urban 
neighbours.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	I am concerned that when urban people drive by and see a 
farmer working his fields they relate his efforts to a small 
businessman rather than to an industry. They should be better 
educated about the situation. When they see a farmer and 
consider the need to sustain agriculture and to assist farmers, 
they must look at it as a primary industry similar to forestry, oil 
and gas or mining rather than a small business. It is not fair to 
equate farming with small business because like forestry, it is 
renewable.
<P>
	I have always been somewhat upset when I pick up a 
newspaper and read about another subsidy to farmers. We have 
to recognize that all industries at different times, especially our 
natural resource industries, call upon both levels of government 
to support them. At different times both levels of government 
provide tax incentives or royalty holidays or initiate specific 
programs to assist major industries. As I have said, agriculture 
should not be viewed any differently.
<P>
	Over the years there has virtually been a flood of farm 
programs supposedly designed to assist farms to remain 
sustainable. As has already been outlined, some programs have 
taken the form of transportation subsidies, the Crows Nest Pass 
rate which eventually became the Western Grain Transportation 
Act. There are various feed freight assistance programs and 
those types of things. Some have been designed to protect 
farmers from natural disasters, natural elements. Crop insurance 
is a program put in place to provide that type of protection.
<P>
	There have been many others implemented to protect farmers 
from price fluctuations in the marketplace. The western grain 
stabilization program was such a program. It was proclaimed in 
1976 and was eventually dissolved 15 years later in 1991. I know 
from personal experience on our farm that in consultations 
among my father, my brother and I, we chose not to participate 
in that program because we could see that it was not sustainable. 
By the way it was initially set up, it was not a good program for 
farmers.
<P>
	As president of the B.C. grain producers I was personally 
involved with the special Canadian grains program that came 
about because of the trade war. In 1985-86 it was recognized 
that the WGSA was simply not addressing needs because it did 
not foresee how badly prices would drop.
<P>
	We have moved through myriad programs over the years, and 
now we have come to GRIP and NISA. I am sure I could spend a 
lot more time than I have available today talking about all the 
problems that have developed with GRIP and NISA. Actually 
NISA is the one program that has been a relatively bright light in 
the darkness of government programs.
<P>
	Despite all the problems with the programs that have been 
created in the past, we still talk about being proactive and 
co-operating with farm groups and farmers. The discussion 
seems to centre around which commodities to include in new 
programs on the horizon to replace GRIP and NISA.
<P>
	As mentioned by my colleague earlier, Reform suggests a 
different route. It suggests elimination of the present farm 
support programs and instead the diverting of funds into 
basically three separate programs. The trade distortion 
adjustment program is an all-sector program, an all-inclusive 
program designed to address some of the concerns of my hon. 
colleague 
<P>

<B><A NAME="4126"> 4126 </A></B>
<P>
across the way and what is going to be facing the supply 
management sector and other sectors.
<P>
	We talk about a program specifically designed to offset 
foreign intervention and foreign competition through unfair 
subsidies our foreign competitors might be granted that we in 
this country do not have. We talk about other areas. As I have 
said, NISA has been a relatively successful program. We talk 
about making it more inclusive and making it applicable to all 
sectors of agriculture rather than just the grain sector.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	We would continue to require crop insurance to offset the 
elements, the natural disasters that always occur and that 
farmers must be protected against. That briefly outlines my past 
history and what I say our government must move toward in 
relation to farm safety net programs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member for 
Prince George-Peace River talked about the Reform 
agricultural policy. He also talked about the elimination of farm 
support programs.
<P>
	Could he be a little more specific so that we on this side would 
have the benefit of knowing what farm support programs that are 
in place now he wants to eliminate? Could he give the specifics 
on that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my hon. colleague on the other side of the House for his 
comments and question.
<P>
	There are a number of programs. The two I specifically 
referred to were the gross revenue insurance program and the 
Net Income Stabilization Act. There is also the feed freight 
assistance program that we talked about. My colleague referred 
earlier to western grain transportation. There are a number of 
programs for livestock, feed development initiatives, and 
economic and regional development agreements. A wide range 
of programs are presently in place.
<P>
	Rather than having all the specific programs that actually end 
up distorting one sector of agriculture to the detriment of 
another, Reform is suggesting that we should be looking at the 
whole farm approach to protect farmers regardless of whether 
they are producing chickens, grain, milk or whatnot. We have to 
protect all farmers in all sectors against unfair foreign practices. 
To do so we need to move toward all farm and all sector 
programs with both our trade adjustment distortion program and 
our new income stabilization program, which would be an 
enhanced NISA and applicable to all sectors instead of only the 
ones it currently covers.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 
30(5) the House will now proceed to Statements by Members

	<B>Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant):</B> Mr. Speaker, this past Saturday I 
had the pleasure of participating in the opening of the Canadian 
Military Heritage Museum in the city of Brantford, Ontario.
<P>
	In the words of the board members, Canada's military 
heritage collections are part of the history of all Canadians. The 
story of our military past should be understood and made 
meaningful to all Canadians, many of whom have had no direct 
experience of war or the part played by conflict in Canada's 
history.
<P>
	The museum is a wonderful museum. It has displays of 
original armaments, vehicles and uniforms from Canada's 
earliest conflicts right to the present. Most striking are the 
pictures that depict Canadian men and women in the heat of 
battle.
<P>
	I would like to congratulate those who have made the museum 
a reality and invite all Canadians to Brantford to share in the

	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi):</B> Mr. Speaker, the green 
revolution launched by Horne, a copper smelting operation in 
Noranda, is worthy of note today since it stands as proof that a 
mining company can conduct its operations without polluting 
the environment.
<P>
	The company derives no less than 15 per cent of its supplies 
from various recycled products. More than 150 suppliers from 
around the world do business with Noranda. These include such 
well-known companies as IBM and Kodak.
<P>
	In addition to making an economic contribution, Noranda 
enriches the quality of life in the community by making 
substantial grants to local agencies.
<P>
	The technology employed at the Horne smelter goes far 
beyond our borders. Agreements for the export of continuous 
smelting technology have been concluded with China, allowing 
the Horne smelter to make a name for itself in terms of its

	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Mr. Speaker, the joint 
subcommittee of agriculture and transport has been dealing with 
the crisis in grain movement in Canada. The testimony of these 
meetings clearly demonstrates there are too many 
uncoordinated and overlapping government organizations 
attempting to control and regulate grain movement.
<P>
	There is no clear authority. One organization often interferes 
with the actions of another. This has led to a transportation and 
grain handling industry which has failed miserably. This is 
unfair to Canadian farmers.
<P>
	Reform agriculture policy has always recognized the need for 
a less regulated industry and the evidence supports our position. 
The government must back off. We must allow farmers to 
control the system they pay for and which exists to serve them.
<P>
	It is my sincerest hope that this government will recognize the 
need for less government regulation and for a more market 
driven grain transportation industry.

<P>

	As the member of Parliament for Timiskaming-French

<P>
	These draft amendments would restrict the sale and

There is too much violent crime as witnessed by my constituents

<P>
	However, in the past ten years, one and a half times more men 
than women have been admitted into Canada as refugees.
<P>
	Furthermore, the refugee selection process applied at offices 
located abroad is also biased against women. Indeed, women

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, about one 
hour ago in my riding of Beaver River students and staff of J.A. 
Williams High School in Lac La Biche joined together to offer 
their sympathy to families that have lost loved ones at the hands 
of young offenders.
<P>
	They joined to form a heart with the word yes underneath it; 
yes to major changes in the Young Offenders Act.
<P>
	They are telling us it is not just the older generation that is 
concerned about youth violence, they are also concerned. They 
are puzzled as to why the identities of all young offenders are 
protected. What about the rights of citizens to be informed of 
potential dangers in their own neighbourhood? Young people 
who commit criminal acts must be held responsible. All 
Canadians are angry and frustrated at a court system that allows 
young criminals to thumb their noses at the law.
<P>
	I congratulate the students at J.A. Williams High School for 
their initiative. We should listen to them and to millions of other 
Canadians. They are telling us loud and clear that yes, the Young

constituents of London-Middlesex believe that 
communication is a vital link in the development of a unified 
community.
<P>
	In 1993 a large area of land including the village of Lambeth 
was annexed to the city of London. Lambeth is now part of 
London and as such receives most of the same services and 
utilities as the residents of London.
<P>
	There is one exception. That is that Lambeth residents are 
subject to long distance telephone rates when calling 
surrounding communities.
<P>
	The community of Lambeth has a strong social and 
commercial dependency with neighbouring exchanges. It does 
not seem fair or equitable that Lambeth residents do not receive 
extended area service in the same manner as other London 
residents.
<P>
	An overwhelming number of my constituents are in support of 
the CRTC providing extended area service to the Lambeth 
telephone exchange. On their behalf I ask that the government 
consider this unique situation which would go a long way in 
improving our vital community communication links.

which serve to deviously corrupt our young people and attack 
our basic values of respect for life.

legislation banning the sale of such cards and games. He is 
leading the way to a more decent and respectful society.

quality of service that is delivered to the taxpayers by 
government.
<P>
	Many of our civil servants are hard working, dedicated 
people. However, I have discovered many incidents of poor 
attitude and indeed the inability to deliver personal services in 
many departments of government.
<P>
	A recent freeze on public sector wages has been imposed on 
government employees. This freeze is, at the choice of the 
public service, being borne by the junior employees; that is to 
say incremental increases have been curtailed. As a 
consequence the freeze on mid-line management is minimal as 
it would only forgo modest cost of living increases.
<P>
	As it is generally the more junior ranks that deal with the 
public, I fear that this policy will further erode motivation and 
reduce service. This is occurring at a time when the private 
sector is embracing concepts like total quality management.
<P>

<P>
	First, we must remember that most youths are law abiding, 
hard working young people. It is important to recognize that 60 
per cent of crimes committed by young people are property 
crimes. Also, of all violent crimes reported in Canada 86 per 
cent are committed by adults, not youths.

Canadians will also be heard by a committee when the

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs.
<P>
	Yesterday, after condemning the UN's decision to withdraw 
its peacekeepers from Rwanda, the minister said that in fact 
reinforcements should be sent to that country. However, on May 
5, the Deputy Prime Minister, who disagreed with the minister, 
said that she refused to consider the feasibility of sending 
reinforcements and acting on the request made by the UN 
Secretary General.
<P>
	In the case of Haiti, yesterday the minister seemed to support 
the U.S. proposal to send a UN force, although on May 4 in the 
House, the minister rejected out of hand the possibility of armed 
intervention.
<P>
	My question is this: How does the minister explain this 
about-face by the government, this change of policy in its 
approach to the events in Rwanda and Haiti, and are we to 
understand that in the case of Rwanda, Canada not only supports 
the secretary general's request for additional peacekeepers but 
intends to participate personally?

wishful thinking on his part.

	Both in Rwanda and Haiti, the Government of Canada is 
pursuing very specific objectives: to persuade the parties to stop 
killing each other, and to support all humanitarian efforts to help 
the people in those areas. And in the second case, to bring 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the president in exile, back to Haiti. In 
both cases, anything we can do in co-operation with our partners 
and allies will be in line with the government's objectives.
<P>
	We may have to fine-tune our approach in the weeks to come, 
but the objectives remain the same, and there has been no change 
in policy on the part of the government.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would be more inclined to use the word ``zigzagging'' 
instead of fine-tuning in referring to the government's foreign 
policy.
<P>
	I want to ask the minister, who is now mentioning the 
possibility of armed intervention in Haiti, why on May 4 he said 
in this House, and I quote: ``Canada did not contemplate the 
possibility of an armed intervention, as we are convinced that 
stiffer economic sanctions would overcome the military junta''?
<P>
	What made the government change its mind so that it could 
now consider sending in the troops instead of maintaining an 
economic embargo?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I may remind the hon. member that there have been 
quite a few zigzags in his political career. All things considered, 
I think-

wait and see attitude: The wait-and-see attitude is back.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ouellet:</B> He may call this zigzagging, but I can assure 
him that the Government of Canada is prepared to do whatever 
zigzagging it takes to get President Aristide back to his country. 
With our allies, and more specifically with Haiti's friends, we 
are pursuing a series of measures to convince the Haitian 
military that they cannot usurp the government, they cannot 
keep depriving the people of a democratic government, and that 
we will continue our efforts, first of all with measures we feel 
are effective, in other words, a total embargo, to bring back 
President Aristide.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	If this approach is not successful, we will consider the next 
alternative. For the time being, we have not changed our 
position, and we continue to believe that total sanctions will be 
successful as a way to take power away from the military in that 
country.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, after asking the Minister of Foreign Affairs about his 
government's position on international issues, I was somewhat 
surprised to see him stoop to domestic squabbling. We can 
assume that the minister who is responsible for the lofty domain 
of international affairs is never far removed from his partisan 
concerns.
<P>
	Does this fine-tuning-to borrow a euphemism from the 
minister- of the government's approach to foreign affairs mean 
that Canada has not obtained all the guarantees expected from 
the Dominican Republic with respect to compliance with the 
economic embargo and that consequently, the minister is now 
going back to the American proposal because the total embargo 
contemplated by the minister is doomed to fail?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to say to the Leader of the Opposition that in our 
discussions yesterday with the U.S. ambassador to the UN, we 
reviewed a series of initiatives that have been taken in order to 
make sure that President Aristide returns to Haiti.
<P>
	It is quite clear that if we want to follow the agreement of 
Governors Island, at some point there will have to be the return 
of police forces to assist in re-establishing democracy in Haiti.
<P>
	I suspect that the hon. member is misinterpreting when he 
talks about forces. We are not talking about military forces. We 
are talking about police forces that should go back to Haiti. I 
draw this to his attention.
<P>
	Clearly our objective is to implement the Governors Island 
agreement. Canada is fully supportive of this. We have been in 
the forefront in making sure that sanctions are applied and that 
total sanctions are imposed by the UN. We are quite pleased that 
diplomacy and our  representations now have the full support of 
the American government.

	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. In 
mid-June, the second to last frigate will be completed and 700 
workers will be laid off at MIL Davie. In November, the frigate 
program will end and there will only be 80 employees left, who 
will maintain the shipyard. At best, if the Magdalen Islands 
ferry is built, construction would begin in February 1995 at the 
earliest. The government has everything it needs to make a 
decision, including MIL Davie's business plan.
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister aware that his government's 
inexplicable slowness in making a decision on the islands ferry 
and the ``smart'' ship is doing serious harm to the Lauzon 
shipyard and making thousands of workers who are waiting for a 
decision lose all hope?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as announced in the House this week, MIL Davie's business plan 
was filed only last week.
<P>
	The hon. member rightly says that everyone is concerned 
about the future of the MIL Davie shipyard, but surely building 
the ferry for the run between Prince Edward Island and the 
Magdalen Islands will not be enough to keep MIL Davie going.
<P>
	I wish to assure my colleague that the Government of Canada 
is trying to co-operate on this issue, but besides the recovery 
program for MIL Davie based on its business plan, financing 
would have to be found both for the ferry and for the ``smart'' 
ship. We are all concerned with this issue and we are trying to 
work as quickly as possible.
<P>
	Nevertheless, we should point out that the financial plan was 
submitted only last week, as an opposition member indicated 
earlier this week.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans):</B> Mr. Speaker, could the 
Prime Minister tell us how many more people will have to be 
laid off before the government makes a decision on construction 
of the ferry at MIL Davie?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
nobody wants to see shipyard workers laid off. Practically all 
Canadians across the country know what happened in the 
shipbuilding industry in British Columbia, Newfoundland, 
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Quebec. We know full well 
that we must try to maintain an industry that is important to 
Quebec and Canada.
<P>
	However, in a project such as this, we must ensure that not 
only is the business plan tabled, but also that the  financial 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4132"> 4132 </A></B>

statements are in order, and that shipbuilding has a viable future 
not only for the shipyard but especially for the workers.
<P>

are now trying to find the financial resources needed to arrive at 
the solution that I am sure my hon. colleague would like to see as

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	On Mother's Day a number of us attended justice rallies in 
Edmonton and Calgary. These were held to commemorate the 
deaths of Barb Danelesko, the young Edmonton mother who was 
murdered in her home by young offenders, and to demand action 
to reform the justice system and address the roots of crime.
<P>
	While the government has assured Canadians it is studying 
these problems and working on amendments to relevant 
legislation, the public is crying out for action now.
<P>
	Is there not some element of the government's criminal 
justice reform package that it could bring forward now for 
passage before the summer recess, at least as a symbol that the 
government is capable of acting swiftly on this major public 
concern?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I said in the House 
yesterday, we propose to bring forward specific legislation, 
particularly in relation to the Young Offenders Act but also 
dealing more broadly with the question of sentencing under the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	We propose also to announce the creation, the structure and 
the composition of a national crime prevention council within 
the weeks to come. Before the House rises in June, it will have 
before it legislation with respect to specific changes in the 
Young Offenders Act and sentencing as well as particulars of the 
crime prevention council.
<P>
	I cannot tell the hon. member that this legislation will be 
enacted by the end of June. I can say in response that we will 
have concrete proposals before the House and that is in keeping 
with the commitments we have made throughout the session.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the minister's answer. We have heard this and the 
timetable before.
<P>
	There must be something in that package, a change to the age 
of application to the Young Offender's Act, perhaps a change in 
the accountability of the parole board, something that the 
government could bring forward expeditiously and get passed to 
recognize the public's demand for swift action.
<P>
	My supplementary question is this. How is it that when the 
government wants to act swiftly to undo certain acts of the 
previous government, like cancel the helicopter and Pearson 
airport deals, it can act overnight? How is it when it wants to ram 
a bill on redistribution of politicians' seats through Parliament it 
can use closure to expedite that? Why will the government not 
act with the same urgency and swiftness when the lives and 
property of Canadians are at stake?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, may I say two things in 
response?
<P>
	First of all, the process of criminal justice reform is an area of 
law that uniquely engages the interests of the provinces, for they 
pay for much of it in terms of administration, particularly with 
young offenders. It seemed to the government that it was 
appropriate, indeed necessary, at the end of March when we 
convened a meeting with our provincial and territorial 
counterparts, to solicit their views with respect to the proposals 
we had. As a result of that consultation there are changes in the 
proposals we will be bringing forward.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	The second and equally important answer that I proffer to the 
hon. member is this. One must not think that the problems of 
crime and violence in this society are going to be dealt with by 
specific amendments to this or that piece of legislation. That 
will help and we are going to do it. But what is really going to be 
required if we are going to make a significant difference in the 
safety of communities in this country is a longer term approach 
toward crime prevention.
<P>
	The hon. member ought not to think that just changing a 
statute is going to get that job done.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Canadian public is not stupid. If these types of answers had 
been advanced at these public rallies, that nothing can be done 
because of the complexity of federal-provincial relations or 
nothing can be done because the cause lies deep and far behind, 
the minister would have been booed off the stage.
<P>
	My supplementary question is for the Solicitor General.
<P>
	We understand that the prairie vice-chairman of the National 
Parole Board says he wants an apology for inaccurate 
accusations of his involvement in the release of convicted 
murderers.
<P>
	What is the government's policy on officially apologizing to 
victims and citizens for the failures of the National Parole Board 
and is not this something that the government could do swiftly 
and expeditiously?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House

this government wants to do more than apologize for omissions 
of the previous government. It wants to bring forward 
legislation very soon to modernize and improve the parole and 
corrections system so that the concerns of the public in that 
regard will be answered to in a concrete way.
<P>
	I hope that we will have the support of the Reform Party when 
we bring forward this legislation because it is action people 
want, not just words.

question is for the Minister of Health. This morning, we learned 
that close to 140,000 Canadians might be carrying the hepatitis 
C virus, several of them through blood transfusions without 
knowing it. After the contaminated blood scandal, this new 
problem again raises the issue of public health and safety in the 
context of blood transfusions.
<P>
	Does the minister agree with the head of the federal office 
regulating blood products, who says that it is pointless to try to 
track down those who received contaminated blood transfusions 
and now carry the hepatitis C virus, because no vaccine or 
preventive treatment exist? Does the minister share that 
opinion?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health): </B>Mr. Speaker, as 
you know, Canada's blood collecting system is recognized as 
one of the best in the world. It goes without saying that there will 
always be problems. Right now, the commission headed by Mr. 
Krever is looking at blood contamination problems to ensure 
that Canadians enjoy the best possible protection for their 
health. We are anxiously waiting the commission's report.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
minister not realize that her primary obligation is to intervene as 
minister responsible for public health? Will she order an inquiry 
into the circumstances surrounding this new contaminated 
blood problem, and will she demand that the Red Cross contact 
all those who may have been contaminated?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
blood transfusions, like any other medical procedures, are 
relatively safe but there are never 100 per cent guarantees.
<P>
	Hepatitis C infection is certainly a case in point. We are 
continuing to monitor the progress. We know that the Canadian 
Red Cross has brought in testing of donors and has made 
considerable progress.

When they escaped the press release issued by Correctional 
Service Canada stated that the two escapees were considered 
low risk.
<P>
	On Friday these two low risk offenders were arrested in 
Oregon after robbing a store at gunpoint. When these two low 
risk offenders were arrested they were driving a stolen car of a 
man who was found strangled to death in his apartment and 
guess what, these two low risk offenders are suspects in the 
murder.
<P>
	What guarantees can the minister give this House that there 
are not other such low risk offenders in Canada's minimum 
security prisons?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Commissioner of Corrections has just announced the setting 
up of a national inquiry into this whole situation. I am asking 
him to review this as a matter of urgency because protection of 
the public has to be our priority.
<P>
	That is what I think the public wants whether the people in 
question are in a maximum security institution or a minimum 
security institution.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
suppose the national inquiry might get at it in the long run but we 
want to talk about crime prevention in the House.
<P>
	One of these low risk offenders was Michael Kelly Roberts. 
The criminal record of this low risk offender includes a 25-year 
sentence for attempted murder of a police officer and a life 
sentence for the murder of a fellow inmate. In 1988 he walked 
away from a minimum security prison as well and was on the 
loose for two years.
<P>
	How could anyone, let alone a professional in Correctional

action will be taken against the men who made this ridiculous 
decision?

compliance, her department must ensure that the medication is 
efficient and safe for the people of Canada.
<P>
	Since BioVac has been waiting 22 months to obtain approval 
for its BCG cancer vaccine, are we to understand, from the

does not consider the vaccine an acceptable drug to be 
marketed?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health): </B>Mr. Speaker, as I 
said on April 27, we have to follow a process, whereby the 
Department of Health along with its researchers and scientists 
must ensure that the medication they are about to approve will 
serve its purpose.
<P>
	The 22-month delay may have been due to the great number 
of drugs we have to examine. As you know, we have a deficit and 
debt problem. We receive a lot of submissions for new drugs. As 
the list gets longer and longer, so do the delays.

<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr.

impose a first set of sanctions against the military regime in 
Haiti. It has a period of time to comply and if it does not comply, 
full sanctions will be imposed against Haiti.
<P>
	In the meantime diplomatic efforts are being made in order to 
obtain the co-operation of the Dominican Republic in order to 
ensure that the border is totally closed so that the military is not 
receiving products that it should not get because of the

situation where at least the perception is that people are having 
to pay twice. The Reform Party is asking that the government 
save tax dollars by using charter aircraft or rented aircraft.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4136"> 4136 </A></B>
<P>
	I ask the minister to say either yes or no, oui or non. Are they 
using private aircraft and, if that is the case, would they accept 
the Reform Party's suggestion in its entirety that the 
Challengers be sold-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Could the hon. member please be precise and 
put her question now.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> I will put my question now. Will the government 
sell the Challengers now and have cabinet ministers travel by 
commercial flights when possible and only by charter when 
necessary?
<P>
<B>(1450 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I 
should like to say that I have no specific knowledge of any 
chartered flights taken by any of my colleagues.
<P>
	Again, the hon. member should have looked at the entire 
review. Had she been there when I did the entire 20-minute 
taping she certainly would not have got that impression. I would 
like to ask her a question.
<P>

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. 
Several immigrant aid organizations deplore the current 
sponsorship provisions of the Immigration Act that can lead to 
abuse from the sponsor, usually the spouse. It appears that 
immigration officers leave women and children at the mercy of 
violent family members and under the threat of sponsorship 
withdrawal.
<P>
	In cases where violence and sponsorship withdrawal threats 
are involved, what measures does the minister intend to take to 
give the victim a recourse other than ministerial discretion, if 
she is not eligible for permanent resident status?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration): </B>Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her 
question. It is an issue that our officials have been studying for 
four months.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We have an internal task force looking at sponsorship 
breakdown, the fact that some people fraudulently break their 
contract with this country. I think we should look very carefully 
and very toughly at those individuals.
<P>
	Second, there are those individuals in Canada who, through 
no fault of their own, have been hit by the economic impact and 
are thus not in a position to sponsor those individuals.
<P>
	There is a third category that is growing of individuals who, 
under the threat of going to the government and pulling the 
sponsorships, are physically violating women. That is under 
active consideration.
<P>
	We have engaged the provinces so that we can come up with a 
package that is not only tough with those who break the law but 
sensitive to those individuals who through no fault of their own 
find themselves in impossible situations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec):</B> Mr. Speaker, is the 
minister aware that some immigrant women sponsored by their 
spouses are extremely vulnerable and does he not believe that 
they should be better protected than they are now?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, yes, the government is sensitive to 
that. We should also say with some degree of pride that our 
country is the only country that has offered gender persecution 
guidelines within the IRB. It is the only country in the world. 
During my discussion with the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees I learned that they are now in the 
process of trying to export those gender persecution guidelines 
around the world.
<P>
	In the international context we have also raised the reality of 
there being some 20 million refugees around the world, the 
majority of whom are women and young children. Regrettably 
the majority of refugees selected from camps are men. We have 
spoken about that publicly. We need to redress some realities 
that have stared the world in the face for far too long.

	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Today the bank increased its lending rate by 34 basis points to 
what is now 6.61 per cent. When the present Minister of Finance 
was in opposition he often insisted on the lowering of interest 
rates because high rates retard economic growth, reduce 
employment and tax revenue. We know that they also raise the 
cost of servicing the debt. The two effects combined will result 
in a larger deficit.
<P>
<B>(1455) </B>
<P>
	Will the minister now consider further spending cuts that he 
knows are the only way to prevent increasing the deficit and the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4137"> 4137 </A></B>
<P>
possible disastrous dumping of Canadian bonds by investors, 
which in turn will lead to even higher interest rates?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. member knows, at the time 
we brought in the budget it was one of a very few times if not the 
first time a government set in place contingency reserves in 
order to meet unexpected matters.
<P>
	The member also knows that these contingency reserves, 
growth in employment and a number of other things arising out 
of confidence as a result of the activities of the government have 
given us better economic indicators in almost everything else. 
We are on target and there is no further need for a minibudget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
leading bank just published a report saying that if the interest 
rate remains one and a half percentage points above that 
predicted it will in fact wipe out the contingency reserve. 
Furthermore the contingency reserve is in the budget as 
spending and the deficit will be increased by this continuation.
<P>
	What criteria will the minister use in deciding that interest 
rates have risen such that he has to act, that he has to make new 
spending cuts?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows that any 
comments-he did this in the preamble to his first question-I 
made in terms of interest rates were made when I was a member 
of the opposition. It is not incumbent upon the Minister of 
Finance to make comments about interest rates. May I say, 
therefore, that I look forward to the member making continuing 
comments about interest rates for many years to come.
<P>
	The fact is that in our budget we provided for substantial 
spending cuts arising out of structural reforms which are very 
important to make the economy work. Those structural reforms 
are in place and are working. We are also delighted to see that 
our budget is being brought on course and kept on course by high 
unemployment-by low unemployment insurance benefits.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard)</B> Oh, benefits. They have to 
understand that unemployment insurance benefits is a phrase. I 
know it is hard for the opposition to grasp a whole phrase at one 
time.
<P>
	At the same time there is confidence in Canadians. That is 
what is going to turn the situation around.

	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	Members of the public have shown concern for the need for 
blood testing of sexual offenders to determine if they are HIV 
positive or to determine whether they carry a transmittable 
venereal disease.
<P>
	What if anything is being done in this area to detect such 
diseases and to prevent the spread of such diseases to victims?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I met last Friday in my office 
with a woman known publicly as Margo B., a victim of sexual 
violence, who discussed this matter with me from a powerfully 
personal perspective.
<P>
	I want the House to know that I expressed to Margo B. on that 
occasion my admiration for the courage with which she has 
drawn public attention to this important question.
<P>
	I want the House to know as well that I told Margo B. that we 
are considering the question. We recognize its complexity. It 
raises criminal law as well as health and constitutional issues. 
We have it under consideration. Indeed I told her that an 
interdepartmental report we received recently recommended 
against compulsory HIV testing in such circumstances but that I 
did not consider that the end of the matter.
<P>
	Finally I told her then, as I tell the House now, that I expect the 
Department of Justice will be in a position to make its 
recommendation to the government in this connection by about 
September of this year so that we can get the matter before the 
public for discussion at that time.

	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the minister responsible for seniors.
<P>
	The federal government is getting ready to introduce a 
centralized telephone system which uses voice mail to answer 
all inquiries about government programs from senior citizens.
<P>
	In future, all inquiries from seniors will be routed to a 
telephone exchange in Montreal.
<P>
	Given the special needs of seniors and persons with 
disabilities, will the Prime Minister recognize that the 
widespread use of so-called voice boxes in dealing with clients 
such as these is totally inappropriate?
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4138"> 4138 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification): </B>Mr. Speaker, I disagree completely with the 
statements made by the hon. member and by the president of the 
union.
<P>
	On the contrary, our proposal calls for highly personalized 
and speedy services. For example, clients wishing to speak to 
someone in person will receive a response in half a day, instead 
of seven; those wishing to obtain pension information will 
receive a reply in one day, instead of thirteen; the response time 
in the case of appeals involving seniors will be reduced from 
eight weeks to one day.
<P>
	Certainly our government has made it a priority to provide 
less costly, more efficient, and more humane services to seniors. 
This is not what the hon. member would have us believe.

<P>
	Today the minister tabled legislation to deal with the east 
coast fisheries disaster. We want to avoid a similar catastrophe 
in the west coast fishery. Local media reports in my west coast 
riding indicate that DFO is reducing-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Order. Will the hon. member please put his 
question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duncan:</B> Will the minister tell the House that already 
scarce west coast DFO enforcement and management programs 
will continue and that diversion of funds to the aboriginal 
fishing strategy will cease?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, indeed the member is right. As was promised by the 
Prime Minister, we tabled legislation today to deal with foreign 
overfishing. Another red book commitment has been kept.
<P>
	Let me say as well, because it is important to note it, that the 
legislation is not partisan in nature. It has received the support 
of the Leader of the Official Opposition and his party. I want to 
acknowledge the support of the leader of the Reform Party and 
his party, the support of the New Democratic Party, and I 
understand the support of the Conservative Party.
<P>
	We will give the same kind of attention to the problem of 
fishing and overfishing on Canada's west coast that the House of

the east coast. This is one case where the country speaks as one

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I would like to 
say what a privilege it is to have the opportunity to take part in 
the debate today. I feel very honoured to be able to work with the 
Department of Agriculture and Agri-food, a department that has 
such a real impact on the lives of Canadians.
<P>
	The agriculture and agri-food portfolio is one that affects us 
all to probably a greater extent than many others, although 
different departments in the federal government affect our lives 
each and every day. However, agriculture and agri-food is one 
that contributes to economic growth and job creation, 
international competitiveness, market development and 
domestic prosperity. Fundamentally and most importantly it is 
one of the major players and is responsible for providing and 
ensuring a healthy and safe food supply for Canadians.
<P>
	I also feel very fortunate to work with the present Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food as parliamentary secretary. I enjoy 
very much working in co-operation with him, in facing and 
meeting the challenges head on that are coming to the industry 
today, seemingly at a faster rate than they ever have before.
<P>
	The agriculture industry is one that changes very rapidly. It 
always has and quite frankly probably always will. It is an 
industry that is made up of individuals, whether primary 
producers or processors or anyone else in the very large 
agri-food chain. It is made up of people who are very resilient 
and very determined to be successful. They are efficient 
producers, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4140"> 4140 </A></B>
<P>
efficient players  and holders of the links in that chain. It is also 
a pleasure to work with them.
<P>
	We know that Canadians feel very strongly about the 
agri-food industry and even passionately about food. When we 
are on a holiday or on weekends or a dinner at home with our 
family some of the strongest memories we have are about food. 
It is said that the way to a person's heart is through their 
stomach. We in Canada have to stop more often than we do and 
remind ourselves how fortunate we are as Canadians to have the 
food system we have.
<P>
	I want to remind members and anyone who might be watching 
about the importance and the value the agri-food industry plays 
in providing Canadians with the safest and most reasonably 
priced food of any country in the world. Once in a while we see 
an analysis that states the country south of us spends a slightly 
smaller percentage of their disposable income on food 
consumed at home. Basically we are neck in neck with them.
<P>
	On average Canadians spend about 10 or 11 per cent of their 
disposable income on food. When that is compared with some 
other countries in the world where it is two, three and four times 
higher and when you consider that the food provided to all 
Canadians is without question the best and the safest in the 
world, we are doing a pretty good job. Canadians are getting an 
incredibly good return on their investment and their food dollar. 
Not only does the agri-food industry provide the food on our 
plates but it also plays a major role in the balance of trade.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	About 8 per cent of the products that we export in total are 
agri-food products, whether in bulk or further processed 
products, to the tune of about $13.5 billion. The agri-food 
industry from the primary producer right through to the 
restaurant and food service industry employs about 15 per cent 
of the population, about 1.6 million or 1.7 million Canadians. It 
is no small player.
<P>
	The agri-food industry plays a major role in the sustainability 
of our environment and is being asked to play a more major role. 
It is certainly willing to play a more major role and to take 
responsibility for soil and water conservation. Last but not least 
the industry plays a major role in the social fibre and fabric of 
the nation. I could go back through all of these and outline areas 
where the government is very active.
<P>
	This morning the member for Québec-Est brought up a 
number of issues that he thought needed to be discussed, but I 
want to remind him that he did not bring up one issue that the 
present government is not already addressing.
<P>
	One of the other speakers from the opposition made the 
comment that they had an opposition day on agriculture last 
week. They tried to claim that they beat us to the punch. I would 
remind the opposition that the government about five or six 
weeks ago announced that  there was going to be a full day of 
debate in the House on agriculture.
<P>
	One of the things the government is doing which has not been 
done in this way before is listening to the concerns of opposition 
members about the agriculture and agri-food industry. It is the 
substance of the debate today that is so important. I would like to 
take a few minutes on some of that in a minute or two.
<P>
	I would also like to express to everyone how pleased we are to 
see the eagerness that all of the players in the agri-food industry 
are exhibiting in attacking and approaching the challenges and 
opportunities that are before us in the agri-food industry today. 
There is a real determination among Canadians to put their 
shoulder to the wheel, to work with government, to work with all 
of the players to help support and facilitate what needs to be 
done in adjusting to the new trade regimes that we have to deal 
with.
<P>
	We know as a government that the direction and input must 
come from the bottom up, but it is the duty, as other members 
have said today, of government to deal with and to facilitate and 
to consolidate the concerns of everybody in the industry, 
whether that be by methods of financing, whether it be in 
legislation, whether it be in enforcement, or inspection or 
whatever.
<P>
	I would like to take a few minutes to talk about how fortunate 
we are with the food inspection and safety programs we have in 
Canada today and the initiatives that the present government is 
moving with in that field. Canadians have the best and safest 
food supply, as I have already said, of any country in the world. 
We intend to keep it that way.
<P>
	It means that we have to get a lot of agencies and a lot of 
different groups working together. The country's food safety 
mandate is shared among different federal departments, as well 
as with provincial health and agriculture departments and with 
municipalities.
<P>
	On the federal level Health Canada is responsible for health 
related food safety matters; the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans looks after fish and fish product safety and quality; 
while Agriculture and Agri-food Canada is responsible for the 
quality and safety of agri-food products. It discharges this 
responsibility through activities including inspection, labelling 
and pesticide regulation.
<P>
	Partnership and consultation are keys to the success and to the 
successful management of a healthy and safe food supply in this 
country. With so many players involved in the issue of food 
safety, it is important to ensure that there is consistency, to 
clarify the roles and eliminate duplication in order to maintain 
the most efficient food safety system that we possibly can and, 
quite frankly, that we do have.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4141"> 4141 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	Before I get into what the department of agriculture is doing 
in order to ensure that safety and that the efforts are 
co-ordinated among all that are involved, I would like to 
mention the mandate of the department. As I say, different 
departments are involved in food safety but it has the mandate of 
agriculture in there.
<P>
	The main one is the role carried out by the food production 
and inspection branch, which is the regulatory arm of the 
department. The food production and inspection branch 
develops and establishes health and safety standards which the 
agri-food industry is required to meet. It also sets out to protect 
the Canadian agriculture industry in controlling the introduction 
and spread of foreign animal and plant diseases and pests that 
may enter the country from outside our borders. That indeed is a 
very important role that it plays as well.
<P>
	In 1976 that branch was formed and three years later the food 
inspection directorate was created within the branch. The 
mandate of that directorate is based on four pieces of 
legislation: the Canada Agricultural Products Act, the Meat 
Inspection Act, the Food and Drugs Act and the Consumer 
Packaging and Labelling Act. From the titles of those people can 
draw the conclusion of what they basically deal with.
<P>
	Over the years the food inspection directorate has developed 
various programs and policies and has provided services to 
clients that have allowed the Canadian agri-food sector to 
prosper and be competitive on a world market. The directorate 
has been instrumental in contributing to the department's high 
level of credibility in the area of food safety through its ability 
to handle complex situations and balance, what many times are 
political, social, scientific and economic interests.
<P>
	The world is changing but the agriculture and agri-food 
sectors' commitment to food safety is not changing. What we do 
have through the food inspection directorate is the relentless 
determination to carry out the job that needs to be done and we 
will not let up on that pressure.
<P>
	Change is happening very rapidly. Today's global economy, 
as we know, is reshaping the structure of the agri-food industry. 
There is a stronger emphasis on trade and a significant increase 
in imports and exports determines and dictates that the 
consumers' tastes are diversifying. The department has to be 
able to deal with those increases in imports and the variety of 
imports that they must inspect and determine their safety and 
health for Canadians.
<P>
	The growth in volume in the kind of food imports will place 
increased pressure on the department. We know that we can 
meet that with determination. We must meet that and continue 
the good job that we have done at the same time as improving its 
efficiency. We have to do what we have done better. We are able 
to do that and we will have to do it with probably less funding 
and fewer people. Therefore it is important that we have the  
co-operation between the provincial and municipal 
governments and the private sector to carry that out.
<P>
	For their part as well, the consumers are becoming more 
aware of food issues. Today's consumers need more information 
and increased assurances that the food they eat is safe. Now 
more than ever consumers are very concerned about the 
effectiveness of food inspection and food inspection programs 
and how food safety is regulated.
<P>
	Rapid advances in the agricultural technology area are also 
having an impact on the product services and markets for food 
companies. The regulatory framework surrounding these 
changes needs to be equally responsive and regulations must be 
in place quickly to allow companies to take advantage of new 
opportunities while making sure that the food safety and quality 
concerns are still being met.
<P>
	Today's agri-food industry is a very different one than it once 
was. The industry has become more self-regulating and is 
largely self-reliant, often taking the lead in exploring the new 
technologies and new methods of productions and processing 
that are leading to improvements in the agri-food sector. This 
presents a challenge but not one that we cannot meet and are not 
meeting. We are doing an excellent job but it is a challenge for 
government in that it must now try to regulate food safety in 
areas where we may not have had a lot of activity or 
participation in the past.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	We have put in place initiatives to tackle these new realities 
successfully and we believe that the answer lies in the 
development of a revised food inspection system strategy. The 
department of agriculture, through the food inspection 
directorate, has been working toward this and has set out a 
number of initiatives which will lead us to that goal.
<P>
	One of those initiatives is the national food inspection policy, 
one of the department's ultimate goals with an objective which 
was approved by the federal and provincial ministers in 
Charlottetown at a federal-provincial agriculture ministers 
meeting last year. It calls for the establishment of common 
standards between provinces and federal agencies in order to 
provide for food safety and food disclosures.
<P>
	The benefits of such a system are many and the efficiencies 
are many. It will streamline the inspection delivery system. It 
will enhance market performance and competitiveness. It will 
reduce trade barriers and regulatory pressures on industry. It 
will facilitate and harmonize processes and offer a flexible and 
responsive inspection system.
<P>
	A national food inspection system is, as I said, a top priority 
for everyone in the Canadian agri-food inspection area. It will 
ensure that consumers continue to have access to a high quality 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4142"> 4142 </A></B>
<P>
food supply and a safe food supply, and it will ensure the 
harmonization of national standards.
<P>
	As well, there is the food safety enhancement program and the 
general trend across the agencies involved in food inspection to 
work on a common health and safety standard which will 
increase mutual recognition of inspection and reduce 
duplication.
<P>
	These agencies apply the hazard analysis and critical control 
points principles to their inspection practices and this is an 
internationally recognized approach to controlling and 
monitoring the food processing operations. Agriculture and 
Agri-Food Canada is working with industry to implement the 
principles of the hazard analysis and critical control points 
program and the department will be consulting with industry on 
an ongoing basis to develop that program.
<P>
	As well, there is the common inspection approach at the 
interdepartmental level which will adopt the principles I just 
talked about based on an inspection approach being developed 
through common Government of Canada inspection standards 
which will be implemented using a mutually accepted audit 
protocol.
<P>
	A tremendous amount is going on and has been going on 
regarding food safety in Canada. The federal departments are 
now concentrating their efforts on defining the specific 
requirements for other highly identified risk areas in the food 
processing industry.
<P>
	There is also a single access food labelling service. We have 
had a situation for a number of years in which labelling has been 
quite cumbersome. One of the results of the recent government 
reorganization was the consolidation of food labelling activities 
involving the former Department of Consumer and Corporate 
Affairs and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada which will 
streamline that operation.
<P>
	The evidence through these initiatives is very clear. The 
Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food takes its role very 
seriously in the food safety area. Food safety is something which 
every Canadian should not take for granted. We work very hard 
at maintaining and upgrading our food safety standards in this 
country and I am certain that everyone can appreciate what an 
enormous responsibility it is.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to state that the increased mutual 
recognition by government departments of inspection should 
reduce the complexity of dealing with the federal government. 
This is good news for industry because federal departments will 
be using common language and common interpretation of 
regulations as well as uniformity in rating and enforcement at 
processing establishments.
<P>
	I said at the beginning that the whole agri-food industry was 
facing a lot of challenges and opportunities. It reminds me of the 
story of the commander in a war zone who radioed his platoon 
officer out in the field. He said to the platoon officer: ``Officer, 
how is it this morning?''. The officer said: ``Today we have 
enemy to the left, enemy to the right, enemy in front of us and 
enemy behind us. We won't miss them this time''. I  challenge 
the industry, and I know it is accepting that challenge, to turn 
that the other way.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	Our industry has opportunities in front of us, behind us, to the 
left and to the right, whether they be in Asia, whether they be in 
Latin America, whether they be in our neighbour to the south, 
whether they be in Mexico or whether they be in Europe. The 
opportunities are there.
<P>
	I challenge everyone. I look forward to more comments from 
the opposition members today and input from them. As the 
minister said clearly this morning, we welcome those. We will 
consider those. We will put them in the hopper, as the term is 
used, because we do not want to miss any opportunities there.
<P>
	I congratulate the industry for the eagerness with which it is 
meeting the challenges before us and the opportunities before 
us.
<P>
	In closing, I want to refer to a festivity that was held in 
Toronto last night which the minister, I and some others had the 
privilege to attend. It was the final presentation of the 
Agri-Food Competitiveness Council. I want to remind everyone 
of the vision that it wants to keep before the industry and the 
challenge that is there, one that I know we can meet. I will state 
that in closing. There is nothing to stop us from being the 
premier agri-food sector in the world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question for the hon. secretary to the minister.
<P>
	The member mentioned that there are several departments 
involved in food safety, several agencies outside of the 
department of agriculture, all these people involved in dealing 
with food safety. Is that perhaps part of the problem not just in 
the food safety area but in agriculture in general? Are there too 
many different groups involved in making the decisions in food 
safety and in other areas?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vanclief:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not think anyone right off the 
top of their head can give a yes or no answer to that. What we are 
doing within the department and within the government is 
taking a complete overview of everything that is going on.
<P>
	When we were in opposition we said that in every department 
whether in agriculture or in any other ministry we needed to 
have a look to see whether everything was operating as 
efficiently as it can. As far as food safety is concerned, yes, there 
is work going on between the provinces and the federal 
government to see whether we need to continue any duplication 
if there is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4143"> 4143 </A></B>
<P>
duplication in food processing plants. I will use those as an 
example.
<P>
	Quite frankly I see no reason why if we have a set of rules 
good enough for interprovincial trade it should not be able to be 
meshed with whatever the rules are for inspection for 
international trade. There is no sense in inspectors chasing 
themselves around different plants inspecting for 
interprovincial movement of products and then somebody else 
coming in and saying they have to inspect for international 
movement of product as well. That is being looked at.
<P>
	Canadians have the right and need to be concerned. When I 
say need to be concerned about the safety of Canadian food, they 
need to be and they are but I want to reassure them that they have 
no justification to be worried about what is there. Out of the 11.5 
thousand employees with Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada 
over 4,000 are involved in the inspection of processing facilities 
in the Canadian food supply in total. We do an excellent job in 
providing Canadians with safe food.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
interest earlier to the minister of agriculture when he drew our 
attention to the importance of the federal-provincial 
governments working together with the private sector. Again, 
that has been reiterated by the parliamentary secretary to the 
minister of agriculture.
<P>
	At the moment in British Columbia the federal government, 
the B.C. government and aboriginal groups are negotiating land 
claims. Part of that process is to set up a whole set of advisory 
boards with the various stakeholders involved in the final 
outcome. Of course the critical players are the cattlemen of 
British Columbia.
<P>
	Vast tracts of their land, leased land and deeded land, are 
potentially involved. Their representative on that advisory 
committee has had to swear an oath of secrecy and therefore is 
unable to communicate to cattlemen and other livestock 
operators throughout British Columbia.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	I am really simply asking the parliamentary secretary if he 
would take time to look into this increasing concern that people 
in the livestock industry in British Columbia have.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vanclief:</B> Mr. Speaker, yes I will. I will give a 
commitment to the hon. member that I will look into it and get 
back to him on the situation as far as discussions are concerned.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque):</B> Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed 
listening to the parliamentary secretary to the minister of 
agriculture as he showed how this government intends to 
strengthen and maintain the food inspection and safety of 
agricultural products.
<P>
	There is another area where Canada has shown leadership 
certainly and in which we are recognized for producing a high 
quality product at reasonable prices and that is in the supply 
management sector. The parliamentary secretary has been 
charged with a great responsibility in terms of maintaining the 
benefits of that sector.
<P>
	I am wondering if he could give us a few comments in terms of 
how those discussions are coming along and where that is at.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vanclief:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would be pleased to.
<P>
	As the hon. member for Malpeque has said, the task force on 
the future of orderly marketing, the supply management sector 
and the dairy, egg and poultry sector has been ongoing since 
about mid-January of this year. It was a small task force that 
started out by putting together the work that had already been 
done. We did not reinvent the wheel or redo anything.
<P>
	We assembled the work that had been done by a number of 
task forces and groups of individuals in the industry over the last 
number of years. We assessed the processes, the issues and put 
them all together in a report. We reported to the federal and 
provincial ministers meeting at the end of March on all of the 
issues, all of the processes in place and where to deal with the 
issues that were there. We went on past that and suggested 
processes and participants we felt should be in those processes 
going on for the next number of months.
<P>
	As a result we now have five commodity committees, one for 
each of the supply managed sectors. They are meeting. I am 
pleased to say that representatives of every group of 
stakeholders within the agri-food chain from the farmer or 
primary producer to the consumer are represented around that 
table. They are sitting down and will be reporting back to the 
task force on their recommendations on how to deal with the 
issues. We will reporting the recommendations to the ministers 
in July again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank the parliamentary secretary for his comments earlier on 
agriculture.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary is familiar with my riding and 
with some of the federal institutions in my riding. In particular, 
in reference to his remarks about safety and continuing to 
investigate new ways of producing safe agricultural products he 
will be aware, I am sure, that in the Agassiz agriculture research 
station there is a new program being initiated on manure 
handling and composting and all that sort of thing.
<P>
	I wonder if the parliamentary secretary could comment on the 
future of that kind of study in the Agassiz research station. I 
know the people back home are dying to know.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vanclief:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no question that one of the 
critical regions in Canada as far as what we call waste disposal is 
the Fraser Valley. I have had the pleasure of travelling through 
there a few times, not enough times, because it is a beautiful 
area. There is a high concentration of livestock there. There is a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4144"> 4144 </A></B>
<P>
challenge in the disposal of foreign material that comes along 
with raising livestock.
<P>
	There is work going on there at Agassiz. The federal 
government and the department are very keen to work with those 
at Agassiz, work with the industry people and the commodity or 
livestock groups in that area to solve that problem. I say solve 
the problem but it is not a problem. It is just that there are 
technologies that are coming forward for better disposal of 
agricultural wastes, livestock wastes. We look forward through 
Agassiz and through other areas in the department to working 
with the industry.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before resuming debate I 
want to thank the last intervener from Fraser Valley East and the 
parliamentary secretary for use their of parliamentary language 
in dealing with the nature of the last question.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in this 
place today to set the record straight about the agricultural 
industry.
<P>
	The government introduced a motion in which it boasts about 
its proactive work in the agriculture sector. To listen to it all is 
well with the world. But then that is often the case when the 
opposition ventures constructive criticism.
<P>
	I can tell you that my riding is mainly rural. So, I have 
excellent feelers in that sector. I may surprise you by saying that 
the federal government is indeed pro-active in the agri-food 
sector, in Western provinces. You can certainly count on the 
government to be active in Western Canada!
<P>
	I will give you supporting figures in a moment. Before I do 
however, I want the government to understand that it is not 
enough to be pro-active or claim to be; you must also know 
where you are going and, more importantly, if you are on the 
right track.
<P>
	Quebec has a real plan for the future of the agri-food sector. 
The agricultural community knows what it wants and has taken 
the necessary steps to achieve its goals.
<P>
	When the government decided to impose its policy, it did not 
stop to think for one second that this may not be consistent with 
the priorities and development targets set by the community 
concerned. Unlike the government, this community takes a 
concerted approach.
<P>
	Here are a few examples. In February 1991, Quebecers 
involved in regional development and in the agri-food sector 
met in Montreal, where it was decided that the community had to 
take its future in its own hands.
<P>
	Other objectives developed during this summit conference of 
the rural community included: respect and promotion of 
regional and local values; joint action by regional and local 
partners; diversification of the regional economic base; 
protection and regeneration of resources; restructuring of the 
political power from the base up, an objective we did not hear 
the people across the floor mention.
<P>
	This led to the creation of advisory committees, which are 
incidentally very active in my riding.
<P>
	These committees raised consensus on the general approaches 
to be favoured in promoting the development of the Quebec 
agri-food industry at the Trois-Rivières summit in June 1992. 
Some recommendations to come out of it are: recognize, value 
and support the training of human resources; ensure the 
permanence, development and growth of agri-food companies; 
readjust current income security programs based on production 
costs; develop income security programs compatible with 
international trade rules; provide financing for agricultural 
enterprises and their transfer without massive debt; consider 
support for non-viable companies that could be reoriented 
within the sector and help people leaving farming.
<P>
	We see that the farm community has taken action to control 
decision making in fields of concern to it, but the government 
must avoid making life difficult for them. Our party has also 
dealt with the situation.
<P>
	Agricultural companies and processing plants must be 
encouraged to be self-sufficient by helping them adjust to new 
market requirements, to win new markets and to increase their 
competitiveness by lowering their production costs. The 
government should note this. We could finally break the vicious 
circle of dependence on subsidies.
<P>
	But be careful! This does not mean blindly cutting budgets. 
The transition will take some time. We want this transition to go 
smoothly, but this is unlikely since the government signed the 
GATT agreement.
<P>
	The agri-food sector competes directly with foreign 
competitors now that the Canadian government has thrown farm 
programs and practices into upheaval.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	Let us talk about GATT. Does the government think it acted 
proactively when it signed the GATT agreement on November 
15? This government did not even ensure a settlement of the 
trade disputes that could arise with the Americans. The 
Americans, who still seem to have the upper hand at their own 
game-and you know that baseball is their national 
sport-managed to lead Canada to the negotiating table on all 
agricultural issues.
<P>
	Are all negotiations in good faith not conducted on a 
case-by-case basis? Unfortunately, our government tried to 
play cautiously and defensively. Yet our national sport is 
hockey. A long 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4145"> 4145 </A></B>
<P>
time ago, experts realized that offence is the best defence. The 
Montreal Canadiens could only  count on Patrick Roy this year 
and you saw where it got them.
<P>
	Why not denounce the barriers the Americans put up against 
our products? Why not denounce the numerous measures taken 
to subsidize U.S. agricultural products? Why not condemn the 
hypocrisy of the Americans who accuse Canada of practices 
they themselves have used for a long time? The government may 
call this being proactive, but where I come from we refer to it as 
inertia.
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Americans are having fun at our expense. The 
GATT and NAFTA agreements did not resolve all Canada-U.S. 
trade disputes. Far from it. The Americans even decided that 
quotas will be imposed on durum wheat exports effective July 1. 
This date would be quite a coincidence, if negotiations fail! In 
return, Canada threatens to retaliate against certain American 
products if the U.S. carries out its threat of imposing quotas.
<P>
	A trade war is looming. The Bloc Quebecois is asking the 
government not to yield to American pressure, and not to sign a 
bad agreement for Quebec and Canadian farmers for the sole 
purpose of ending the conflict.
<P>
	Another indication of the Canadian government's apathy in 
these negotiations with Americans is its willingness to negotiate 
a ceiling on Canadian exports of durum wheat to the United 
States. Canada is not guilty of any illegal trade practice in this 
case; yet, it is prepared to penalize itself. Americans are the sole 
responsible of their problems, since they subsidize their durum 
wheat exports. You can understand American producers who 
prefer to export their production. Canada is only satisfying a 
need. It is a simple market law which Americans do not respect 
because it is detrimental to them. Oh, inertia.
<P>
	In the context of our party's position regarding the future of 
this most important industry, we feel that farmers must be 
considered as entrepreneurs and that regional entrepreneurship 
must be supported; also, agricultural development policies must 
be distinguished from regional development policies; finally, 
the government must promote an awareness by farmers 
themselves of the importance of the environment to promote 
agriculture.
<P>
	The government does nothing in its negotiations with 
Americans, and it does nothing inside our borders either. I did 
say at the beginning of my remarks that the government can have 
a proactive approach. But I also added that it was mostly 
proactive in Western Canada. The federal government 
subsidizes Western crop diversification, and so much the better 
for that region. However, this is done to the detriment of 
Quebec. We say: Whoa, there! Here are some facts: Between 
1981 and 1991, cultivated acreage for potatoes increased by 30 
per cent in Western Canada, by 9 per cent in the maritimes, and 
by a mere two per cent in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	During the same period, beef production in the West increased 
by 4 per cent while it fell by 13 per cent in Quebec. In pork 
production, an area which Quebec has been developing for some 
years, the situation is critical. I know whereof I speak, because 
there are processing plants in my riding.
<P>
	Again during the period from 1981 to 1991, the swine 
population in Quebec fell by 16 per cent and increased by 39 per 
cent in Western Canada. In the production of lamb, Quebec is 
also at a disadvantage compared to the West. While Quebec's 
lamb population increased by only 8% between 1981 and 1991, 
that of the West grew by 33 per cent. Even in hothouse crops, 
despite its energy advantages and its proximity to markets, 
Quebec lagged behind the West.
<P>
	During this same period of 1981 to 1991, the area devoted to 
hothouse crops increased by 67 per cent in the West, compared 
to an increase of only 46 per cent in Quebec.
<P>
	The proactiveness of the federal government here takes the 
form of unfair competition at the expense of Quebec producers 
because of subsidies to Western farmers. It is as simple as that. 
If only these subsidies made sense, but they do not. As in many 
areas, the government intervenes without consultation or 
consults the wrong people.
<P>
	Departments should assess the results of their actions. In 
agriculture, the Department is involved in the analysis, 
organization and dissemination of information on agri-food 
markets. Very well, but, here as in other areas, the Auditor 
General notes serious shortcomings. He found that the 
information gathered did not necessarily meet the users' needs. 
Another example of public money being wasted, with decisions 
being made in ivory towers, when it might be easier to check 
firsthand what the clients' true needs are.
<P>
	The government always takes heavyhanded action, when it 
should concentrate on avoiding duplication with provincial 
initiatives. Quebec has understood this, as industry and 
government have been working together for a long time to 
implement strategies to conquer new markets. It is not only 
Quebeckers who have understood this.
<P>
	At the Sixth Outlook Conference on the future of the 
agri-food sector, which took place in Quebec City on March 9, 
Ms. Cooper, project co-ordinator at the Guelph Food 
Technology Center, made this point: ``In the fight between the 
federal government and the provincial governments to decide 
who is going to lead the industry, the governments developed 
programs that overlap or conflict with others. This is a waste of 
public money and increases the debt''.
<P>
	Ms. Cooper, whose remarks were published in the journal <I>La 
terre de chez nous</I>, maintains that an effective government 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4146"> 4146 </A></B>
<P>
encourages companies to become more  competitive. 
Governments should be more responsible and more effective in 
their actions.
<P>
	She also stated that governments should ensure more and 
more transparency and relevance with respect to money 
invested.
<P>
	Many agricultural producers in Quebec are sovereigntists. I 
understand them. In a few minutes, I have shown how the federal 
government is ineffective for them, and they could go on at 
length about this subject. What is known is that the number one 
solution for our agricultural producers is to decentralize 
decision-making mechanisms and to provide effective budgets. 
Is the government willing to take this approach?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce):</B> Mr. Speaker, I commend 
my colleague for his dissertation this afternoon on the subject 
with which I find myself quite familiar.
<P>
	I found his observations on the agricultural scene in terms of 
how the federal government treats Quebec rather interesting.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	He alluded to the fact that there are certain commodity groups 
where there are problems. He mentioned potatoes, hogs and 
cattle. There are some aspects of agriculture that were not 
discussed or mentioned in his speech, one of which was supply 
management.
<P>
	Can he tell Canadians and those of us in the House today how 
the percentages of the total amount of production of poultry and 
eggs and supply management in the milk industry have been 
affected and how his province has been affected.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Landry:</B> I will gladly answer this question, Mr. Speaker. 
You know, when I quoted figures in my speech earlier, it was to 
impress upon this House and this government that, regarding 
supply, Quebec has often been cast aside.
<P>
	We were talking about supply and demand. As a result of the 
GATT agreements, the agricultural sector will suffer many 
losses, not only in Quebec, but across Canada.
<P>
	I would also like to say that it makes me sad when I see, as I 
did recently-and I want to come back to this because this is the 
starting point, the signing of the GATT-farmers' associations 
were formed to oppose it. While some aspects were beneficial, 
protection had to be sought against other aspects. It is like when 
you make a deal; there is no point giving and giving, you have to 
keep something for yourself.
<P>
	That is the point I was trying to make in my speech. We have 
been giving too much and for no reason. We are worth a lot in 
Canada and in Quebec.
<P>
	As far as quotas on milk are concerned, I can tell you that 
farmers have been asking what will replace them. One of them 
told me: ``Look, I will loose everything within a few years 
because my quota which was worth so much will not be worth 
anything any more because of free trade, of the GATT''. Canada 
should have negotiated protective clauses.
<P>
	I would have to do the same thing if I owned a business and 
dealt with other countries or had employees. In any case, we 
have to protect ourselves and our interests. In so doing, we are 
protecting all Canadians and Quebecers.
<P>
	But rest assured this is not over yet and I think it will do more 
harm than good. We are told to think in terms of globalization, 
but as I said in my remarks earlier, we must also be competitive. 
Let us not forget that unless we are able to compete on the global 
market, we will do very poorly.
<P>
	I believe that Providence and common sense are both required 
in this matter, even if it is politics or agriculture. I also believe 
that we must always strive to obtain as much as possible and the 
best deal possible for Canada and Quebec. That is why I chose 
that angle in my remarks, saying: ``Look, Quebec has 
traditionally received less for grain transportation like all the 
rest''. I could have gone on for 20 minutes. Let me tell you that 
as a Quebecer and a member responsible for representing the 
people of Quebec and Canada, I will do my very best to get as 
much as possible for them and protect our interests, instead of 
giving it all to the Americans or other foreign countries.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question for the member which I ask on behalf of Quebec dairy 
farmers.
<P>
	Quebec has a surprisingly large percentage of the dairy quota 
within the supply managed system. Quebec depends on markets 
beyond the borders of the province in this arrangement. If the 
Bloc gets its way and Quebec does separate then certainly 
Quebec dairy farmers will lose that production which is 
presently being sold in the rest of Canada.
<P>
	What is the member going to tell Quebec dairy farmers about 
the prospect of virtually overnight losing this market outside 
Quebec?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Landry:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to answer his 
question because I have the impression that on learning of a 
sovereign Quebec, farmers or, to go even further, cows will give 
less milk on account of being afraid. That is not the case. I would 
like to set the record straight. You can rest assured that whether 
it is Quebec or the other provinces, it has never been said that for  
years there have been tariff barriers between Quebec and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4147"> 4147 </A></B>
<P>
Ontario or between other Canadian provinces. No such thing has 
never been said to the Canadian people, but today it has to be 
said. We had not even become sovereign, and yet there were 
tariff barriers between Canada's provinces. Did that make 
sense?
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Do not worry, the agricultural sector will not be any worse off 
in a sovereign Quebec. There will be agreements, but we will not 
be dealing with barriers. In the agriculture committee, we were 
told that if cows ever gave less milk, there is a new hormone, on 
which a one-year moratorium has been imposed. We said no to 
protect human and animal health. Wait a minute! Technology is 
so advanced, and we are being pressured by multinational 
pharmaceutical companies. You can rest assured that at that time 
there will not be a problem with supply and demand or the lack 
of milk.
<P>
	I can tell you that, as far as milk is concerned, whether it is 
Canadian or Quebec milk, it will always be easier to sell without 
BST, unlike what comes from the U.S.A. You can tell me in a 
year from now, when the current moratorium is lifted.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
last two speakers were on a particular theme so I thought I would 
continue to run with it for a minute.
<P>
	In my riding, which is probably one of the highest density 
supply managed ridings west of Ontario where there is actually 
more of Canada, there is a real concern. In B.C. we have what is 
called Fraser Valley butter in a Fraser Valley butter wrapper, but 
it is not produced in the Fraser Valley. It is produced in Quebec, 
shipped to British Columbia, and then wrapped in what they call 
a Fraser Valley butter wrapper.
<P>
	To follow up on the earlier comments of the hon. member, 
what are you going to tell the Quebec dairy industry? If the hon. 
member believes that there is a readiness, a willingness or an 
eagerness to have the milk and cheese and butter produced in 
Quebec when we could very easily do it by increasing our 
production of industrial milk in B.C., there is some kind of sad 
mistakenness here.
<P>
	What are you going to tell the dairy farmers in Quebec? The 
market is going to be cut virtually in half.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Landry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know if my colleague is 
referring to production or overproduction. At one point, there 
were quota problems in the dairy industry and I remember quite 
vividly farmers dumping milk in creeks. I believe the dairy 
industry in Quebec is trouble free at this time.
<P>
	I am not looking for problems where there are none. I like to 
deal with problems as they arise and find solutions to them. I 
have always maintained that there are no problems, only 
solutions. You can rest assured that when Quebec and Canadian 
farmers encounter a problem, they will confront it head on and 
seek out a solution together. They will not turn a blind eye to it. 
Have no fear, they will be open, honest and to the point. Our 
farmers are capable of adjusting very quickly.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I was thinking 
about participating in this debate today, I could not help but 
reflect on its timeliness.
<P>
	In my riding of Brant as in many ridings across this country 
we are now seeing our agricultural community out in full force. 
They are out and visible because now is the planting season for 
1994.
<P>
	In my little village of St. George the tractors are on the 
highways pulling discs, cultivators, drills and sprayers. If you 
look closely you can see that the tractors are in the fields 24 
hours a day. Local mechanics, tire repair operators and carriers 
of fuel are working at the beck and call of our farm community, 
all because our farmers are working. They are working hard 
against time and against the elements to get our crops planted 
for this year.
<P>
	The opportunity to debate the issues facing Canadian farmers 
today is very timely and important. The debate is not only 
important for farmers, producers and retailers of food. It is 
important for each and every one of us as a Canadian.
<P>
	What we are talking about is our national food supply. When 
we think about our national food supply there is one issue that 
we cannot ignore. That is the issue of security; security of 
supply, security of health and safety and the financial security 
that our farmers who grow and produce the food for this country 
and hopefully for more and more of the world require.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	Let us think about security of supply. Canada has a very, very 
good record in that area. Over the last 40 years we have been part 
of the green revolution and have helped to identify, develop and 
now use seeds, herbicides, pesticides, fungicides and fertilizers 
that have helped us increase our yield exponentially.
<P>
	As we move into the next century we are also moving out of 
the green revolution and into the genetic revolution. I expect 
very much so that we are going to have considerable debate in 
this House as we move into that biotechnological revolution.
<P>
	I believe that we will in the end make good and clear decisions 
and that we as a country will continue to be able to provide and 
supply food, not only for ourselves but for the rest of the world.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4148"> 4148 </A></B>
<P>
	When we think of security of health and safety, we have an 
excellent track record in Canada. We have come to expect that 
the quality of our food will be the best in the world. Our 
ministries of agriculture and health have insisted on it and we as 
Canadians may have even come to take it for granted.
<P>
	It is very possible that as we make transitions in the world of 
agriculture and agri-food we are going to see more and more 
products from around the world. I think we will then find very 
clearly that Canadian produce has been the best quality bar none 
at a good and affordable cost. I believe that Canadians will 
continue to insist upon the availability of Canadian food 
products.
<P>
	We can also think about security from the point of view of 
financial security for our farmers. When I think about that I am 
optimistic. I continue to be optimistic. I read in the current farm 
media that there is an understanding or a belief that in Canadian 
agriculture we have a sleeping giant that is now just awakening. 
It gives me pause to feel optimistic.
<P>
	As I have said we have a good, solid supply of bulk 
commodities. It is a quality supply of bulk commodities. I 
believe that as we work with our farmers, and I too am a farmer, 
to become better entrepreneurs, to be better marketers, to be 
more innovative and creative in our product slate and our crop 
slate and our market sources we will ensure our financial 
security as an industry.
<P>
	I believe quite fully that the agricultural and agri-food sector 
of our economy will be a driving force to ensure a strong 
economy for this country. I believe that the government has a 
role and responsibility to help our farmers move in that direction 
so that we can ensure our own financial security.
<P>
	There are a number of things that this government has already 
done in that regard. First, as many of my colleagues have 
identified, we have signed the GATT agreement. In that 
agreement we identified what subsidies are all about and how 
subsidies can truly interfere with the marketplace, particularly 
in agriculture.
<P>
	We have a world trade organization that will help us 
adjudicate the times when we believe that subsidies are playing 
an unfair role in the world market. Our government has gone a 
long way and will continue to work to make sure that the General 
Agreement on Trade and Tariffs works effectively for us.
<P>
	As well our government is working hard at looking at 
interprovincial trade barriers that are stopping us from having 
effective trade here at home. I have been very pleased to see the 
work of the Ministers of Industry and Agriculture in terms of 
getting their provincial counterparts to work together to break 
down these interprovincial barriers.  As we become more 
successful in our market development at home so will we 
become more successful in the broader marketplace.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	A third area I must highlight is the general focus that this 
government takes in ensuring that as a government we reduce 
red tape, we reduce government intervention that gets in the way 
of our agri-food business as well as all business. We want to 
make it so that government is there supporting small business 
and, in particular, given this debate, the agri-business, so that 
we can continue to develop effective markets and be able to sell 
our commodities not only here at home but to the broader world.
<P>
	As we try and work to help our farmers and our farm 
communities become more entrepreneurial we also have to 
accept the responsibility and the understanding that we have to 
make life predictable, or as predictable as we possibly can, for 
this sector of the economy. Fighting, as I mentioned earlier, 
against the natural elements of floods, disease, drought, we have 
to make sure that we have some kind of safety net that is there in 
support of our farm community.
<P>
	As well as talking about the development of new markets we 
have to recognize that the marketplace is a very unpredictable 
place. As we encourage our farmers and our farm communities 
to step out, to think about new crops, to find new market niches 
and to be more aggressive in our activities around the world, we 
have to provide a safety net that will allow them the confidence 
to do that.
<P>
	I would like to recall the work of Alvin Hamilton under the 
Diefenbaker government, of all governments. Back in the 1960s 
when we made our first grain sales to China, that was a 
watershed that really solidified the western grain marketplace. 
It is this kind of activity that we have to build on and improve 
and step out and grow with. I think our government plays a 
significant role in helping our agricultural and agri-food 
industry to do just that.
<P>
	We are talking about social safety nets here. I believe, as on 
many occasions we have already done, our government is 
looking forward to introducing and making more aware and 
making more usable the whole farm approach to safety nets.
<P>
	I was pleased to hear the hon. member for Prince 
George-Peace River reference the NISA, net income 
stabilization account, approach to security and safety nets. That 
program is a new program, a bright light in our safety net 
situation, to quote him.
<P>
	I would also like to identify that the Ontario Federation of 
Agriculture, the federation to which I belong, is working hard in 
support of the notion of whole farm safety nets: ``The OFA is 
committed to the concept of a whole farm approach to safety 
nets and will continue to work with commodity groups and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4149"> 4149 </A></B>
<P>
government to evolve a meaningful and equitable set of safety 
nets that are available to all producers''.
<P>
	I support that approach. It is the approach of the Liberal 
government. I have talked to producers in my own riding, some 
of whom are covered by programs like NISA and feel very 
positively about that program, others who are not but are 
interested in being covered. I feel that this notion of whole farm 
support is the right one. It encourages our farmers to develop 
their farms in a complete way and not to carry on growing crops 
that may not be the best for their properties because those are the 
crops that receive subsidy. It is the right approach and the 
approach that becomes even more important is the one of 
making sure that we consult with producers and with growers as 
we develop this whole safety net transition.
<P>
	That is what my growers are saying to me. They say: ``We 
need the social safety net. The whole farm approach has 
appealed to us but please, please do it in concert with the 
producer''.
<P>
	This government will, I believe, make that its hallmark. 
Whether it be in the ministries of finance, immigration or 
agriculture, what we are seeing is that our government is one 
that consults with those who are particularly concerned.
<P>
	In terms of our security and financial security for farmers, I 
feel very optimistic in that regard.
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
	This government is here to support our farming communities. 
I believe we have a very bright future as Canadian 
agriculturalists and that agriculture will play a significant role 
as we continue to develop our new and global economy.
<P>
	I feel glad to have been able to participate in this debate and I 
also want to thank the minister for providing this opportunity for 
me and for all my colleagues in the House to talk about this very 
important issue to the Canadian people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
congratulate the hon. member for her comments and her speech.
<P>
	I would like to ask if she believes farmers should be exempt or 
non-exempt on the Liberal GST replacement tax on machinery 
and equipment that is pending.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Stewart (Brant):</B> I appreciate that question, Mr. 
Speaker. As you may know, the hon. member and I both sit on 
the GST review committee.
<P>
	We have heard some very appropriate and clear submissions 
from the Canadian Federation of Agriculture. As a farmer I do 
believe that farmers should continue to be exempt and that we 
have to work very closely to find new solutions to improve the 
cashflow situation that farmers face as they pay their GST up 
front and then have to wait for those rebates to come back.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question for the hon. member.
<P>
	It may have been a slip of the tongue, I am not sure, but she 
referred to the farm stabilization programs as being social safety 
nets. I just want to clarify whether that was in fact a slip of the 
tongue or does she see farm stabilization programs as a type of 
social safety net.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Stewart (Brant):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the member 
drawing that to my attention.
<P>
	It was a slip of the tongue. I feel that these are very much 
programs that are there to help our industry, the agricultural 
industry, propel itself into the future. I look forward to having 
that safety net so that we can actively pursue new and broader 
markets.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Dauphin-Swan River):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as a grain farmer representing the rural constituency of 
Dauphin-Swan River in western Canada I firmly believe that 
we need a long term vision for the grain industry.
<P>
	The current difficulty in moving grain is just one of a number 
of issues affecting Canada's grain and oilseed industry. The 
short term immediate problem must be addressed to ensure that 
it is not repeated next year.
<P>
	However, it is also time to take a look at the grain marketing 
system as a whole. We must be prepared to ask ourselves if our 
industry is positioned properly to build on the opportunities that 
are out there.
<P>
	The new trade deals offer new market opportunities and the 
Canadian grain industry must examine how it can best take 
advantage of these opportunities. New trade agreements, 
notably the North American free trade agreement and the GATT 
deal, mean obligations that the Canadian government must 
meet.
<P>
	For example, the GATT requires that we make changes to the 
WGTA for shipments to the west coast and to Churchill. The 
Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food has asked 
representatives of the grain marketing system to a meeting in 
Winnipeg on May 16.
<P>
	Why should the industry and government work together to 
develop a vision for the future? First, the marketplace is 
changing, trade patterns are shifting, traditional markets for 
Canadian grain are disappearing, Asian countries and the 
Americas are now the focus of Canada's grain marketing efforts. 
These changes in trade patterns mean different demands on 
Canada's grain handling and transportation system.
<P>
	There are also production driven demands as farmers turn to 
higher income, alternative special crops. We are selling to fewer 
larger institutional buyers and more to individual buyers such as 
millers who require just in time delivery. This changes, for 
example, the time and resources required to ship our grain.
<P>
<B>(1640 ) </B>
<P>
	As we look toward a vision for a grain policy framework, 
clearly decisions we make today on a number of grain issues 
need to be based on a long term vision for the grain industry. 
Today I would like to outline the policy framework we intend to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4150"> 4150 </A></B>
<P>
use as a basis for working  with industry to shape a vision for 
where we want the grain marketing system to be in five to ten 
years.
<P>
	The first area is transportation. My hon. colleague will or has 
already outlined the steps we are taking within the industry to 
resolve the serious short term system capacity problems 
plaguing the industry.
<P>
	Other transportation issues include the St. Lawrence seaway, 
the WGTA issues, rail system efficiencies and the NTA rate 
setting. On the St. Lawrence seaway, the Standing Committee on 
Transport has established a subcommittee to review the seaway 
system. This government is grateful to have this report.
<P>
	On WGTA, by June the minister will have reports from the 
producer payment panel on methods of paying the benefit and 
from the Grain Transportation Agency on efficiencies. A study 
was also undertaken of the NTA rate scale.
<P>
	The hon. Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food plans to 
announce a process for reviewing the recommendations on all of 
these issues so that the government is in a position to make 
decisions by the 1995 crop year.
<P>
	The industry is very concerned about a number of grain 
marketing issues, but the issue is very divisive. The Canadian 
Wheat Board for its part already has made important studies 
toward positioning itself to meet new global marketplace 
demands. For example, it has made changes to improve its price 
information for producers and the industry. It has made changes 
to the quota system so there is better information on the amount 
and quality of grain in the country elevators.
<P>
	In the trade area we are faced with a combination of 
tremendous trade opportunities in the U.S. mixed with increased 
protectionist pressures. Canada continues to work toward a 
negotiated settlement. That is good for Canadian agriculture.
<P>
	Our objective is to achieve a settlement before the 90-day 
consultation period which is up in July. If agreement is not 
possible and the U.S. acts to restrict imports of our wheat we 
have the right to retaliate, and we will. Canada will not roll over 
and play dead.
<P>
	In the regulatory area, the Canadian Wheat Board and grain 
commission have made numerous changes in their operations 
which are contributing to greater industry competitiveness. For 
example, the Canadian Grain Commission has examined ways 
of handling grain that are not visually distinguishable.
<P>
	Visual distinguishability remains an integral part of our 
grading system. Our commitment to a grading system which 
ensures quality and consistency remains unquestioned. We are 
also considering options as to how the grain commission 
regulates terminal elevator tariffs. The goal is more flexibility 
for grain companies and, in turn, a more flexible grain handling 
system overall.
<P>
	There is an industry based committee in place now to continue 
monitoring the implementation of regulatory review 
recommendations over the course of this year.
<P>
	Another factor in the whole grain policy area is the safety net 
programming. In order for the industry to change in the face of a 
changing global marketplace it must be supported by a strong 
safety net program. Currently a committee representing farm 
groups and federal and provincial governments is reviewing the 
Canadian farm safety nets.
<P>
	Its consensus is to make a whole farm safety net program 
available to all commodities. They also agree that some type of 
additional support or supplementary programs may be needed to 
deal with specific regional or commodity problems as they 
arise.
<P>
	Federal and provincial ministers of agriculture expect to 
receive the committee's report in July. The goal of this 
government is a safety net program that is GATT consistent, 
market neutral, financially sound, affordable, effective and 
understandable. Our policy framework involves decisions on 
WGTA before the 1995 crop year, continued implementation of 
the regulatory review over the next year, overseen by the 
industry based advisory committee, a negotiated settlement in 
our trade dispute with the U.S. before the section 28 deadline in 
July but only if the settlement is a good deal for Canada, and 
finally whole farm safety nets for the 1995-96 year with 
companion programs if necessary. The committee of producer 
representatives and federal and provincial governments will 
work together toward this goal.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	These are the means we have established to achieve our goals 
and the timeframes we have set. On this basis the minister has 
asked representatives of the grain companies, railways, grain 
handling labour unions and government agencies to a meeting in 
Winnipeg on May 16.
<P>
	We must move immediately to re-establish Canada's 
reputation as a reliable supplier of export grains and oilseeds. It 
is critical that the people who own and run the system come 
together now to set their collective sights on the next five or ten 
years.
<P>
	Before we make decisions today we must ask ourselves what 
kind of a grain marketing system is needed for a competitive 
tomorrow.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to join with other members in this debate on the 
challenges facing Canadian agriculture and some of the 
alternative approaches to resolving those challenges.
<P>
	In doing so I want to begin like other members by 
acknowledging and stressing the importance of the agricultural 
sector to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4151"> 4151 </A></B>
<P>
Canada's future. Agriculture is important because we all have to 
eat, because of its contributions to GNP and the balance of 
payments and  because, as others have pointed out, it is the 
economic underpinnings of most of rural Canada.
<P>
	However, there is another reason why agriculture is 
important. It is because it is a primary resource industry in full 
transition, a transition which if successfully accomplished, has 
lessons to teach every other primary resource sector.
<P>
	In other words I believe there is an old agriculture based on 
old trading patterns, old financing methods, old marketing 
techniques, old relationships with governments that are passing 
away. There is a new agriculture that is more knowledge based, 
more market oriented and more internationally competitive that 
is struggling to be born.
<P>
	This challenge of transition faces all our primary industries: 
forestry, mining, energy and the fisheries. However, if we can 
pioneer and find adjustment strategies to guide the transition of 
agriculture from the old to the new, I am convinced that many of 
these solutions will have application to other primary sectors as 
well.
<P>
	I want to suggest therefore that the acid test of the 
government's agricultural policy and the acid test of the 
agricultural platforms of the Bloc and ourselves should be how 
well do these facilitate the transition of the old agriculture to the 
new. Do these policies and platforms provide adequate bridges 
whereby farmers and agri-business people can pass over from 
the old agriculture to the new? This is the standard by which we 
ought to judge both government policy and opposition 
alternatives.
<P>
	I should add that this need for transition policy or bridge 
policy in agriculture has been repeatedly drawn to my attention, 
not just by theorists but by farmers themselves.
<P>
	In the spring of 1993 prior to the federal election I received a 
letter from a Saskatchewan farmer in which he wrote these 
words:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We feel like we are on an economic island, isolated from the economic 
mainland and opportunities to make a decent living, isolated by trade wars at 
depressed prices, marketing systems we can't control, inefficient transportation 
systems, safety nets that don't work well and ever-increasing taxes and input 
costs. What we desperately need are bridges over troubled waters, bridges that 
lead to a better economic future.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What then are some of the key questions that will allow us to 
test whether government policy will truly assist farmers to 
participate in the agricultural economy of the future? Let me 
discuss three of them.
<P>
	First, does the government's policy provide any prospect of 
tax relief for farmers or at least a reduction in the tax component 
of input costs?
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	Measured by this standard the government is not getting off 
on the right track. Its general budgetary policy is to spend $40 
billion more this year than it takes in or $110 million more a day 
than it collects in tax revenues. Farmers know that these levels 
of expenditure mean that taxation levels are likely to rise, that 
the tax component of input costs will rise, and that the cost of 
money as measured by the interest rate is also likely to rise.
<P>
	To date I have not heard from the minister or from government 
members. I have not heard them in the forefront of demanding 
deeper spending reductions that would lead to tax reductions for 
their agricultural constituents.
<P>
	We have even heard from some Bloc members in this debate 
who seem to think that the answer to the problems of the 
agriculture industry, and presumably other industries, is still to 
spend yet more government money on additional or enhanced 
programs.
<P>
	Spending more taxpayers' money is not the answer to any 
industry's problem. In contrast, Reformers continue to call for 
reduced federal expenditures.
<P>
	It is our conviction that the single greatest thing that the 
federal government can do to stimulate agricultural recovery in 
the context of freer trade is to simply get the cost of government 
down to the point where this is reflected in lower taxation levels, 
a lower cost of living and a lower cost of doing business for 
Canadian farmers.
<P>
	We even believe that the agriculture sector could be 
persuaded to take less by way of program expenditures if it 
could be assured that every other industrial sector would do the 
same thing to the point where there is an absolute reduction in 
the cost of doing business for all of us.
<P>
	A second question for testing the relevance of agricultural 
policy is does that policy reduce or maintain the dependence of 
the agricultural sector on government.
<P>
	During the years when government involvement in 
agriculture was considered to be the solution to every problem, 
we witnessed enormous growth in provincial programs and 
regulations, federal programs and regulations, and the overlap 
between the two. To date we see very little in government 
initiatives to reduce the dependence of agriculture on those 
programs in concrete terms.
<P>
	For example I have not heard, but perhaps I missed it, the 
minister call for a clear definition of the responsibilities of the 
private agricultural sector, the provincial departments and the 
federal departments so as to eliminate excessive overlap and 
regulation.
<P>
	Moreover it appears from the current budget and the estimates 
of the agriculture department that it intends to keep in place the 
dozen or so income support programs maintained or instituted 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4152"> 4152 </A></B>
<P>
by previous governments including crop insurance, revenue 
insurance, net income assistance, loan guarantees, livestock 
feed development  initiatives, assistance to agri-food 
producers, cash flow enhancement programs, western grain 
transportation subsidies, the dairy commission subsidy and so 
on.
<P>
	Reformers on the other hand call for a phased clear-cut 
reduction in the dependence of the agricultural sector on both 
levels of government.
<P>
	We believe it is the private agricultural sector which should 
have the right and responsibility to make the vast majority of 
agricultural production, transportation and marketing decisions. 
We believe the primary role of the provinces is in the 
maintenance and development of the human and physical 
resource base of the industry, education and training for the 
farmer of the future and preservation of the soil.
<P>
	We believe that the primary responsibility of the federal 
government lies in the maintenance of health and product safety 
standards for agriculture, the negotiation of international trade 
agreements, the enforcement of import and anti-combines 
regulations, and the operation of national income maintenance 
programs as long as these are necessary.
<P>
	In order to further reduce agricultural dependence on 
government and excessive regulations, Reformers advocate the 
consolidation of the current plethora of income support 
programs into three. These have been mentioned by my 
colleagues.
<P>
	They include, first, an expanded crop insurance program to 
protect agricultural producers from natural hazards. Second is a 
trade distortion adjustment program to shield at least partially 
agricultural producers from foreign subsidy injury. A third 
question for testing the soundness of agricultural policy is does 
government policy respect and enhance the farmer's freedom of 
choice, the right of the farmer himself or herself to make those 
production, transportation and marketing decisions upon which 
the success or failure of the farm unit depends?
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	On this question of freedom of choice, we see a hesitancy on 
the part of the government. It is the same hesitancy evidenced by 
the government when it is asked to experiment with more direct 
methods of democratic decision making in other areas, like 
using referendums to establish the legitimacy of aboriginal 
self-government in Manitoba, to give Canadians a say on 
criminal justice issues like capital punishment or to democratize 
the Senate.
<P>
	Reformers advocate greater democratization of economic 
decision-making in agriculture. We believe the present 
government appointment system for the Canadian Wheat Board 
should be replaced by a board of directors elected by producers 
through a fair and democratic process.
<P>
	In order for grain producers to benefit from every available 
market opportunity we believe that producers should be given 
the opportunity to democratically examine their organizational 
and jurisdictional options. This would include introducing 
greater domestic and international market competition; 
permitting the wheat board to trade in grains and oilseeds; 
allowing the purchase of wheat and other grains on either a cash 
basis or a pooled initial final price basis and implementing 
special opting out provisions for entrepreneurs interested in 
developing better export markets.
<P>
	The net effect of all these reforms is to increase the freedom 
of choice for the Canadian farmer with respect to production, 
transportation and marketing decisions affecting their own 
future.
<P>
	I want to conclude by raising one further question which is on 
the minds of almost every farm family in Canada when they 
think of the future and any government policy that is intended to 
help them prepare for that future. That is the question whether 
government policies or alternatives offered by the opposition 
provide any genuine basis for hope for a better economic future 
for Canadian farmers and their children.
<P>
	I personally believe that there are reasons for hope for the 
Canadian farmer, that bridges can be built between the faltering 
agricultural economy of the past and the new agricultural 
economy of the 21st century, over which the majority of our 
farm people can pass.
<P>
	There will always be a growing market for food even though it 
may be badly distorted and obscured by everything from 
government trade wars to private monopolies. What we must do 
is figure out how to access our fair share of that changing 
market, which is what building the bridges of marketing, safety 
net and transportation system reform is all about.
<P>
	The world is slowly lurching toward more liberal trade 
including freer trade in agricultural products. The signing of 
CUSTA, NAFTA and the GATT agreements are good and 
hopeful signs. What we need to do is hold our trading partners to 
the spirit and the letter of these agreements and not let them or 
ourselves slip back into the old world of protectionism.
<P>
	We also need to build bridges which will enable our producers 
to survive the transition from a heavily subsidized agricultural 
sector to a less subsidized one, which is what our safety net 
reforms and particularly our trade distortion adjustment 
program is all about.
<P>
	In addition, tax relief and a lowering of the cost of doing 
business must be offered as the light at the end of the tunnel, to 
persuade all our resource and industrial sectors to become less 
dependent on government. It is up to this Parliament to build the 
bridges from unbalanced budgets and excessive taxation to 
balanced budgets and lower taxation, which is what the Reform 
Party's federal spending reforms are all about.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4153"> 4153 </A></B>
<P>
	It is up to this generation of Canadian voters and farmers to 
build these bridges, not just for ourselves but so that the next 
generation, the children of farmers, may enter and prosper in the 
new agricultural economy.
<P>
	I conclude with this. In the 1920s and 1930s, in the heyday of 
agricultural reform in this country led by the old progressive 
party there was a poem on bridge building that was frequently 
read at farm meetings across the country and was often quoted in 
the House during the great agricultural debates of that year. It is 
a simple poem which eloquently expresses the ultimate reason 
for building bridges from the past to the future in any field of 
human endeavour, including agriculture. It provides the 
ultimate reason for advocating and supporting real agricultural 
reform regardless of our politics. I will close by reading it. It 
says:

<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
intent because being on the agriculture committee I have been 
amazed at the contradictions within the Reform Party 
agricultural policy. As I listened to the leader of the Reform 
Party I am still struck that it is cut, cut, cut, regardless of the 
consequences.
<P>
	What does phased clear-cut reduction mean? Can he be more 
specific than that? Where does the Reform Party really stand 
with regard to the Canadian Wheat Board and supply 
management?
<P>
	You talk about opening up the board to allow basically off 
board grain to be sold and grain to sold through the pooling 
system as well. Do you not realize that that works in-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I would like to 
remind the hon. member to put his question through the Speaker 
please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Easter:</B> Mr. Speaker, so noted.
<P>
	I want to point out that maybe there is something that the 
Reform members have not learned, and it is that when you set up 
that kind of system the lowest seller sets the price. The last thing 
we want to see is Canadians competing against each other in 
international markets.  The Canadian Wheat Board, and as we 
have seen with the barley experiment, has shown that it is a good 
seller, that it achieves success in terms of selling and maximizes 
that return back to producers.
<P>
	Just where does the Reform Party stand relative to the 
Canadian Wheat Board and to the supply management system?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> I want to thank the hon. member for his 
question.
<P>
	I thought I had made myself fairly clear with respect to the 
Canadian Wheat Board. What we are saying is democratize the 
way the Wheat Board is organized and makes decisions. We 
consider that more important than particular questions about 
what decisions the Wheat Board makes. We are prepared to live 
with the decisions that are made if you democratize the board.
<P>
	With respect to the member's comments that he sees 
something contradictory in what the Reform Party is 
advocating, I do want to say that what we are talking about is the 
trend or shift in direction. We are not talking about going from a 
very heavy dependency on government and subsidies all the way 
to no government, no subsidies, overnight. We are talking about 
a shift in direction. We argue that it is not a contradiction. It is 
clear the direction in which we would like to shift things. We can 
argue about the scope.
<P>
	I would suggest that if he thinks that is somehow a 
contradiction, what we wonder about is the contradiction where 
before the election we had Liberals fighting free trade and 
fighting any change in the supply management system at all, and 
then six months after advocating a completely different 
position. If we are guilty of contradictions, we suggest there are 
others who are even more guilty.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a couple of questions for the 
leader of the Reform Party.
<P>
	I was interested in his comments in so far as they related to 
grain transportation and the impact of market forces on grain 
transportation.
<P>
	The hon. member will know that before the 1980s the railway 
companies could quite legitimately complain that the regime 
existing at that time did not compensate them for the movement 
of grain. Accordingly government moved in to pick up the slack 
and did so by buying hopper cars, rebuilding prairie branch lines 
and a whole range of other things. With the WGTA coming into 
effect in the early 1980s it effectively provided for a full 
compensatory position in terms of the railways.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	Now that we have passed through the end of the eighties and 
into the nineties, despite the fact that under the WGTA the 
railways have been fully compensated and they do not have their 
old complaints about shortfalls, we have seen very little, if any, 
investment in hopper cars, very little, if any, investment in 
infrastructure like  prairie roadbeds and so forth. This year we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4154"> 4154 </A></B>
<P>
have a horrendous problem with the levels of service that have 
been provided.
<P>
	In terms of the philosophical position that the leader of the 
Reform Party takes, I wonder how he sees in future market 
forces being a sufficient discipline on the grain transportation 
system to ensure that those agents that operate in the system, 
even though they are being fully paid for their services, are not 
in fact providing the services in some cases for which they are 
being paid.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question.
<P>
	I think that whenever you see a demand for a service as he 
suggests exists in the grain transportation field not being 
adequately provided, what that is telling you is that you do not 
really have a proper market operating; that there is still either 
too much regulation, or monopoly framework or 
semi-monopoly framework because supply is not responding to 
demand.
<P>
	I suggest that what that means is you have to go to further 
deregulation and that freight rates ultimately should be set by 
market forces. This is what we advocate.
<P>
	The minister will also notice that in our safety net reforms we 
argue taking away the funds that are currently used to subsidize 
the railways under the Western Grain Transportation Act, and 
channelling them into one of these three income support 
programs, in particular the expanded NISA.
<P>
	We think that provides a measure of protection to the producer 
over the changes which market transportation rates would 
provide. It is also a mechanism of helping the producer that 
would be GATT green. That is our view on how you employ 
more market forces to solve the transportation problem and still 
provide a measure of transitory protection to the producer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
also was extremely impressed by the speech of the leader of the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	I sat on the subcommittee on transport and agriculture and 
was amazed at the problems of grain transportation in the west. 
In fact the problems are critical for grain for the western 
economy.
<P>
	I was curious to ask the Reform Party leader what suggestions 
he might have in regard to improving the system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> I guess I would just reiterate the remarks I 
made to the minister.
<P>
	Our view is that further deregulation and greater reliance on 
market forces is ultimately the best solution to the 
transportation problems of agriculture in the west. Many of the 
reforms that we advocate would move us in that direction, 
although not all at once.
<P>
	The other thing I would like to comment on, because I have 
listened to the speeches made by the Bloc members, is this 
comparison between government subsidization of agriculture in 
the west and government subsidization of agriculture in Quebec, 
the implication being that Quebec is not getting its fair share.
<P>
	I really do suggest that what the Bloc members have been 
doing is comparing apples and oranges, or to use an agricultural 
analogy, Herefords and Holsteins. In the west, our agriculture is 
essentially serving and competing in an international market, 
particularly the international grain market where it is subject to 
all these tariff or subsidy wars and it is being subsidized by the 
taxpayer.
<P>
	Quebec to a much greater extent is competing more in a 
domestic market and the subsidization is being provided by the 
consumer. I suggest if you add up subsidies, not just subsidies 
from government but subsidies in general, you will find that the 
subsidization levels in Quebec and the subsidization levels in 
the west are a lot closer than the Bloc member suggests.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is indeed my pleasure today to 
join in this important debate on agriculture and the agri-food-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. We still have a 
little time left for questions and comments. I thought the 
member was seeking the floor for questions or comments.
<P>
	Before I resume debate, were there any other questions or 
comments?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Easter:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a comment. The leader of the 
Reform Party read a poem that talked about our understanding 
where the shift is leading us.
<P>
	Members should understand where this shift is leading us, 
what this absolute sacrifice of power to the marketplace really 
means and how it affects us. I will read a two-line quote: ``One 
of the key characteristics of a market society is that it isolates us 
as individuals. From a market point of view, there is no such 
thing as society. There are only individuals and markets. 
Families are only units of consumption based on economies of 
scale. Communities are only places where individuals come 
together to engage in economic activity''.
<P>
	That is not the kind of community and society I want to live in. 
I would suggest that the Reform Party policy that is looking at 
shifting in that direction is not the society we want to be a part 
of.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member did not give the 
source of that quotation but it sounded like Karl Marx. I would 
argue that that philosophy is in disrepute the world over.
<P>
	The other thing I point out to the member is that it has been 
under the heavy government involvement, government 
subsidization pattern that we have had for the last 30 or 40 years 
that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4155"> 4155 </A></B>
<P>
has seen the destruction of  rural community after rural 
community all across Canada, and particularly in the west.
<P>
	Whatever we were doing before, I argue that it is the last thing 
we should continue to do if our number one priority is the 
preservation of the rural community. The reforms that we are 
advocating are a step toward a revitalization of rural Canada on 
the basis of market principle.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Easter:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of information, I should 
have attributed the source. The source is Christopher Lynn, a 
minister in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> That concludes the time 
for questions and comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
you can tell I am anxious to speak in this debate, however I am 
glad I did not prevent the interesting exchange we just heard 
between my colleague and the leader of the Reform Party.
<P>
	First let me congratulate the minister in opening this 
important topic to a full debate of all parties in the House. My 
riding of London-Middlesex is 20 per cent agricultural and 
that 20 per cent encompasses four townships of some of the best 
farming land in southern Ontario.
<P>
	It is important to me that my constituents have their views 
represented. They well know that the spinoff value of 
agriculture in economic activity is something in the order of 
four to one. This is a fact that is not appreciated enough by urban 
Canadians, just how important agriculture and the agri-food 
industry is to the country.
<P>
	Our party in the red book spoke about making food and the 
production of food a matter of national security. That is a 
commitment that our government and our minister fully intend 
to live up to. I intend to help make sure that it does take place.
<P>
	As Canadians, we know that we have the safest food in the 
world at a very affordable cost. Many of us who are more urban 
Canadians do not fully appreciate that fact. It is time that we did 
so whatever part of the country we happen to live in.
<P>
	Earlier I heard the speech of the leader of the Reform Party. I 
enjoyed it but I would take issue with one important point 
because it is something that has been brought home to me by my 
constituents. That is the question of article XI of the GATT.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	Our party during the election made the commitment very 
clearly, and I know this because I spoke to it a number of times 
in the campaign, that we would do everything within our power 
as a government if we were elected to ensure that article XI was 
maintained.
<P>
	It just was not there for that to happen. In case there are any 
members opposite who forgot the vote let me remind them that 
when the actual push came to shove and it came time to vote on 
article XI, the vote was 115 against and 1 country for, that 
country being Canada.
<P>
	An elected government can do no more. A member of 
Parliament can do no more. We have heard this repeatedly from 
the members in the Reform Party. You can do no more than stand 
and cast your vote and be counted on what you feel is important. 
I intend to do that on some issues like euthanasia when the free 
vote comes on that. I intend to do it based on my conscience and 
discussions with my constituents, but in my case based on my 
conscience because I believe that is how one ought to cast his 
vote.
<P>
	I am drifting into another important but somewhat off the 
topic at this point.
<P>
	The point I am making is that when you cast your vote as an 
individual member of Parliament or as a government in an 
international forum, that is the ultimate that you can do to back 
up your position. This country stood absolutely alone in trying 
to maintain article XI at GATT so I take some exception with the 
leader of the Reform Party in saying that we were not consistent 
on that. That is not exactly what he said but that is the 
implication I drew from his comments.
<P>
	Agriculture is of national importance to Canada from coast to 
coast to coast. We know that it is. If Canadians are not involved 
in the production of food they are certainly involved in the 
consumption of it. There is no Canadian in this country who can 
look at the agriculture and agri-food sector with indifference. If 
they do then they are displaying an ignorance that I think we 
ought to address.
<P>
	What I would like to do, given the national importance of 
agriculture, is to overview briefly on a regional basis the 
importance of this particular activity. In B.C. the agri-food 
sector is a small but stable component of the provincial 
economy contributing just over 2 per cent of the province's GDP 
in 1992 and almost 6 per cent of Canada's agri-food GDP. With 
its proximity to the Pacific Ocean obviously the sector is firmly 
focused on the Asian marketplace where it is beginning to have 
considerable export success.
<P>
	In order of importance, the major sectors of the British 
Columbia agricultural industry are dairy, poultry, eggs, cattle 
and calves, horticulture, grains and oilseeds.
<P>
	The prairies, which many of us have had the opportunity to 
visit and marvel at the wave after wave undulating prairie with 
the fine grain that we see produced there, is now beginning to 
diversify into new primary and processed products and is 
finding new customers for its exports.
<P>
	In 1992 the prairie provinces contributed more than 30 per 
cent of Canada's agri-food GDP.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4156"> 4156 </A></B>
<P>
	I might digress at this point and make the point that I intend to 
share my time with my colleague, the hon. member for 
Huron-Bruce. I hope, Mr. Speaker, you will remind me when 
my time has run out.
<P>
	In Alberta the agri-food sector is the major renewable 
resource industry in the province contributing nearly 6 per cent 
of the province's GDP in 1992. The southern area of Alberta 
produces the most hot season crops and has the majority of beef 
lots. The central area has cow-calf operations, hogs, dairy, 
grains and oilseeds and the northern Peace River district, which 
I would like to visit, has livestock and grain and is noted for 
forage seed and honey production.
<P>
	In Manitoba the agri-food sector contributed some 6.4 per 
cent of the provincial GDP in 1992. Wheat and barley 
traditionally constitute two-thirds of farm cash receipts in the 
province while other major crops include canola, flax and 
sunflower. As well the soil and climate accommodate the 
production of a variety of special crops such as buckwheat, 
sugar beets and potatoes.
<P>
	Manitoba also as we know has a substantial red meat industry 
which constitutes about 25 per cent of the value of agriculture 
production in the province. It has a dynamic food processing 
sector which in 1991 accounted for almost 27 per cent of the 
value of all manufacturing shipments from Manitoba.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	Some 39,000 people were employed in primary agriculture 
production in 1991, about 8 per cent of the province's total 
workforce, while an additional 21,000 people were employed in 
related industries, hence reinforcing as I said at the beginning of 
my remarks the spinoff value of agriculture and the agri-food 
sector.
<P>
	Turning to my own area of central Canada, Ontario and 
Quebec's agri-food sectors contributed about 55 per cent of 
Canada's agri-food GDP in 1992. The region ships primary and 
processed products to the rest of Canada and the United States 
and has some highly successful processing firms that have 
become multinationals with plants around the world. In 1992 
agri-food production constituted 4 per cent of Ontario's GDP 
and about 4.3 per cent of Quebec's.
<P>
	My home province of Ontario is the top agri-food producing 
province in Canada with more than 588,000 people employed in 
the industry in 1992. Livestock and livestock products 
accounted for 59 per cent of farm cash receipts in the province in 
1991 and crops such as grains, oilseeds, soybeans, dried beans, 
corn and tobacco accounted for some 36 per cent.
<P>
	As well, much of Canada's food processing occurs in the 
province of Ontario. Ontario accounted for 35 per cent of all 
shipments from Canadian food and beverage manufacturing 
industries in 1991.
<P>
	In Quebec the dairy industry is the largest component of 
agricultural production, producing over 38 per cent of Canada's 
milk output in 1991. As well, Quebec accounted for 32 per cent 
of all Canadian pork production that year.
<P>
	Poultry, horticulture and beef are also very important 
components of this sector. The province has more than 1,000 
processing plants which shipped more than $11 billion worth of 
products in 1991.
<P>
	Agriculture and Agri-food Canada employs about 2,600 
full-time employees in the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. No 
part of Canada has a greater variety of agri-food product than 
the province of Ontario. That is very easily reflected in my area 
of southwestern Ontario and in my riding of 
London-Middlesex.
<P>
	My colleague from Huron-Bruce who will speak following 
me can certainly attest to the diversity of agriculture in 
southwestern Ontario.
<P>
	In Atlantic Canada, and there are members in this House much 
more knowledgeable about Atlantic Canada than I, 6 per cent of 
Canadian agri-food GDP in 1992 was produced. The region's 
biggest agri-food market is the United States but there are also 
successes in the Caribbean and in Europe.
<P>
	In New Brunswick the agri-food sector contributed about 4.7 
per cent of the provincial GDP in 1992 with dairy representing 
the most valuable agricultural commodity, followed closely by 
potatoes at $54 million.
<P>
	In Nova Scotia agri-food production contributed about 4 per 
cent to the province's GDP.
<P>
	In Prince Edward Island, where the agricultural sector has 
long been the mainstay of the provincial economy, about 7.8 per 
cent of the provincial GDP was contributed by the agri-food 
sector in 1992, not including food and beverage processing. Can 
there be any eastern Canadian or western Canadian who is not 
familiar with the famous songs of Stompin' Tom Connors 
immortalizing the potatoes from Prince Edward Island.
<P>
	In Newfoundland agri-food production contributed about 2.8 
per cent of the provincial GDP in 1992. Some 83 per cent of farm 
cash receipts came from livestock operations and 17 per cent 
from the production of vegetables and other crops. The majority 
of the province's agri-food production is in the processing 
industry however. Of the 293 agri-food processing businesses in 
the province in 1992 half were engaged in the meat and meat 
products sector. The bread and baking products sector was the 
next largest at 36 per cent followed by poultry and then fruit and 
vegetable processing.
<P>
	Agriculture and agri-food Canada has about 820 employees 
working in Atlantic Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4157"> 4157 </A></B>
<P>
	It is quite clear to me as an urban Canadian from southwestern 
Ontario and increasingly more so as a member of Parliament just 
how vital the agri-food industry is to this country.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
	When seeking nomination and because I come from an urban 
background, I formed an agricultural advisory committee in my 
riding, making sure that the different parts of the riding and 
different sectors of the agri-food industry were represented. 
This obviously led to an increased knowledge of agriculture in 
Canada on my part. But as the old saying goes, the more you 
learn the more you understand you have to learn about anything 
in life. That certainly applies to agriculture.
<P>
	I commend the people who served and continue to serve on 
that committee and who keep me informed as a member of 
Parliament from an urban background about the issues, the 
needs and the concerns of Canadian farmers.
<P>
	It would be a sad day when we could not go into our farmlands 
and see the family farm still in existence. That is a very real 
concern I have come to share with the constituents I represent. 
There is tremendous stress and strain on the family farm. I 
believe this government will do everything possible to make 
sure that a young farmer who wishes to follow in his or her 
parents footsteps and continue to farm will be able to do so.
<P>
	It is a key drive of this government to make sure that those 
Canadians who wish to work are able to work. That must include 
agriculture. It will be a sad day when my cousins, some of whom 
do farm, cannot continue to do that because the family farm has 
become obsolete or simply impossible to manage.
<P>
	I appreciate the opportunity to join in this debate today. It is a 
great privilege to represent farmers in this House of Commons. 
As I said, I will continue to speak on agricultural issues, ask 
questions to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-food and 
make sure that the voices of my constituents are heard.
<P>
	In closing on a related note, I hope that my colleagues in the 
Reform Party will perhaps reflect on this. One of the objections 
in southwestern Ontario to the proposed redistribution, not of 
members of Parliament but of individual ordinary Canadians, 
farmers living in southwestern Ontario, was that the proposed 
redistribution was going to represent a reduction in 
representation in the House of Commons for rural southern 
Ontario. They want to see the maximum possible voice for their 
concerns in the House of Commons. Those farmers in my riding 
who represent 20 per cent of my constituency do not want to see 
my riding become totally urban and their voice therefore 
reduced.
<P>
	I am not sure that is appreciated by all members in various 
parts of the House who are not familiar with rural Ontario. I 
thought it was important to share that.
<P>
	I appreciate the opportunity and I will listen very carefully to 
the rest of the debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the member on his address and the sincerity of his 
remarks.
<P>
	I come back to his references to Article XI and the Liberal 
Party's defence of it. My question is really this. Would the 
member not acknowledge that this is a classic case of 
politicians, and in this case even the government because the 
government took a similar position, sending producers precisely 
the wrong signal at the wrong time?
<P>
	What the market was saying to supply management people 
during the GATT negotiation was that this particular approach to 
protecting supply management was not going to last. The 
consumers would not pay the shot. Consumers were saying that 
in other ways in Canada by going across the border and buying 
supply managed products.
<P>
	Would not the more responsible thing have been to say to 
supply management people: ``Look, this system cannot be 
maintained the way it is now. It is going to have to be changed 
and we are going to have to find some other way to provide you 
with financial security'', which is what we tried to do by making 
supply management people eligible for an expanded NISA.
<P>
	In other words, does the party's and the government's 
experience with the article XI business not illustrate precisely 
that too much politics, too much government sends the wrong 
signals to producers and we would be better to withdraw 
politicians and government from any area where they can send 
those signals to producers and end up misleading them rather 
than leading them in the right direction?
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the leader of the Reform 
Party for his compliments and for his question. Perhaps I 
misunderstood his earlier speech, but I was taking issue with the 
suggestion that there was some sort of an inconsistency with the 
pre-election or the election position of our party on article XI 
and what we actually did once elected. I do not think there was 
any inconsistency whatsoever when we voted and stood alone in 
the world on article XI.
<P>
	However one sees article XI and the efficacy of it, I was 
wanting to reinforce the fact that we were very consistent on 
how we dealt with that important clause of GATT after elected 
and what we had said prior to the election.
<P>
	I will comment briefly on the Reform leader's points which 
almost amounted to depoliticizing the agri-food industry. While 
I applaud that sentiment I am not sure, knowing the farmers I do 
in my riding, I have never met more political people, people 
more attuned to what is going on in the country politically and 
determined to influence the system obviously to their advantage 
as Canadians, as we all seek to use the system to the advantage 
of our families and our country in general. I do not think we are 
going to see a day when governments  are not involved in the 
agri-food decision making process. The process is political by 
nature, as I see it.

	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider the 
advisability of developing regulations and a program to replace dioxin 
producing bleaching processes in pulp and paper mills in Canada and at the 
same time launching immediately a campaign to educate the public about the 
advantages offered by non-bleached paper products.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, the motion has two purposes. One is to 
gently but firmly remind the government with respect to pulp 
and paper companies and the activities of the pulp and paper 
industry that there is a pollution problem which needs to be 
addressed. Second, it is desirable to launch a program of 
advocacy with Canadians to see whether there is acceptance 
among the users of paper of all kinds, from writing paper, to 
pads, to toilet paper, that it is not bleached and therefore not 
subjected to rough chemical treatments.
<P>
	Obviously this question could be considerably resolved if the 
purchasing trends of consumers were to change and shift from 
bleached to non-bleached products. It is a question that every 
consumer asks when walking by shelves in our supermarkets.
<P>
	The background to the motion is simple. We have a very 
important pulp and paper industry. It is a major contributor to 
Canada's economy. It helps considerably to maintain a positive 
trade balance. At the same time, however, the industry is the 
largest industrial user of water in Canada and it is a major source 
of pollution.
<P>
	It is estimated that pulp and paper mills in Canada are 
responsible for roughly 50 per cent of all waste dumped into the 
nation's waters and account for approximately 5 per cent to 6 per 
cent of the common air contaminants from known industrial 
sources.
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	Because of the livelihood of many families, because of the 
economic importance of the industry, because of the interests of 
shareholders in this industry, and because of the growing desire 
to behave as good environmental citizens on the part of 
Canadians, I am sure it is in our long term interest to develop 
measures that will improve the image of the industry at home 
and abroad and therefore secure the livelihood of the families 
dependent on the industry.
<P>
	We are informed by the Chlorine Institute of North America 
that pulp and paper bleaching accounts for 14 per cent of 
chlorine use in North America. The use of chlorine and its 
compounds as bleaching agents results in the discharge of some 
very damaging and poisonous substances. By that I mean 
dioxins, furans, chloroform and other toxic materials.
<P>
	The problem with chlorine is that it has an impact on the 
environment and human health. We know that chlorine is useful 
as a disinfectant. It is useful in many industrial activities. There 
is no doubt about that. There are also many negative effects. 
When chlorine is used in pulp and paper manufacturing 
processes the byproducts include such toxic substances such as 
dioxins, furans and PCBs. These elements are known to be 
persistent in the environment. They have found their way into 
the food chain and human tissue. They have been the subject of a 
number of recommendations in recent years by the International 
Joint Commission.
<P>
	A number of health problems are associated with 
organochlorines and mounting evidence indicates that some 
organochlorines can cause not only cancer but reproductive 
dysfunctions, endocrine disruptions, developmental 
impairments and immunological effects.
<P>
	At the present time we must say in assessing the situation that 
in recent times there has been a reduction in the use of chlorine 
in pulp and paper by the industry due mostly to modernization of 
the industry. We welcome that. Many plants are shifting away 
from the use of elemental chlorine or chlorine gas to the use of 
chlorine dioxide which results in a sharp decrease in the 
production of organochlorines and a reduction in the amount of 
dioxins associated with bleaching. However chlorine dioxide 
discharges contain large amounts of chlorate which is a very 
powerful herbicide.
<P>
	We must raise the question as to whether this change or this 
shift is good enough. That question is followed by another one: 
Are there alternatives? Alternatives do exist. Also there is 
resistance to these alternatives. There is ozone bleaching, 
hydrogen peroxide and oxygen pre-bleaching.
<P>
	These various approaches are now the objects of examination 
at the research level, but they would be extremely desirable as 
alternative approaches. They are a bit more expensive than 
chlorine and chlorine dioxide. They provide not only cleaner 
alternatives but involve less cost in the long run. The basic 
concept that has to be advanced in this debate is that it is going to 
be less costly in the long run if this is seen as an issue that will 
affect more than just one generation.
<P>
	The present regulatory situation raises a question as to 
whether it is good enough. Regulations for pulp and paper were 
passed in May 1992 and were intended primarily to control 
conventional pollutants from mills. No assessment of the 
potential harm to human health by effluents from pulp and paper 
has been conducted because it is not required under the Fisheries 
Act.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4159"> 4159 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	The regulations control only two members of the family of 
chlorinated dioxins and furans. There are many family 
members. These are highly toxic because when they enter the 
environment in quantities they have immediate and long term 
harmful effects and constitute a danger to human health.
<P>
	In his report in 1993 the auditor general informed Canadians 
that the Department of the Environment had not explained why 
it had not regulated dioxins and furans according to total 
toxicity. One province has done so. That is the province of 
Quebec. Maybe others have followed suit.
<P>
	These regulations do not address directly the pulp and paper 
sludge or air emissions because they are not under the scope of 
the fisheries act. Nor do the conventional pollution regulations 
deal with effects on the environment in general or on human 
health. Further the environmental effects monitoring program, 
which is to be the main method of assessing the effectiveness of 
regulations, does not assess the effects on the environment and 
human health for the same reasons.
<P>
	Next, the auditor general pointed out that the implementation 
of some of the new regulations had actually afforded mills that 
met regulatory requirements with some protection by allowing 
discharge of prescribed amounts under specific conditions. This 
is a very tricky situation.
<P>
	The auditor general reported that incomplete information was 
provided on the effectiveness and cost of pulp and paper 
regulations. Apparently, while the federal regulations authorize 
the government to require mills to provide data on dioxins and 
furans in intermediate flows and in pulp and paper sludge at the 
mill, not much has happened.
<P>
	The auditor general also pointed out that of 97 mills not in 
compliance at the end of December 1992, 91 mills were granted 
permission to continue polluting at preregulation levels until the 
end of 1993. All companies that tabled plans by the end of 1993 
have been given an extension to the end of 1995.
<P>
	The auditor general stated in his report that if these extensions 
were granted the mid-term effectiveness of the regulations 
would be quite questionable. In other words, why have 
regulations if extension after extension is granted? It is my 
understanding that 26 mills were granted extension until 
January 1994 to the dioxin and furans regulations.
<P>
	We are dealing with a serious situation. I am sure that the 
parliamentary secretary or other members will address it in their 
interventions later.
<P>
	In conclusion, one has to raise a basic, elementary question: 
Does paper need to be white? Is it really that important? In some 
countries paper of different colours is used. I do not want to go 
into shades of brown or grey, but the preoccupation or almost 
obsession with chlorine white does not exist in many other 
cultures. We seem to adhere to that very firmly, I suppose 
because the appearance is so attractive. Does it really have to be 
that way once we connect in our way of thinking to the fact that 
the use of chlorine which is necessary to have white paper is 
harmful to the environment in the long term and affects the 
ecosystem? That also leaves much to be desired because it can 
also have negative impacts on human health.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	Do we need bleaching? Is it necessary to have white paper 
from toilet paper to writing paper? What is needed to do that? I 
suggest that if the appearance of our paper is not that important 
perhaps we could achieve a change in attitude and in consumer 
demand at the purchasing level of the individual consumer by a 
program of advocacy.
<P>
	I would suggest that ways must be found to convey to the 
public the benefits of non-bleached paper. We need 
comprehensive education, if you like. We need to inform the 
public of the merits of unbleached paper.
<P>
	Industry perhaps argues that there is no demand for chlorine 
free paper and it may be right. Yet through education and 
advocacy about the desirability of using non-bleached paper we 
might witness a change in demand in a very short time.
<P>
	I am reminded in that respect and you are also, Mr. Speaker, I 
am sure, to what happened in the 1970s when we did switch from 
phosphate detergents to non-phosphate detergents when the 
public became seriously preoccupied with eutrophication both 
in Lake Ontario and Lake Erie in particular.
<P>
	Therefore, an education campaign would perhaps rely on 
groups with experience in public education and grassroots 
awareness building so as to provide a vehicle to convey this 
message. There are many people I am sure who could be 
instrumental in an effective campaign Environment Canada 
could enlist their help. It seems to me that it is the responsibility 
of Environment Canada to initiate this process as it has done so 
successfully with other public advocacy programs.
<P>
	To conclude, there is the government procurement process. 
Here the government could set the tone and the pace by 
determining what it buys when it comes to paper. If the 
Government of Canada were to switch from bleached to 
non-bleached procurements and buy the non-bleached paper it 
would make an enormous difference. We know the quantities 
that are being ordered. All the paper products used by 
government depart-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4160"> 4160 </A></B>
<P>
ments if non-bleached could become a very important trigger 
and start a new trend in favour of  products that are 
environmentally friendly, namely non-bleached recycled paper 
products.
<P>
	It seems to me therefore that it is reasonable to raise this 
matter in the House of Commons at this point to assess the 
situation we are in at the present time. We are perhaps at the mid 
point between the very unsatisfactory situation in the 1980s. We 
are certainly moving the right direction but we have to 
accelerate that process. We have to ensure that the industry does 
not become the object of trade retaliation abroad initiated by 
environmental movements as we have seen in other industrial 
sectors.
<P>
	Maybe rather than being motivated by negative reasons we 
should be motivated by positive ones, namely by the desire of 
not only protecting the environment through our industrial 
activities but also to practice the concept of sustainable 
development which is a key chapter in the red book entitled 
``Creating Opportunities''. Sustainable development means that 
we are heading for times in which we will need to integrate 
environmental with economic decisions.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	Evidently the pulp and paper industry cannot exempt itself 
from this emerging trend. It is a desirable one because it has, as I 
mentioned, positive repercussions not only in terms of 
environmental protection but also on human health and it is 
therefore important that we bring all these concepts together on 
the floor of the House of Commons for further deliberation and 
hopefully for the advancement of the cause of a well managed 
and well protected environment with the long term interests of 
the economy in mind.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate on the motion tabled by the 
hon. member for Davenport, who is also the chairman of the 
Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable 
Development.
<P>
	I am always impressed by the hon. member's appropriate and 
honest comments, which reflect a genuine concern for the 
protection of our environment.
<P>
	Quebec and Canada must make a sustained effort to control 
the overconsumption of goods and services. The motion tabled 
this afternoon must be supported by every member in this 
House, since it aims to significantly improve the quality of 
water.
<P>
	The motion is twofold. First, it proposes to develop 
regulations and a program to replace dioxin producing 
bleaching processes in pulp and paper mills in Canada. Then, it 
proposes to launch a campaign to educate the public about the 
advantages offered by non-bleached paper products.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois fully agrees with the need to review 
regulations on the pulp and paper industry, even though the Pulp 
and Paper Mill Effluent Chlorinated Dioxins and Furans 
Regulations were passed as recently as May 7, 1992, under the 
Canadian Environmental Protection Act.
<P>
	These regulations, which came into effect on July 1, 1992, 
regulate two types of chlorinated dioxins and furans. In fact, 
these two substances were the first ones on the list of primary 
interest substances to be evaluated in terms of their toxicity.
<P>
	These regulations were the result of initial action taken by the 
government under the Green Plan to limit industrial pollution.
<P>
	These regulations are particularly important, especially since 
the Pulp and Paper Effluent Regulations which were passed at 
the same time are related to the Fisheries Act which does not 
require an evaluation of the possible dangers of effluents to 
human health. Consequently, I think it is essential that the 
regulations on chlorinated dioxins and furans provide us with 
means to protect the health of every human being.
<P>
	However, the issue of regulations in the pulp and paper 
industry is very complex. This industry has played an important 
role in our economy for a long time now. Although it has 
provided essential financial support, the pulp industry has also 
long been an important source of pollution.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	Even though we still have a long way to go, the results 
obtained encourage us to continue on this road. Industry 
complains when the government forces it to use new equipment 
to meet stricter standards.
<P>
	Let me remind you here that when a regulation is passed 
forcing a company to incur expenses to meet a new standard, it 
can reduce its taxable income by deducting a capital cost 
allowance and operating expenses from its profits.
<P>
	However, I would like to voice a criticism of my colleague 
from Davenport. He has fine qualities, I admit, but he has a 
drawback: he is a Liberal. The Conservative government did 
some things that were beyond reproach, of course; it did some 
things for which it can be criticized, but one thing it did was to 
try to put pulp and paper mills on the road to environmental 
protection and sustainable development.
<P>
	The Liberals were elected on October 25 and the House had 
not yet started to sit under the new Liberal team when I read in 
<I>Le Soleil</I>: ``Domtar has a year to comply with Ottawa's new 
green standards''. Now there are about 15 pulp and paper mills 
along the St. Lawrence River. Less than three months after they 
were elected, the Liberal Party granted the paper mills an 
exemption from a regulation that the Conservative government 
had passed here in this House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4161"> 4161 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me read you a paragraph or two:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Ottawa has just allowed Domtar to dump into the water until 1996 twice the 
amount of pollution that it usually produces at its Beauharnois plant-</BLOCKQUOTE>
-Beauharnois is in Quebec, my friends-
<P>
-says the Société pour vaincre la pollution, SVP.
<P>
	In an interview in <I>Le Soleil</I>, its spokesperson, Daniel Green, 
denounced the one-year delay granted yesterday by the federal 
government for these facilities to meet the new ``green'' 
standards.
<P>
	Similar permission was granted to most of the 60-odd paper 
mills in the province.
<P>
	And water flows downhill. In my riding, close by, in East 
Angus, there is a paper mill, and there is one in Windsor. The 
waste, following the Saint-François River, flows by 
Drummondville and inevitably ends up in the St. Lawrence 
River. Nearly all of the 60 paper mills in Quebec have obtained a 
waiver from your government, my friends. I have not heard one 
of them get up and yell, not one.
<P>
	I also wish to draw attention to a report that was just made 
public by the Quebec Department of the Environment and 
Wildlife. It is the annual report on environmental compliance 
for the pulp and paper sector, 1992.
<P>
	The report shows that, while the Quebec pulp and paper 
industry probably experienced its worst financial year in 1992, 
the percentage of compliance with standards substantially 
improved and the quantities of waste discharged also declined 
significantly.
<P>
	To say that financial constraints oblige us to go slow in our 
efforts to reduce the use of chlorine is therefore not as true as it 
once was.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	As we recently discovered in reading the seventh biennial 
report of the International Joint Commission on Water Quality 
in the Great Lakes, the pollution of these bodies of water has a 
drastic impact on human health.
<P>
	These effects, to name only two, include congenital 
malformations and learning disabilities. We are no longer 
talking about fish. This winter, opposite Trois-Rivières, at 
Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade, a third of fish in the channels, the 
tommy-cod, were blind. A third. But we are no longer talking 
about fish, but human beings. Children are born and it is known, 
at birth, that they will have a learning difficulty that can be 
determined. This is no laughing matter.
<P>
	When birds were affected, the females laid eggs with shells 
that were too thin to ensure reproduction and people said, ``It is 
sad about the birds''. But in this case, human beings are 
involved. It is estimated that one person in three will develop 
some form of cancer at one time or another in his lifetime. One 
person in three. And you know where that comes from, cancer, 
from carcinogenic agents, including these we are talking about.
<P>
	Well, Mr. Speaker, I see that my 10 minutes are already nearly 
up. I will conclude by saying to the member for Davenport that 
the Bloc Quebecois is, of course, in agreement with his private 
member's motion. It remains to be seen whether his party will 
have the courage of its convictions and go all the way with a bill 
that has teeth.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank you 
for this opportunity to speak to this motion M-100. The Reform 
Party and I recognize the importance of the preservation of our 
environment for future generations.
<P>
	A very important part of our mandate as legislators is to 
ensure the environmental sustainability of our industries as well 
as the fiscal sustainability of our standard of living. These two 
goals are very interdependent. The sustainability of our standard 
of living very much depends on a healthy strong resource 
industry sector.
<P>
	If we as lawmakers enact such strict environmental 
regulations as to make our resource industries uncompetitive in 
the world marketplace, then the income from those industries 
will not be there to support our high standard of living.
<P>
	Therefore we must strike a balance between degradation of 
our environment and exploitation of our resources for profit. 
The phrase now popular for this balance is sustainable 
development. We only have to look at third world countries to 
see how the environment suffers when human beings must 
struggle just to survive.
<P>
	It is vital that we do not lose our perspective to the agenda of 
the environmental movement. It is with this thought in mind that 
I am somewhat confused about the introduction of this motion. 
Perhaps it has become somewhat clearer after listening to the 
previous two speakers but the wording in the motion itself was 
somewhat confusing.
<P>
	Knowing the background and long experience in 
environmental matters of the member for Davenport, I assumed 
but now know after listening to him that he is aware that under 
regulations passed in May 1992 under the Environmental 
Protection Act as of January 1994 the presence of dioxins and 
furans has been virtually eliminated from the effluent of 
Canadian pulp mills. That makes this motion somewhat 
redundant.
<P>
	Thinking that I might be misinformed on the issue, I consulted 
the Alberta-Pacific Forest Industries mill in my riding, the Pulp 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4162"> 4162 </A></B>
<P>
and Paper Research Institute of Canada and the B.C. Council of 
Forest Production. All confirmed that my information is correct.
<P>
	I also visited the Alpac mill, the largest single line bleach 
kraft pulp mill in North America. I found it to be a shining 
example of the type of sustainable development we are striving 
to achieve.
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	This mill is producing 1,600 tonnes per day of the highest 
quality bleached white pulp, the best in the world, without 
producing any measurable dioxins or furan emissions. This mill 
also has one of the lowest AOX or organochlorine compound 
levels in effluent discharge of any mill in the world.
<P>
	The effluent treatment plant makes use of a natural organic 
activated sludge biological effluent treatment system, if you can 
believe that. In this process micro-organisms which occur 
naturally in the river are introduced and thrive on the 
contaminants in the effluent, much the same process as the 
common household septic tank. The effluent is then aerated and 
oxygenated. Solids are then settled into large settling ponds. The 
clean water then returns to the river and the sludge is removed 
and burned in the power boiler.
<P>
	Air and water emissions from the mill are continually 
monitored to meet the most stringent regulations in the world, as 
laid out in its operating licence.
<P>
	The best example I saw of the technology being used is the 
large aquarium in the administration area of the mill in which a 
number of goldfish are living in pulp mill effluent. The fish 
looked healthy and vigorous with no mutations or growth sores 
that were visible. They certainly were not the type of horrors we 
heard the previous speaker talk about in our rivers and 
atmosphere.
<P>
	I am not for a minute suggesting that the pulp and paper 
industry does not deserve its reputation as a major polluter of 
our air and water, but let us give credit where credit is due. 
Through a combination of much improved technology, public 
pressure and government regulation the industry has developed 
an environmental conscience as a means of survival in today's 
world.
<P>
	The environmental movement no doubt was a real factor in 
this new environmental awareness. We must continue to be 
vigilant in monitoring the industry, but let us not let the 
pendulum swing too far as this motion might suggest.
<P>
	We now have the technology to produce high quality bleached 
white paper, a product which certainly seems to be in great 
demand in this institution, and I notice it on the member's desk 
as well. We have the technology to do this without destroying 
our environment.
<P>
	While the industry has eliminated the highly toxic 
organochlorine compounds, other non-organic, non-toxic 
organochlorine compounds continue to be present in the effluent 
streams. We must recognize that many products we consume on 
a daily basis, such as many pharmaceutical products and 
artificial sweeteners contain organochlorine compounds. As 
well we use chlorine in our drinking water and swimming pool 
treatment.
<P>
	Therefore let us not react hysterically and destroy a very 
profitable industry which uses a renewable resource formerly 
viewed as a trash forest byproduct not suitable for the 
production of lumber. Research must continue on options such 
as closed recycling systems. That option is nearing reality. It is 
certainly one that is being developed in the Alpac system. The 
effluent is not pumped back into the river but instead is 
recirculated and reused in the mill. These are some options that 
we must continue to explore.
<P>
	We must continue also to examine the other organochlorine 
compounds. If they are discovered to be toxic, let us move 
swiftly to ban these elements. But let us not destroy a viable 
industry that creates much needed jobs and contributes in a big 
way through tax dollars to our high standard of living based on a 
poorly informed environmental lobby.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Parliamentary Secretary to Deputy 
Prime Minister and Minister of the Environment):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first of all I would like to thank my colleague the hon. 
member for Davenport for his respect for the environment and 
his tenacity in promoting the cause of the environment over the 
years. I do not think his case was hysterical at all. His case was 
in very measured tones in fact in contrast to the two speakers 
who spoke after him.
<P>
	Of course I agree we should not be alarmists. At the same time 
I think we should be realists. To suggest that all over Canada 
pulp mills are not a problem today is to simplify the notion to a 
degree where it is not real any more.
<P>
	I know there are state of the art mills such as Millar Western in 
Alberta and Saskatchewan with closed looped technologies 
producing zero effluents and zero toxins. They are models for 
mills all around the world, but they certainly are not typical of 
all the mills in Canada. In my own province of Quebec right up 
until a few years ago, the effluents from paper mills were tragic 
to the St. Lawrence. That has been the case all over Canada.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	We recognize very much the economic importance of the pulp 
and paper industry. Of course it is our foremost industry. The 
accent was put on it by the hon. member for Davenport in saying 
that on the contrary we must be proactive in making sure that the 
output of the industry is enhanced, that the quality of its 
products sell all over the world. It is in that sense the motion was 
produced. We have to see it in a proactive light.
<P>
	In 1992 after tremendous consultations involving 
stakeholders from the industry, from environmental groups and 
from governments, the Canadian government decided to 
produce a comprehensive set of regulations under the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act and also under the Fisheries Act. 
The regulations mandated that mills would not produce any 
more 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4163"> 4163 </A></B>
<P>
effluent that resulted in dioxins and furans by 1994. That has 
been the case.
<P>
	However I will correct my colleague, the critic for the Bloc 
Quebecois, when he said it was due to the Liberals that 
extensions were granted, as they were. I will remind him that the 
amendments to the 1992 regulations providing for extensions 
were produced by the Conservative government. If members do 
not agree with me they can check it and challenge me tomorrow 
in Question Period.
<P>
	What happened was that these amendments to the regulations 
were produced so that when mills applied for extensions of time 
before December 31, 1995, there was no choice but to grant 
these extensions.
<P>
	I know we have to do better. We have to examine the chlorine 
issue very carefully. There has been a change in gaseous 
chlorine used in mills in Canada by a 70 per cent decline. Instead 
they are choosing chlorine dioxide bleaching which is far less 
harmful to the environment. As a result there has been a 
dramatic decrease in the effluents producing dioxins and furans.
<P>
	I will give some figures which are pretty startling. The total 
discharges of chlorinated dioxins and furans as measured in 
toxic equivalent units discharged from all pulp mills using 
chlorine bleaching in Canada has decreased from over 350 
grams per year in 1988 to less than 6 grams in mid-1993.
<P>
	We have to carry on our pursuit for completely dioxin and 
furan free effluents, zero discharge effluents, not just at the end 
of the pipe effluents but preventive technologies that will 
produce closed loop technologies which will stop discharges of 
these altogether. Such is the case for Millar Western.
<P>
	Some very important initiatives are now in progress. First of 
all, side effect research is being carried out today by 
Environment Canada and other parties. The report of the study 
will be completed in a matter of a few months. The study is 
examining the effect of chlorine and chlorinated products used 
in pulp mills and other manufacturing uses. Also a 
memorandum of understanding has just been signed by the 
Government of Canada with the Pulp and Paper Research 
Institute to try and establish new technologies in closed loop 
circuits so that effluents will be completely toxin free.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There is also the St. Lawrence program just signed with 
Quebec, which will force all manufacturing companies-there 
were 56 of them, including the pulp and paper mills, and now 
there are 106-to reduce effluents, which have been reduced by 
70 per cent so far, by 90 per cent by 1998. Consequently, 
measures are currently being developed. I know we have to 
improve what we are doing. This is why I personally and all the 
people in the department are closely monitoring what is 
happening especially in the United States, where an extensive 
study is under way on chlorine and on the steps to be taken to 
eliminate dioxin and furan effluents resulting from chlorine.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	My colleague from Davenport also spoke about health, and I 
agree completely with him. This is why the Vision 2000 
component of the St. Lawrence action plan-as will also be the 
case in Ontario-will include a component on health to measure 
the effects on the health of living species and especially humans. 
It is essential that we begin to look into the health effects of 
toxic effluents, not only from pulp and paper mills, but also 
from all plants.
<P>
	I agree completely with my colleague that what is needed is a 
heightened public awareness campaign so that the public can 
find out about the environmental impact of a particular product.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That is the reason for the ecochoice program and I would be 
quite happy if most of our paper, certainly the procurement of 
the House of Commons to start as an example, were unbleached 
paper. Why not start here as an example?
<P>
	It seems to me that we can also produce good white paper, 
bleached so long as it is under closed loop technology or 
non-toxic technology, and at the same time use other measures 
which eventually people accept.
<P>
	I use stationery that is brown in colour, so does my colleague, 
and I find it receives acceptance today all over the place. Ten 
years ago recycled paper was not acceptable. Today it is.
<P>
	We have to change our ways, our attitudes, find a means for all 
of us, including my colleagues over there, including colleagues 
from the Bloc Quebecois, to find a certain consensus that yes, 
industry has to carry on. It is our bread basket. It is the way we 
live and manage to earn our living.
<P>
	At the same time it has to be done with full respect for the 
environment, for the ecosystems, for our biodiversity, for 
human health, not only in one place, perhaps in the member's 
riding, but all over Canada without regard to where it is or how it 
is done.
<P>
	We may reach it, not tomorrow or the day after, but we have to 
set an objective of a toxic free, dioxin and furan free ecosystem 
all over Canada.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There being no further 
members rising for debate and the motion not being designated 
as a votable item the time provided for the consideration of 
Private Member's Business has now expired and the order is 
dropped from the Order Paper pursuant to Standing Order 96(1).

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my 
honour to be able to stand here this evening and address the issue 
of agriculture, something which I am very familiar with.
<P>
	I am also pleased to have shared this time slot with my 
colleague, also my constituency colleague in the fact that he 
neighbours to my south and we share in many ways similar 
constituencies with the exception that my constituency is totally 
agriculture and I do not share the urban aspect that my colleague 
from London-Middlesex does.
<P>
	This evening I want to draw some points that I think have 
already been made today. I want to reiterate a number of points.
<P>
<B>(1820 ) </B>
<P>
	I think as we go back and look at the February budget we see 
included some very tough measures such as cuts for all 
government departments including the agricultural department. 
Agriculture grants and contributions were cut by 5 per cent. 
Because the government was aware and sensitive to the 
challenges facing agriculture producers, major safety net 
programs, that is GRIP, NISA and the dairy subsidy and crop 
insurance programs, were exempt from these cuts.
<P>
	There are no huge amounts of money for new programs as we 
all know and we do not want to create new cumbersome 
bureaucracies. Therefore we must work with the farmers to 
prioritize our resources and farmers are going to have to decide 
what they want the limited moneys to be spent on.
<P>
	Just this morning a committee of rural people met with the 
farmers representing the corn and oilseed industries with regard 
to the way they want to see us spend our money in terms of the 
advance payment programs. Later on this morning they also met 
with the hon. minister. I understand they had a very congenial 
meeting.
<P>
	The agri-food industry is complex and goes far beyond the 
farm gate. The system provides Canadians with the safest and 
the most nutritious food in the world and let me suggest also at 
the most reasonable prices.
<P>
	We as a government are committed to develop all 
opportunities for growth and have placed priority on the security 
of the family farm. This priority can only be achieved by 
building solid domestic and international markets, staying on 
the forefront of innovation and in the concentration on 
stewardship of our natural resources-farmers know this 
best-soil, the way we revere this ever so important ingredient 
in the food chain.
<P>
	I want to move to the issue of trade. Trade is this country's life 
blood. Offshore markets are expanding especially for value 
added products. Canada is losing ground to our competitors for a 
number of reasons. However, we through the minister, the 
parliamentary secretary and the agriculture committee, are 
working to reverse this trend. The minister has stated that our 
government's policy will be to work with the different industries 
to reach a goal of $20 billion of exports by the year 2000. This is 
a major increase from the current level of $13 billion.
<P>
	We are committed to increasing exports and the minister has 
told the department to shift its priorities and to increase support 
for export initiatives. The potential for export growth in the 
agri-food industry falls within value added products. Also key 
is the development of new markets in Asia and in Latin America.
<P>
	There has been created a new market, an industries branch 
that will work with the Department of Industry and the 
Department of Human Resources Development to produce a 
single window approach to provide support for market 
development of agriculture. Agri-food specialists have been 
placed in selected embassies abroad and to date the response has 
been positive.
<P>
	The minister along with the Governor General and private 
organizations came back from a trade mission to China, South 
Korea and Hong Kong to promote the agri-food industry. The 
government wants to find new customers while firming up 
existing partnerships.
<P>
	This government has been working hard to cultivate and take 
advantage of new trade opportunities post NAFTA and GATT. 
With NAFTA we have the opportunity to jump on new 
opportunities south of our border in the United States and in 
Mexico. We as a government did what we promised and made 
improvements to NAFTA before we signed. These 
improvements were in areas of labour and environment, 
subsidies and dumping, water and energy.
<P>
	NAFTA was agreed upon to ensure that we have secure access 
to our largest trading partner and greater access to a growing 
market in Mexico.
<P>
	To date Canada has accepted 85 per cent of Mexican food 
products duty free. Mexico maintained high import duties and 
import restrictions on many food products. NAFTA will correct 
this imbalance and increase our exports past the pre-NAFTA 
levels of approximately $215 million. This will help the whole 
agricultural industry including our food processing sector which  

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4165"> 4165 </A></B>
<P>
currently employs close to 200,000 people and with a 
production valued at $40 billion.
<P>
	Market opportunities in Mexico exist in many food sectors 
including fish, shellfish, wheat, barley, oilseeds, pork and pork 
products, potato and potato products, canary seed, dried beans, 
peas and apples, to name some of the things we export from this 
country.
<P>
	There was little time to rest when we were elected. We had to 
jump into the trade issue right away with the GATT negotiations.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	Recently in Morocco, on April 15, 1994 the trade minister 
along with about 120 other governments signed on to the final 
act that embodies the results of the Uruguay round of 
multilateral trade negotiations. Their agreement will put greater 
fairness and predictability to international trade. New trade 
rules will apply to all countries equally and differences between 
trading partners will be settled more effectively through the 
rules of the World Trade Organization. This is essential to 
farmers and the agri-food industry.
<P>
	For the first time in history we have an agreed to definition of 
the term subsidy. The agreement also sets out a category of 
government programs agreed upon to be non-trade distorting.
<P>
	This will not happen overnight, but will be phased in over six 
years. In most cases this will give domestic industries time to 
adjust to the new trading rules.
<P>
	The agreement will help put an end to a disastrous grain trade 
subsidy war that proved extremely costly to Canadian farmers. 
In the future Canadian farmers will enjoy greater market access. 
The red meat industry will also benefit from this agreement. 
Pork and beef producers will enjoy greater opportunities in the 
Asian market.
<P>
	Now allow me to move to supply management. More than 20 
years ago this country decided that a made in Canada approach, 
the supply management system, was the appropriate structure 
for the dairy, poultry and egg industries. Now supply 
management is one of the foundations of the Canadian 
agricultural economy.
<P>
	Supply management is and was based on three pillars: 
production quotas, a regulated pricing mechanism and import 
quotas. After the 1994 GATT agreement one of the three pillars, 
import quotas, was replaced by tariffs.
<P>
	Our party's position is clear. We remain committed and 
support the supply management system and will continue to 
assure its prosperity. Opposition members are quick to pounce 
on us and predict the end of supply management. In December 
the Ontario Milk Marketing Board issued a press release: 
``Marketing boards have not been dismantled by the recently 
announced trade deal under the General Agreement on Tariffs 
and Trades (GATT). The change coming in July 1995 is that 
border import quotas are being replaced by border tariffs so only  
the mechanism to keep out subsidized product has changed''.
<P>
	The industry has accepted this. Currently the government is 
working with stockholders to develop new arrangements that 
will support the sustainable orderly marketing systems required 
in the future.
<P>
	In December the agriculture minister along with provincial 
agriculture ministers established a small task force to provide 
advice on changes needed to the supply management system to 
address the challenges and opportunities resulting from GATT.
<P>
	The task force was chaired by the hon. member for Prince 
Edward-Hastings and is looking toward an aggressive 
marketing approach as key to the future of this sector.
<P>
	Recently the United States has decided to serve notice of its 
intention of proceeding with increased tariffs on barley and 
wheat. We regret the action and despite what the opposition 
claims we will stand firm in our support of the industry. We will 
not trade off one industry's interest for the interest of another.
<P>
	We will try to use the 90-day consultation period to try and 
negotiate a deal to prevent a trade war. We stand ready and we 
will not back down. If the U.S. proceeds with unilateral trade 
action we will have no choice but to respond in kind.
<P>
	In fact, Canada would have been much worse off had it not 
been included in the GATT agreement. If this had happened the 
U.S. would have been free to impose tariffs right away without 
the 90-day consultation period.
<P>
	In looking at the future, we have under GATT clear rules and a 
new system of discipline in trade that can be understood by all 
parties when developing the new generation of safety net 
programs. These programs need to be to the best of our ability 
countervail proof.
<P>
	My view is that we need to develop long term agricultural 
policies that will take us well into the 21st century. Farmers 
need and want that stability.
<P>
	Farmers have always said they do not want subsidies, they just 
want a fair price for their goods from the market. However, even 
with the best trading conditions support programs are still 
needed because of the inherent instability of the agri-food 
industry, instability caused by such things as weather conditions 
and trade wars.
<P>
	We as a government are committed to replacing the patchwork 
of current expensive commodity subsidies with a user friendly, 
whole farm income approach. Farming organizations have given 
us their strong support in this matter.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4166"> 4166 </A></B>
<P>
	To avoid major dislocation we will make future changes over 
a period of several years. Safety net programs need to be 
financially efficient, GATT constant and market neutral.
<P>
<B>(1830 ) </B>
<P>
	In my closing comments, I want to say that this government 
has been very positive in the direction that it has taken the 
agriculture department. In terms of our agricultural committee 
we have now opened the process where the public has been able 
to view us in our deliberations, particularly as we deliberated on 
the BST question.
<P>
	We have offered and tabled in this House seven 
recommendations. It is the committee's hope and trust that this 
House will embrace those recommendations. We encourage all 
in this House to support us on those issues.
<P>
	We also think it was positive that in the past week we were 
able to sit down and discuss the difficulties in marketing and 
getting our grain to ports on the west coast. A subcommittee of 
the transportation committee and the agriculture committee was 
established. It is meeting with witnesses on this issue because it 
is affecting and impacting on all Canadians. We want to let 
members know that we had a very successful conclusion to that 
time. Members will be hearing our responses from those 
witnesses within the next few days.
<P>
	I want to say again how important it is that we recognize the 
values of agriculture. It is a privilege to have been part of this 
discussion and having allowed Canadians to see that agriculture 
is truly a part of Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened carefully to my colleague from Huron-Bruce, and I am 
delighted to see that in this House there are several members 
who seem to want to defend the interests of our farmers.
<P>
	However, I would like to have him clarify a point which he 
stressed several times when he talked about ensuring the 
financial security of our farmers.
<P>
	I too am familiar with the farmers of Quebec. However, you 
know that 49 per cent of the milk consumed in Canada is 
produced in Quebec. I therefore wonder how we can tell our 
farmers in Quebec that we are going to ensure their financial 
security when milk quotas are reduced regularly by a few 
percentage points each year, except last year, when they went up 
2 per cent or rather, 2 per cent was loaned. Production costs are 
rising constantly, and our dairy farmers have been selling milk 
at practically the same price for the past five years.
<P>
	The same holds true for veal calf breeders. The price of veal 
has virtually not risen at all since 1978, whereas production 
costs continue to rise.
<P>
	I would like the person who spoke last to tell us, in all 
seriousness, how he can say to Quebec farmers that the Liberal 
government, which was just elected with a solid majority, is 
going to ensure their financial security in the foreseeable future, 
not in 50 years, but in a year or two. I would like to hear you talk 
about that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Steckle:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for raising 
that question. I am sure that his concern and interest in farmers 
is quite similar to mine. Whether those farmers be in Quebec, 
Saskatchewan or Ontario really is not my point of argument this 
evening.
<P>
	My point is that the farmers' interests in Quebec are best 
served by remaining part of Canada. My concern would be that if 
they did not remain in Canada the likelihood of farmers' success 
in agriculture and their future would certainly not be as bright as 
remaining here in Canada.
<P>
	We have policies in place in this country. We have a directive. 
We know where we are going in this country. The supply 
management system is not gone. The member mentioned quota 
values. Quota values today are stronger than they were just 
before article XI was lost. I might say to the member that the 
people in Quebec have done very well.
<P>
	We in Ontario who happen to take shipment of some of its 
stocker calves into our province know very well that there is 
good cattle there. Ontarians look forward to getting those cattle. 
We also know that the cattle industry as one of the many 
industries in the agriculture sector has done reasonably well. We 
would all like to do better but many sectors have been restrained 
from growth and doing the kinds of things they would like to do.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	I once again assure Canadians that this government has the 
interests of farmers at heart. We sincerely indulge upon the 
member sitting next to the hon. member in the committee. He 
has participated and he has shared. I know the concerns.
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member that we are there for the farmers 
of the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member 
stated during his presentation that he hears from farmers the 
comment: ``All I really want is a fair price for my product. I 
don't want subsidies''.
<P>
	How does the member answer this question?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Steckle:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member raises a question 
that I rather expected would come from the Reform Party. As 
you know, as we have discussed in the agriculture committee-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I hesitate to 
interrupt members. I know this debate is of great interest to the 
House and the debate has been most interesting. But I would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4167"> 4167 </A></B>
<P>
remind you in your responses to address yourself through the 
chair and not directly to one another.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Steckle:</B> Mr. Speaker, the point is well taken.
<P>
	Regarding the issue of how to address farmers who say to us: 
``What are we going to do in the meantime?'', your leader very 
ably this evening in an earlier dialogue said that we cannot get 
rid of these subsidies and aids immediately, that it is going to 
take some time. We need an interim period where we adjust.
<P>
	That is what we are asking our farmers to do. They are 
prepared to do that. Farmers realize that subsidies are of the 
essence at this point in time because we are competing with 
countries that are much more highly subsidized than this 
country.
<P>
	The fact that we now have a definition of subsidy is important. 
That was defined when we reached our agreement under 
NAFTA. I hope and trust as we go into the GATT period over the 
next number of years that we will find less and less need for 
subsidies.
<P>
	I trust that farmers in the western part of this country 
recognize that we are heading in a direction where we will no 
longer need subsidies.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, there are several reasons why I welcome the 
opportunity to speak in this debate, but before explaining what 
they are, I would like to draw a parallel with a unique 
astronomical phenomenon we saw today and I am of course 
referring to the solar eclipse which a few hours ago was visible 
over a substantial part of the earth and indeed above our heads, 
what the scientists call an annular eclipse. In other words, the 
sun was visible around the moon, and people who wanted to 
watch were urged to wear glasses to prevent any injury to their 
eyes.
<P>
	As we experienced this phenomenon, here in this House we 
experienced a total eclipse of vision in the agricultural sector. 
However, this particular eclipse has been going on for more than 
six months, while the one we saw today will probably not recur 
for another 50 years. The Liberal eclipse, unfortunately, does 
not require special glasses. We can see its daily impact on 
agriculture in Quebec and Canada and on the lives of our 
farmers.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	I became interested in agriculture at an early age, since I come 
from a farm background. I had several uncles who were farmers 
and raised their children on the family farm, and those children 
are now also engaged in farming.
<P>
	In fact, I was personally very involved in farming for seven or 
eight years when I was a beef producer in the riding of 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, together with my 
father-in-law, who died tragically in a car accident last Friday.
<P>
	I would like to take a few moments to pay tribute to him. His 
name was Maurice Brault, and he was one of my constituents, 
who like most farmers not only worked on the land, but was a 
part of it and made it a part of his life. He passed on to me this 
love of farming, of the animals, the forest and everything that 
grows on the land, and above all, he passed on his respect for our 
land.
<P>
	I also want to say that I am proud of living in a riding where 
farming is the main economic activity. I quoted some figures in 
a speech about two weeks ago in this House, and I want to repeat 
these figures, because they are very revealing.
<P>
	In the riding of Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, agriculture 
is an economic activity that generates roughly $160 million 
annually. It is responsible for 2,500 direct jobs and for 10,000 to 
12,000 indirect jobs. All of which means that 15,000 people 
depend on agriculture in the riding of 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead. Therefore, it can be 
classified as a major industry.
<P>
	I am also proud to belong to this riding since barely two weeks 
ago, Parti Quebecois faithful gathered to elect the candidate who 
would run in the upcoming provincial elections in the provincial 
riding of Mégantic-Compton. They chose Mr. Jacques Blais of 
La Patrie, who is himself a very prosperous farmer and the 
owner of a 1,300-acre farm in the municipality of La Patrie. Mr. 
Blais is a farmer by profession. He knows the agricultural sector 
and will be able to defend the interests of all Quebec farmers in 
the National Assembly once the election is held in a few weeks 
or, at most, in a few months.
<P>
	Mr. Blais also belongs to a family that includes at least five or 
six prosperous farmers in the immediate region of La Patrie and 
Coaticook. These individuals have dedicated their lives to the 
farm and to farming. I will come back to this later and give you a 
few examples.
<P>
	Therefore, I am proud to represent this riding. My colleague 
from the neighbouring riding of Frontenac was also a farmer up 
until his election on October 25 last. He raised cattle in addition 
to working as a teacher.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	Agriculture is therefore more than just words for the people of 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead. It represents their livelihood, 
their survival and even the future, not just their own, but the 
future of their municipality, of the entire riding and even of 
Quebec.
<P>
	I would like to give you two examples of initiatives taken by 
farmers in my riding which speak volumes about how Quebec 
farmers are capable of taking care of themselves and of 
benefiting from the spirit of co-operation that has prevailed in 
our region for the past twenty years. They are not waiting, and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4168"> 4168 </A></B>
<P>
rightly so, for the government, whether provincial or federal, to 
come up with solutions; they roll up their sleeves and work at 
resolving their problems themselves.
<P>
	I would like to start by talking about the RCM of 
Haut-Saint-François which includes the municipality of La 
Paltrie that I mentioned a minute ago as well as those around 
Cookshire, East Angus and Weedon, the locality next to my 
colleague's. Within this RCM, a consultation committee on 
agri-food, which incidentally was called agri-food table of 
Haut-Saint-François, was set up about a year ago.
<P>
	This Table brings together farmers, of course, but also 
processors, distributors and representatives from the UPA. 
These people want to look after the interests of the 600 farming 
enterprises in that RCM, the total sales of which exceed $40 
million annually.
<P>
	On the subject of agriculture, it is important to stress the 
figures and the impact of the agricultural industry on the 
economy, because many urbanites believe that farming is 
something you do on the side, like gentlemen farmers. In the 
riding of Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, farming is a 
business enterprise, an industry which requires daily input.
<P>
	These people got together when they noticed a kind of rural 
exodus in the last 10 years or so, especially among young 
people, a kind of devitalization of the agricultural community. 
They noted that the population of the regional county 
municipality was decreasing and getting older since the young 
people were moving to the city, more often than not to join the 
ranks of the unemployed.
<P>
	They noted that the education and skill level of the labour 
force was low. They also noted that the producers were quite 
spread out geographically since the regional county 
municipality of Haut-Saint-François is a vast territory and, 
with the number of farms dwindling, the distance between 
producers is increasing. All the agri-food forum findings I just 
mentioned led them to the problem of marketing their products.
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	That is why they decided to join forces and promote 
partnership and co-operation among the various players since a 
farmer alone on his farm will not accomplish anything if he is 
not familiar with market conditions not only to sell his products 
but also, when the time comes to invest in his farm, to know 
whether he should stay with the same products or diversify into 
other sectors and, if so, into which sectors.
<P>
	That is why the forum produced a strategic development 
action plan. They identified new agricultural projects, new 
niches through market studies and realized that there was a 
demand for certain fruits and vegetables. They also published a 
number of promotional flyers, which is a precedent at least in 
our region if not in Quebec as a whole, to let people know about 
their products.
<P>
	They also developed the tourism sector. In the last 15 years or 
so, our region has noticed an increasing level of interest from 
city people who want to spend a weekend or a week on a farm to 
see how things are done, how people live, how we produce the 
various products sold on the market such as milk and poultry. In 
our region we developed through the agri-food forum a farm 
tour which is already giving results and increasing, as I said, the 
local economic activity level.
<P>
	We are also interested in labour force training since, as I 
pointed out a few moments ago, after noting that many farmers 
were poorly educated, we approached school boards to help 
solve this problem. Finally, we developed an area-buy policy 
when we found out that many people living close by did not even 
know the products available from the local farmers.
<P>
	Also in the region, in the Regional County Municipality of 
Coaticook, there is the Coaticook regional agricultural 
initiatives centre, an agricultural co-operation and planning 
body whose purpose is to develop a dynamic and attractive 
economic environment to help consolidate and diversify rural 
activities. Local farmers got together at something like the 
agri-food forum and shared their experience and knowledge to 
develop the agricultural sector further.
<P>
	What is special about the Coaticook RCM is the diversity of 
the stakeholders involved in this project. I will name a few: the 
city of Coaticook is not only taking part in the discussions but is 
also helping to finance the agricultural initiatives centre, which 
gave $450,000 last year, the municipality of Coaticook, the 
regional development board, the Coaticook school commission, 
49 commercial interests of all kinds in the Coaticook RCM that 
invested money in this project, 10 surrounding rural 
municipalities in the Coaticook RCM, 56 farmers who invested 
time and money in this initiatives centre, and 71 supporters, 
ordinary people who are interested in such an initiative and 
decided to put their time and money into it; the Government of 
Quebec contributed $1.5 million, local groups and individuals 
also, and the federal government gave $1,184,000.
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you are telling me that I have one minute left. I 
will conclude by saying that farmers want to take charge; they 
want to succeed, but they also expect governments, and 
particularly the federal government, to invest more. If you 
compare Quebec and western Canada in terms of federal 
investments, the figures are very eloquent. I do not have time to 
review them now, but I may have that opportunity during 
questions and comments period.
<P>
	I want to point out that farmers in my riding are concerned 
about their future, following the GATT agreement. They are 
concerned, but not because they do not want to compete on the 
world market, quite the contrary. They are concerned about the 
negotiations which will follow and they want the government of  
Canada to guarantee that they will get support and that 
agriculture's future will not be jeopardized in any way.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member 
opposite talked in the beginning about the eclipse and eclipse is 
right. He leaves the impression that Quebec would do better out 
of Canada. Nothing could be farther from the truth.
<P>
	The member continues to portray total darkness to Quebec 
producers on the amount of gains they make out of the national 
agricultural policy. The facts are that Quebec net farm income 
has grown steadily over the past 20 years, a result of stability 
and markets for hogs, supply management products and a 
growing grain industry.
<P>
	I might add that these kinds of policies were started by the 
previous Liberal administration. Quebec has gained a great 
advantage because of them. Another example given by the 
member that is a little misleading is that members have to 
recognize that over 45 per cent of the industrial milk in Canada 
is produced and processed in Quebec but only 25 per cent of 
those industrial milk products are consumed in Quebec.
<P>
	It is because of the national policies we have in place, the 
sharing of the national market, the expanding international 
markets that Quebec has gained substantially to the point it has.
<P>
	I want to conclude by saying that with this new Liberal 
administration in charge again and being proactive as we are we 
can move forward as a united nation in exercising our potential 
as a country as a whole, including Quebec, in fostering exports 
and profits for Canadian farmers.
<P>
<B>(1900) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my colleague for his comments and, with all 
due respect to him, I would recommend that he review the 
figures he has just submitted to us, implying that agriculture in 
Quebec had continued to make progress in the past 20 years, 
thanks, in particular, to the initiatives of the federal 
government. The reality is quite different.
<P>
	You will allow me to cite some figures that indicate the 
contrary. There was indeed a period, in particular the period 
from 1976 to 1985, when agriculture in Quebec experienced 
constant development and a very remarkable improvement. This 
was due in great measure to the policies of the then government 
of Quebec, that of Mr. René Lévesque.
<P>
	I will simply recall, for the benefit of the member and the 
Minister of Agriculture, that, in 1976, when the Parti Quebecois 
took office, Quebec's level of self-sufficiency in food was 47 
per cent. In 1985, when the Parti Quebecois was replaced by the 
Liberal Party, the twin brother of the Government that now sits 
opposite us, the rate of self-sufficiency in food was 78 per cent.
<P>
	In just nine years, Quebec's self-sufficiency in food 
improved from 47 to 78 per cent. After 1985, figures are not 
available, since the Liberal Government of Quebec abolished 
the evaluation branch of the Department of Agriculture, but the 
rate of self-sufficiency is now estimated to be below 70 per cent. 
Thus, there has been a falling off.
<P>
	From 1977 to 1985, agriculture accounted for 1.7 per cent of 
Quebec's gross domestic product; from 1986 to 1993, it 
accounted for 1.37 per cent of the gross domestic product, a 
significant decrease. Farm investment in Quebec from 1980 to 
1985-the Member should take note of these figures and use 
them in future speeches-averaged $737 million per year. From 
1986 to 1993, investment averaged $409 million, a decrease of 
45 per cent.
<P>
	A look at other telling figures in terms of potato production 
from 1981 to 1991, when there were either Liberal or 
Conservative governments, reveals that the cultivated acreage 
for potatoes rose by 2 per cent. In the West, it increased by 30 per 
cent. Beef production in Quebec from 1981 to 1991 fell by 13 
per cent, whereas it rose by 4 per cent in the West. Pork 
production fell 16 per cent in Quebec, whereas it rose 39 per cent 
in the West. Lamb production rose 8 per cent during the same 
period in Quebec, compared to 33 per cent in the west.
<P>
	Therefore, instead of being told stories, I would like the real 
figures to be used, and I say once again that I fervently hope, and 
the farmers in my county hope even more so, that the 
government will table policies that will ensure the development 
of agriculture in Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the 
member opposite made my point to a certain extent because 
what we are talking about here is a proactive government. He 
indicated that between 1976 and 1985 there was continuous 
development.
<P>
<B>(1905 ) </B>
<P>
	That was as a result really of a strong Liberal administration 
operating in terms of federal-provincial cost sharing 
agreements, and Quebec benefited greatly as a result of that 
leadership.
<P>
	One other point that I will make is that when one compares 
1981 and 1994 net income in Quebec, Quebec has grown by over 
60 per cent compared with only about 20 per cent of the rest of 
the provinces. Those facts and figures should be known.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think we must keep along the same line, since the hon. 
member mentions figures the origin of which I do not 
know-although I am sure he will be pleased to send me those 
figures. I want to remind him that comparisons were made and, 
for 1991-92, federal public spending to support Quebec's 
agri-food industry reached $399 million, that is almost $400 
million, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4170"> 4170 </A></B>
<P>
compared to  about $5.5 billion for the rest of Canada. In other 
words, about 7 per cent of federal support is allocated to 
Quebec's agri-food industry.
<P>
	Let us take a look at the respective percentages represented by 
support or assistance by federal and provincial governments in 
the agricultural sector. Again in 1991-92, federal assistance in 
Quebec represented 37.2 per cent of all subsidies granted, 
whereas the support provided by the provincial government 
represented 62.8 per cent. In the rest of Canada, it is the 
opposite. The figures are reversed: federal assistance, 65.8 per 
cent; provincial support, 34.2 per cent. I will end on that. These 
figures speak for themselves and show that federal assistance 
must be redistributed and, I will say it again, we are waiting for 
the Minister of Agriculture to take action.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Guy H. Arseneault (Restigouche-Chaleur):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member opposite. If this 
government implements programs which will surely help 
Quebec farmers, will he vote against separation, yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, with all due respect, I really do not understand the hon. 
member's intervention. If any measure tabled in this House by a 
government, whether Liberal or not, is susceptible to improve 
the plight of agriculture and farmers in Quebec and the rest of 
Canada, we will be pleased to support it.
<P>
	As for Quebec's future, the federal government's 
interventions in the past are not likely to incite Quebecers to 
give unconditional support to Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Murphy (Annapolis Valley-Hants):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased this evening to have the opportunity to 
add something to this important debate.
<P>
	Annapolis Valley-Hants is home to a large and diverse 
agricultural and agri-food sector. I am committed to working 
closely with this sector and I am honoured to have the 
opportunity to bring its views to this place.
<P>
	In order to help me effectively gain local input on agricultural 
issues I have set up an advisory committee made up of 
individuals from the local farming and processing sector. 
Meeting with this group has been of tremendous assistance to 
me in not only identifying local concerns but also highlighting 
workable solutions.
<P>
	Most recently I received some very positive feedback from 
this group regarding the position of the minister of agriculture 
on our current dispute with the United States over wheat.
<P>
<B>(1910 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to share with hon. members one particular 
response I received just yesterday: ``Please continue to fight. 
Americans are tough traders but we must learn that our strengths 
and policies need to stay in place. So from my past business 
experience, hang tough''.
<P>
	That is precisely what we intend to do.
<P>
	In contributing to this debate I would like to focus my 
comments on how we are assisting family farms. I would like to 
make it very clear that we must retain the family farm as a 
business unit. In my riding and the constituencies across this 
country, small and medium sized farms are the backbone of the 
local and regional economies. Through our commitment to 
enhance value added production, provide better access to capital 
and financing, and work with all of the stakeholders to redesign 
our supply management system, I believe that our policies are 
on the right track.
<P>
	Our platform for the election last fall emphasized jobs and 
economic growth. The agri-food sector represents 8 per cent of 
our GDP and 15 per cent of all the jobs in this country. It is key to 
our success in achieving that growth and creating those jobs.
<P>
	World markets are changing. Canadian consumers' tastes and 
needs are changing. Technology is giving farmers and food 
companies new ways to produce, market and manage to meet 
consumer demands. This is the sector where government 
support for innovation is vital.
<P>
	Our platform, commitment to innovation and value added 
production, is particularly important to our government's focus 
on trade in agri-food. It is a high tech industry in which market 
share can only be maintained by being at the cutting edge of new 
technology.
<P>
	Our government believes in innovation. As we stated in our 
red book: ``For Canada comparative advantage now hinges not 
just on our natural resources, but on our technological prowess, 
our ability to be innovative''.
<P>
	One of the keys to this depends on a commitment to research. 
Better focused R and D is critical to our global competitiveness 
and economic growth. It is important for us to develop low cost 
processes and the new products we need to capture new markets.
<P>
	Just yesterday the minister announced that the Department of 
Agriculture and Agri-food is launching a $500,000 pilot project 
for a new program called the agri-food R and D matching 
investment initiative. The goal of this initiative is to encourage 
further industry investment in research, especially where 
increased market potential exists. This innovative way will 
provide up to $25 million over the next four years.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4171"> 4171 </A></B>
<P>
	In my riding I am proud to say that there are many examples of 
successful value added, community based initiatives. For 
example, the processing of hogs, chickens and fruits and 
vegetables can be found in communities throughout my riding.
<P>
	Furthermore, a biotechnology firm located in my riding, the 
Efamol Research Institute, is making great gains in the area of 
value added non-food products. The Efamol Research Institute 
is a world leader in the research of the medical benefits derived 
from the oil of evening primrose plants.
<P>
	I believe that as a government we must look to and work with 
the private sector to ensure that these companies are on the 
cutting edge of value added production.
<P>
	Closely related to our focus on value added production is our 
commitment to provide comprehensive support for farmers 
through improved access to capital and financing. Time and 
time again farmers in my riding have said that in the past they 
have felt shut out by governments. Income support programs 
have often been passive in nature and put together on a 
piecemeal basis.
<P>
<B>(1915 ) </B>
<P>
	Statistics clearly show that most family farm operations 
would not be financially viable unless there was off-farm 
income coming into the household. However farmers in my 
riding and across Canada have also said that they do not want to 
rely on government handouts. Instead, they want the security of 
stable markets and the knowledge that the government will 
support them in their efforts to take advantage of new market 
opportunities.
<P>
	Given these realities, we are redirecting our focus from 
providing merely a passive safety net to looking at 
comprehensive long term programs. We must ensure that these 
farms have access to the capital necessary to grow and to be 
competitive over the long term.
<P>
	In order to improve access to capital for farms, we will focus 
on providing long term stability through established bodies such 
as the Farm Credit Corporation. Initiatives that we are 
committed to include are a long term mortgage program that 
would transfer some of the risk of interest rate fluctuations from 
the borrower to the Farm Credit Corporation, a vendor loan 
guarantee aimed at improving the availability of reasonably 
priced long term capital, and the agricultural equity 
development program which would allow the FCC to lease land 
acquired by foreclosures. This would allow the FCC to assist in 
getting foreclosed farmers back on their feet.
<P>
	It is clear that farmers do not want us to repeat the policies of 
the past. They want to be masters of their own fate. They want 
government to help them with the tools that they need to be 
successful.
<P>
	I would like to turn briefly to the critical issue of supply 
management and orderly marketing. In the past, supply 
management has worked to stabilize farmers' revenues while 
ensuring the supply of top quality and healthy food products. 
However many farmers have expressed concern over how the 
GATT agreement will affect their ability to remain competitive.
<P>
	While we were not able to secure article XI during the GATT 
negotiations, we were able to ensure that a system of high tariffs 
will be put in place as a replacement to import quotas. In 
achieving this, we will be able to provide the necessary security 
for Canada's small farms and processors to remain competitive 
while they adjust to the new trade rules.
<P>
	In the meantime, the GATT also opens new markets for these 
same products. The minister has stated on many occasions that it 
is his goal to see our agriculture exports almost double to $20 
billion annually. In pursuing new international markets in such 
an aggressive manner, the government can ensure that Canada's 
rural communities will play an important role in generating 
economic growth.
<P>
	The <I>Financial Post</I> reported this morning that according to a 
study by the Agri-Food Competitiveness Council, Canadian 
producers have nothing to fear from worldwide trade. I believe 
that the agri-food sector in my riding and across Canada can be 
the best in the world. I am committed to working with them to 
ensure that they have every opportunity to reach their potential.
<P>
	With the GATT negotiations behind us, one of the biggest 
challenges facing our system of supply management is in the 
area of internal competition. More than ever there is a clear need 
for national and regional co-operation. In order to address this 
and other immediate challenges facing us, the parliamentary 
secretary has been working with a small task force.
<P>
	The mandate of this group is to determine how to make the 
necessary changes to Canada's orderly marketing system by 
making it flexible and viable over the long term. The task force 
has to this point consulted widely with all of the stakeholders. 
These groups must have a direct role to play in mapping out the 
future of supply management and orderly marketing in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1920 ) </B>
<P>
	There is no question that we face many challenges. There are 
no easy solutions, no quick fixes to the issues I have raised here 
today. As a government we have shown that we are up to the 
challenge before us: working with industry to set priorities, 
encouraging industry investment in technological development, 
investing in the skills of our people, and providing security and 
stability for small and medium sized farms and producers. These 
are the ways to keep the Canadian agri-food products 
competitive.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, just a brief comment for the hon. member. I appreciate 
very much the way he put on the record the concerns of his 
constituency. It is the kind of debate that I wished we had had all 
day. I know that he comes from an area where poultry is raised. I 
wonder if he shares the concern, as I do, about the recent 
disputes that we have had in the poultry sector of supply 
management. I am very concerned about that.
<P>
	I want to see that sector get together and resolve its internal 
problems. I am of the opinion that the greatest danger to supply 
management at the present time is not the GATT agreement that 
we have just signed, but the danger of the implosion that 
structures sometimes have once they get to a certain age. There 
is a maturity in the system now. It works well. However there is 
also the tendency for structures after a while to deteriorate and I 
want to know if he shares that concern with me.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murphy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question.
<P>
	I do share this concern. In my riding of Annapolis 
Valley-Hants we produce 78 per cent of all the poultry in Nova 
Scotia. What is happening with regard to the quota system, the 
lack of working together by the provinces to live up to the rules 
and regulations of our system is of major concern.
<P>
	As we know, there is an overproduction in two of the 
provinces and the overflow is coming to the east coast. 
Consequently the price of chicken in our area is going down and 
that is a real threat to the small business farms that are running 
the poultry industry.
<P>
	I share with the member the concern that we as a country are 
not now inundated with external problems, we have internal 
problems. The internal problems need to be worked out between 
the provinces. We need to sit down. We have to remember that 
we are a generous country that wants to survive from coast to 
coast. The poultry industry needs to survive but it will only 
survive if all of the provinces play by the rules and we find a 
consensus to work out our difficulties.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure this evening for me to rise and pay 
tribute to my hon. friend from Annapolis Valley-Hants for his 
very informative discussion on agriculture.
<P>
	Being a member of the standing committee on agriculture I 
take pride in being able to talk about the concerns of agriculture, 
specifically in Souris-Moose Mountain which is a very large 
rural riding in southeast Saskatchewan.
<P>
	One of the concerns we have is the movement of grain and the 
situation it poses for all of us. With this question in mind, it is 
necessary for us to take a look at the problems that have been 
created. We may have tarnished Canada's reputation as a 
reliable shipper and supplier of grains and oilseeds because of 
our inability to ship on time.
<P>
	There are some factors which severely challenge Canada's 
ability. We must meet the demands though. Our western 
agricultural community was built on exporting grains and 
oilseeds to overseas markets. Canada has built and maintained 
for over half a century an excellent reputation as a dependable 
supplier. We have high quality grains and oilseeds and because 
we have that reputation, we must work diligently to protect and 
maintain it. That is why the current situation concerning grain 
transportation needs to be addressed.
<P>
<B>(1925) </B>
<P>
	Canada's inability is causing some concern in our Asian 
markets, namely Japan and China. The government is not 
content to let this situation continue. Over the past few weeks we 
have seen at least 40 vessels tied up at the port of Vancouver. 
There are demurrage charges in the amount of $10 million.
<P>
	Where do those demurrage charges go back to? They go right 
back to the farmer, who is the person who is suffering most and 
yet must pay those costs. How about the cost of sales that are 
lost? The Canadian Wheat Board estimates that we have lost 
$280 million in sales because we do not deliver on time.
<P>
	Our customers look elsewhere to satisfy their needs. I know 
that Japanese canola customers have already looked to Australia 
and Europe for new suppliers. When a market is lost in Canada 
the farmers cannot afford it nor do they want to see it happen.
<P>
	The government is very concerned that the grain movement 
situation be placed as a high priority and that we work toward 
solutions. The issue is not simple. A number of factors have led 
to the shortfall in a number of rail cars. One is the movement of 
grain to southern markets and a turnaround time of possibly 40 
days. In most cases, it is at least two times the normal length of 
shipping time in Canadian markets.
<P>
	That rail car shortfall is due to several factors. The 
Mississippi flood caused the normal use of U.S. cars to be 
limited to us and we have had to turn to other means. The late 
harvest last year caused problems for us in moving our grains to 
the port of Thunder Bay and to the west coast.
<P>
	Unexpected increases in the movement of canola also created 
problems at Thunder Bay. The operation at country terminals 
because of the extreme cold weather in January and February 
caused additional problems. The work stoppage at the port of 
Vancouver did not help at all. A 13-day shutdown because of 
labour unrest caused the terminals back up.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4173"> 4173 </A></B>
<P>
	We are looking to solving these problems. How do we get 
weekend loading? How do we ensure that we can have seven 
days a week of service at those ports? However the key players 
in the grain and marketing industry realize there is a problem. I 
am confident that they are going to take a look at the turnaround 
time of the cars.
<P>
	Both railways have increased their budgets for maintenance. 
Railways have also modified their train service and have 
increased the switching budgets. CN has just added 765 boxcars 
from Hudson Bay into the Thunder Bay shipping area.
<P>
	Shippers have been allowed to bring in private cars. We have 
introduced an emergency trucking program, a subsidy through 
the Western Grains Transportation Act which will allow 
movement to Thunder Bay and to Vancouver. Therefore we are 
now looking to weekend loading and unloading, an efficiency in 
the system that we have not had for some time.
<P>
	Senior executive officers of railway grain transportation and 
of government are going to look at the problem. They are going 
to review the shortfalls for 1994-95. We have set up a human 
resources Canada commission to study the labour issues in 
western grain transportation. The report should be due in July.
<P>
	Clearly much has been done but much remains to be done. 
This problem cannot be solved by looking at one issue alone. 
More than rail cars are the problem for us.
<P>
<B>(1930 ) </B>
<P>
	The Canadian grain marketing system must continue to run 
efficiently in the face of the changing marketplace. Western 
Canada is now producing a different mix of grains and oilseeds 
and specialty crops. It is time we examined Canada's grain 
marketing system to look where the grain is going and determine 
whether the system is in place to make sure we get it there.
<P>
	Canada is now competing in a world market that has changed 
since last year. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is 
certainly going to change our way of marketing. The agreement 
means new marketing opportunities for Canada's grains and 
oilseeds throughout the world. A strong, efficient grain 
marketing system will continue to be the backbone of our 
industry. It is vital to ensure that kind of system takes us into the 
year 2000.
<P>
	Concerning grain marketing, handling and transportation, 
different groups and representatives from grain companies, 
railways, and labour unions involved in grain handling will be 
meeting in Winnipeg on May 16 to review the problem and 
hopefully come to some resolution. We look forward to an 
industry in which government along with the others in the 
system bring us a proper grain handling system for our oilseeds 
and our grains.
<P>
	I want to turn for a moment in the final part of my speech to 
review some matters in my riding.
<P>
	In Weyburn an ethanol plant is proposed to come on stream. 
Moosomin would like to see one come on stream. In Kipling, 
pork producers are looking to introduce a new breed. In 
Broadview we have a maple syrup program, a wood products 
future and ethanol. Inland Terminal is certainly a major impact 
on the Weyburn area. The PMU farms in southeast 
Saskatchewan are growing, but they need protection. They need 
some assurance that we will support them. PMU stands for 
pregnant mare urine.
<P>
	Our specialty crops continue to be enhanced. However, we are 
facing a rural decline in southeast Saskatchewan. Added to that 
is the fact that Saskatchewan along with Atlantic Canada has the 
largest amount of debt in the agricultural sector which is a deep, 
deep concern.
<P>
	We want to ensure that we have a whole farm safety net 
program to deal with the debts, to help the people who are 
working the farms of southeast Saskatchewan move forward.
<P>
	Saskatoon has one of the most outstanding research centres in 
the biotechnical field in Canada and certainly in the world. It has 
just introduced sunola which is a new sunflower oil. There are 
100,000 acres under production. That particular crop is certainly 
going to enhance the viability of farming in Saskatchewan.
<P>
	In closing I deem it a privilege to speak on behalf of the 
agricultural program that our government has put forward. It is 
very forward looking. It is going to take us into the future.
<P>
	On behalf of the rural community of southeast Saskatchewan 
it has been a pleasure for me to rise in this House and speak in 
this debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened closely to the remarks of the hon. member for 
Souris-Moose Mountain. I share with him responsibilities for 
many farmers in the province of Saskatchewan. Many of them 
are looking in this spring of hope to an opportunity to have a 
much better year than they had previously, both financially and 
cropwise.
<P>
	The hon. member in his remarks commented on the problems 
of transportation and moving the grain to ports. I am wondering 
if the member is aware that the railways have fallen short of 
their requirements in terms of shipping.
<P>
	In fact, I understand in the second quarter of the current crop 
year railways reached only 75 per cent of their targets on 
shipments to the west coast and 82 per cent of their targets to 
Thunder Bay. The Western Grain Transportation Act allows for 
penalties to be applied to the railways should they fall short of 
their commitments or targets.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4174"> 4174 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1935 ) </B>
<P>
	Would the member for Souris-Moose Mountain agree that 
perhaps the federal government should examine imposing the 
penalty clauses of the WGTA at this time when, as we realize, 
they have never been applied in the past?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collins:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member 
opposite for the question on transportation.
<P>
	I can say to the hon. member being on the subcommittee on 
agriculture and transportation and looking at that very important 
question he raised, one of the features was that particular point.
<P>
	When railways are not meeting expectations and their 
delivery quotas there should be some redress. Some penalties 
should be put in place to encourage them to work efficiently or 
pay the costs.
<P>
	One of the problems I had was that if it was going to be in the 
form of a demurrage and the railways were going to charge it 
back I kept asking the others who it was going to be charged back 
to. If it was going to go back to the farmers then I would not 
support it. Their position was, and I am sure we will see it come 
forward as a recommendation, that where railways do not meet 
and follow through with their production quotas there should be 
a penalty in place.
<P>
	I certainly understand what the hon. member is saying. I think 
that will likely come forward as a recommendation from the 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Moose Jaw-Lake Centre):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to advise the chair that I will be sharing my time 
with the member for Fraser Valley East.
<P>
	I am pleased to participate today on this long awaited debate 
on agriculture. It is the first time in the four months of this 
Parliament's sitting that we have had a government sponsored 
debate on agriculture. It is good to see that our friends opposite 
have cranked up their tractors and are heading out to the fields to 
do some work.
<P>
	Farmers across our country are busy with their spring work 
and seeding. New seed is going into the ground. I believe that as 
farmers drive up and down the fields in their tractors their radios 
are tuned into the news to see if there are any new ideas and any 
new initiatives coming forth from Ottawa this spring about 
farming.
<P>
	It is time for new ideas and new approaches to agriculture in 
Canada. Old ideas, like old seed, will not produce the results we 
need. The basic new idea we need in agriculture is that 
government must get out of the way of farmers. Farmers do not 
want government as their major partner in business. They 
realize the way to solutions for our problems is to open up the 
process and let farmers take control of their own destiny. Let 
farmers determine and choose the solutions. Let them get 
involved directly about how they want to produce, process, 
insure, transport and sell their crops.
<P>
	I want to focus my remarks today on new ideas about some 
safety nets and also touch on the farm debt problem as it relates 
to the Farm Credit Corporation. There is no question that 
farming is a high risk business, perhaps more so than any other 
industry. We face matters over which we have very little control. 
There are basically three of them: trade distorting influences, 
market cycles, and good old mother nature.
<P>
	On this matter of dealing with mother nature there was some 
discussion by farmers in my riding during the election campaign 
last fall as to whether the weather was provincial or federal 
responsibility. It was finally decided it must be federal because 
it does cross provincial borders.
<P>
	New ideas are needed as to how to make adjustments in light 
of the GATT and the NAFTA so that we can take full advantage 
of new market opportunities.
<P>
	There have been some gripes about GRIP in my home 
province of Saskatchewan, so much so we have given notice that 
we are withdrawing from the program after the 1994 crop year. 
Why is this? Because farmers right across our province think it 
is a lousy, useless program. Some of their main concerns are that 
it has declining support levels, the premiums are too high, there 
is a lack of producer consultation in developing it and the 
payment process is too long.
<P>
	Saskatchewan has the largest number of producers in the 
program of any province in Canada, some 42,000 when it started 
in 1993 and an insured acreage of some 23 million acres. Our 
involvement was almost twice that of any other province, but we 
are pulling out. For the most highly involved province to do so 
makes a big statement about the need for the program to be 
scrapped after only three years of operation.
<P>
<B>(1940) </B>
<P>
	It is a tremendously highly bureaucratic program. The 
program works by building on conventional crop insurance by 
offering producers a form of revenue insurance. Producers are 
provided with a guaranteed target revenue. Indemnities are paid 
throughout the crop year and are triggered when the value of an 
eligible crop falls short of the target revenue. The premiums are 
shared by federal and provincial governments as well as 
producers.
<P>
	In the event that the premium income and accumulated 
reserves are insufficient to cover indemnity to payments to 
producers, the federal and provincial governments share the 
deficit financing. Deficit financing. I do not like to say those 
two words. Deficits are financed 65 per cent by the federal 
government and 35 per cent by the provincial government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4175"> 4175 </A></B>
<P>
	Does that sound bureaucratic? I believe it does. Well it is, at 
least according to most of the farmers I talked to, and the results 
are predictable. As of March 31, 1993 there were outstanding 
interest bearing advances of $64 million. The program is in the 
red.
<P>
	What are we proposing for this revenue insurance for 
farmers? Reformers have always believed that GRIP should be 
discontinued. We believe it inhibits farmers' abilities to 
compete. It discourages good land stewardship and is market 
distorting. It promotes producer dependence and is in violation 
of international trade rules. The implementation of streamlined 
comprehensive safety nets is a priority for ensuring necessary 
stability in all sectors of agriculture. This Reform process must 
be based on trust by providing for direct stakeholder 
consultation.
<P>
	I want to touch on some of the problems of farm debt as it 
relates to the Farm Credit Corporation. The Farm Credit 
Corporation mandate states that the purpose of the FCC is to 
enhance rural Canada by providing specialized and personalized 
financial services to farming operations and to those businesses 
in rural Canada that are related to farming.
<P>
	That is a very honourable mandate, but if one goes out into the 
country and listens to farmers talk about the FCC. one realizes 
this mandate is not being achieved. Farmers in my riding tell me 
that when it comes to dealing with this government organization 
it is much more difficult than dealing with the chartered banks or 
credit unions. I have heard horror story after horror story of 
unrelenting badgering by Farm Credit Corporation officials as 
they give their brand of personal service to farmers.
<P>
	For example, last week I had a call from a farmer in my riding 
who had leased back his farm from the Farm Credit Corporation 
after FCC had taken it away from him. The deadline to pay his 
lease was May 2. He was in arrears by some $12,500. The Farm 
Credit Corporation would have been completely justified in 
taking back the land on May 2. On May 1 he called me and told 
me he had some private backing available to pay one-third of his 
arrears on May 2 and the balance by certified cheque on May 31. 
This sounded completely reasonable to me and a solution to the 
problem.
<P>
	He asked me to act on his behalf with the Farm Credit 
Corporation. After explaining the position to both the case 
worker and the regional manager, I came away frustrated and 
very angry. They both told me they were not interested in his 
proposal and they were only interested in doing business with 
someone who would pay. It is not that this farmer would not pay; 
it is that he could not pay.
<P>
	The bottom line here is that we will lose a 55-year old farmer 
who has little or no chance of any other career in rural 
Saskatchewan. Now the corporation has no chance of ever 
recouping this farmer's back rent. He most likely will end up on 
social assistance.
<P>
	These two bureaucrats told me they had to be more fiscally 
responsible to Farm Credit Corporation. That to me is not very 
fiscally responsible. We had the chance to save a farmer, if only 
for the short term, yet we chose to play God with another farm 
family's life.
<P>
	These are the kinds of stories I hear on a regular basis in my 
province. At times I am embarrassed to be part of a government 
that deals so heavy-handedly with people's lives. If it were 
within my power a noise would have been heard all across this 
country last week. That noise would have been the heads rolling 
in the Farm Credit Corporation in Regina. My question is: Do we 
as a government have any business in the banking business? I 
think not.
<P>
<B>(1945) </B>
<P>
	As I mentioned before farmers want to be able to control their 
own destiny. All they ask for are fair rules and a level playing 
field. If we look at government spending on agriculture in the 
past we see that we have spent adequate dollars. A budget of 
somewhere in the neighbourhood of $2.5 billion is not by any 
means insignificant. What we need to do is spend smarter, not 
necessarily more. The government must be prepared to show 
leadership in developing farm programs by farmers for farmers.
<P>
	In conclusion, there are not many things a farmer cannot fix if 
he can get his hands on them. Let us get the farmers in on this 
discussion this year and let the seeds of common sense that have 
made our country great bring forth the harvest of an industry that 
will be second to none in the entire world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I noted with interest the comments of my fellow 
member from Saskatchewan. He highlighted, in particular at the 
end of his speech, the common sense in making sure we have 
farmers working together.
<P>
	In light of that and knowing that the parliamentary secretary 
had an opportunity to contact 180 different groups to take a look 
at supply management and other features, I think that is a 
positive step. I am glad he mentioned there is a direction we can 
move in.
<P>
	With regard to GRIP, he mentioned that GRIP should be 
scrapped, should be done away with. Yet when we look at other 
parts of Canada, other provinces, we find it working well. It is a 
useful mechanism that will be continued.
<P>
	Why is the problem in Saskatchewan so different from the rest 
of Canada in relation to GRIP? Maybe he could identify the 
problems that created it, other than just saying let us get rid of 
the whole program when I know other provinces are saying no 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4176"> 4176 </A></B>
<P>
and that they think there are some benefits to the program. I 
wonder if the hon. member could respond.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kerpan:</B> Mr. Speaker, first I would like to mention on the 
subject of farmer consultation that I encourage the government 
to become more involved in it. What we will see happening is 
that farmers, the stakeholders who can take part in the decision, 
will get behind whoever is in power at the particular time if they 
have the opportunity to become real players in the discussion.
<P>
	If the hon. member wants to talk about GRIP, if we look only 
at the numbers we see that Saskatchewan makes up half or more 
of the participants. That in itself says something to me. If we 
talk to farmers in western Canada, and I speak mainly about 
Saskatchewan because that is my area and that is where I do my 
work, they tell us for the reasons I said that it does not work. 
There is no farmer consultation. It is too heavily bureaucratic. It 
takes up to 18 months to get final payments.
<P>
	It is simply not the answer given the problems we see today. It 
is too expensive for federal and provincial governments and the 
producers. The negatives far outweigh the benefits of the 
program. It simply was never a good program to start with. It 
only took us two years in Saskatchewan to realize that. It just has 
to go. There is no question about it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a question which I have divided into two short 
parts.
<P>
	The first part is on GRIP. In 1991 when the previous 
government brought in GRIP my colleagues in the NDP in the 
House and I were among a very few who spoke against GRIP and 
predicted many of the problems that have beset the program ever 
since.
<P>
	We were criticized quite heavily throughout Saskatchewan 
and elsewhere by farmers who did not support the NDP 
generally. We were criticized because the farm economy was in 
such bad shape that farmers were prepared to accept any 
program that would provide them with some very quick relief. 
Certainly we admit the first year of GRIP provided some 
incredible relief for Saskatchewan and other farmers. We realize 
many producers, in the atmosphere of needing money in 
1990-91, were prepared to accept the program they knew was 
not going to be acceptable in the long term.
<P>
<B>(1950) </B>
<P>
	The member referred earlier to the Reform always being 
against GRIP. Where were their members in 1991 in 
Saskatchewan when the program was being promoted by the 
Conservative Party to the support of many farmers in 
Saskatchewan?
<P>
	The second point I wanted to make with regard to the Farm 
Credit Corporation-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> When members have split 
their time I know 10-minute interventions with 5-minute 
question and comments are very short.
<P>
	However I ask the member for Moose Jaw-Lake Centre to 
reply to the first question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kerpan:</B> Mr. Speaker, with regard to the GRIP question, 
one of the other elements that has made it a negative or poor 
program from our point of view has been that it has been open to 
abuse by farmers. It encourages poor farming practices. That is 
one thing that has been very negative about it.
<P>
	I will not take any more time, except to say that in 1991 there 
were no Reform members of Parliament in Saskatchewan. Had 
there been we would certainly have been aligned with the NDP 
on that particular point.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
addressing a subject that concerns 36,000 agricultural producers 
in Canada. The topic is vital because each one has a vital stake in 
a set of rules that govern their agricultural production. We call 
these rules the supply management system.
<P>
	Supply management has been kind to the producers of my own 
constituency. We have a healthy industry in the Fraser Valley 
that has contributed much to our community.
<P>
	Agricultural activity continues to be the backbone of the 
Chilliwack-Abbotsford area. I would be remiss if I did not 
mention another agricultural mainstay of my riding, so I want to 
speak for a moment on the federal agricultural research station 
located in Agassiz, B.C., which for decades has served our dairy 
community. Unfortunately its role in the future of the 
agricultural industry has been threatened of late.
<P>
	For a while we heard false rumours that the station was to be 
closed. Then we heard that the station's dairy herd was moving 
to the unlikely town of Oyster River on Vancouver Island, a 
place far removed from the Fraser Valley and the mainstay of the 
industry, where new facilities would have to be built and feed 
transported at a tremendous cost. Not only that, the milk would 
have to be transported off Vancouver Island back to the 
mainland. It did not make a lot of sense.
<P>
	We further heard that the University of British Columbia was 
willing to move its experimental herd to Agassiz and build a 
research facility there but that it would follow the station's dairy 
herd to Oyster River if the station chose to relocate it there. We 
brought the matter up with the minister and his parliamentary 
secretary. I would like to thank them for placing the relocation 
process on hold pending further investigation. I am confident 
that once the facts are all out on the table the Agassiz dairy herd 
should have a solid place in our research future.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4177"> 4177 </A></B>
<P>
	I shared these details so that my constituents might be clear 
about the situation. I publicly urge the minister to make every 
effort to resolve the impasse among the local producers, the 
processors and the officials at the station or in Ottawa. I stand 
ready to assist in bringing the parties together so that the dairy 
community and the local community will continue to benefit 
from the research herd remaining in Agassiz and benefit from 
the university's significant contribution. That is our local 
situation.
<P>
	I also want to touch on the national supply management 
problem that we cannot ignore. The problem is that our system 
has been abruptly challenged by a larger set of trading rules. 
These new rules operate on a global basis. They operate between 
nations, not within nations. The new rules are the free trade 
agreement, the NAFTA and the GATT. These agreements 
threaten to swamp our national rules and thus affect the 
livelihood of many thousands of producers.
<P>
	The old rules are like a river that has cut a deep channel over 
the years. With each passing year the river's course has become 
deeper and more resistant to change. Once our supply 
management system was instituted economic interests were 
channelled in a specific direction and financial interests are now 
deeply entrenched.
<P>
	A new channel is being cut by the outside world and we have 
little choice but to direct our economic river into the mainstream 
of the world's economy. Our supply managed sectors are 
realizing the need to explore new markets and to develop new 
products for the global economy of the future. The streams that 
fed our made in Canada agricultural policy have been rerouted. 
Our supply managed sectors must change with the times.
<P>
<B>(1955) </B>
<P>
	The major obstacle to change is the economic interests that I 
mentioned earlier. The winners for the last 20 years, the 
producers and the processors within the supply management 
industry, may stand to lose some of their security when the rules 
change.
<P>
	The rules of the old game are written by an old name in 
Canada. Pierre Trudeau promised a national supply management 
system in 1970 and the Liberal Party has defended it ever since. 
Even as recently as last year's election period Liberal candidates 
were still holding on to the past insisting that article XI(2)(c) 
regarding import quotas would be strengthened and clarified 
under the GATT arrangement they promised to producers. The 
flip-flop immediately after the election reinforced my belief 
that the Liberals were not being frank with the agricultural 
community.
<P>
	Political gamesmanship does not go over very well with the 
agricultural community. Saying one thing while doing another is 
guaranteed to raise their ire and raise their concerns as it should. 
It is a case of once bitten twice shy, and the supply managed 
industry is checking for bite marks as we speak. This time it 
needs to know  the facts, not the wishful thinking, so it can start 
planning its future.
<P>
	For example, the task force on the future of supply 
management calls on the system to become ``fully market 
responsive''. Yet the whole weight of the report focuses on 
preserving the system, a system that is not fundamentally 
market responsive. There is a contradiction here. Which will it 
be: status quo or market driven?
<P>
	New interests are arising in Canada. They are the producers 
who have been waiting many years to get into the system but 
have been legally barred from doing so because they could not 
afford to buy the right to produce. What is their status? There are 
consumers as well, consumers who have paid higher prices for 
food products for over 20 years to ensure a steady supply and to 
ensure that producers within the system received an adequate 
price that they have set for themselves.
<P>
	There is also a new political party that gives voice to those 
previously shut out of the system. The Reform Party of Canada 
is the new political vehicle for the average consumer and the 
average producer who wants to grow, sell and buy agricultural 
goods without unnecessary government interference; those who 
want to buy quality food at more competitive prices; and those 
who want to produce it, not only for Canada but for the global 
marketplace.
<P>
	This is not to say that current producers are doing something 
wrong. Far from it. We have an excellent, productive industry 
producing the highest quality food in the world. However 
Reformers insist that the world economy is forcing change upon 
us. To resist that change is not possible. It will harm us in the 
long term. We must not obstruct inevitable change, but we must 
construct that change so that the transition from a managed to a 
less managed system will continue to be orderly. We want to 
avoid financial hardship for the supply managed sectors. We 
must lay out a workable, innovative work plan for all the 
stakeholders and then stick to it.
<P>
	This problem also touches on national unity. As members may 
be aware, agricultural production was increased during World 
War II to serve the allies overseas. After the war the supply 
management system froze the allocation of quota at historic 
levels of production. Quebec, for instance, produced a lot of 
milk during the war. Today it still produces almost half of all 
industrialized milk in Canada. The right to do so is protected by 
law.
<P>
	Quebec is not about to give up its share of the markets in other 
parts of Canada now, even though it is obviously inefficient to 
ship butter and other milk products to B.C. instead of producing 
it right in B.C. Allocating production through political decisions 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4178"> 4178 </A></B>
<P>
is another fundamental inefficiency. We will not survive in the 
world economy unless we are able to increase our efficiency.
<P>
	I have a special word of caution for my friends in the Bloc. At 
least within the national system farmers in Quebec can bargain 
to retain their production rights, but what if Quebec opts out of 
Canada? Would Canadian producers gladly accept Quebec's 
produce when producers all over the country are clamouring to 
increase their production to serve their local populations?
<P>
	Quebec's privilege within the system has been maintained at 
least in part to preserve national unity and that incentive would 
disappear if Quebec separated from Canada. Quebec would lose 
the market share it currently enjoys within the Canadian system 
and western producers would happily move quickly to fill that 
market share.
<P>
<B>(2000 ) </B>
<P>
	Farmers all over Quebec would suddenly have to scramble to 
sell their produce. They would not be able to sell all of the 
excess in the United States. They would have to look at overseas 
markets. The adjustment would be painful indeed. Agriculture 
in Quebec may be permanently stunted as a result.
<P>
	The industry can co-operate together on a national basis to 
find an orderly way to convert to a less regulated market, a way 
that would be fair to producers and benefit consumers all across 
this great land. One thing the government can do is promote 
more agricultural exports that would allow increases in 
production over present quota allocations.
<P>
	We commend the efforts of the Minister for International 
Trade to increase exports and we urge the minister of agriculture 
to follow his lead and work harder to develop these export 
markets.
<P>
	I have another example to illustrate that. The cruise ships that 
dock in Vancouver recently wanted to buy 20,000 dozen eggs 
from a B.C. processor-producer but finally gave up trying to get 
the necessary permission from the marketing board to supply 
them. The eggs were finally shipped from the United States and 
we lost that market.
<P>
	This kind of rigidity is no longer acceptable. We must take 
advantage of the opportunities available to us in the 
marketplace. Let us hope that Ontario's recent decision to boost 
chicken production is a sign of a positive change in attitude. 
Indeed, we must allow all agricultural sectors to be market 
responsive.
<P>
	Right now producers and processors collaborate to set their 
own prices using a complex cost of production formula but the 
market, not producers and processors, should set the prices for 
these products. We can help by including all supply managed 
sectors in the government's whole farm income stabilization 
plan. This would be a safety net based on total farm income 
applying to all farmers.
<P>
	The managed sectors need to embrace this whole farm plan 
even though it would expose producers to market prices which 
might be lower than the supply managed prices they calculate 
for themselves. If the supply managed sectors are allowed to opt 
out of the whole farm alternative and continue on as at present, a 
GATT panel may rule against them and once again Canada could 
suffer trade penalties as a result. We could also suffer the 
insecurity of once again throwing this whole supply managed 
system into the wind.
<P>
	Our producers cannot escape change. The old ways are no 
longer the best ways. It is time for us to free up our internal 
markets to include more producers and processors and benefit 
Canadian consumers, to strike down interprovincial barriers to 
trade, to capitalize on our nation's abundant agricultural 
potential by increasing production for markets all over the 
world.
<P>
	As Reformers have said for years now, give Canadians the 
tools of deregulation, give farmers the freedom to make 
economic decisions without interference and they will do the job 
of competing with the best in the world for price and quality.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murray Calder 
(Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with a lot of interest to the member's comments. I 
cannot say that I agree with all of them.
<P>
	I am a poultry producer and I work under supply management. 
There are a few things I would like to clarify before I ask my 
question. First, if you go to the supermarket and take a look at 
the meat shelf, you will find that poultry is probably the most 
inexpensive buy on the shelf.
<P>
	As a poultry producer, I make <I>x</I> dollars during the year 
because I have <I>x</I> number of chickens that I can grow. If I find 
ways of bringing my overhead costs down, I up my profit 
margins. That is what makes my industry so efficient.
<P>
	It is a stable industry under supply management. A stable 
industry has money to put into research and development. As I 
said previously today, in the early 1950s it took 14 to 16 weeks 
to raise a four pound bird. A male bird now can be raised to that 
same weight in 37 days. That is research and development. That 
is from a stable industry.
<P>
	The member suggests we are going to do away with supply 
management. We are not because we replaced import quotas 
with tariffs that effectively protect the industry within Canada. I 
would caution the member that as we look at lowering provincial 
barriers across the country, this national board will replace that 
same job.
<P>
<B>(2005 ) </B>
<P>
	We have to take a look at what happened in the United States. 
In 1958 Tyson Foods vertically integrated. We are talking about 
rural Canada. The strength of rural Canada is its farmers. Tyson 
Foods vertically integrated. Eighty per cent of the chicken 
production that was  bordered along Canada went to the south 
central states. I know because I bought up some of that surplus 
equipment for my farming operation. It went dirt cheap. These 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4179"> 4179 </A></B>
<P>
guys could not survive because of overhead costs and the price 
that they were getting for their poultry.
<P>
	Within our industry we have health standards which the 
United States does not even come close to. A declassed bird in 
the United States is 60 per cent bruising and is sold off of the 
shelf. You will not see that here in Canada. We have pride in the 
products that we are putting forward.
<P>
	Our farmers were protected under the GATT because the 
levels were set high enough to protect the industry. We have an 
efficient and stable industry under supply management which is 
putting forward an inexpensive food product.
<P>
	I guess I have to ask the hon. member: What more do you 
want?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I can tell you what we want. We 
want consistency.
<P>
	I was reading a pamphlet from the election period. It happens 
to be one of mine. Perhaps that is why I was reading it. We said 
all along during the negotiations for GATT that we would be 
replacing article XI 2(c) with appropriate and equivalent 
tariffication.
<P>
	We were raked over the coals incessantly, consistently, 
persistently by members like the one opposite who said that that 
was an unworkable option, that it would not work, that we were 
trying to destroy the industry.
<P>
	Perhaps I could read just a brief bit here. It states: ``All of the 
other political parties are supporting a contradictory trade 
position. They are calling for the elimination of export subsidies 
by other countries but they want to strength article XI 2(c) which 
permits Canada to impose import quotas. Reformers are asking, 
what will the other parties do if they are faced with signing a 
GATT agreement, which includes tariffication of access 
restrictions? What will they do?''
<P>
	I fought incessant battles in my own riding because we said 
we would prepare farmers for the 21st century. We said: ``Let's 
not kid ourselves''. One of the stories I get now from my farmers 
back home where I have a lot of supply management is: ``At 
least you told the truth during the election and not only that at 
least I can trust you to plan for the future''. They feel very let 
down that they were promised something that was undeliverable 
during the campaign by the Liberal Party. Now they are having 
to try to readjust mid-course, midstream in that river I was 
talking about. They are nervous now about what the next thing 
might be.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Revenue):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to advise at the 
beginning that I will be splitting my time with the hon. member 
for Lambton-Middlesex.
<P>
	I want to start today with an article that appeared in this 
morning's <I>Globe and Mail</I>: ``Thomas Homer-Dixon notes that 
the current crisis in Rwanda is in part being driven by severe 
land and food scarcity''. He further wrote: ``Rwanda has eight 
million people crammed into an area the size of Vermont. Its 
population doubles every five years. Extreme nutrient depletion 
affects the soil in half the country and agricultural production 
per capita fell by almost 20 per cent between 1980 and 1990. The 
land competition fuels the vicious ethnic animosity between 
Hutus and Tutsis and the collapse of civil order has made the 
country incapable of dealing with underlying scarcity and 
population problems''.
<P>
	This clearly underlines why agriculture, no matter how much 
we talk of the new economy of the electronic revolution, is and 
always will be of central importance. Without food we cannot 
have peace. Without peace we cannot have food.
<P>
	That is why we called our agricultural paper ``Food security 
for Canadians and a fair return for Canadian farmers''. Food 
security for Canadians and a fair return for farmers are the 
cornerstones of this government's agricultural policy.
<P>
	In order to achieve that, and I quote from the red book: ``The 
government is committed to achieving the full potential of the 
Canadian agri-food sector by developing new markets and 
maintaining existing ones while capitalizing on economic 
opportunities for value added regional development. Producers 
across this country have told us many times that they do not want 
their livelihoods to be dependent on government handouts. They 
do not want any special treatment. What they want is the 
opportunity to derive their income from the marketplace. One of 
this government's top priorities in this regard is to ensure that all 
Canadian producers-that is all Canadian producers-enjoy fair 
and unrestricted access to those marketplaces at home, within 
North America and abroad. This is why trade has been such an 
important issue in agriculture since the day this government 
took office last fall.
<P>
<B>(2010) </B>
<P>
	This government strongly believes that Canada has the 
products, the expertise and the technology to compete and win in 
any market. But in order to do that, Canadians must not be 
prevented from getting to the starting line.
<P>
	To ensure that the federal government is working on a number 
of fronts to secure greater market access for Canadian producers 
and to do that since last October, the single most dominant issue 
for this government and for Canada's agri-food sector has been 
international trade.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4180"> 4180 </A></B>
<P>
	It began with the conclusion of the Uruguay round of 
multilateral trade negotiations under the GATT after seven years 
of negotiations. Under GATT member countries will reduce 
agri-food export subsidies by 21 per cent by volume and 36 per 
cent by value over a period of six years. As greater disciplines 
are brought to bear on such price distorting programs as the U.S. 
export enhancement program and the European union's common 
agricultural policy, international prices for grains and oilseeds 
should gradually improve over time.
<P>
	It is true that we did not get everything we wanted in Geneva. 
As we entered the negotiations late in the game it was not 
possible to build enough support for a strengthened and clarified 
article XI 2(c). We were, however, able to negotiate tariffs 
which will enable supply management to continue to exist as an 
effective Canadian approach to producing and marketing dairy, 
egg and poultry products.
<P>
	We have not stopped there, however. To assist this sector with 
these adjustments a federal-provincial industry task force on 
orderly marketing has been established. Its mandate is to consult 
with all affected sectors of the industry, to develop co-operative 
processes to deal with the new rules in advance of the GATT 
implementation in 1995.
<P>
	Under the task force five ad hoc review committees have been 
established for the dairy, chicken, broiler hatching eggs, turkey 
and egg industries. These committees will help draft a task force 
report to be submitted to the national and provincial agriculture 
ministers when they meet in Winnipeg in July.
<P>
	As well, the U.S. is our largest trading partner. In 1991 
Canada exported $11 billion worth of agricultural product to the 
world, of which $4.7 billion was exported to the United States. 
However, the federal government is also pursuing improved 
market access with the United States. Under the free trade 
agreement the last government promised guaranteed access, but 
we all know what we got was guaranteed harassment. That is 
why I support the minister's promise to push these negotiations 
to the wall.
<P>
	This government has made it clear to the Americans that there 
will not be a deal unless it is a good deal for Canada. That means 
a good deal for the grains, processing and supply managed 
sectors. We will not trade off the interests of one for another.
<P>
	Canada will continue the dialogue as long as necessary in 
order to reach a satisfactory conclusion. It has been made very 
clear to the United States that if it proceeds with recent threats 
regarding unilateral actions Canada will have no choice but to 
respond in kind. We are fully prepared to follow through in this 
area.
<P>
	I would like to now turn to marketing. This government is 
committed to achieving the full potential of the Canadian 
agri-food sector by developing new markets and maintaining 
existing ones. To help the sector take advantage of new trade 
opportunities the  government has created a new branch of 
Agriculture and Agri-food Canada, market and industry 
services. This new branch has offices in all provinces and will 
work with industry to increase its share of both domestic and 
international markets. It is through increasing the sector's 
ability to meet customer demands that we will be achieving our 
goal of providing financial security for Canadian farm families 
and jobs for the Canadian agri-food sector.
<P>
<B>(2015) </B>
<P>
	In Essex County, my home county, we can grow any product 
grown in the world. Farmers in my area in conjunction with the 
Windsor-Essex Development Commission have taken their 
own steps to prepare a marketing plan for the future. They 
started by conducting a comprehensive survey to identify those 
areas in which they can excel. Their goal is to identify markets 
and to find areas where we can substitute imported product for 
domestic product.
<P>
	For example, one of the findings of the commission was 
although in my region there are five wineries, 60 per cent of the 
grape juice concentrate is imported from outside of the region 
from areas such as Chile, Europe and California. Those varieties 
of grapes could be grown in Essex County and we could 
substitute local product for imported product.
<P>
	The survey also found that there is a need to identify market 
niches and corresponding products that local producers can add 
value to before export. Both of these ideas tie in with two items 
the minister spoke of this morning.
<P>
	The minister of agriculture told the House that we must listen 
carefully to what the market is saying and not just try to sell 
what we produce now but produce what the market wants to buy. 
To that end the federal government has 55 trade commissioners 
and commercial officers working on agri-food trade 
development in more than 150 foreign markets. This includes 18 
agri-food specialists.
<P>
	To further assist us at home an agri-food industry council will 
be established later this year to advise on processes to improve 
Canada's market strengths, promote economic growth and 
create jobs.
<P>
	The minister also spoke this morning of his role in rural 
renewal. It is clear, as a survey in my area found, that it is not 
good enough just to export raw product but we must export 
further processed products where the value is added in Canada. 
It is through such further processing that we can renew our rural 
areas. This will create jobs in these areas by keeping more 
dollars circulating within our communities as well as bring 
greater amounts of money into Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4181"> 4181 </A></B>
<P>
	Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada is also working in 
co-operation with other federal departments and provinces to 
establish a single window marketing service for Canadian 
industry. A single window service will provide access to 
programs such as the agri-food industry marketing strategy 
program which helps agri-food associations develop and 
implement marketing plans, or the new getting ready to go 
global program which provides cost shared assistance to food 
and beverage processors to develop new strategies and 
initiatives.
<P>
	In addition to easing restrictive barriers through trade 
agreements and providing market service and information to 
industry, the government is also constantly seeking out new 
markets and working to maintain and improve existing markets. 
This government is also looking to Asia for new markets and 
opportunities.
<P>
	A concrete example of this is the minister's recent two week 
trade mission to the Asia Pacific. Accompanied by the Governor 
General, the minister headed a delegation that included 15 
Canadian farm leaders and agribusiness officials.
<P>
	Canada has some of the most productive land in the world. 
The article by Thomas Homer Dixon which I referred to earlier 
warns that a world food crisis is pending. A recent report of the 
International Food Policy Research Institute notes that grain 
production per capita has been flat since 1980. Canada has a 
responsibility to ensure that we protect our land so we can help 
feed a hungry world. The best way to do that is to protect our 
farmers. In doing so we will protect ourselves.
<P>
	In conclusion, if one looks at the situation in the former 
Yugoslavia and if one asks the people there what they wanted 
more than anything, I believe they would ask for the two things 
we have in great abundance in Canada, bread and peace. The 
power expressed in the idea of bread and peace is fundamental. 
It was a promise of bread and peace that allowed the Bolsheviks 
to overtake Russia in 1917.
<P>
	It is our abundance of bread and peace that underpinned our 
economic prosperity in the past and we must never forget its 
importance to our future.
<P>
	Now we must move forward to implement an agricultural 
policy that ensures our future prosperity.
<P>
<B>(2020) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would first 
like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of National revenue on her speech. Allow me to make a 
comment and perhaps ask a few questions that will be included 
in my comment.
<P>
	In her introduction, the hon. member explained to us that, in 
order to achieve a certain level of peace in the world, it was 
necessary for us to provide underdeveloped countries with 
products such as agricultural products, agri-food products, et 
cetera. Then she told us that we should assist our farmers in 
developing and rationalizing  their production precisely to 
enable Canada to find new markets and develop them and to 
ensure that our farmers receive adequate income.
<P>
	I would like to ask the parliamentary secretary, first, where 
does she see these new markets? Where could Canada direct this 
agri-food sector? And I would also ask her the following 
question: Has the party she represents re-examined its position 
or done a post mortem on the way in which the recent 
agreements were arrived at, agreements that were achieved with 
difficulty in the case of the GATT and, of course, the free trade 
agreement? Will we follow the same model to develop or 
interest or negotiate with other countries with regard to 
agri-food?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Whelan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comments.
<P>
	Briefly I mentioned that in my riding we have five wineries. 
We know we could produce grapes locally. We know that is a 
market in my area that we need to expand on and should expand 
on.
<P>
	I also mentioned that the minister spent two weeks on a trade 
mission in the Asia Pacific. That is an area that his department is 
looking into for new opportunities.
<P>
	I believe that every government learns from past experiences 
in negotiating future agreements and this government has 
learned from what has happened in GATT in the last seven years 
and from the free trade agreement. In the next agreements we 
negotiate we will take that experience with us.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am delighted to stand in the House today and respond to this 
government's motion in support of Canadian agriculture. To the 
extent that this is a wide ranging debate, I hope to touch on a 
number of issues which are directly impacted by federal 
agricultural policies.
<P>
	The primary industry in my riding of Lambton-Middlesex is 
agriculture. Stats show that nearly three-quarters of a billion 
dollars worth of farm products are produced in Lambton and 
Middlesex counties and more than half a billion dollars worth of 
farm supplies and equipment are purchased.
<P>
	All of us in this House recognize that the production, sale and 
trade of agriculture produce is becoming more and more subject 
to both the constraints and opportunities that exist within the 
highly competitive nature of international trade.
<P>
	Over the past couple of years more monumental changes have 
taken place in the field of international agriculture trade, 
necessitating some fairly radical adjustments to Canada's 
domestic structures. To that extent I have to say that the farmers 
of my riding who sell their products under Canada's supply 
management system were extremely disappointed that Canada 
was 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4182"> 4182 </A></B>
<P>
unable to secure a strengthening and clarification out of  article 
XI at the recent Uruguay round of GATT negotiations.
<P>
	Canada's unique system of marketing boards, agencies and 
commissions is arguably the most sophisticated system in the 
world, ensuring producers a reasonable income and consumers 
stable quantities of the highest quality food.
<P>
	Two years ago Canada had a number of impressive allies in 
her fight to strengthen and clarify article XI of the GATT. 
However, due to relentless pressure and threats from the United 
States, our allies fell by the wayside one by one. Unfortunately 
by the time the deadline approached Canada stood completely 
alone at the bargaining table. We were faced with a fundamental 
decision: Do we leave and scuttle seven years of negotiation 
involving the interests of 116 nations and our own, or do we 
examine the factors associated with this most comprehensive 
round of global trade talks in history and work to implement the 
measures that would ensure the survival of our unique supply 
management system?
<P>
<B>(2025) </B>
<P>
	The Government of Canada chose the second option. I am 
hopeful that Canada's farmers who operate under our current 
supply management system comprised chiefly of poultry egg 
and dairy sectors can successfully retain their system through a 
well regulated conversion process from the original import 
quota system to one that is to be characterized by initially high 
levels of tariffication.
<P>
	Despite recent threats and posturing by the United States, I am 
hopeful that the Government of Canada will successfully 
implement this initial set of tariffs of supply managed produce 
beginning July 1, 1995. My constituents and I find it disturbing 
to read in the media accounts outlining the possibility of 
tradeoffs with the Americans in which some of the tariff levels 
and supply managed commodities may be significantly lowered 
in return for greater access of Canadian wheat to U.S. market.
<P>
	While the Government of Canada is still negotiating with the 
United States to sort out a number of longstanding bilateral 
issues, I am gratified to have received assurances from the 
Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food that in the process of 
these bilateral negotiations with our American friends there will 
be no tradeoffs between agricultural sectors.
<P>
	The farmers in my riding of Lambton-Middlesex tell me that 
they do not want subsidies, they just want a decent price for their 
product. As I see it, we need to develop a farm income 
stabilization program that is regionally flexible, yet one that is 
also GATT consistent, market neutral, financially sound, 
affordable and effective.
<P>
	One program to be looked at is GRIP. It is true that GRIP plays 
differently in different provinces. For example, in my province 
of Ontario it is seen as a very successful program. In others, 
especially Saskatchewan, people have the opposite opinion. 
Perhaps what is needed then is a set of more regionally sensitive 
safety net programs that take into account the various 
agricultural sectors and their producers.
<P>
	The question of interest free cash advance payments comes to 
mind. On February 14 of this year I made a statement to the 
House calling upon the minister of agriculture to reinstate the 
interest free provisions of the advanced payment for crops act 
which was removed last June by the previous government.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate the same 
request. While I respect the reality that interest free cash 
advances have cost about $50 million to $75 million each year 
and that these moneys would come out of the total budget of 
$850 million for all income support and safety net programs, I 
am convinced that it is a well spent investment, especially for 
our farmers who experience cash flow problems at various times 
each year. It almost goes without saying that proper stewardship 
in the form of sustainable agriculture continues to grow in 
importance.
<P>
	Canadian agriculture has a proud environmental record and 
can be attributed to an even greener environment through a 
greater federal commitment to the development of ethanol as an 
alternate fuel. As co-chair of the ethanol task force, I have been 
working with my colleagues diligently over the past number of 
months in trying to convince cabinet members to take that extra 
step in providing assurances to the development and flourishing 
of Canada's fledgling ethanol industry.
<P>
	Frankly it is an idea whose time is long overdue and I intend to 
keep advancing this notion at every opportunity. Ethanol as a 
fuel has come under the microscope more often in the past five 
years than any other transportation fuel from the standpoint of 
energy efficiency, environmental and economic benefits, 
sustainability, farm practices, cost benefit ratio, energy source 
comparisons and the impact on grain supply.
<P>
	Can the same be said for the big oil companies that fought 
changes such as the removal of lead until the public demanded it 
be removed? Speaking of the public, demand for ethanol is so 
high in Canada that our small existing ethanol producing 
facilities have been forced to import ethanol from the United 
States in order to meet that growing demand. This is nothing 
short of ludicrous. Canadians have the will, the know-how in the 
market, both domestic and international, to support a major 
expansion of our ethanol industry.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4183"> 4183 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(2030) </B>
<P>
	The ethanol industry is not looking for an 8.5 per litre federal 
tax exemption for ethanol blended fuels. It already has its 
exemption as do alternate fuels. What ethanol manufacturers are 
seeking is a guarantee of the present commitment by the federal 
government or a maintenance of the status quo on tax treatment 
for the next 10 years.
<P>
	Such a guarantee would ensure private sector investment for 
potential ethanol manufacturers who would like to create jobs 
and economic development to benefit the economy through the 
construction of a $170 million world class ethanol production 
complex utilizing 20 million bushels of Ontario corn.
<P>
	The Ontario, Alberta and Saskatchewan governments have all 
seen fit to help kickstart this renewable industry through long 
term tax exemptions.
<P>
	Members of the ethanol tax force and our many supporters 
both here in the House and in the Canadian agricultural 
community at large are only asking for similar consideration 
federally. No subsidies, no loans, no grants, no loan guarantees 
are requested. If the crude oil increases and/or corn prices 
decline the ethanol industry is prepared to have a clawback 
formula.
<P>
	Ethanol has much to offer Canadians who are 
environmentally conscious, thirsty for economic recovery and 
concerned about the sustainability of our agriculture and energy 
industries.
<P>
	We do not need any more studies. What we do need is the 
political will to make the right decision. We all know that 
Canada produces enough grain to put 10 per cent ethanol in all 
Canadian gasoline and still be one of the world's top four grain 
exporters. Moreover, as evidenced by federal and provincial 
government policy, evaluation of ethanol cannot be assessed 
only in the context of cost versus gasoline. There are numerous 
factors that must also be considered.
<P>
	There is a very positive and undeniable economic benefit to 
Canada when one thoroughly assesses all the impacts of 
renewable fuel programs in important areas such as farm income 
stabilization, rural development, direct Canadian jobs, exports 
and improved balance of trade, more valuable animal feed 
stocks, reduction in primary energy use, lower emissions of 
greenhouse gas. All of these are positive factors which will be 
the fruits of a courageous and visionary federal ethanol fuel 
policy.
<P>
	We have to act and we have to act now or Canada will be left 
by the wayside. Renewable ethanol is already a large scale 
business in the United States and it is getting larger as we speak. 
Over 49 new plants are on the drawing board and 14 existing 
plants have plans for expansion.
<P>
	Here in Canada we simply cannot afford to dither any longer. 
As I said, we simply do not need any more studies by well paid 
bureaucrats. The beneficial results of the  ethanol experiment 
are already before our eyes south of the border.
<P>
	Let us not waste any more time. The time for a real federal 
commitment to ethanol and the positive impact it will have on 
our environment, our agricultural communities and our 
economy is now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, may I extend my congratulations to the member who 
just spoke on her tireless and courageous support of the ethanol 
industry. I too support the ethanol industry not only in my own 
constituency but right across Canada. I congratulate the member 
for her work and I urge her to continue with what she has been 
doing.
<P>
	Second I also congratulate the member for her comments 
regarding the interest free cash advance. I was in the House 
earlier this session when the member raised the question with 
the minister of agriculture and I am pleased that he is in the 
House again tonight to hear the member's request for an 
extension, in fact the reintroduction, of the interest free cash 
advance.
<P>
	The member who just spoke and the minister of agriculture 
who comes from Saskatchewan will know that the interest free 
cash advance is not just a benefit to the farmer but it is a benefit 
to all of Canada.
<P>
	Farmers under our current system, a marketing system that I 
support, cannot sell grains whenever they feel like it. They are 
subject to quotas. They are subject to elevators that are full. 
They are subject to a system that is backlogged so that grain can 
simply not be delivered when the cash is needed to pay for 
clothing or tuition fees, food or other payments that the bank 
requires in order to allow for a farm family to remain on the 
land.
<P>
<B>(2035) </B>
<P>
	The interest free cash advance is a small price for our nation 
to pay for an accessible agricultural product and an income at 
the farm gate when in fact the grain needs to be sold and the 
system will not allow it to be sold.
<P>
	I urge the member to continue to call on the minister of 
agriculture to reintroduce the cash advance. I have a brief 
question for her. She did ask the question of the minister before. 
Can she give the House an indication whether the minister is 
responding favourably to her request?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ur:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member 
for his statement and his question.
<P>
	Perhaps it is presumptuous of me to answer when the minister 
is in the House. I have had favourable discussions with the 
agriculture minister. I had discussions this morning with the 
corn producers' representatives and I believe they were meeting 
with the minister today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4184"> 4184 </A></B>
<P>
	I have not been updated on that meeting, but I hope it was 
favourable. The indications appear to be favourable but I am not 
psychic. I hope it is.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with my colleague from Champlain.
<P>
	It gives me great pleasure to take part in the debate on the 
agricultural sector. However, I cannot agree with the motion 
presented by the minister of agriculture. The wording of the 
motion is nothing but self-congratulatory, with praise for a duty 
that was poorly done.
<P>
	I represent the constituency of Chicoutimi, and I can tell you 
that there are roughly 1,700 agricultural producers in the region. 
The dairy industry is the largest. Many of the farms are owned 
by individuals. Family farms are still very much a part of our 
region, but they have undergone numerous changes. With the 
globalization of markets and its very tangible impact on 
agriculture, it can be said that this sector is constantly subject to 
change.
<P>
	The agricultural sector is active. In February 1991, all players 
in Quebec with a stake in regional development and the 
agri-food sector met in Montreal for the <I>États généraux du 
monde rural</I>, which established a series of benchmarks, 
including giving the regions control over their future, respecting 
and promoting local and regional values; having local and 
regional partners work together, diversifying the regional 
economic base, protecting and regenerating resources, and 
restoring a balance in political powers from top to bottom.
<P>
	At the Trois-Rivières summit, round tables achieved a 
consensus on the major approaches to be taken to ensure the 
development of the agri-food sector in Quebec. The 
Trois-Rivières Summit generated a series of commitments. I 
will mention a few: first of all, to focus on research and 
replacing old technologies as part of a strategy to win new 
markets; to promote and support human resources training; to 
ensure the continued development and growth of agri-food 
businesses; to readjust existing income security programs based 
on production costs; to develop income security programs 
compatible with the rules of international trade; to promote 
financing for farm operations and the transfer of same without 
incurring massive debt; and subsequently, to consider assistance 
for conversion within the sector of operations that are not viable 
and help farmers who leave the profession.
<P>
<B>(2040) </B>
<P>
	The federation of the Union des producteurs agricoles du 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, in its activity report for 1992-93, 
has also changed its strategy and talks about winning new 
markets.
<P>
	On page 7, the report says that this new theme in the 
agricultural and agri-food sector will guide our planning for the 
next decade. Some serious thought has been given to these 
issues. There is a need to promote the autonomy of farm 
operations and processing plants by supporting their efforts to 
adjust to new market demands and win new markets, and also 
increase their competitiveness by reducing production costs. All 
this to break the cycle of dependency on government assistance. 
However, a reasonable time frame is needed to provide for 
harmonious transition. By signing the GATT agreements, the 
Canadian government has upset farm programs and practices by 
making the agri-food sector compete directly with foreign 
countries.
<P>
	This is not harmonious transition. We must consider farmers 
as entrepreneurs and support regional entrepreneurship. They 
should have access to ongoing professional training and to the 
financing and technologies they need to make their operation a 
profitable and competitive business.
<P>
	Quebec is committed to promoting the development of a 
competitive agricultural sector that is regionally based. The 
agri-food industry must adjust to the demands of globalization. 
It cannot, by itself, guarantee the development of rural areas and 
maintain the social fabric, although it certainly can play a 
significant role in regional development.
<P>
	Nevertheless, non-viable companies will have to be 
supported by the government until their activities are redirected 
within the agri-food sector or in other sectors of the economy. 
We have to make the industry aware of the importance of the 
environment as a means of promoting agriculture.
<P>
	Finally, the agri-food sector needs a reasonable time to adjust 
to international competition. The federal government defended 
only weakly the interests of Canada and Quebec farm producers.
<P>
	During the last negotiation sessions of the Uruguay round of 
GATT, and despite repeated assurances by the Liberal 
government in December, federal negotiators were unable to 
gather the support of enough countries to defend and keep article 
XI which protected egg, poultry and milk production, mostly 
centered in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(2045) </B>
<P>
	Even though import quotas will be replaced by tariff barriers 
which will gradually disappear over time, the abandonment of 
article XI is disrupting Quebec agriculture. Clearly, the federal 
government did not come back from Geneva, last December 15, 
with the best of agreements. We would have wished for a larger 
reduction in export subsidies and a better access to foreign 
markets.
<P>
	For Canada and Quebec farmers the biggest threat, at the 
present time, is the outcome of the current trade negotiations 
with the U.S.A. in the agricultural sector.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4185"> 4185 </A></B>
<P>
	The federal government is now pressured by American 
negotiators over the issue of restricted sectors like eggs, poultry 
and milk. Americans claim that pursuant to the agreement, tariff 
barriers must be completely abolished between the two 
countries by 1998.
<P>
	Decision making processes must be decentralized. 
Stakeholders in the Quebec farming industry did what they had 
to do. They do not need for the federal government to impose 
policies that would be contrary to the priorities and positions 
they developed. They want to control the decision-making 
levers in the fields that concern them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to the member from Chicoutimi in his 
remarks and until the last few minutes I was carried along by his 
enthusiasm for agriculture in the Chicoutimi area and with his 
vision of agriculture.
<P>
	I enjoyed when he was discussing agriculture, talking about 
research, new technology and market developments and global 
competition, these things which I think in the stereotype of 
agriculture we do not hear enough about. Agriculture is a very 
diverse, very sophisticated part of the economy and the social 
structure of Canada. In listening to the debate today I think the 
diversity of agriculture across the country comes out.
<P>
	In my riding of Peterborough there are 1,100 farms, about half 
of which are in beef. About a quarter are dairy farms. There are 
large poultry farms and hog farms. We have a fine buffalo farm 
which produces breeding stock of buffalo. We have sheep farms, 
goat farms, we produce bees, we have market gardens and whole 
variety of crops, soft fruits and things of that type.
<P>
	I mentioned Peterborough in the same way the member 
mentioned Chicoutimi, to show that in my riding the diversity of 
agriculture is extraordinary.
<P>
	One thing I think the government has to do is continually 
inform the people of Canada, particularly the people urban 
areas, of the true nature of agriculture as an industry in this 
country and as a way of life in this country. It is a diverse, 
progressive part of our society which, as the member for 
Chicoutimi mentioned, includes the family farm. It includes 4H 
and all of those things we associate with our rural communities.
<P>
	The government has to help farmers reach out to the urban 
areas and get rid of this stereotype of agriculture which exists 
there and show them what a vital and interesting and diverse part 
of our country it is. It also has to reach out and tell Canadians 
that they receive cheap, high quality, healthy food from their 
farm sector.  We spend 10 per cent or less of our disposable 
income on food and we get the very best food for that. I think the 
government should articulate. There are some developed 
country which spend almost 25 cents on the dollar they earn on 
food. In developed countries we spend less than 10 cents thanks 
to our farm communities.
<P>
<B>(2050) </B>
<P>
	Also the government has to tell Canadians, particularly urban 
Canadians, about the agri-food industry which the member for 
Chicoutimi mentioned and the huge trade surplus we have in that 
area.
<P>
	Last, I urge the government to continue with its consultations 
with farmers and the agri-food industry in making all its 
decisions.
<P>
	My question to the member for Chicoutimi is will he help 
us-I heard his criticisms-give urban folk in Canada an 
understanding of the true nature of the high quality of 
agriculture we have in this country?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, to start with, I would like to thank 
my colleague for his long preamble, which, in spite of my 
criticism of his government, seemed to support some of my 
arguments. I would like to get back to his main point which was 
farm diversification.
<P>
	I am all for it, except that under the present system, the federal 
government is funding diversification in western Canada at the 
expense of Quebec. Which, to some degree, explains why 
Quebec has been unable to diversify in that area. I could give 
you many examples and statistics. But I will only talk about 
lamb production. Quebec has been unable to emulate the west. 
The sheep population increased by 9 per cent between 1988 and 
1991 in Quebec, whereas it went up by 33 per cent in western 
Canada. Why? Thanks to programs funded by the government at 
the expense of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain):</B> Mr. Speaker, farmers 
are prepared to meet the challenge of globalization, despite the 
loss of protection with respect to the marketing of products on 
which quotas apply and the mandatory elimination of certain 
government subsidies as a result of the GATT agreement. Like 
all good entrepreneurs, they want to know what kind of support 
they can expect to receive from the government.
<P>
	Producers recall the inertia of the federal government which 
failed, during the signing of the GATT agreement last November 
15, to obtain assurances that the numerous trade disputes pitting 
Canada against its main trading partner, the United States, 
would be resolved. Canada therefore finds itself in the position 
of having to negotiate under pressure in an effort to resolve 
numerous trade disputes in the agricultural sector. The 
government has left itself in a tenuous position and must now 
adopt a defensive posture in order to limit the damage.
<P>
	The negotiations currently under way with our neighbour to 
the south are going nowhere. The dispute, you may recall, 
centres on our main products, that is ice cream, yogurt, Western 
wheat and the new Canadian tariffs on poultry, milk and eggs. 
The government must not cave in to pressure from the United 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4186"> 4186 </A></B>
<P>
States. It must stand its ground and think first about the future of 
Quebecers and Canadians.
<P>
	In addition, the government must reduce the inequities 
between east and west. If past practices are any indication of 
what lies ahead and if inequities increase, producers will come 
to expect a double standard in the case of eastern and western 
farmers. The competitive position of Quebec farmers is directly 
affected by this practice.
<P>
	In the past, producers disciplined themselves and worked 
together to ensure that production levels were geared to the 
needs of Canadian consumers.
<P>
<B>(2055) </B>
<P>
	Quebec farmers fell for it. Take chicken production for 
example. Each province would have to produce chickens to meet 
the provincial demand. In 1990, taking advantage of its 
geographic location and the impending abolition of quotas, 
British Columbia decided to go it alone to get ahead of the other 
provinces and increased its production capacity. Now Ontario 
would be prepared to follow suit and saturate the market in 
Quebec.
<P>
	In parallel with this trade liberalization on the Canadian 
market is the concentration of enterprises within the industry, 
which unfortunately will take place at the expense of producers. 
Certain processors also own hatcheries and flour mills, thereby 
controlling the price of farming inputs as well as prices paid to 
producers when poultry is sold. Producers are wondering how 
long this little game will go on and what the government intends 
to do in its role as partner in this changing environment?
<P>
	This turmoil created uncertainty among Quebec producers 
who have seen the share of the federal budget for agriculture 
allocated to western Canada increase from 42 per cent to 64 per 
cent since 1980, while Quebec's share dropped from 30 per cent 
to 10 per cent during the same period. In spite of this inequity, 
our producers are working enthusiastically and manage to keep 
agriculture in Quebec profitable and this, even though their 
indebtedness ratio is the highest in Canada.
<P>
	The government should do whatever is necessary to stabilize 
the farmers' economic environment. After all, the agricultural 
industry accounts for 15 per cent of jobs and over 8 per cent of 
the GDP in Canada.
<P>
	The government should start by reducing the number of 
assistance programs. Agriculture Canada is administering 
approximately fourty, another 22 are co-managed with the 
provinces and 286 more are administered by the provinces 
alone.
<P>
	In the area of agricultural finance, the federal government 
intervenes through the Farm Credit Corporation and the Quebec 
government through the Société du financement agricole. The 
terms of reference of these two organizations are amazingly 
similar, yet both are maintained. In terms of visibility in 
Quebec, it is in the interest of the government to maintain an 
organization of its own, but in terms of customer service, it will 
prefer a single-window approach to agricultural  financing. You 
can be sure this would be the approach preferred by Quebec 
producers.
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Quebec government is contributing 20 times 
more than the federal government to agricultural financing. 
Furthermore, only 16.7 per cent of the Farm Credit Corporation 
has gone to farms in Quebec, as compared to 35 per cent in 
Western Canada.
<P>
	In their agriculture policy statement, the Liberals promised to 
create for farmers a long-term mortgage, with two thirds of the 
interest sheltered from fluctuating rates, a guarantee plan for 
farmers whereby the government would guarantee the loan 
made by a farmer selling his farm, thus ensuring a stable 
retirement for sellers and helping established farmers and 
newcomers obtain capital at reasonable rates, and thirdly, a farm 
leasing plan whereby farmers whose property had been seized or 
who were starting out could rent land under long term leases 
from the FCC, with the rent credited toward possible future 
purchase.
<P>
	But what has become of these good intentions? Is it only pious 
wishes? We may well ask, the farmers are still waiting.
<P>
	I am not calling for the abolition of standards but for an 
adjustment to the new agri-food environment where companies 
will have two choices: to compete on international markets or to 
serve specific niches in local and regional markets. Our small 
businesses must be allowed to develop and our entrepreneurs 
must be given an opportunity to carry out their business ideas 
and thus develop our regions, all this without threatening food 
quality.
<P>
	However, we find on our grocery shelves beef from Nicaragua 
with no identification of origin on the package. As a result, 
consumers cannot encourage our own producers and buy a better 
quality product.
<P>
<B>(2100) </B>
<P>
	Although the government says in its agricultural policy that it 
intends to apply Canadian standards to imported food, it has no 
control over sanitary conditions where the food is produced and 
processed and over environmental standards on foreign farms.
<P>
	Quebec has developed a seal of quality, ``Qualité Québec'', 
that is placed on products to encourage people to buy local 
products.
<P>
	I therefore call for the strict application of present regulations 
on the identification of the origin of agricultural products; this is 
another measure that could maintain and even create jobs at no 
great cost.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4187"> 4187 </A></B>
<P>
	Our farmers and processors must not only adjust to the 
various standards but above all meet consumers' needs and 
requirements. Again, through its policy statement on 
agriculture, the government wants to promote and reinforce our 
marketing strategies under GATT and any other trade agreement 
in order to preserve a system beneficial to consumers and 
producers alike.
<P>
	Producers are still waiting for these great principles to be 
applied and in the meantime most of them, especially in Quebec, 
must deal with a crumbling quota system and the opening-up of 
our markets to foreigners knocking on our door.
<P>
	Along with the many changes occurring in the Canadian and 
Quebec agricultural environment, the profile of consumers is 
evolving. Families are smaller. People are looking for more 
refined products with less fat and added value whose quality sets 
them apart from the competition. All businesses are based on 
consumption and Agriculture Canada seems to spend a great 
deal of energy on applying standards and not enough on 
advertising and marketing.
<P>
	If the government is a partner of the agri-food sector players, 
it must do its job by adjusting quickly to the new realities and 
making its presence felt instead of keeping a very low profile as 
it does now.
<P>
	Producers must face another reality: the protection of natural 
resources that has become necessary because resources are not 
inexhaustible and because of their apparent degradation. 
Producers are determined to promote and adopt sustainable 
agricultural practices combining resource preservation with 
farm performance.
<P>
	It is up to all the stakeholders in the agricultural sector to take 
the necessary measures to pursue sustainable development 
while minimizing output losses for producers. The 
government's role in the quest for a sustainable agriculture 
should be to support the changes decided by producers, and not 
impose such changes through regulations.
<P>
	Although the Canada-Quebec subsidiary agreement on 
sustainable agricultural development provides for the 
implementation of several research and technical innovation 
projects over the next four years, the results do not benefit those 
who are primarily concerned. The government must ensure that 
research conducted by the Department of Agriculture in Canada 
is shown to producers and-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order! I am sorry to 
interrupt the hon. member, but his time is up. We now move to 
questions and comments. The hon. member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened attentively to the words of the member and to 
the member who spoke before him and, frankly, I have questions 
to ask about where the information comes from-if it can even 
be called  information-that these members have shared with 
the House.
<P>
	The member who just spoke to us called for the Government 
to deliver on the Agricultural Equity Development Program, as 
set out in the red book. Mr. Speaker, I know that the member may 
not be in the habit of reading his mail, but the program was 
announced three weeks ago by the Farm Credit Corporation and 
the Minister of Agriculture could confirm this immediately.
<P>
	Second, I must ask the member opposite, because he told us, 
regarding quotaed agriculture, If I understood his words 
correctly, that Quebec should have a percentage of the poultry 
market proportionate to its population. Is he telling us that he 
wants Quebec to have less poultry production than it currently 
has? If that is his position, it is not mine.
<P>
	Finally, Quebec produces 48 per cent of industrial milk.
<P>
	Is he telling us that he favours a reduction in the industrial 
milk granted to Quebec? Because, once again, that is not my 
position or that of my colleagues.
<P>
<B>(2105) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This member will have to explain to us just what he means and 
where he gets his information from, particularly on the equity 
lease issue that he advocated, that already exists and that was 
already announced by the government more than three weeks 
ago.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lefebvre:</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to 
answer the honourable colleague seated across from me. At 
present, leases are not in use.
<P>
	I would like to go back to some statements I made. When I 
defend the farmers of Quebec, I am also talking about small 
farms. In the West and in Ontario, they are used to seeing large 
producers. In my constituency, I want to defend the small farms.
<P>
	At present, dual jobholding is common, with spouses forced 
to look for work. We are moving toward globalization of 
markets, and we know that the big farms are indeed ready for 
global markets, even with the GATT agreement. However, we 
also have to think about small farms, which are fighting to 
survive. I personally believe that we are going to have to allow 
products to be processed in our regions and to develop new local 
and regional niches.
<P>
	When I talked about standards, I did not mean that I have 
anything against standards, but sooner or later, the government 
will have to reach a decision on this issue. I am in favour of 
having standards now, but not in favour of having them applied 
immediately. Two or three years could be allowed before they 
are implemented.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Murray Calder 
(Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
be sharing my time with the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell.
<P>
	The government recognizes that an economically healthy 
farm sector depends on conservation and protection of our 
natural resources. It is a simple fact. Without fertile soil and 
clean water, Canada's farmers cannot continue to produce the 
high quality nutritious food they are famous for.
<P>
	Over the past few years all Canadians have come to recognize 
the importance of protecting the environment. Many Canadians 
have changed the way they go about their daily lives. They are 
reusing, recycling and reducing, the famous three rs.
<P>
	More and more of our industries are also changing the way 
they go about business. They are trying to minimize their impact 
on the environment. They are also increasingly recognizing the 
need to protect the environment can represent business 
opportunities that not only result in environmental benefits but 
in jobs as well.
<P>
	Canada's agri-food industry is no different. Things are 
changing on the farm. Many urban Canadians may not realize it 
but Canadian farmers are changing the way they do business. As 
we all know, change is not easy but farmers are used to facing 
challenges. For example, farmers across the nation are working 
to preserve wetlands that are crucial to wildlife and the entire 
ecosystem. In Prince Edward Island farmers are partners in the 
P.E.I. wetlands stewardship program that helps them build 
fences around wetland areas to protect them from cattle. 
Farmers are increasingly moving to low till or zero till cropping 
technologies to reduce soil loss and runoff into our lakes and 
rivers. In my riding of Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe 
the Grey County Federation of Agriculture made mention of this 
problem in a brief presented to me in March.
<P>
	Because much of our landscape is blessed with many rivers it 
is essential to protect them from contamination and from 
erosion. A study in progress in Ontario is indicating that no till 
farming has increased almost 50 per cent in the last three years.
<P>
	Farm families have always been great recyclers and reusers. It 
is often born of necessity. Therefore it is no surprise that 
recycling empty pesticide containers is a major initiative found 
in many Canadian farm communities. Agricultural pesticide use 
is declining. Figures show Ontario farmers have reduced their 
use by about 20 per cent over the last decade.
<P>
<B>(2110) </B>
<P>
	In Quebec, farmers are taking part in a program to reduce their 
pesticide use by half by the year 2000. Farm organizations are 
increasingly taking a leadership role in promoting 
environmentally sustainable agriculture.  Prairie pools and the 
co-operative formed by the Manitoba, Saskatchewan and 
Alberta wheat pools are developing an environmental 
assessment guide. It will be distributed across the prairies to 
help farmers incorporate environmental planning into their farm 
management practices.
<P>
	The government is working and will continue to work in 
partnership with farmers, farm organizations, industry 
representatives and the provinces to ensure this trend continues. 
It is in everyone's interest to see that Canada's agri-food 
industry is second to none in the world when it comes to working 
in harmony with nature. Building Canada's reputation as an 
environmentally sustainable producer of food and crops can 
only help us in seizing world-wide marketing opportunities.
<P>
	Just last month the Canadian Agricultural Energy Use Data 
Analysis Centre was opened in Saskatoon. The centre will 
provide farmers, companies involved in agriculture and 
governments with the information they need to improve the 
efficiency of energy use in the agricultural sector. It is a 
partnership effort involving the federal government, the 
Saskatchewan government and the University of Saskatchewan.
<P>
	Also last month the direct seeding program was announced. 
This three-year $1.6 million program will help Saskatchewan 
farmers to obtain the information they need to make the 
technology transfer to direct seeding, that is seeding the new 
crop directly into the stubble of the past crop.
<P>
	What are the benefits of direct seeding? It reduces field work. 
It saves farmers fuel costs. It reduces soil erosion. The crop 
yields are equal to or better than traditional seeding methods.
<P>
	There is another benefit that non-farming Canadians may 
want to spend a few minutes thinking about. We have heard a lot 
about greenhouse gases changing the global environment. 
Canadians are worried about this. Let us consider that scientists 
believe the undisturbed plant material left behind by direct 
seeding methods can reduce greenhouse gas concentrations. 
Agriculture can play an important role in protecting our 
environment.
<P>
	The direct seeding program is a result of the partnership of the 
federal government, the provincial government, private 
business and non-government organizations. This is the kind of 
partnership for sustainable agriculture that we need to see 
continue and will continue from this government.
<P>
	I quote from a Saskatchewan Wheat Pool brochure on 
sustainable agriculture: ``We are not where we should be or 
could be, but we are a long way from where we used to be''. The 
government, in consultation with stakeholders, is developing 
long term approaches to sustainable agriculture that will get us 
to where we should be, approaches that will integrate not only 
our environmental goals but our economic and social goals. Our 
rural areas and farming communities must be safe, healthy and 
vital places. These long term approaches will  guide us as we 
develop a new national soil and water conservation program. 
This involves reviewing our programs for their environmental 
impacts and it involves continuing to help our agri-food 
industry to acquire the environmentally sound technologies and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4189"> 4189 </A></B>

practices it needs to meet our goals for a sustainable industry. 
That is this government's agenda to get us where we should be.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
presentation we have just heard is evidence of how dedicated my 
colleague opposite is to the environment, co-operation, 
recycling and the harmony of nature.
<P>
	I am confident that these sentiments are shared by all 
parliamentarians. It is critically important that all of these 
factors be present if we are to have sustainable agriculture.
<P>
	I would, nevertheless, like him to explain to us how 
opportunities can be seized on world markets. That is the real 
issue, because if we want to seize these opportunities, the 
wealthier countries will have to stop subsidizing agriculture 
indirectly.
<P>
	Financial assistance, particularly if it also entails standards 
specific to certain countries, impedes the movement of our 
goods and prevents them from being exported.
<P>
	I want to give you one example and then I would like to hear 
your view on the subsidies that wealthy countries award to 
agriculture and find out if there is any way to change this 
situation.
<P>
	In the Lac Saint-Jean area, we produce an aperitif made from 
a fruit characteristic of our region, namely the blueberry. Vast 
quantities of this product were exported to Japan because 
Japanese consumers had created a great demand for it. Japan did 
everything it could to block the sale of the product on its 
markets. It proceeded to indirectly subsidize national 
companies so that they could compete with our products.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member would care to comment on this 
aspect of the question which, in my view, is a logical follow up 
to what he was saying earlier.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Calder:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to hear that the 
hon. member shares with me the responsibility that we have to 
enhance our environment and turn it over to our children in 
better condition than when we took it on. That is a commitment 
that as a farmer I have always had.
<P>
	As to the rest of it, I have lobbied for farm issues for years. 
One of the problems that I had as a person representing supply 
management within Canada was as I lobbied for my own sector I 
knew I was doing it to the detriment of another part of 
agriculture, one of the people who worked in the same business. 
In other words, if I was effectively able to get a good deal for 
supply  management it could have been to the detriment of 
grains and red meat and that always bothered me.
<P>
	Under the new GATT agreement we are now underneath one 
umbrella. Now we can lobby for the farm industry as a whole. 
Also, the GATT agreement laid out world-wide foundations that 
we never had before and now have.
<P>
	When I campaigned in the October election I campaigned for 
the retention of article XI(2)(c)(i) for supply management 
because at that point that was what we understood to be the only 
position that we had and therefore we went for it.
<P>
<B>(2120 ) </B>
<P>
	When we became the government we found afterwards that 
the position of article XI(2)(c)(i) was not attainable because 
there were 116 countries out of 117 voting against it. That was 
not our fault. What we did was go to the places, the SM-5, the 
supply managed groups to replace that aspect of it and said: ``All 
right, what do we need? What do we need to protect that part of 
agriculture?'' They told us. We negotiated it and got it. That part 
of supply management is protected.
<P>
	However, I want to go back to the foundation as the soil is 
within agriculture. With the GATT signing we now have a 
foundation that is world-wide that we can build from. If another 
country like the United States challenges us on wheat we can 
work from a base set of rules which we never had before. I think 
we are miles ahead because of that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak for a few minutes tonight to 
express the grievances, wishes and desires of the people whom I 
have the honour and the privilege to represent in this House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let me commence my remarks by complimenting the minister 
of agriculture. Not only has he proposed this motion today 
which is unprecedented but I have no recollection in the 14 years 
I have had the honour of representing my constituents at the 
federal and provincial levels of the government taking an 
initiative like that, of having a debate on its own; not an 
opposition motion but a government initiated debate of this 
kind. I congratulate the minister.
<P>
	I also want to indicate to the House and indeed to all 
Canadians that the minister has been in the House as we have 
had this debate all day. He has been here for about 12 hours 
listening to the suggestions of hon. members from all sides of 
the House. I know that members of his able staff are here taking 
notes and informing themselves of the wishes of Canadians 
through their respective members of Parliament with regard to 
agriculture.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4190"> 4190 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There are about 68,000 farms in the province which I have the 
honour to represent. My riding alone has 1,000 farmers. So it is 
an important region for supply managed agriculture.
<P>
	As you well know, Mr. Speaker, there are also poultry 
producers, egg producers and many others. I would like to share 
some of my constituents' concerns and make some suggestions 
to the government.
<P>
	First, I would like to join with some of my colleagues who 
today expressed an interest in ethanol.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I as well as other members use ethanol blends in my 
automobile. At the present time I do that in an effort to 
encourage agriculture in part because it is a good conservation 
measure and of course because it makes my car work better. My 
ethanol is a local brand called McEwans. You know it well, Mr. 
Speaker. I think Mr. McEwan is a close personal friend of yours. 
A number of McEwan gas bars in eastern Ontario sell this very 
good product.
<P>
	This ethanol blend, however, as all ethanol blends in eastern 
Canada, mostly has in the portion of the blend which is ethanol a 
product imported largely from the United States. There is 
nothing wrong with that per se, except that in encouraging 
agriculture by purchasing gasoline I would much prefer to 
encourage agriculture in Canada and even better agriculture in 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	You no doubt know the group of producers in our region, the 
St. Lawrence Ethanol Co-op, which also has an ethanol project 
in our region. I even think that it is in the riding of the hon. 
member for Leeds-Grenville, with many producers coming 
from your riding, and the president is a resident of mine. A 
whole group of corn growers in eastern Ontario is interested in 
this project. I point out to the minister that these growers need 
our encouragement and support.
<P>
<B>(2125) </B>
<P>
	I would also like to make some suggestions about the Farm 
Credit Corporation to the minister.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Farm Credit Corporation of course lends funds to a 
number of producers both in my riding and elsewhere and I 
congratulate it for the work it does. I am not always pleased with 
what FCC does but I do not share the view of the Reform Party 
member who spoke earlier who suggested that there was no 
room for the Farm Credit Corporation in financing agriculture at 
all.
<P>
	I do not share those views. I think the FCC has a significant 
role to play and if it did not it certainly would not have the loan 
portfolio that it does. In any case the Farm Credit Corporation is 
a valuable instrument and we should encourage it.
<P>
	I want to suggest to the minister that he consider doing what 
another minister had done a number of years ago and that is to 
review the present loan portfolio of the Farm Credit Corporation 
in an effort to determine whether or not it would be possible to 
lower the interest rates on some of the existing loans.
<P>
	In approximately 1985 or 1986 the then agriculture minister 
had made a decision to lower the interest rates on a number of 
outstanding loans, I believe they were loans financed at 16 per 
cent and above, to bring them to what had been the prevailing 
rate for the preceding year which was in the order of 12 per cent. 
That had a significant impact.
<P>
	Of course farmers can do that now but they are subject to a 
considerable penalty and that has reduced some of the potential 
help that farmers could have received had they been able to 
restructure those loans with the Farm Credit Corporation.
<P>
	I want to bring to the attention of the minister this suggestion 
of mine and I hope that he considers it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I want to say a few words on GATT. The GATT agreement 
signed last fall was not the Liberal government's first choice. 
We did say what our first choice would have been. Mr. Speaker, 
you know hockey well. You know that if 117 teams play under 
the same rules, and if 116 of those teams decide to change the 
rules, you will not be able to do anything about it. Indeed, if 116 
out of 117 teams decide to change the rules, those rules are going 
to be changed, no matter what.
<P>
	Under these circumstances, we had to find what was best for 
our country. I think we have done that. And the member for 
Glengarry-Prescott-Russell is not the only one to think so. I 
have here an article published in the December 20 issue of 
<I>Agricom</I>, which is an agricultural publication from my riding. It 
says: ``In spite of the loss of article XI, Canadian supply 
management programs are safe''. I will only quote another short 
excerpt: ``The new GATT agreement provides for the 
maintenance of supply management programs through tariffs''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<I>Agri-com</I> is not the only newspaper that said that. As a matter 
of fact I have before me the May 10 editorial of the agricultural 
publication <I>Farm and Country</I>, a very well known publication in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4191"> 4191 </A></B>
<P>
my province of Ontario. The editorial is entitled ``Canada 
survives GATT Chess Game'' and reads:
<P>
	``The world's dairy producing countries which protected their 
markets before will continue to do so. The U.S. section 22 is 
gone. The EU's''-European unions-`` variable import levies 
are gone. So is Canada's article XI. But domestic industries 
around the world will still be protected''. The still critical <I>Globe 
and Mail</I> should take note.
<P>
	In other words, this writer is responding to criticism of that in 
Toronto's <I>Globe and Mail</I>.
<P>
<B>(2130 ) </B>
<P>
	The point I am making is that agricultural publications are 
telling us that our supply management has been protected, but it 
is not over. I raised this in a question with one of my hon. 
colleagues earlier. I give this note of caution to members of the 
House and hopefully through them to all Canadians involved in 
supply management. I have said this before. The supply 
management system has achieved a certain maturity and when 
an industry does, it sometimes becomes self-critical. That is not 
bad in itself but when there is an excess of that there is a danger.
<P>
	I am thinking generally of the chicken and poultry industry. I 
have what I have referred to as the fear of implosion for lack of a 
better word, and I am concerned about it. I hope producers in 
supply managed commodities will ensure they do not become 
their own worst enemies.
<P>
	They could have been their own worst enemies last December 
and some of them were. Some of them panicked. Many of us, the 
parliamentary secretary, the minister and myself included, spent 
hours and hours, days on the phone with farmers reassuring 
them and telling them that if they sold their quota they could be 
putting the whole system in a tailspin. Most of them were 
careful and through the efforts of everyone the supply 
management sector survived.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	But the concerns persist, and I want to point that out.
<P>
	Let me express some thoughts in the few minutes I have left. I 
do not know how to solve the problem, but I ask the minister and 
the parliamentary secretary to think about this. We live in a 
society which does not give sufficient recognition to the 
agricultural sector and that concerns me. This is true for all of 
North America. Again, I do not know the solution, but I think it 
is good to mention that point.
<P>
	I have had the opportunity to go to Europe many times and I 
noticed that Europeans in general value their agriculture a lot 
more than we do here. Is it because more European consumers 
go to the market to buy products directly from the farmer who is 
a personal friend, whereas here in North America consumers 
think that produce comes from the supermarket? Is it this lack of 
interaction which is responsible for the lack of recognition? I do 
not know. However, I urge the minister and his cabinet 
colleagues to look at this important issue  and try to make sure 
that Canadians living in urban areas can better understand our 
agricultural sector.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I thank you and the House for giving me this 
opportunity. Again I thank the minister and his parliamentary 
secretary for the attention they have given to agriculture in 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I did earlier I want to congratulate the hon. member 
as well for his support of the ethanol sector. I was very pleased 
that he has chosen to utilize ethanol blended fuel in his vehicle.
<P>
	I too have been using ethanol blended fuel in my vehicle for 
the last two and a half years, but I have a greater difficulty in 
securing ethanol fuels for my vehicle in northern Saskatchewan 
than he would have in Ontario. I certainly encourage the 
member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell to do whatever he 
can within government to support the ethanol industry to ensure 
it can survive and prosper not only in Ontario but throughout the 
prairie provinces as well. I believe there are many other 
Canadians who would benefit by using ethanol blended fuels in 
their vehicles, as he and I already have.
<P>
	On the same subject of sustaining the environment, I know the 
member has some interest in the organic farming industry. Does 
the member have any thoughts on the organic industry, given 
that the organic growers require a greater amount of marketing 
support from the federal government? That would be because 
the organic industry is more expensive to maintain. Also there is 
a problem with the official certification of an organic product. I 
wonder if the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell could 
offer some advice to the minister about what the federal 
government could be doing to ensure that the organic industry is 
able to prosper within our country.
<P>
<B>(2135) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all I want to thank the 
member for a very good question. He and I served on a number 
of committees together during the years we have been here. He 
might recall my raising this issue in the past with the previous 
minister of agriculture.
<P>
	In regard to the certification process and also in regard to 
what a person can call organic, the difficulty we have is that the 
identification of products as being organic seems to be a little bit 
like the expression ``good'', good versus what. It becomes a 
relative word particularly in the absence of more definitive rules 
than we have had.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4192"> 4192 </A></B>
<P>
	For instance constituents have had problems importing 
organic products. Their products would being stopped at the 
border by inspectors who did not want to allow the products to 
come in because they were applying tests that apply to 
non-organic products and they did not match. I had to intervene 
on a number of occasions during the previous Parliament with 
the then minister. The goods were released and were allowed to 
come into the country.
<P>
	It created quite a problem at the time. There were many 
consumers willing to buy the product but there was difficulty 
with certification.
<P>
	What we need is clearly marked differences for organic and 
non-organic products, tests that have to be followed in order for 
products to be identified that way. It should not be subjective. It 
should be totally objective. As well as ensuring that when these 
products are imported for part of the year, particularly products 
such as tomatoes that we do not grow, that the people who 
enforce the rules at the border are clearly aware of the 
differences because they are clearly not the same. Even the 
appearance of the product is not the same. Products may have a 
more blemished and bruised look because they are organically 
grown and because they are not sprayed with some of the things 
that give the flawless appearance that products that do not have 
the organic properties sometimes have.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
during the last six months the grain handling and transportation 
system in the west has been in crisis. Tonight I want to take part 
of my time to discuss the recommendations made by the 
subcommittee on grain transportation which has reported to the 
Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-food. I also wish 
to address some of the long term solutions offered by the Reform 
Party for grain transportation in the west.
<P>
	The subcommittee on grain transportation has been 
examining the current problems over the last few weeks and 
even held public hearings with the major participants in the 
grain handling and transportation sector.
<P>
	The subcommittee reported to the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food and the Minister of Transport on Friday, May 6. In 
the report the members of the subcommittee describe the current 
situation as a crisis. They estimated that in this crop year alone 
the grain car shortage in the west would cost producers at least 
$35 million in demurrage charges for ships waiting at the west 
coast ports. They also estimated that two million tonnes of grain 
sales would be lost or at least deferred which could cost 
producers between $100 million and $200 million.
<P>
	The report prepared for the subcommittee on the St. Lawrence 
seaway by the Library of Parliament also felt that there was an 
even far more serious long term consequence if this 
transportation crisis is not solved on an urgent basis. It was felt 
Canada's reputation as a reliable supplier of grain to the world 
would be jeopardized.
<P>
	The report said: ``If Canada cannot meet its delivery 
commitments on time sales will be deferred, cancelled, and 
customers will go elsewhere''.
<P>
<B>(2140 ) </B>
<P>
	The subcommittee determined that the current grain 
transportation crisis was caused by a number of circumstances 
including, first, a sharp increase in the movements of grain to 
the U.S.A. resulting in a doubling of turnaround times for rail 
cars from 20 days to 40 days; second, a tight lease market in the 
U.S.A. for grain cars because of the flooding of the Mississippi 
needed to replace barges; third, an increase in the movement of 
non-board speciality grains which are handling intensive, 
resulting in longer car cycles; fourth, a very severe winter which 
slowed rail traffic; and, fifth, a 13-day strike at the west coast by 
grain handlers.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports the recommendations made by the 
subcommittee on grain transportation and the subcommittee on 
the St. Lawrence seaway. If I had the time, I would like to 
outline all nine of the recommendations made to the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food and to the Minister of Transport in 
response to this crisis. However I think at this point in the debate 
everyone in the House is fairly clear on the content of these 
recommendations.
<P>
	In addition to the subcommittee's report to the ministers, 
Reformers have two other recommendations which we believe 
will help address the crisis. First, farmers should be allowed 
greater choices as to how their grain is shipped to market. In 
times of backlogs and strikes alternative ports including U.S. 
ports should be used to export Canadian grain.
<P>
	The second recommendation we would like to put forth is that 
there is an excessive amount of overregulation and the rail 
transportation system is unable to respond effectively to market 
demands. The rail car allocation system needs to be less 
centralized and less regulated.
<P>
	Personally I would like the ministers responsible to seriously 
consider the port of Churchill. It could be used to help alleviate 
the immediate crisis. I would like to also encourage the minister 
to develop a long term strategy for grain transportation using all 
ports: Vancouver, Thunder Bay, Churchill and the U.S.A.
<P>
	On the longer term the Reform Party believes that permanent 
reforms are necessary to ensure that politics are removed from 
the transportation of grain. I emphasize the Reform Party 
believes that agricultural commodities should move to markets 
by any expeditious mode, by any route, and in any form or state 
of processing. Such decisions should be based exclusively on 
the principle of cost effectiveness and with the best interest of 
the customer in mind.
<P>
	To this end the Reform Party makes the following 
recommendations. First, the Western Grain Transportation Act 
should be repealed and all transportations subsidies should be 
redirected to the  Reform Party's proposed comprehensive 
safety nets 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="4193"> 4193 </A></B>
<P>
programs which will defend Canada's food producers against 
matters over which they have little or no control.
<P>
	Second, in order to create a genuinely competitive 
transportation environment the Reform Party recommends the 
deregulation of the rail transportation system, turning control of 
the allocation of rail cars back to railways and the grain 
companies and eventually privatization of all rail cars. This 
would mean the end of the grain transportation agency and the 
senior grain transportation committee.
<P>
	There are about 21,000 grain hopper cars in the system today 
and 18,500 are owned by the government. Reformers see no 
reason for the grain companies and the railways not to own their 
own rail cars. The free market should determine how many rail 
cars are needed and when and where they are needed in the 
system. The turnaround time for a rail car in the grain 
transportation system is between 20 and 25 days, and this 
turnaround time has not improved since 1908. By comparison, 
the potash industry in my riding has a turnaround time of 
between 7 and 8 days to the same ports. The potash industry 
leases its own rail cars and the grain industry should do the 
same.
<P>
<B>(2145) </B>
<P>
	As our final recommendation, during periods of labour 
disputes the Reform Party recommends the alternate use of 
shipping points, including U.S. ports. Should that not prove 
sufficient in maintaining shipment levels and customer 
satisfaction then they should legislate the grain handlers as an 
essential service.
<P>
	A final point is in regard to the strategic use of the port of 
Churchill. The Hudson Bay Route Association has its office in 
Yorkton, Saskatchewan. For years this association has been 
effectively promoting the use of the port of Churchill as an 
alternate port for grain shipments. If the shipment of 
agricultural products is based exclusively on the principle of 
cost effectiveness and with the best interests of the customer in 
mind as the Reform Party proposes, the port of Churchill will be 
successful in attracting its fair share of the transportation 
market.
<P>
	For example, and this is important, if CN will provide the 
boxcars this summer to an agricultural commodity broker he 
will move at least one and possibly two shiploads, that is 80,000 
tonnes of pulse crops, through the port of Churchill to Europe at 
a saving of 60 cents per bushel. The Hudson Bay Route 
Association also maintains that if elevators are plugged and the 
grain bins are full then the boxcars designed for the Churchill 
run should be moving grain to Churchill and customers could be 
advised of the availability of grain at that port.
<P>
	The Hudson Bay Route Association has also learned that the 
Canadian International Development Agency, CIDA, gives 
away 750,000 tonnes of grain handling. It asks, if we are going 
to give that grain away, why we cannot direct those ships to pick 
up their grain at Churchill. It is a question that deserves an 
answer.
<P>
	Even the Minister of Human Resources Development publicly 
supports greater utilization of the port of Churchill. The 
ministers of agriculture in both Saskatchewan and Manitoba 
publicly support greater use of the port of Churchill. The federal 
and provincial politicians agree that now is the time to actively 
promote the port of Churchill to grain customers throughout the 
world.
<P>
	In closing I would like to point out that I was raised on a farm. 
I farmed myself for seven years just outside Yorkton. Farming is 
part of me. Farming is in my blood. Farming is my culture and 
my heritage. Farming is very special to me, so special that I do 
not want the government running it. The government is too 
involved in trying to solve the farmers' problems when farmers 
are quite capable of solving their own problems; if only the 
government would get out of the way.
<P>
	I encourage members of the House to support the 
subcommittee's recommendations to help get the grain moving 
in the west. I also ask for support of the Reform Party's longer 
term solutions to our grain transportation system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
note that the Reform Party supports the recommendations of the 
subcommittee on transportation and agriculture dealing with car 
shortage.
<P>
	That committee's recommendation shows the kind of 
proactive approach the minister talked about in his resolution 
this morning. I would encourage the member opposite to read 
the transcripts of that hearing. It was not the excessive amount 
of regulation that was the problem with respect to car shortage. 
It was that the regulations were not enforced enough for the 
GTA.
<P>
	With regard to the example of 1,000 cars of canola meal, that 
was a result of non-administrative product and it was the 
problem. It is not just a matter of less regulation; it is a matter of 
enforcing those regulations.
<P>
	What would the member suggest the government should do 
with respect to the railways not living up to their obligations 
under the Western Grain Transportation Act in terms of 
providing the rolling stock and capital investment with which to 
move the product to market?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
recommendations of the committee with regard to that are 
sufficient.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="4194"> 4194 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(2150 ) </B>
<P>
	In regard to something else, there is no incentive built into the 
system now for many of these bureaucrats to really get at some 
of the problems that underlie the whole grain handling system.
<P>
	When one has over a dozen support programs and all the 
bureaucracies saying that they are trying to help the farmer and 
in effect working at cross purposes, it does not help. This is 
where I get back to what the Reform Party is saying.
<P>
	We are saying that you should take all of these 11 departments 
of agriculture and get them to start working together. The best 
way you could do that is with the Canadian Wheat Board. Give 
farmers some control. Let them get involved. Right now it is run 
from the top down. We find this totally unacceptable. We are a 
populace party and we would like to see a lot more of the 
grassroots farmers supported and represented in these agencies.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will not abuse your consideration. It will be a short 
question.
<P>
	The member talked about wanting greater choices in the 
transportation opportunities for farmers. I am wondering if he is 
aware of the producer payment panel report on the Crow benefit 
that has just recently been produced and made public, a report 
that basically indicates that a pay the producer option means less 
money and fewer farmers on the land. Is that the program that he 
supports?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not 
sure of everything that the member is speaking about but I think 
we should put this money put back where farmers have control 
over it. Put this Crow subsidy money into a fund that is 
administered. We have proposed three of them. I am just going 
to briefly explain what I mean by this.
<P>
	We could take these over a dozen consolidated, 
unco-ordinated support programs and put them into three major 
programs and use the funds that are now presently in the Crow 
subsidy and gradually eroding. We could put these into funds 
that would protect producers from unfair trade subsidies that 
other countries have, natural hazards and income fluctuations 
beyond their control. They would be effective and farmers 
would begin to be able to make some choices that would really 
make farming a profitable enterprise once again.
<P>
	I think that is the kind of thing we would like to see happen in 
agriculture.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, how 
appropriate tonight that the Reform Party should have the last 
word.
<P>
	Flying east to west the southern landscapes of Canada offer a 
panoramic view of fields and farms stretching to the horizon in a 
richly textured patchwork. This rich and productive farmland 
injects a massive boost to Canada's  general economic activity 
and provides the most basic of all human needs, food.
<P>
	Yet, agriculture remains a virtually invisible industry 
scarcely noticed by the media when more fashionable news 
captures the interests of consumers. Issues that do enter the 
public arena are treated as the preserve of an emotional special 
interest group or a sad but quaint relic of other times.
<P>
	Agriculture in Canada in reality is a vital and integrated 
industry, including primary production, processing, marketing 
and delivery of a final product to the consumer. It remains a 
fundamental part of the economy and society affecting in subtle 
ways the development of our social policy in Canada and a 
changing economic agenda.
<P>
	Three decades ago Canadians spent 25 per cent of their budget 
on food. Today we spend much less, 13 cents of every dollar and 
we get better quality and more consistent supplies than virtually 
any overseas country.
<P>
	There is an established pattern of consumer demand that 
suggests stability for the short term but emerging trends may 
reshape food production in the long term. To anticipate changes 
in demand we need to know what already exists, what could be 
and what can be made to be. Managing what exists today was 
yesterday's business. Our task is to plan and manage what 
tomorrow may become.
<P>
	Consider the following. In present day agriculture the interest 
of the consumer is almost constantly sacrificed to that of the 
producer. The system seems to consider production and not 
consumption as the object of all industry and commerce.
<P>
	As a trading nation Canada must address the fact that the 
global neighbourhood is a place of change. A neighbour of today 
may not be there tomorrow. Where is the Bloc?
<P>
<B>(2155 ) </B>
<P>
	Globalization really boils down to a definition that means 
jobs and money now go in search of skill and income levels 
regardless of distance and borders. The production process takes 
place over thousands of kilometres and is co-ordinated by 
instant communication.
<P>
	Now how will these global changes affect our current levels of 
domestic production? What kind of planning process needs to be 
in place to address the future needs of not only Canada but the 
world? What kind of trading agreements will need to be 
negotiated with countries such as China? Our current 
government policies do not give serious consideration to these 
issues. They regulate for today with little thought for tomorrow.
<P>
	In the year 2000 earth's inhabitants are expected to be 6.4 
billion and 10 billion by 2030. Before the world reaches 
population stability food demands could be three times today's 
level, but arable land is expected to increase by the year 2000 
only to the extent of 4 per cent worldwide. So traditional 
methods of improving crop  yields will be hard pressed to make 
up the difference between population and farm land growth.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="4195"> 4195 </A></B>
<P>
	In Canada the government has had a unique pervasiveness and 
integrated relationship with agriculture because of the highly 
disbursed nature of farming and the limited size of the 
individual enterprise. Because of the importance of a strong 
agricultural sector to the overall competitiveness of the 
economy, it is imperative that Canada develop an industry that 
takes advantage of its specific natural and human resources.
<P>
	Practically speaking, consumers eventually get what they 
want. Just how quickly and efficiently that happens measures a 
supplier's success. How readily Canada anticipates and 
responds to emerging demands will become an important 
yardstick determining her competitive advantage or lack 
thereof. And so while the world waits, Canadian consumers also 
present a very real and current challenge. They create demand 
and they consume the product.
<P>
	About 90 per cent of the people who are here now will be here 
at the turn of the century, I am very happy to say. Canada like 
many other countries is approaching zero population growth. 
Beginning in about the year 2010 if no dramatic change in 
fertility or immigration occur our population will start to 
decline. This implies weak domestic opportunities for growth 
and increasing competition at all levels.
<P>
	As well, there are growing concerns for food safety which 
places further pressure on government as well as distributors as 
consumers become more aware of the food chain. It is an irony 
of the food industry that it takes a lot of work to be natural.
<P>
	Opportunities exist to attempt new communication 
approaches to more effectively manage the public's worry about 
food safety. There are implications for increased costs to the 
consumer. Government too needs to accept responsibility for 
developing regulations that assure producers remain 
competitive within this food safety conscious environment.
<P>
	Regulations have been mentioned prior to my presentation 
tonight. They are an insidious form of hidden taxation and any 
assessment of the tax environment in Canada should also 
consider its regulatory climate. It is complex with many 
departments unable to work independently of one another 
because of the current structure. Can you imagine implementing 
even the slightest regulatory change when regulatory 
amendments have to go through 80 to 90 offices before they can 
be gazetted. It is taxpayers' money that continues to support this 
huge monolithic structure.
<P>
	Government now has an opportunity to encourage initiative 
and innovation to meet changing expectations, heightened 
competition, industrial evolution and risk. Its responsibility 
becomes one that must not limit innovation by overregulating. 
As well the regulatory process has to be streamlined to allow for 
timely and effective change to meet the needs of the 
marketplace.
<P>
	How do we become market responsive? We know the 
characteristics of the consumers we wish to serve. We know the 
emerging reality of increased competition in the marketplace 
and of the new global trading environment regulated by GATT 
rules and the NAFTA alliance.
<P>
	NAFTA raises questions of basic rights and obligations 
regarding issues related to sanitation and vital sanitary 
measures for agriculture. Technical standards such as these are 
based upon scientific principles and risk assessment.
<P>
	We understand also that distortions to world markets and 
prices for commodities have been the result of subtle but 
invasive farm policies worldwide. And the cost of protection is 
getting higher and higher.
<P>
	Currently a number of sectors of the agriculture industry are 
production driven under supply management regulations. This 
continuation of such regulation does not bode well for the 
consumer who seeks choice in an open market environment. It is 
time to redefine supply management and to decide what 
Canadians want in terms of farm policy.
<P>
	To achieve this, the Standing Committee on Agriculture and 
Agri-Food should be asking how to achieve an orderly 
marketing system in Canada, how to handle imports, how to 
harmonize the current quotas given to producers in order to 
shield consumers from short market disasters. The standing 
committee has been hesitant to date to look into these matters. 
Why?
<P>
	We know that a farm policy is no substitute for realistic rural 
policy. Guaranteed prices do not prevent bankruptcies, and 
being self-sufficient does not ensure food security.
<P>
	To those who remain in the House tonight and to those on the 
agriculture committee, it is time to be courageous in leadership 
and to demonstrate that development of new opportunities 
demand a new approach, and then go and do it. It is no longer 
enough to follow where the path is going.
<P>
	It is time to go where there is no path and blaze our own trail.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It being 10 p.m., pursuant 
to order made Friday, May 6, the House stands adjourned until 
tomorrow at 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 10 p.m.)
