</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Madam Speaker, I would first like to advise
					 that I will be splitting my time with my colleague from Saint-Jean. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are here today to discuss a motion by the Bloc
					 Quebecois. The motion's importance stems from the tragic events of the last
					 weeks, events to which we are trying to find the best and most peaceful
					 solution possible. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that the Parliament of Canada be
					 consulted by the government before any major decision is taken regarding
					 Canadian participation in any military action.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is democracy that has been attacked and, therefore,
					 it is up to democracy to defend itself. When the terrorists attacked the
					 Pentagon, what they targeted was the power, the symbol of military power, not
					 only of the United States but of the free democratic world as a whole. When the
					 terrorists attacked the World Trade Center, it was the economic powers that
					 they attacked. When they targeted the White House, fortunately without success,
					 it was the political power that they singled out. Since the target was
					 democracy, it is up to democracy to defend itself. This is critical, in our
					 view.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament must also be consulted because, should there
					 be military action, the lives of hundreds of thousands of Quebecers and
					 Canadians would be at stake. The decision to send its sons and daughters to
					 fight for democracy has to be the most important one a parliament can make.
					 Such a decision cannot, we believe, be made by the government alone. It cannot
					 decide to put the lives of our fellow citizens at risk and not ask those
					 elected to represent them to make this most important decision in a
					 non-partisan spirit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament must also be consulted because the events
					 that will unfold in the coming weeks and months could very well shape our whole
					 future. Democracy and the free world are at stake. The goal pursued by
					 terrorists was to destabilize the values, which are dear to us and which we
					 have fought to defend over the years and down through the generations. These
					 are the values we are fighting for daily in this parliament, despite our
					 ideological differences.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of consulting parliament is so fundamental,
					 in our view, that we have a hard time understanding why the Prime Minister who
					 on the very first day of this session opened the door to a critical
					 consultation of parliament and a vote on crucial issues, is now backtracking.
					 It is unbelievable. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is out of the question for us to accept such an
					 attitude on the part of the government on issues that are so fundamental for us
					 and for those who may be called upon to put their own lives at risk in a
					 conflict, the outcome of which is unfortunately never known at the
					 outset.</p>


	<A NAME="T1015"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1015)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It strikes us as unacceptable that the government is
					 settling for responses that are not only ready made but, let us admit it,
					 partisan along the lines of “We are consulting parliament”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that parliament is consulted on a certain
					 number of subjects, when missions of this nature are involved, but most of the
					 time the discussions held here are for the purpose of obtaining the members'
					 points of view after the important decisions have already been reached.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes the Prime Minister and the government look
					 good to say that there is a new type of debate in parliament and that from now
					 on members can express their points of view when troops are to be
					 deployed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are calling for, however, is that before the
					 government commits to actions of such importance it require not only the
					 opinion of members, and a general point of view on what must or must not be
					 done, but also the approval of parliament, pure and simple. There must be votes
					 in this parliament so that the government knows where the representatives of
					 the people stand on future actions. This is the very basis of
					 democracy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are asking is not unrealistic. Let us look at
					 what other countries have done in the same context.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In France, Prime Minister Jospin said “--decisions of
					 this kind could not be reached by the executive without consultation of the
					 National Assembly and the Senate”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Argentina made its participation in any military
					 intervention conditional on a vote in its parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Germany the lower chamber, the Bundestag, voted to
					 give the government the mandate to take part in any military action.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From information I received only this morning as I was
					 preparing my notes for this speech, in India. The opposition was consulted, and
					 will be consulted on any participation involving services or other
					 contributions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Great Britain, although their parliament is not
					 sitting, when Mr. Blair returned he consulted not only the European Union but
					 also MPs from all the parties in order to find out their opinion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the major democracies of the world are behaving
					 like democracies, we have trouble understanding, as do those who are listening
					 to us, why the Prime Minister is afraid to submit to a vote in this parliament
					 decisions of such great importance as the one to join in the fight against
					 terrorism. Why do the Prime Minister and his government fear
					 democracy?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the Bloc Quebecois have shown a sense of
					 responsibility from the beginning of this crisis. We have tried, through our
					 suggestions, to support the government and to give it credibility. In response
					 to this co-operation, the Prime Minister is now rejecting any confirmation by a
					 vote the consultation of parliament. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, our Prime Minister went to Washington.
					 Observers consider that he was not taken so seriously. What stature he would
					 have commanded if he had met the president of the United States armed not only
					 with his opinion and that of his ministers' who incidentally are appointed by
					 him, but also with the opinion of all Canadian parliamentarians, with a
					 serious, credible vote that would have given him a credibility that he
					 unfortunately did not have?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When one wants to look like a head of state, one
					 behaves like a head of state, and the Prime Minister did not behave like a head
					 of state. He refuses to consult parliament. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to a Liberal Party fundraising dinner to talk

					 important.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion asks that the House urge the government to
					 consult parliament. I believe this is a very serious issue. Yesterday, we saw
					 the Prime Minister of Canada go to Washington without the formal support of
					 parliament. He may have had the support of the executive, of cabinet, but he
					 did not have the support of parliament. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went to meet with the President of the U.S., who has
					 the support of both houses of Congress. In the U.S. Senate as well as in the
					 House of Representatives, these discussions went beyond any partisan
					 considerations. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this is what parliament is all about, that is
					 to give all elected members not only the right to express their views on an
					 issue, but also the fundamental right to vote on the issue. It is the same as
					 if an election campaign were to provide for heated debates between candidates
					 but, in the end, no opportunity for the people to vote. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think people have to be asked to vote. When the
					 people voted, whether they voted for an individual and a party or an individual
					 representing a party, they asked that person to sit in parliament, to which
					 they had elected him, to debate and to vote on all of the issues. That is what
					 counts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, the Prime Minister did not have a mandate
					 from parliament. He had a mandate from cabinet, but not from
					 parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at all of the countries of the world in the
					 context of this crisis, I think armed forces, including those of the G-7, will
					 certainly draw on the decisions of their respective parliaments. The French
					 president has just made a commitment. He has said, “We cannot use force,
					 involve our army, without consulting the National Assembly”. He has made that
					 commitment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, Tony Blair, the British prime minister, not
					 only briefed people, but he is planning to recall parliament before the date
					 set, because he also wants to draw on parliament. He will thus be speaking on
					 behalf of all members of the British parliament. It is important to remember
					 this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same is true in Germany. Probably for historical
					 reasons, this is in the German constitution. Because of the two world wars,
					 when Germany wants to use force, it must consult its parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Prime Minister cannot remain outside what
					 the major powers are doing. Of course, we already have problems with our army.
					 We cannot contribute a whole lot. Still, if parliamentarians have the
					 opportunity to speak their mind, we can then come up with solutions. Democracy
					 will then decide. How will it do so? By letting each member of this parliament
					 vote on these questions. That is the aim of the motion before us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of the members is well equipped to do so. We are
					 used to making decisions. I would even say that we can make decisions that are
					 often very difficult. The decision for which we want the government to respond
					 to our request is a difficult one. The decision to send Canadians and Quebecers
					 into a conflict that could be lengthy and dangerous is the responsibility of
					 each member. We each have our points of entry in this debate and in the vote.
					 We will hold a considered vote based on what each member must do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A member is someone who already—this is true in my
					 case—has a file, who is in contact with the army, who can discuss at length
					 with members of the armed forces and listen to their viewpoint.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A member of parliament is also someone who listens to
					 his constituents. Since there cannot always be unanimity, a majority of voters
					 may say “I think you should defend my point of view and go so far as to vote
					 according to it”. This is the fundamental role of a member in this House. His
					 role is not to merely discuss issues. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, we have been discussing and we have expressed
					 our opinion to the Prime Minister. Now, we want to go the next step, a step
					 without which it is useless and totally pointless to discuss issues. If we have
					 a debate without a vote, we can talk until we are blue in the face. However,
					 the fundamental decision, the decision that history will remember, will be the
					 one recorded in <i>Hansard</i>, following a vote, that will show how members
					 voted on the motion. So, this is very important. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of parliament also listen to interest groups.
					 Peace groups come to see us and so do more aggressive ones. We must listen to
					 these people. This is why I say that we are perfectly capable of making these
					 sometimes difficult decisions. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not miss this opportunity to strengthen the
					 role of MPs. How many times have we heard comments such as, “Backbenchers never
					 have a say”. This is a typical example of the importance of the members of the
					 House as a whole, both backbenchers and ministers. When a vote takes place
					 here, everyone has a voice. The Prime Minister or any minister does not carry
					 more weight. The process is fair to everyone. Sure, the government can always
					 rely on its majority, but this is normal and at least members can vote on these
					 issues. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members who will be expressing their opinions today
					 want to do more than talk. They want to do more than have a debate. They want
					 to do more than engage in rhetoric. They want all these speeches and
					 discussions to end with their vote, a vote based on what I mentioned earlier
					 namely their files, their voters, the interest groups that contacted them and
					 the feedback provided by their office, which receives calls every day on this
					 issue. We must take all this into account and give MPs an opportunity to give
					 some finality to the debate through a vote.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the importance of debating and the importance
					 of voting. There is also the importance of knowing, in the motion before us,
					 what the financial consequences will be, for there are financial consequences.
					 However, at the outset I must say that the primary consequence for a member is
					 that Quebecers and Canadians will be sent into a risky conflict. That is the
					 main thing I said earlier that we were used to taking decisions. The most
					 difficult part about taking those decisions is that we are the lives and health
					 of people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that not everyone is killed in a conflict but
					 some people come back in pretty rough shape. We have only to think of the gulf
					 war and the conflict in the Balkans. Some people who went over lost their
					 lives, but others came back with their health broken, which is almost as bad.
					 We therefore have a very great responsibility.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the cost to the Canadian taxpayer will also
					 be great. Once again, members do not want to be restricted to debating the
					 matter.</p>


	<A NAME="T1025"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1025"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1025)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They want to have their say in a vote on a motion, with
					 the financial consequences that vote will imply.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, the performance of the Minister of Finance has
					 been sadly lacking. He has said nothing has been planned yet in this regard and
					 that he would do everything possible to avoid a deficit. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we decide to make an additional commitment and
					 troops are sent to Afghanistan or if we increase our participation to make up
					 for the shortfall in our international commitments such as replacing the
					 Americans in the field in Bosnia, this is bound to have financial
					 consequences.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore think that members of this House have
					 everything they need to be well informed in the debate and that they are
					 certainly in a position to vote, which is essential in a democracy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to tie this in with the proposal I just made
					 regarding financial resources, I wish to move an amendment to the motion moved
					 by the member for Roberval.</p>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the Liberals who were calling on the government

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does my colleague from Saint-Jean think of
					 this?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-51442"></A><a HREF="#Int-51445"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-51440"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Claude Bachand:
				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, my colleague has just given us an
					 example where the Deputy Prime Minister, back then, answered back to the
					 Conservative government in office “You must consult us, but you must also allow
					 us to vote on it”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, I would like to remind my colleague that
					 there was not only one member of the opposition at the time who questioned the
					 government about this. I believe all the Liberal members of the opposition
					 asked that there be a vote.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, this is not the only example of an
					 opposition party that forgets the past once elected to government. They should
					 re-read <i>Hansard</i> and ask themselves if they are not contradicting
					 themselves on their positions of the past.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case that my honourable colleague raised, the
					 Liberals are indeed in contradiction with their stand at the time. For this
					 reason, we are asking them to demonstrate that they are listening and to allow
					 all members a vote on this issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Bloc Quebecois, while I do not believe we
					 will ever form the government, we would not contradict ourselves, unlike the
					 Liberals certainly are, from when they were the opposition compared to today as
					 government.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-51445"></A><a HREF="#Int-51447"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-51442"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Robert Lanctôt (Châteauguay,

	Madam Speaker, during question period, when we came
					 back we asked the Prime Minister if there would be a vote, since consulting the
					 House appeared essential in such an important debate on the attacks. In his
					 reply the Prime Minister indicated that there would be consultation in the
					 House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our understanding was that it would not be mere
					 consultation as part of an exploratory debate, but that a vote would be taken
					 in the House of Commons to give ourselves some power.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later the Prime Minister recanted. What does my
					 colleague, the hon. member for Saint-Jean, think of that tactic on the
					 government's part? </p>


	<A NAME="T1035"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1035"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1035)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, the hon. member
					 for Châteauguay, for his question. I believe there is indeed a discrepancy
					 between what the Prime Minister said at the beginning of the session and the
					 statement he made later, saying that he was not sure whether people would be
					 asked to vote on the issue. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today it must be clear that this motion is more than
					 just a motion put forward by an opposition group or a political party. It
					 concerns all members who are not ministers or the Prime Minister. What matters
					 today is that members realize that we are sending a message, not only to
					 opposition members, but also to all members of this House who, sadly, are all
					 too often confronted to positions taken by this government's executive branch
					 the cabinet that is, and are expected to toe the line. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we want to do today is get a vote. We are asking
					 the Prime Minister to allow all backbenchers of his party to vote. We want
					 these people, all the members, not only to give their opinion on the issue but
					 also to vote on it. This is a fundamental principle and the Prime Minister must
					 not miss this opportunity to take a measure which will satisfy all members of
					 the House of Commons.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-51449"></A><a HREF="#Int-51457"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-51447"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Art Eggleton (Minister of National
					 Defence, Lib.): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak to this motion and
					 to reassert the government's commitment to consulting and having an open debate
					 on defence and foreign policy issues.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first part of the motion presented by the hon.
					 member for Roberval calls for consultation. We on this side of the House have
					 no difficulty with that. We have put it into practice and used it in a
					 meaningful way for a great number of years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However the second part of the motion calls for a
					 different kind of procedure and debate in the House that would culminate in a
					 vote of parliament. It is for that reason that I rise to oppose the Bloc
					 motion. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I do so because it would break with a current
					 Canadian parliamentary practice that has been in effect for some eight years,
					 the life of this government, a practice that has worked exceedingly
					 well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the motion deals with a hypothetical situation.
					 We do not know whether our armed forces will be called on for a combat role in
					 the campaign against terrorism at this time. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the motion creates difficulty in terms of the
					 timeliness and effectiveness of being able to move our resources, both assets
					 and personnel, to help deal with these kinds of struggles and tragedies. This
					 would sometimes require swift deployment of troops, perhaps at times when the
					 House is not sitting. The government would not be able to wait a very long time
					 to do that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally a reason for not supporting the component of
					 the motion which calls for a vote of parliament is that quite frankly such
					 decisions should be made by the government. That is what we were elected to do.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we need to consult with and fully inform as best
					 we can members of parliament. However it is ultimately the responsibility of
					 the Government of Canada to make the decisions for which it must be accountable
					 to parliament and the people of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be better to direct the energies of the House
					 toward responding to the tragedy of September 11 than to engage in the kinds of
					 procedural debates or wrangles we are seeing this morning. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we take the discussion beyond the current eight year
					 practice in terms of the matter being dealt with in parliament, it is
					 interesting to note that no formal parliamentary resolution was ever made with
					 respect to the entry of Canada into the Korean war in 1950. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in 1939 at the outset of World War II there was no
					 specific resolution of parliament declaring war on Nazi Germany. Parliamentary
					 approval for the government's policy was shown through support in the Speech
					 from the Throne and the defence estimates. There was no resolution of
					 parliament. There was no vote at all in parliament on the declaration of war
					 against imperial Japan. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1950 Canada has had over 50 peace support
					 operations of varying size. For many of these missions parliament was not
					 consulted at all if they were small. For the roughly 20 major missions debated
					 in the House there were only five recorded votes. Three motions were agreed to
					 without a recorded vote.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has delivered on what it promised to do:
					 expand the rights of parliament to debate major Canadian foreign policy
					 initiatives such as peacekeeping deployments. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1994 we have consulted parliament on many of the
					 international missions carried out by the Canadian forces. We held a debate
					 most recently in October 2000 prior to deploying Canadian forces personnel to
					 Ethiopia and Eritrea. Debates were held in the House during the Kosovo crisis.
					 The Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade and the
					 Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs met numerous times,
					 either jointly or separately, to discuss the issue. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was in addition a series of detailed technical
					 briefings by military and other officials to make sure members of the House
					 were well informed of developments in the Balkans. Two debates were held in
					 April 1998 and February 1999 regarding the deployment of peacekeeping forces to
					 the Central African Republic. We held a debate on potential military action
					 against Iraq in February 1998. </p>


	<A NAME="T1040"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1040"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1040)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November 1996 we debated Canada's leadership role in
					 alleviating the suffering in the African great lakes region. We also held more
					 than one debate on Canada's role in implementing the measures taken by the
					 international community to maintain stability and security in Haiti. This
					 demonstrates that parliament's role has extended beyond consultation on
					 deployments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1994 a series of joint committees were especially
					 organized to take an indepth look at Canada's foreign and defence policies.
					 Their work led to the adoption of a new defence policy and a review of Canada's
					 foreign policy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament has also played a major role in many other
					 aspects of foreign and defence policy. For example, the expansion of NATO, the
					 renewal of the NORAD agreement that provides for the security and defence of
					 North America, and Canadian policy on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons,
					 arms control and disarmament have all been subjects of consultations with
					 parliament.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the tragedy that struck the United States, there
					 have been three separate debates about it over the last week.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The September 17 special debate, the September 18
					 Canadian Alliance opposition day debate and the September 20 evening debate on
					 the Prime Minister's meeting with President Bush have all been the subject of
					 discussion in the House. I think these examples show that this government and
					 this party are committed to consulting with parliament and will continue to do
					 so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will also add that the motion put forward by the Bloc
					 Quebecois deals with a hypothetical situation. The question of armed forces
					 outlined in the motion is clearly hypothetical. There is no UN, NATO or United
					 States request to deploy Canadian troops to respond to the events of September
					 11. There is none at this point in time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is certain, however, is that the struggle that
					 lies ahead will be a long and difficult one. This will not be a simple or a
					 quick campaign. The world is faced with an elusive enemy that works in the
					 shadows and uses unconventional techniques. We do not expect this campaign to
					 be run by the conventional methods of war. President Bush himself underlined
					 this in his speech last Thursday.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This will not be like World War II. This will not be
					 like the Gulf war. It will not be like Kosovo. There may be aspects of
					 conventional military operations involved, but ultimately it will take a
					 different kind of effort to weed out the perpetrators of this
					 violence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For that reason we must be prepared for a sustained and
					 intensive effort, one that uses all available tools at our disposal, including
					 diplomatic, military and economic means. Yesterday, both in the House and in
					 the United States, there was much discussion about cutting off the funding to
					 these people who inflict this terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States has already pre-positioned some of
					 its military forces into the Middle East area where many of the terrorist
					 organizations exist, near Afghanistan, near the operation that is the
					 headquarters of Osama bin Laden. It is normal in times of crisis for military
					 forces to move in such a fashion and pre-position, but let me make it clear
					 that no decision has been made by the United States as to how this campaign
					 will be carried out and how these forces will be used. This is clearly
					 positioning. It is also quite obviously a tool to put pressure on the Taliban
					 and Afghanistan to give up bin Laden. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Americans have not asked for anything specific from
					 Canada at this time in terms of future military contributions. However, we have
					 already responded to the United States requests as events unfolded between
					 September 11 and now. I think the Canadian forces have been doing an excellent
					 job in meeting those requests.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian CF-18s work closely with their American
					 counterparts in Norad to defend North American airspace from further terrorist
					 attacks. We put additional planes into the Norad system at their request. Three
					 Canadian forces vessels were put on a heightened state of readiness to deliver
					 humanitarian aid to the United States ports if it should be necessary. At the
					 same time members of the disaster assistance response team, who responded so
					 quickly and effectively to natural disasters in Turkey and Honduras, were also
					 put on active alert in Trenton in order for them to be able to move into the
					 United States to assist in New York or Washington.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian forces also responded quickly to the
					 domestic demands of more than 200 rerouted planes placed in Canadian
					 communities across the country. Within hours of learning that flights were
					 being diverted into Canada, Canadian forces Airbus and Hercules aircraft worked
					 closely with local airports, Transport Canada, Red Cross workers and countless
					 volunteers to provide important resources across the country to help cope with
					 the heavy influx of travellers. Their efforts deserve recognition and the
					 gratitude of Canadians. We can be proud of their reaction.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time members of the Canadian forces were
					 setting up shelters and bases in Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and Manitoba to
					 accommodate some of the thousands of distraught passengers and crew who found
					 themselves stranded in our country. The assistance that was both offered and
					 provided by the Canadian forces was an important part of the overall national
					 response efforts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organizing the many aspects of this response was no
					 small task and here the federal government's new Office of Critical
					 Infrastructure Protection and Emergency Preparedness played and continues to
					 play a key co-ordination role. Officials at OCIPEP are working in close
					 co-operation with the U.S. federal emergency management agency, FEMA, in this
					 connection. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the excellent work of the Department of
					 National Defence and the Canadian forces in the days following the attacks
					 demonstrates that we are ready and able to respond whenever we are called upon.
					 As we move forward the Canadian forces continue to work with the U.S. and our
					 allies through our intelligence community, which has put on an extra effort at
					 the request of the United States in terms of intelligence gathering and
					 analysis. From them to our binational command of NORAD, our Canadian forces are
					 maintaining a close working relationship with their counterparts in the United
					 States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we can see, we have been there with the Americans
					 and they have thanked us for what we have done. We will continue to be there as
					 we prepare to embark on this campaign against terrorism. We have capabilities
					 in the Canadian forces that we can still make available. Moreover last Friday I
					 authorized more than 100 Canadian forces personnel who were serving in the
					 United States and other allied military forces to participate in any operations
					 conducted by their host units in response to the recent terrorist
					 attack.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure the House that we are not looking to play
					 a symbolic role. We are looking to play a very meaningful role. As the United
					 States comes through the planning stage it will then consult with Canada and
					 other allies to determine how we can work together. It is by working together
					 that we will be able to use our capabilities in a complementary way. That is
					 why the Prime Minister travelled to Washington yesterday and why I leave for
					 Brussels later today to meet with our NATO allies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are in the process of building a coalition of
					 countries that recognize the need to suppress terrorism. Let me assure the
					 House that Canada will work with our allies, but we will not rush into any
					 decisions concerning our response without thorough and balanced consideration.
					 If, after consultations with the United States and our allies, it is decided
					 that Canada would contribute combat troops, let me remind the members of the
					 House that the Prime Minister has already pledged that the House, as is our
					 custom and has been our practice for many years, will be fully
					 consulted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me make one last point concerning the Bloc
					 Quebecois motion. It is important that Canada be able to respond quickly and
					 flexibly to the events of September 11. While we are committed to consulting
					 Canadians and members of the House, we are equally committed to making the most
					 effective contribution to peace and freedom.</p>

					 Alliance): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I would like to ask the minister some
					 questions. I have been asking them for two weeks now and have not been getting
					 a lot of answers so I am hoping that today we can just have a little back and
					 forth and get some real information.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister said that we should not be spending the
					 energy of the House on this motion, that we should be talking about deployment,
					 so let us talk about deployment. The minister also said that Canada's
					 contribution would not be just a token contribution, that it would be
					 substantial, with our NATO allies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would just like to ask the minister exactly what that
					 contribution could be, not what it will be, but what Canada is capable of
					 supplying looking at the fact that the number of our forces has dropped from
					 90,000 when this government took office to probably under 55,000 now, and
					 according to some experts it is heading down still quite rapidly. Considering
					 that this government has cut the defence budget in real terms by 30%, that our
					 equipment is so badly outdated, starting with the Sea King and going right down
					 the line, that we have mostly gaps in our equipment, we do not have an awful
					 lot to offer. It is important that if we send our troops into a combat
					 situation they have good equipment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even our F-18s, which the minister so often refers to,
					 have been cut from 122 to 80 now, with a pledge to cut the number to 50. It is
					 not just the planes themselves, of course, but also the pilots. We have lost
					 more than half of our experienced pilots who flew in Kosovo. In regard to
					 ordnance, I have had rumours fed to me, and judging from where they came I
					 would say they are more than rumours, that in fact we are so short of smart
					 bombs and other equipment needed in this type of situation that we cannot
					 possibly go ahead until we restock in these areas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the minister just what we can send
					 and what his plans are in terms of emergency spending to restock some of this
					 ordnance and to take other emergency measures to deal with this important
					 situation.</p>

				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, the hon. member is getting way ahead of
					 himself. I clearly indicated that we should not be getting into procedural
					 debates. I also indicated that it is premature to talk about a hypothetical
					 situation. We really do not know what will be required. I will not speculate on
					 what is required in terms of the long term or even the short term campaign
					 against terrorism. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are in consultation with our allies and with the
					 United States and as it is determined what role we can play we will, as best we
					 can, be happy to provide that information, subject, always, to national
					 security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the strength of the Canadian forces, as
					 has been said time and again, we have a recruitment challenge as every other
					 country does, the United States and other countries. We are down to a total
					 strength of about 58,500. Our effective strength--I noticed some article on
					 that this morning--is lower than that but that is because we have a number of
					 people who are in training. At any given time people are going through
					 education courses and various training activities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must also say, on an optimistic note, that our
					 recruitment is way up. Recruitment numbers this year are up substantially over
					 last year with our new recruitment program. Our attempts also to retain current
					 military personnel, together with the recruitment, will help us to bring our
					 numbers up.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also worth bearing in mind that while these
					 numbers are lower we do have a lot of new equipment and technology which means
					 the force projection of those numbers is greater than what the force projection
					 of those numbers would have been, certainly 10 years ago.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member talked about budget cuts again. Back in
					 the days of the deficit, way over there on that side of the House, in that
					 party in particular, they were saying cut government spending. I did not hear
					 them say cut government spending but do not cut defence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was here back in 1993 and I never heard that at all.
					 It has become convenient for them to say that nowadays but back in those days
					 they were saying cut government spending. Everybody was saying it. Nobody said
					 exempt defence. Nobody said exempt health care or exempt anything else.
					 Everything was put on the table and the budget cuts were based so we could get
					 our fiscal house in order. We have been able to do that. Other countries have
					 done that as well. Many other countries, including the United States, cut their
					 defence budgets but now our defence budget is going up. We have invested some
					 $3 billion more in the last three years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of equipment, the member conveniently forgets
					 that we do have a lot of good, modern equipment. Yes, we have some equipment
					 that needs replacing. Of course the Sea King needs replacing. However we have
					 new Coyotes that are the envy of many other militaries and were requested
					 recently by the United States and other countries to be part of the operation
					 in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We played a very frontline role in Kosovo with our
					 CF-18s. We have more precision guided munitions on order and if we were to
					 engage in any conflict, we would need to make sure we had the necessary
					 equipment to do that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it would be very premature to talk about that.
					 The member talked about the cut in the number of CF-18s. We have cut them down
					 to a level that is still higher than what the white paper on defence policy of
					 1994 said we required.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think the member has his facts right at all.
					 We have more pilots now than we had at Kosovo. We may not have the same pilots,
					 as there is always a turnover, but we have good pilots.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During an interview the other day involving the former
					 supreme allied commander, General Clark, he said that the Canadian pilots were
					 exceptional, that they were top class and that they continue to be top class.
					 We have and have always had great training programs in this country. These are
					 some illustrations. The member has a lot of his facts wrong.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I will point out to the Minister of
					 National Defence that history will tell whether Canada has done what had to be
					 done.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more observers are beginning to say that
					 Canada is not taken seriously. On the other hand, what is put forward today in
					 this House is serious. There might be terrorists inside our country. As members
					 know, the Prime Minister said yesterday that it was an attack that was carried
					 out against our neighbours, close to home. That is why the Bloc Quebecois wants
					 the issue to be considered in the House and a vote taken here with regard to
					 any military intervention.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quote the Deputy Prime Minister, who was sitting in
					 the official opposition in 1990 when he said this:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

						  are called upon to participate in any offensive action, such participation must

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore ask this to the Minister of National

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was not here in 1990 so I do not know the

					 opposition, for a vote on the matter. I can tell members that each case has to
					 be judged on its own merit and on its own individual circumstance. In the eight
					 years that I have been here and this government has existed, we have developed
					 a very open consultation process for all members to engage in the major
					 potential deployments of our military. That practice will continue. The Prime
					 Minister has made it clear that there will be consultations here.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada is prepared to play a meaningful role and will

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If troops are to be sent to an offensive action, why is

				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, I think the proposal raises an excellent
					 topic, which is the issue of how to appropriately respond to a circumstance we
					 are faced with as a nation that is certainly not without precedent but without
					 precedent in terms of its impact on North America. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events of two weeks ago are events we deplore. The
					 question of how we should respond in the House and how the government should
					 respond is at issue. Certainly the Canadian Alliance policy position should be
					 put on the record and I will do so now. I quote from our policy document which
					 states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>We
						  will make Parliament responsible for exercising effective oversight over the
						  conduct of Canadian foreign policy, and the commitment of Canadian Forces to
						  foreign operations. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of parliamentary oversight is one that I have
					 heard addressed here, in the few months that I have been here, and it certainly
					 has been addressed by members on this side of the House with increasing
					 frequency since the government came to power. Part of the reason for that
					 increasing frequency is the fact that as the government remains in power there
					 seems to be a tendency for that power to increasingly centralize in the Prime
					 Minister's Office and in the hands of the Prime Minister himself as opposed to
					 remaining dispersed, as it more appropriately should be, among the members of
					 this responsible body.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This view is shared by many. I will quote from Donald
					 Savoie's book, <i>Governing from the Centre</i>, in which he says:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>While I argue that the centre and, in
						  particular, the hand of the Prime Minister, has been considerably strengthened
						  in recent years, this is not to suggest that the federal government is better
						  able to define new strategic direction or a coherent plan to which all
						  government departments can contribute. It is ironic perhaps that as the hand at
						  the centre has been strengthened, its ability to manage horizontal issues has
						  been weakened.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At no time has it been more evident than in recent
					 weeks that Mr. Savoie's comments are not only accurate but are illustrative of
					 a problem for our country. The reality is that the Prime Minister's office has
					 centralized responsibility for decision making within its own confines. The
					 reality is that the government did not even bother to strike a committee to
					 discuss defence issues. The reality is that the Prime Minister and his close
					 advisors, his closet or his court, made decisions immediately following the
					 events and very likely will continue to make decisions that will affect us in
					 many profound ways.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the key aspects that we should be addressing in
					 the House is our relationship with the United States. Bilateral relations with
					 the United States are key to our country in many ways, not the least of which
					 is economically. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One trend that all of us should be aware of is the
					 increasing closeness between the populations of these two countries. As with
					 many trends, the effects of this change will be felt disproportionately
					 throughout our country, but the reality is that Canadians and Americans are
					 closer than ever before. An illustration of that is the reaction among the
					 Canadian people to the events in the United States over the last few weeks. The
					 impressive display of support and of honest friendship among the peoples of the
					 two countries was heartfelt and genuine.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second factor that affects our bilateral
					 relationship is the reality that Canada is less significant as a global
					 economic player than it was two decades ago. Once our GDP ranked us among the
					 largest national economies. Today many economies in the developing world have
					 grown larger in terms of their aggregate GDP but Canada has, in some ways,
					 become a smaller player even though it has continued to grow. Developing
					 countries and many smaller developed countries are better able to participate
					 in the numerous international forums where once Canada served as a champion of
					 their concerns. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is also true that a significant part of our
					 decline in world affairs is self-inflicted. Canada's military has shrunk so
					 badly that it cannot serve in much more than a symbolic role even in disaster
					 relief efforts around the world. The debate we are having today, in its
					 specific terms of whether or not we should contribute to military effort
					 elsewhere, is largely a symbolic debate. The real concern that many of us have
					 is that our military has declined. That is a concern and it reduces the esteem
					 with which many of our allies hold us around the world. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our foreign service is shrinking. Our entire public
					 service is losing talented people through attrition and downsizing. We have an
					 excellent diplomatic corps around the world but they are starved for resources
					 and are overwhelmed by the burgeoning number of international talks,
					 commissions and negotiations in which they are asked to be involved.</p>


	<A NAME="T1105"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1105"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1110"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1105)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time we understand and Washington certainly
					 understands the need for our government not to appear to be acting as puppets
					 to the United States. We understand the ambivalent relationship required of
					 governments in the country as to the position of the United States on a variety
					 of issues. The Prime Minister understands that. At the 1998 NATO meeting he was
					 quoted as saying to the Belgian prime minister “I like to stand up to the
					 Americans. It is popular. But we have to be careful, they are our friends”.
					 That is the defining reality of the government's position vis-à-vis the United
					 States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government, in many instances, has refused to
					 co-operate with the United States or, on the surface at least, tried to portray
					 itself as standing against U.S. concerns and for Canadian ones. That is fine
					 when those concerns are different concerns but the concerns raised as a
					 consequence of the terrorist acts are not different concerns but relatively the
					 same in both nations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Historically the United States asked us to address the
					 issues of illegal movement of people across our border, cross border drug
					 smuggling, drug enforcement, light sentences, et cetera. It has also expressed
					 concern about the looseness in our scrutiny over the diversion of sensitive
					 technology to rogue states, as they are sometimes referred. In each of these
					 instances, Canada and the government failed to take proactive approaches which
					 would have addressed the concerns raised by the Americans. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recent Ressam case highlights the concerns the
					 United States has had with Canada being a transit point or a staging ground for
					 terrorist activity. It is well understood that the Americans have expressed
					 these concerns, not just recently but over a long period of time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Her Majesty's loyal opposition, we have proposed
					 solutions to these various problems and others. Refusing to co-operate with an
					 ally does not make one stronger. We share enormous interests with the people of
					 the United States, yet the government's refusal to co-operate with them in so
					 many ways has done nothing to safeguard our sovereignty. On the contrary, it
					 makes us less of a nation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working in partnership enhances our influence and our
					 sovereignty. European Union members have already acted to harmonize their
					 approach to terrorism and they did not surrender their sovereignty in the
					 process. Responsible nations around the globe are responding co-operatively to
					 the terrorist threat. The Liberal government seems to be missing the boat on
					 what is a global trend and a global opportunity to focus resources on solving a
					 problem that affects all of us, not just in the free world but those in other
					 areas of the world where terrorists are domiciled as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians overwhelmingly agree that we should be fully
					 engaged in the fight against terrorism on all fronts, yet the government seems
					 to oppose any policy simply on the basis that the United States supports it.
					 This is a very dangerous attitude, especially when it is applied to continental
					 security concerns.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see a number of areas where the government must
					 proceed, such as on immigration reform but not necessarily harmonization.
					 Canadians want us to do a proper job of making sure that terrorists do not use
					 this country as their bed and breakfast. This does not mean we must do it
					 exactly the same way but we should share good ideas, effective methods and
					 data.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other areas should include faster and more effective
					 deportation of rejected applicants, intelligence co-ordination, foreign
					 intelligence capability, and safeguards against embassy corruption which is an
					 issue that we raised. There are hundreds of examples of various acts of a
					 criminal nature in our embassies over the last few years but when the issue is
					 raised in the House, the minister dismisses it by saying that it is an
					 exaggeration. However we have data showing that there were over 300 cases
					 between 1993 and 1996. This would be another opportunity for us as a nation to
					 safeguard our perimeter defence; our embassies, after all, are key to that
					 exercise.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue on which the government has taken baby
					 steps is on anti-terrorism legislation. This was debated in the House last week
					 and had the support of my PC colleagues and members of the Alliance. The
					 government's proposal is to limit the ability to give tax receipts to terrorist
					 organizations.</p>


	<A NAME="T1110"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1110"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1110)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Martin Collacott, a former ambassador and a diplomat
					 for Canada in Asia, calls the proposal laughable. Many Canadians have the same
					 attitude. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussions have been absent on emergency preparedness,
					 military defence and homeland defence for the United States. Another issue
					 concerns proactive principal diplomacy. The government's insistence on
					 supporting Syria in its bid to become a member of the United Nations Security
					 Council does not support the idea that Canada's values are being represented by
					 the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many other areas, such as economic measures,
					 in which we can do a great deal to assist in the battle against terrorism
					 besides the military option we are debating today. The government seems
					 hidebound in its unwillingness to enter into productive partnerships and
					 discussions with our greatest partner in the world. Waiting at the perimeter
					 for the United States to change its mind on these issues will not work. We need
					 to take matters into our own hands. If we fail to do so it will be a recipe for
					 marginalization and anxiety on the part of the Canadian people.</p>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Alliance policy calls for any movement to
					 arms to include a vote in the House of Commons. I would like to look at what
					 the situation is today. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, one of our NATO allies has been attacked.
					 Article 5 of the NATO convention states that if there is an attack on any one
					 of the NATO allies, that is considered to be an attack on each of the NATO
					 allies. As a result, the attacks on New York City and Washington, the plane
					 that crashed in Pennsylvania and the attempted attacks on other places are
					 considered to have been attacks on Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alliance policy says that before any of our
					 military are sent into action there should be a debate and a vote in the House
					 of Commons. In this case, the debate and the vote which made Canada a member of
					 NATO, would satisfy the Canadian Alliance policy that we have a debate and a
					 vote on sending our forces into action. We have had an attack on an ally and
					 for that reason Canada is considered to be at war. We made that commitment when
					 we signed on to become a NATO partner.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NATO is possibly the greatest military alliance ever in
					 the history of mankind. It has been successful for the 50 some years it has
					 been in existence. NATO has been a great deterrent against those who would
					 attack its members, but also others anywhere in Europe or in North America. The
					 alliance is a good thing and Canada's participation has been essential for our
					 security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had the first direct attack on a NATO ally
					 since the agreement was signed and we need to be there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would go a little further with the idea that we need
					 to be there and be available. Just a few minutes ago I asked the minister some
					 direct questions about what Canada would make available, not what we would
					 commit. I was not asking specific questions about any issue that should be kept
					 secret. I was asking specific questions as to what capabilities Canada actually
					 has to contribute to our NATO allies. No answer was forthcoming. The minister
					 said nothing in response to the question except the usual, that we have the
					 Coyotes. Coyotes are light armoured vehicles but a war is not fought with
					 Coyotes.</p>


	<A NAME="T1120"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1120"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1125"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1120)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coyotes are used to transport our forces from one place
					 to another in battle zones or areas of engagement, but one does not fight a war
					 with them. Yet the minister continually refers to that and does not get much
					 beyond it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister talks about our F-18s. They are still
					 reasonable planes although they are more than 20 years old. They have had
					 upgrades that make them much more capable. They were used fairly successfully
					 in Kosovo. They need substantially more upgrades and some are in the plans.
					 However we need the proper ordinance and we need experienced pilots.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has produced excellent top level pilots. We have
					 top level pilots now, but when we get into a joint operation with other
					 countries we must have experienced pilots. The fact that we have lost well over
					 half our pilots who flew in Kosovo is of great concern.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about shortages, whether in terms of
					 pilots or others in our forces, the minister says we have a stronger
					 recruitment plan. However we do not recruit pilots one day and have them flying
					 the next. We do not do this anywhere. We certainly do not have them flying in
					 joint operations without years of training. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is something that has been anticipated. Past
					 defence critics for the Reform Party, Canadian Alliance and other opposition
					 parties have pointed out the shortages of capable and experienced people in our
					 forces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have excellent people in our forces. We have very
					 good training in our forces. I do not blame members of the Canadian forces at
					 all. They are doing a great job and I am proud of them. Any time I see a member
					 in uniform I feel pride. I am extremely thankful they are there for us. They
					 are doing a good job and they are top notch. I am proud of that and Canadians
					 across the country should be proud of that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However our forces need training. They need training
					 not only at the level at which they are receiving it but at a level that will
					 prepare them for the engagement which may happen now and which will certainly
					 happen some time in the future.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot predict exactly when things will happen.
					 However one thing we know is that there will always be people in the world who
					 will attack others. That is human nature. It is the way things happen. It is
					 not a question of if something might happen; it is a question of when.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first responsibility of the federal government is
					 clearly the safety and security of our citizens and our country. That is the
					 first priority and the first responsibility. It comes ahead of everything else.
					 Has the government given any indication that it understands that
					 responsibility? It has not, and I can point to some quick
					 statistics.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numbers in the Canadian forces in terms of personnel
					 have dropped from 90,000 to under 55,000. They are on their way down to 42,000
					 according to the Canadian Institute of Strategic Studies. Does that show an
					 understanding on the part of the government that we need a strong national
					 defence force? I suggest it does not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Military spending in real terms under the Liberal
					 government has dropped by 30%. Does that show an understanding of or commitment
					 to security and to our largest security force? The Canadian forces is Canada's
					 largest security force.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The auditor general has said that by 2012 we will be
					 $30 billion short for the equipment replacements we have committed to. In other
					 words, they are not budgeted. That is not the whole story. That is only for
					 equipment already committed to. Does that show a commitment to our national
					 forces? It does not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion the Bloc has brought forth today is worthy
					 of debate. The fact that the minister indicated we should not be talking about
					 procedure right now shows a lack of understanding about the democratic process.
					 </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion is worthy of debate. I encourage the
					 minister to come up with answers when these questions are asked. How many
					 Canadians believe the capabilities of the Canadian forces are inappropriate? I
					 suggest they want answers.</p>

					 BQ): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I listened carefully to what my
					 colleague from the Canadian Alliance had to say. I would like him to clarify
					 his position regarding article 5 of the NATO Treaty.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of his speech, he mentioned that
					 indeed all the countries that are members of NATO—there are 17 or 18 according
					 to who you talk to and it seems that many others want to join in, but let's say
					 there are 18 member countries—have an ambassador to represent them in NATO and
					 so does Canada. When discussions are held, all the ambassadors raise their
					 hands to make their country's position known.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with the member that article 5 says that an
					 attack against one NATO member shall be considered an attack against all its
					 members. However, I would like to remind him that Lord Robertson, the NATO
					 secretary general, clearly specified that this was conditional to the fact that
					 the attack came from the exterior. My point is that it is obvious that an
					 attack like the one in Oklahoma City would not necessarily warrant an action by
					 NATO because the attack came from within. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the member to clarify his position. Once
					 NATO has specified the need to establish that the attack was indeed directed
					 from outside the country, which I think the Americans are about to do, what
					 happens next? Do all countries send in their troops without consulting their
					 parliament? I would like the member to give some clarification on
					 that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within NATO, there is a notion called interoperability.
					 It means that nations are capable of performing specific activities in a
					 conflict. As for Canada, we do not yet know what the Americans and NATO expect
					 from us. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, one thing is certain. If we confirm our
					 participation and if NATO decides to proceed because the attack was indeed
					 directed from outside the country, each nation is bound by article 5 and must
					 say what it is willing to do. That is what the Bloc's motion is all about.
					 Before the Canadian government can say that it wants to do this or that, there
					 must be a vote in the House of Commons. This is not only to the benefit of
					 opposition members, but also to the benefit of Liberal backbenchers, who are
					 accountable to their constituents just like we are. It is on that issue that I
					 would like the member to clarify his position. Does he want us to have a debate
					 and a vote in the House regardless of the type of military assistance that will
					 be requested?</p>

				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his
					 question. He has attended many of the NATO parliamentarians' meetings over the
					 past years and he understands how NATO works. Article 5 says that if any of the
					 NATO allies is attacked it is considered an attack on all the allies. That
					 would get NATO involved very quickly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is up to each NATO country to determine what it will
					 send to a conflict based on what it is capable of and willing to send. The
					 member is right in saying that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went on to ask whether parliament should determine,
					 through a debate and a vote, exactly what the contingent would be. I suggest
					 that parliament should have a debate and a vote on what the contingent would
					 be. I support that. However there are cases where there would not be time for
					 it. That type of situation happens on occasion and we must be prepared to deal
					 with it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that at the speed the government is moving we
					 would have time for a debate and a vote. Canadians deserve to hear more about
					 what Canada has to offer. It is important not only in terms of specific
					 commitments but so Canadians can know the capability of their largest security
					 force.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians who understand are quite shocked at how
					 little Canada can offer. This is partly because we are overcommitted to NATO
					 and United Nations efforts in various theatres around the world. Canada has
					 taken on a heavy load in NATO commitments to Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia and
					 other places around the world. We are stretched to the limit right now. There
					 is no doubt about it.</p>

					 NDP): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues in the Bloc for
					 bringing forward the motion. It gives us an opportunity to debate and discuss
					 the role of parliament in the issue that is now before us as a country and
					 before the world, which is to say the act of terrorism that was perpetrated
					 upon the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will begin by agreeing with the right hon. leader of
					 the Conservative Party who said this morning by way of a point of order that he
					 felt the Prime Minister should have made a commitment to come into the House of
					 Commons today after his visit to Washington to make a statement with respect to
					 the nature and result of the meeting he had with President Bush.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear a Liberal member saying that is what question
					 period is for. This reveals an ignorance of parliamentary tradition. It was
					 quite common in days gone by for prime ministers and ministers to make
					 statements to the House of Commons after significant meetings pertaining to
					 events of significant interest to the House. Certainly the Prime Minister's
					 visit yesterday with President Bush would qualify.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that does not qualify for a ministerial statement or
					 a prime ministerial statement in this case, what would? It seems that one of
					 the ways the Liberals could make good on their rhetoric of consulting
					 parliament would be to do that kind of thing. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must say in all fairness to the right hon. member for
					 Calgary Centre that when he was minister of external affairs in the 1980s,
					 during the years when I was his opposition critic, he made use of ministerial
					 statements to involve opposition parties and particularly opposition critics in
					 the ongoing debate about issues as they arose in the area of foreign
					 affairs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would echo his demand this morning that the Prime
					 Minister consider doing that later today under routine proceedings and that
					 ministers of the government in general with respect to the issue, when there
					 has been a significant meeting or development, not wait for take note debates
					 or question period which is by its nature sometimes not the most educational
					 forum. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes a ministerial statement, with a considered
					 response on the part of opposition critics, would serve the Canadian public
					 much better in determining the position of the government and the response of
					 the opposition with respect to particular concerns.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate about the role of parliament in this regard
					 is an ongoing debate. Unfortunately any study of the role of parliament when it
					 comes to foreign affairs will find the Canadian parliament and the Canadian
					 parliamentary tradition particularly deficient when it comes to this area of
					 concern.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the NDP support the motion and think it would be
					 appropriate that the government come to the House for a debate and a vote
					 before the deployment of Canadian troops or any element of the Canadian armed
					 forces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to my comment about the deficiency of the
					 Canadian parliamentary tradition in this regard, I am reminded that Canada was
					 the only country of all the NATO countries that did not have a debate in its
					 parliament about the enlargement of NATO.</p>


	<A NAME="T1135"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1135"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1140"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1130"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1135)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was a very significant development with respect to
					 European security architecture and the role of NATO in the world generally.
					 Yet, I believe Canada was the only country out of 15 NATO countries that did
					 not have a debate in its national parliament. I think 13 out of the 15
					 countries were required by their constitutions to have debate. They have it
					 written into their constitutions or into their political traditions and rules
					 that any such significant decision can only be taken with the advice and
					 consent of their national parliaments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in the U.K., which has the same parliamentary
					 tradition as we do, the government saw fit to have a debate in the house of
					 commons as to the wisdom or lack thereof of enlarging NATO. It was only in
					 Canada that this thing could be passed by order in council without so much as a
					 reference or a whiff of parliamentary involvement. That is wrong and it is
					 something which is fundamentally wrong with our parliamentary
					 tradition.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of National Defence just a few minutes ago
					 got up in the House and said that this was our practice. Yes, it is our
					 practice, but is it a good practice and is it a practice that the government
					 should consider changing if it is serious about consulting and involving
					 parliament? I would certainly recommend to the government that it take the
					 motion much more seriously than it is.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall that at the time the Minister of National
					 Defence cited a number of precedents where recorded votes were not taken on
					 things. However one of the more recent precedents, if he wants to talk about
					 practice, was the gulf war. There was a motion and a vote in the House of
					 Commons. I remember it very well. The government of that day thought it was
					 important to have parliamentary approval, not just a parliamentary discussion
					 but approval, of the action that it took at that time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I remember correctly, the Liberals at that time did
					 not object. In fact they probably pushed for it. Here we see the same pattern
					 of inconsistency between what the Liberals ask for and push for when they are
					 in opposition and what they do in government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of National Defence claimed that all the
					 Liberals were abiding by practice. They are abiding by their own practice. They
					 are abiding by the practice that they established. He as much as admitted this
					 when he talked about what the practice had been in the last eight
					 years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are abiding by their own practice which they
					 established, which is that all that parliament gets to do is to have these take
					 note debates. I suppose these debates are better than nothing, but perhaps they
					 are not if they establish the false impression that parliament has been
					 consulted in as meaningful a way. I think Canadians would like to think their
					 parliament has in fact been consulted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To not have a vote is particularly strange. When the
					 minister of defence spoke earlier he said that government had to act and that
					 it was accountable to parliament for its actions. Strangely it would seem that
					 when it comes to these kinds of things, this is the only kind of issue on which
					 the government is not accountable to parliament. Technically speaking, we vote
					 on everything else down to the last jot or tittle of government
					 spending.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had before us in the life of the House of
					 Commons many occasions on which to vote on many things, which are infinitely
					 less important and infinitely less grave than a decision by the Canadian
					 government to deploy Canadian armed forces, and in so doing to become involved
					 presumably in some larger effort, whether it is the gulf war or the campaign
					 against terrorism or whatever. </p>


	<A NAME="T1140"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1140"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1145"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1135"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1140)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it that on these kinds of issues the Liberals
					 want to argue that we can vote on everything else, but when it comes to
					 something really important forget it? When it comes to something that
					 important, the government reserves the right to make decisions without allowing
					 parliament to express itself in the way that it normally expresses itself. It
					 is not as if the motion calls on the government to do something extraordinary
					 or unusual.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All we are asking for is, when it comes to something
					 like the deployment of the Canadian armed forces, that parliament do what it
					 ordinarily does when it comes to legislative actions taken by the government,
					 which is to have a debate providing an opportunity for individual members of
					 parliament to not just put their views on the record in a take note debate but
					 to vote one way or the other. That is what the motion calls for and that is why
					 we support it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support the motion not just for this occasion, but
					 in the context of our overall criticism of the Canadian parliamentary
					 tradition, particularly as it has been practised by the Liberals since 1993, a
					 tradition which has seen the increasing diminution, if it is not a paradox to
					 talk about increasing diminution, of the role of parliament when it comes to
					 foreign affairs and a decreasing use of the House for ministerial and prime
					 ministerial statements. We should not have to rely on question period for an
					 opportunity to deal with these things appropriately.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to say something with respect to what was
					 said by the Alliance members when they were on their feet just before me. They
					 referred to last week's debate on the opposition day motion brought forward by
					 the Alliance. They had a particular take on that debate, which I do not want to
					 let stand unchallenged.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I remember correctly, I think the member for
					 Portage--Lisgar said that the Alliance and the Conservatives supported a motion
					 to have the government act on terrorism, the implication being that because the
					 other parties did not support the motion they were not as concerned as those
					 two parties or did not want the government to act or have the committee look at
					 it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact is there were repeated opportunities during
					 that day to try to get the Alliance, and even the Conservatives who were
					 involved in this, to accept that what the House would agree to was to have the
					 whole subject matter of terrorism and the measures needed to combat it referred
					 to the justice committee. Many times people sought unanimous consent on the
					 floor of the House of Commons, myself included, to have the motion before the
					 House withdrawn and to have a different motion put forward that would refer the
					 subject matter of terrorism and what could be done to combat it to the justice
					 committee. The Alliance refused to have that done.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not play those kinds of games as to who cares
					 more, but they mentioned it. I want to set the record straight that there was
					 unanimity in the House with respect to the need for referring that matter to
					 the justice committee. There was no unanimity on the list of measures which the
					 Alliance attached to their motion, which by so doing had predetermined in a way
					 that was unacceptable to at least three other opposition parties what the
					 committee would discuss or what the outcome of the committee process would
					 be.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to make clear what happened last week. There
					 was some divergence of fact between what the member for Portage--Lisgar
					 reported to the House and what actually happened.</p>


	<A NAME="T1145"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1145"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1150"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1140"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1145)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, I would like to reiterate that we
					 support the motion. We think there should be more and better involvement of
					 parliament in these decisions. It was not an accident that I said more and
					 better involvement of parliament because if the government is to take
					 parliament into its confidence and deal with it in a way that is more
					 appropriate and more inclusive than what it has in the last eight years under
					 the Liberals, then there is also responsibility on the part of members of
					 parliament to reciprocate and to not look for opportunities to score cheap
					 political points on the government in debates about matters this
					 serious.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I think of my Alliance colleagues in this
					 respect. It seems to me that if we listened to them we would think that
					 everything that happened in New York and in Washington on September 11 was
					 somehow Canada's fault. As far as we know, these terrorists, by and large, were
					 living in the United States. They were training in the United States to do
					 these things. It is unfortunate that the intelligence community in the United
					 States and in Canada were not able to determine what was going on and do
					 something about it. However, it is not a failure of Canada any more than it is
					 a failure of the United States and everyone else who is involved. Why this
					 self-loathing by which it somehow becomes Canada's fault that it
					 happened?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are things we could do better. It is fair on the
					 part of the Alliance members to point to out that there are things they asked
					 for in the past that might not have been done. Why are they not bad-mouthing
					 the United States administration for all the things that it did not do up until
					 now? They may say it is because they are the opposition here and not
					 there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the fact remains that what is needed here is
					 not to grind political axes but to identify the problem and suggest ways in
					 which the government could improve upon its policies with respect to things
					 that would prevent terrorism. That is certainly what I would urge all members
					 of the House to do.</p>

					 NDP): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member
					 for Winnipeg--Transcona for his very thoughtful comments and for pointing out
					 the reasons why the New Democratic Party is supporting the Bloc motion
					 today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know about other members, but it strikes me
					 that since September 11, probably 99% of the letters, the e-mails and the phone
					 calls that I have received from people in my constituency of Vancouver East, as
					 well as across the country, have been on the critical issue of what happened on
					 September 11. People are terribly concerned about the attacks that took place,
					 the loss of life and what impact that has had on families and people of the
					 United States. They are also concerned about what the response will be.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It strikes me that there is an assumption out there, a
					 legitimate belief by the people of Canada, that it will be the members of
					 parliament who will not only debate the issue, if Canada is to be involved in
					 sending Canadian troops as part of some sort of effort, but who will also vote
					 in the House. I think people believe that. It is quite astounding that when the
					 debate unfolds, people will realize that even members of parliament have not
					 been meaningfully involved in that kind of process.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The indications are, from what we have heard so far,
					 that the government may not abide by that true tradition of parliamentary
					 practice and democracy of ensuring that members voices are heard so that we can
					 reflect the views of our constituents.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the member for Winnipeg--Transcona for
					 giving some historical lessons about how far we have come in terms of our own
					 practices, particularly under the Liberal government and what it sees as its
					 own practice versus the need to sustain democracy in this very
					 environment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At what point did this change begin to take place? He
					 outlined how during the gulf war there was a vote in the House. Now, 10 years
					 later, we are at a point where we are debating whether or not members will have

				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, answering the last question first, it
					 changed with the Liberals. Respect is due to the Conservatives for the fact
					 that there was a vote in the House on the Gulf war. I do not remember the exact
					 context of that day or what other reasons there may have been, but the fact of
					 the matter is that the House of Commons was consulted in a more meaningful way.
					 That should stand as a precedent which the House should follow, but it is clear
					 that the Liberals do not accept that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister of defence in his speech today talked
					 about the practice of the last eight years. It is clear that the Liberals have
					 a different view of what the role of parliament is with regard to this issue.
					 The minister of defence said that this was a hypothetical situation. We agree
					 and we hope that the House is never faced with such a question. However it is
					 certainly not out of order for us to discuss what the appropriate process
					 should be if in fact certain things happen in the future. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister also asked what would happen if we had to
					 act quickly and the House was not sitting. There would be opportunities even
					 after the fact for the House to say whether or not it approved. It seems to me
					 that the Liberals are just backing and filling and not being honest with us
					 which is to say they are not telling us that it is their policy to exclude the
					 House of Commons from voting on very important matters when they are quite
					 content to have us vote on all kinds of other things.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member said that Canadians expect it of their
					 members of parliament. It would be very hard to explain to constituents the
					 fact that we get to vote on <i>a, b,c, d </i>and <i>e,</i> but when it comes to
					 something really important, we do not get to vote on it. When it comes to
					 something really important, Canadians would expect their members of parliament
					 to have a chance to vote on it. It is one of the ongoing mysteries of Canadian
					 parliamentary tradition that we do not. </p>

				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, I spoke at some length on this last week
					 in the House. I would refer the hon. member to <i>Hansard</i> if he wanted an
					 answer in any great detail as to what we found wrong with the
					 motion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think these circumstances should cause us to
					 throw away our normal practice. Good procedural arguments are still in order
					 even under the circumstances which prevail now. One of the things I found wrong
					 with the motion was that it called upon us to accept in principle a piece of
					 legislation, that is to say the legislation in the United Kingdom, which we did
					 not have before us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our procedure is that at second reading debate, which
					 is a debate in principle, we have the legislation before us. The Alliance was
					 asking us to accept something in principle that we did not even have before us.
					 I found that particularly objectionable on procedural grounds.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may well be things in the list with which we
					 agree and other things about which we have concerns, but the fact of the matter
					 is that it was presented in a way which was open to the charge of political
					 grandstanding. That is a charge which could have been ameliorated over the
					 course of the day if the Alliance members had been willing to accept the
					 repeated requests by members of the House to refer the subject matter to a
					 committee so that today the justice committee could be meeting to talk about
					 it. But no, it was their way or the highway.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Alliance has to take responsibility for the fact
					 that there is, at the moment at least, no process in train for a House of
					 Commons committee to look at the matters that it said were of such serious
					 importance. I agree they are of importance. That is why we and others sought to
					 get the matter referred to committee.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After his trip to the United States, Tony Blair went

					 president of the United States, and he chose to make his first report to a
					 group of Liberal partisans at a fundraiser.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who care about democracy, is that not another

	Madam Speaker, I would agree with the process followed

					 reporting to the British House of Commons. I will take the member's word for it
					 if after his trip to Washington he reported to the House of Commons, that is
					 something that could have been emulated by our Prime Minister.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to make it clear that I do not completely agree
					 with everything Prime Minister Blair of the United Kingdom has said with
					 respect to the events in New York and Washington. However, in terms of the
					 relationship between the executive and the House of Commons and reporting to
					 and involving the House of Commons, the British tradition is superior to the
					 Canadian tradition. I referred to that earlier when I said that even though it
					 was not required to do so, the British House of Commons was given the
					 opportunity to debate the enlargement of NATO which is not something this House
					 was given the opportunity to do.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the motion. It
					 is my privilege to share my time with the very distinguished member for
					 Edmonton North.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting that today we are talking about the
					 process of engaging our military in an offensive action. It is incredible that
					 we are at this point but reality deems that is what we have to do and it is
					 what we will do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We support the government's involvement in military
					 actions if that is what it takes. We totally support it. It is our tradition as
					 a country and it is our obligation as a country. Even though Canada is not
					 where the terrorism acts occurred, Canadians were victims. Our economic and
					 transportation systems were also impacted. It is very clearly our obligation to
					 participate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our obligation to involve the armed forces but it
					 is also our obligation as parliamentarians to participate and do our job. If we
					 are asking the military to do its job, we must do our job. That includes voting
					 on the decision on how the armed forces will be committed, how they will be put
					 in harm's way and put at risk. We did our job in the gulf war. At that time we
					 met, debated and voted on that issue, on whether or not our armed forces would
					 participate in the conflict. We should do it now. It is simply our job and our
					 obligation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As politicians we have an obligation as well to the
					 people in the military, the people whom we will ask to do that job, the people
					 who will fight for us and represent us, and who will maybe risk their lives in
					 Afghanistan. We have an obligation to those people. That obligation is to find
					 alternatives to military action. Military action should be the last action. We
					 have an obligation to do everything we can to find alternatives. That includes
					 exploring economic avenues to resolve these issues. It includes diplomacy.
					 Diplomacy is a key role for us as parliamentarians and politicians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to give an example of a diplomatic effort that
					 has great promise but is now at risk. It is called the Halifax peace forum. The
					 process evolved after several meetings with Palestinian and Israeli diplomats
					 in Canada. Both sides repeatedly said that Canada is in a unique position to
					 help. We are respected on both sides. We are seen as objective and we can do a
					 lot to bring these two parties together in the Middle East. We can build
					 bridges and open lines of communication that are not there now and never have
					 been. From that recommendation by the Palestinians and the Israeli diplomats to
					 Canada, a plan evolved to bring six members of the Israeli Knesset and six
					 members of the Palestinian legislature to Canada to meet with Canadian members
					 of parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting was established. Everyone had agreed to it
					 and it was set to go in Halifax. We had the co-operation of individuals who
					 donated time, money and volunteers. We had groups representing people with
					 Israeli, Jewish, Muslim and Arab backgrounds. Businesses were prepared to
					 contribute goods, services and money. We had the co-operation of the municipal,
					 provincial and federal governments. Even the archbishop of the Catholic church
					 agreed to hold a joint reception for all cultures at Halifax city hall during
					 the forum which was to take place on October 14.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of all this activity the member for Toronto
					 Centre--Rosedale and I joined with a group of MPs from all parties to put the
					 plan together and bring the members of the three jurisdictions together. All
					 sides have agreed and committed. Even as late as this morning diplomats from
					 both sides indicated their strong support and desire to have the forum go
					 forward. They and many other people say now it is more necessary than ever. I
					 read a passage in the <i>Globe and Mail</i> this morning which said: “You must
					 talk to each other, and the sooner the better. That has been the repeated
					 message to the Israeli and Palestinian leadership from U.S. Secretary of State
					 Colin Powell and yesterday by the British foreign secretary and by the French
					 foreign minister”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is evident and obvious that the Palestinians and the
					 Israelis must talk now. However, last night the Government of Nova Scotia asked
					 us not to proceed with the forum at this time. We must understand that Halifax
					 just experienced an onslaught of 10,000 unexpected visitors which strained its
					 system, its emergency measures and every other aspect of it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We respect their request to not proceed in Halifax but
					 it does not reduce or eliminate the need for this forum. We want it to proceed,
					 even if we have to move it.</p>


	<A NAME="T1205"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1205"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1210"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1200"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1205)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that the only way we can proceed now is to
					 move the process to Ottawa. Ottawa is appropriate under the circumstances since
					 September 11. Security is well established here. There is an RCMP presence
					 everywhere on the Hill. CSIS is close by, as is the Hill's own security
					 service. In Ottawa the security measures organizations are familiar with the
					 challenges of state visits and high risk visitors under strained situations.
					 The RCMP, CSIS and Hill security are right here on the spot.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the next few days we will be asking the government
					 to assist us in moving the process, the Halifax peace forum, to Ottawa. I want
					 to point out that this is parliament to parliament, not government to
					 government. The minister and the department have been totally supportive and
					 co-operative. They have helped us bring this together. Without their help we
					 could not have done it to this point. Now we are making a last minute request
					 to them to help us move the process to Ottawa.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time when we are asking our military forces to
					 participate and to perhaps risk their lives, we as politicians must take action
					 to find alternatives and this is an excellent way to do that. We only need help
					 with facilities, logistics and arrangements. I am sure the government can help
					 us although it has helped us in every way it can until now. As parliamentarians
					 we are today debating sending the youngest and the best of the armed forces
					 into harm's way. We owe it to the people of Halifax, Shearwater and Greenwood
					 and to people all across the country to use every diplomatic and economic
					 strategy that we can come up with. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The peace forum is a very modest initiative which will
					 be unique and will open lines of communication and build bridges that are not
					 available now and never have been. If it is to proceed we need the support of
					 all members of parliament and the government. I want to emphasize that this is
					 parliament to parliament, not government to government, and it is a last minute
					 request. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is just simply our job. We are asking the military
					 to do its job and we must do our job. We must vote on the bill and we must take
					 every step we can to find alternatives to military action.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I apologize to my colleague for missing
					 the beginning of his speech, but from the time I did arrive in the House until
					 the end of his speech, I got the impression that what he was seeking above all
					 was for politicians to be able to find some means other than military
					 intervention and for us to address this issue in response to a proposal from
					 the government of Nova Scotia.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would like to remind him, however, and I hope he
					 will take advantage of the response to perhaps provide a more detailed
					 explanation of the part of his speech that I missed, is that the proposal
					 before us at this time is the following: </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Ottawa decides to send troops to provide support or
					 assistance in connection with the events of September 11, we do not want this
					 to be done without a discussion and vote involving each member of the House of
					 Commons. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the purpose of the motion before us today.
					 Perhaps he could explain to me what he said in the first part about his peace
					 plan, about politicians having to do their bit. Despite my assignment as
					 defence critic I am basically a pacifist. Above all else, I want us to be able
					 to solve the September 11 problem and the fallout from it in a peaceful manner.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fear, however, and this is what we need to be
					 prepared for, that if ever there is an American response and the Americans ask
					 us for military assistance, we will need to know what action to
					 take.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we in the Bloc Quebecois want to avoid, and what
					 is addressed by our motion, is that the Prime Minister and the cabinet alone
					 will decide on behalf of all Canadians and all Quebecers. What we want is not
					 just a discussion in the House, but a vote as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to know from my colleague what
					 he thinks of the Bloc Quebecois motion.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.
					 I did say at the very beginning that we support the motion. We should do our
					 job. It is part of our job to vote on these issues and I did take the
					 opportunity to explain the peace forum. The Bloc member on our peace forum
					 steering committee has been one of the most knowledgeable, effective and
					 interested members of parliament on the committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to read from <i>Hansard</i> of September

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically there was a motion before the House in 1990,

					 harm's way. We did our job then. We should do it now.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, first let me commend the member for
					 Cumberland--Colchester for his initiative with respect to the peace forum. I
					 know that there was a blending of the two issues: the diplomacy that we as
					 members of parliament should be looking at and working toward in order to try
					 to resolve some of the issues of our globe today and, however, I know the
					 member also has some strong feelings with respect to the motion before us
					 today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a question for the hon. member. He quoted a
					 motion that was put forward in September 1990 by the then government, the
					 Conservative government of Brian Mulroney. The right hon. member for Calgary
					 Centre was instrumental in that. In fact it was a very transparent process.
					 There was debate and there were briefings within the House and the member was a
					 part of that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it the member's opinion that the reason why that is
					 not happening now is that the government of the day feels that it in fact has
					 all of the answers and does not have to bring to the Chamber the debate and the
					 necessity to ask for support from the opposition members for any types of
					 actions that may go forward with respect to troops being put into the Middle
					 East? Is it the philosophical mindset of the government that it does not need
					 any other information from any members of the opposition?</p>

					 remember for the rest of our lives where we were, who we spoke with first and
					 these kinds of things. This was a world changing event.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although you and I, Mr. Speaker, were here in 1991 when
					 the gulf war occurred, and it certainly was a frightening time as well, it
					 seems to me that this is perhaps the culmination of many of those events. We

					 what happened and because of the events in New York a couple of weeks ago. I do
					 believe that take note debates just will not be good enough.</p>

					 George W. Bush is not just saying “let us take note” of something. This
					 parliament should be seized with what we can actually do rather than just
					 taking note, and what we do here is vote. That is part of our job and our
					 responsibility.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague just said how important it is. If we are
					 calling on the military to do its job, then so should we be doing our job, and
					 our job is to vote on and participate in this. Whether the government thinks it
					 has all the answers or does not need a whole lot of input is immaterial right
					 now. It is absolutely immaterial.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I were on the government side, I would want to know
					 that I had the safety, the security and the blessing of all hon. members of the
					 House because in numbers is that strength with which we are all able to go
					 forward.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we just look at the idea that we do not really need
					 to vote on it, and the minister this morning said we do not really know if the
					 House of Commons will be sitting at such a time, that is just inane. Surely we
					 could think ahead on something. So much of what has happened over the last
					 couple of weeks is due to us thinking ahead a little bit, but not a whole lot.
					 We have had clues. We had ideas as to what could happen in some of these
					 attacks. No one could have guessed it would happen on that day or in that way,
					 but we should all sharpen up and be ready “in the event of”, because there are
					 enough clues coming forward. It is no surprise now that something will
					 happen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague talked about this amazing initiative that
					 he has undertaken and will continue to participate in, the peace forum. What a
					 great idea that is: to look at diplomatic ways to ensure that military force
					 will be used only as a last resort.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government, especially in the United States
					 yesterday, talked about the wisdom of economic sanctions or cutting off the
					 taps of amazing amounts of profit flowing to these groups. That is a good
					 thing, to look at economic freeze out and the diplomatic moves we can make, but
					 it seems to me that it is evident and inevitable that sooner or later there
					 will have to be some use of military force. Why is the government not thinking
					 ahead on this thing, saying that if such and such happens then let us be ready
					 and let us have the umbrella, strength and protection of this place to be able
					 to move forward and move forward agreed on how important it is? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the idea of take note debates like we saw
					 last Monday, where it was not voted on, the Alliance then brought forward a
					 motion which I thought was very good. On Tuesday it was voted on but defeated.
					 We just have to wonder how forward looking the House of Commons is.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I said earlier that voting is what we do here,
					 that is part of our job and our responsibility. A vote is nothing more than
					 standing up and being counted on something. People participate like that in
					 elections. In the House people participate like that on behalf of their
					 constituents.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am amazed when I talk to people on the streets or in
					 coffee shops or whatever. Everyone is horrified. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A common question we are being asked is what we will do
					 about it. The government says it is taking action. We try to appreciate that in
					 the fullest sense of the word. Receiving an endorsement from parliament for any
					 kind of action is the number one step. I do not know for what reasons that is
					 not happening, </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the gulf war crisis the member who spoke before
					 me and I were both here at the time. We remember it as a very frightening time.
					 He alluded to the fact that we talked about it several times in the House of
					 Commons.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October 23, 1990, the House passed a motion
					 condemning Kuwait. On November 28 and 29 the second motion was brought forward.
					 War was declared on January 16, the very evening I was to give my speech. It
					 was a huge shock for the entire world that war had been declared. Later that
					 week the second motion was passed</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Partisanship politics is so ridiculous and unnecessary
					 at a time like this. It is sad to watch. My colleague talked about the forum
					 and quoted from the <i>Globe and Mail</i> where it said, and I agree 100%, that
					 “we must talk to each other”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this place we talk through each other, we talk past
					 each other, or we make some grandiose statement thinking that was wonderful and
					 maybe we will be on the news tonight. We must talk to each other, not just in
					 this place but at home and on the news. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must talk to each other, those of us in Canada with
					 those in the United States. It could have easily happened here and we are
					 afraid to say that it might because they will not strike the same place twice
					 in the same manner. We need to be thinking ahead.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we get our brains together and begin to really
					 talk to each other, that will be the most important message that comes out of
					 this. Let us look at Mayor Giuliani of New York and the amazing turnaround in
					 that man's life over the last six months. What is he doing? He is talking to
					 people. He is at ground zero holding press conferences and keeping people up to
					 date. He has done a marvellous job, simply because he is talking to people.
					 That more than anything else will be the lesson we need to learn from
					 this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this was an important issue to parliament in the
					 past it should be important again. In 1994 the special joint committee on
					 Canada's defence policy issued a report entitled “Security in a changing
					 world”. Is that not a prophetic title? We have a changing world now or a
					 changed world, and we need security to the maximum. There were recommendations
					 made concerning the role of parliament. At page 58 the committee
					 noted:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<td><small>At the time of the Gulf War, for
						  example, the government of the day introduced and debated a motion regarding
						  the deployment of our forces to the combat theatre.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a whole lot has changed in the ensuing years in
					 terms of how important that committee report was under a Liberal government. We
					 need to make sure that we are together on the deployment of forces. The
					 government would be very wise not to spurn this. We need to come before
					 parliament. We need the strength and security of all of us working together in
					 a non-partisan way.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Edmonton North mentioned
					 a question within the context of her fine address in which she asked what we
					 were doing about it. No matter where one lived in Canada what happened on
					 September 11 affected people in different ways. In the Toronto <i>Star</i>
					 there was a section which showed people at one of the ports of entry in my
					 constituency, North Portal, where the golf course has different holes on
					 different sides of the border.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will describe to the hon. member the fear of people
					 in my constituency that has nine border crossings. I do not believe any other
					 member's constituency has as many. If someone intends to escape from Canada and
					 get by U.S. customs, the border patrol, the highway patrol and the county
					 forces are notified. When it is the reverse and someone is coming back into
					 Canada, many of these nine border crossings do not have an RCMP detachment for
					 25 or 30 miles and the RCMP may be at another scene. We have no means of
					 stopping anyone. The people in my constituency are becoming very nervous about
					 the border situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the hon. member not agree that national security
					 goes beyond the deployment of troops, that it goes beyond other items within
					 our society?</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, that is an excellent point. Military force
					 should be used as a last resort, but there are many things that we could and
					 should be doing before that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tightening our border crossings is essential. Part of
					 the friendship we enjoy with the United States is free and full access back and
					 forth. In times like these when there are people who live along those borders,
					 it is essential to make sure that we have very strong and secure
					 borders.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noticed in today's newspaper that after its 1993
					 election victory the Liberal government cancelled a high level and high powered
					 security agency that was to do something good and practical. When all a person
					 needs to do when crossing a border is to sign up for tee time at the golf
					 course through North Portal, surely there is more to it than that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need more than the minister responsible for CCRA
					 ranting in the House about what a great job it is doing when people are living
					 in fear near border crossings across our country. They are concerned about how
					 easy it is to get into Canada and how difficult it is to get into the United
					 States. We must work together on that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is something concrete the government could, should
					 and must do to say that it has taken action by tightening up that border
					 crossing. That is something the government can point to and be proud of when it
					 says that it has at least made some difference and has taken some action in
					 this regard.</p>

					 (Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Roberval today
					 introduced a motion which this House is debating as part of an emergency
					 debate. I would like to show Quebecers, the people watching us today, why, on
					 Tuesday, September 25, we are having a debate of such urgency with respect to a
					 situation that has gone on for nearly two weeks now and why the Bloc Quebecois
					 felt compelled to demand this debate in the House so that members, regardless
					 of their affiliation, may vote on a situation of such importance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to reread the motion with the amendment by
					 the member for Saint—Jean:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right">
</td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>That
						  this House urge the government, in any reprisals taken in reaction to the
						  terrorist strikes in New York City on September 11, not to commit Canadian
						  armed forces in any offensive action nor any financial resources until the

</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The moment the House resumed sitting on September 17,
					 the Bloc Quebecois drew to the attention of the Prime Minister the need for
					 members, who are the representatives of the people, to have an opportunity to
					 vote on such an important decision. Here again is the question my BQ colleague
					 and member for Laurier—Sainte-Marie put to the Prime Minister during oral
					 question period. It reads as follows:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Mr. Speaker, the House was consulted
						  after the decision had been made or without a vote.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small> I ask the Prime Minister if they
						  could do a little more, ensure that all parliamentarians exercise their
						  responsibility, and have the House vote on the government's proposal when the

</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the question put by the leader of the Bloc
					 Quebecois. The Prime Minister's answer reads as follows:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Mr. Speaker, the House of Commons is
						  consulted. The House of Commons speaks. The members of all parties may have
						  their say, and a consensus is expressed at that point.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>This is the procedure that has always
						  been followed. I do not see why we should change it under the circumstances,
						  but we will see. If it needs changing, we will change it.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the strength of this statement by the Prime
					 Minister, the representatives of the Bloc Quebecois have always thought that
					 the Government of Canada supported it. In view of the urgency of the situation
					 and regardless of the military and economic decisions Canada has had to make in
					 the past, today we have a threat on our doorstep. From what the Prime Minister
					 says, the terrorists could even be inside our country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are faced with an emergency situation. Canada's
					 whole economic, democratic and parliamentary systems, not to mention provincial
					 institutions in Quebec and in the other Canadian provinces, are jeopardized by
					 unscrupulous people. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is an urgent one and this is why the Bloc
					 Quebecois wants members of this House to have a say. We represent constituents
					 who every day have to put up with the problems posed by this major terrorist
					 crisis. This crisis first affected our American neighbours but, as we can see
					 on a daily basis, it is also affecting us from an economic point of view. There
					 have been layoffs in the airline industry and we can see what is happening with
					 the aircraft parts industry. There is a domino effect. We know what companies
					 are going to announce Pratt &amp; Whitney has already made such an announcement
					 while Bombardier is rethinking its investment strategy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are finding out that this terrorist attack has a lot
					 more impact than one would think on Canadian and Quebec industry. Therefore, it
					 is only normal that constituents send messages to their members of parliament
					 so that they can represent them in this House, ask questions and, more
					 important make decisions and vote on the issues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with my colleagues that we are not here merely
					 to make speeches. We are also here, and this includes both opposition and
					 government members, to make decisions and to vote. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point I wish to inform the Chair that, from now
					 on, all Bloc Quebecois members will share their time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an urgent situation. On behalf of our
					 constituents, we are asking for an emergency debate on two major types of
					 action. The Bloc Quebecois is asking the government for a vote to be held on
					 any military intervention that could endanger the lives of Quebecers and
					 Canadians, and on any amount that could be spent on protection, armaments and
					 required actions.</p>


	<A NAME="T1230"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1230"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1230)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is always money involved. We understood that
					 quite clearly when the leader of the Bloc Quebecois put the question to the
					 Prime Minister on September 17. There will be decisions made. As I explained
					 earlier, even the Prime Minister raised the possibility of reviewing that
					 practice, what was acceptable and in order. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The American congress voted on the amounts to be
					 devoted to military strikes and interventions. Those who voted were elected
					 representatives, our neighbours, those who were suffering through this terrible
					 situation and who were victims of this brutal and inhumane attack. Nonetheless,
					 this whole situation is happening on our doorstep, in the neighbouring country.
					 I take this opportunity to express my most sincere sympathy</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this very instant we even think, the Prime Minister
					 himself said it, that there could be terrorists on our own territory. It is not
					 too late. History will determine if we were efficient and if we were taken
					 seriously. More and more observers think that Canada is not being taken
					 seriously because of the way it reacted to this crisis. However, history will
					 be the judge of that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except we, as members of parliament representing our
					 constituents, must make the right decisions for them. We must, and the Bloc
					 Quebecois felt obligated to raise this debate, agree to this motion so that all
					 the citizens of Quebec and of the rest of Canada fully realize that this is
					 very important. In such a serious situation that may affect us, even within the
					 borders of our provinces and of Canada, we should be able to make informed
					 decisions. Most of all the members of parliament who the citizens have elected
					 to represent them in the House should be able to vote on the issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the hand, the olive branch that the Bloc
					 Quebecois is holding out to the Liberal government. We have acted quite
					 responsibly and we have been able to respond by supporting the government when
					 the time came to make some decisions in this crisis. In such serious situations
					 that may affect the lives of Quebecers and Canadians who are in the military
					 and who might be sent overseas during the strikes or that may affect the
					 budgets, our citizens' money, perhaps it is time for the government to think
					 about the important monetary decisions that imply major investments, sums of
					 money that will be allocated to counter the effects of terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are asking the government, both in the amendment and
					 in the main motion, for a vote to be held in the House. That is not asking too
					 much and it is reasonable, given the situation and the gravity of this crisis,
					 that the government take another look at its approach. All the more so because
					 when it was in opposition, the Liberal Party questioned the government's
					 position in its interventions during the gulf crisis. An amendment was moved by
					 the current Deputy Prime Minister, then in the opposition. This amendment
					 referred to military support for operations in the gulf, and read as
					 follows:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>That this support shall not be
						  interpreted as approval of the use of Canadian Forces for offensive action
						  without further consultation with and approval by this House.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was what the Deputy Prime Minister, then in the
					 opposition, had to say. In his speech in support of his amendment, he said, and
					 I quote:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Liberals insist that before Canadians
						  are called upon to participate in any offensive action, such participation must
						  first be brought before Parliament and voted on here in the way it was done at
						  the time of the Korean conflict.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These were the terms used by the Deputy Prime Minister,
					 an important and influential minister and an influential member of the Liberal
					 Party. Why is the Liberal Party, which is now in power, applying a double
					 standard at such a serious time? The Minister of National Defence went through
					 Canada's involvement in all the conflicts worldwide. The fact remains that we
					 are now facing an urgent situation following a serious attack perpetrated on
					 our American neighbours which threatens us on our own territory.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a situation which is unique in the history of

					 parliamentarians and a vote in the House.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague from the Bloc
					 for a very interesting speech. There is no question in my mind that I concur
					 that these matters should be dealt with in the House of Commons. We should be
					 given the opportunity to have our say and to vote on many aspects of the
					 incidents stemming from the tragedy on September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like the hon. member to expand on something he
					 mentioned, which is the impact this catastrophic event has had on jobs. I speak
					 of workers in the airline industry, the aerospace industry and even beyond
					 those industries and into the hospitality industry as well as taxi drivers. The
					 taxi driver who brought me here from the airport told me that he had three
					 fares that day from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. when I was picked up. These people do not
					 have anything to fall back on in terms of EI or many of the other benefits that
					 other workers might have if they found themselves temporarily
					 unemployed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would the hon. member agree that one of the things we
					 in the House should be contemplating is an emergency measures package for
					 workers impacted by this catastrophic event with special emphasis on those
					 workers who do not have access to EI? Would he see fit to temporarily amend the
					 EI Act and use some of the overwhelming surplus in the EI fund to offset the
					 impact that this catastrophic event is having on workers such as taxi drivers
					 and part time employees in the hospitality industry?</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, in answer to my colleague's question, I
					 will give the example of Quebec, though any other region of Canada could be
					 referred to.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of avionics, aerospace and aeronautics, Quebec
					 has become a major player. The Greater Montreal area is now considered to be,
					 after Toulouse, the second largest focal point for this type of industry in the
					 world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Needless to say, the fact that Canadians and people
					 around the world refuse to or are afraid of flying has tragic consequences on
					 the industry as a whole, not only the travel industry, travel agencies and
					 airline industries which are directly hit, but all those who support that
					 industry, namely aircraft producers and manufacturers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States Boeing has made some important
					 decisions. Bombardier will do the same in the days to come. They are going
					 through a process of analysis. Of course, it also concerns companies
					 manufacturing airplane parts and there are many in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the domino effect, the avionics industry is
					 directly linked to international tourism. My colleague clearly understands that
					 there are communities and territories which rely largely on international
					 tourism, which is the case of Mont-Tremblant in Quebec and many other areas in
					 Quebec and elsewhere in Canada. Such areas depend on great numbers of
					 international tourists coming to our regions, and those people have cancelled
					 their reservations throughout the hotel and restaurant network.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the domino effect to which my colleague was
					 referring, the taxi industry is also affected. It is a huge operation.
					 Appropriate funds will have to be committed, because if we accept the complete
					 annihilation of that part of the Canadian avionics industry, airlines and
					 international tourism, the terrorists will have won. Though they may not have
					 anticipated it, the terrorists must certainly be happy that their attacks have
					 almost completely paralyzed the airlines industry as a whole and international
					 tourism. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will need spending and emergency budgets which, I
					 hope, will urgently be voted by the House. As the Minister of National Defence
					 said, the issue is a somewhat complex one because often parliament is not
					 sitting. However, I am convinced that not a single member of parliament would
					 refuse to participate in an emergency debate followed by a vote, even if
					 parliament had to be called back to Ottawa to debate an emergency situation
					 concerning all of Canada.</p>

					 (Charlesbourg—Jacques-Cartier, BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, 14 days ago today some barbarians, some
					 crackpots undertook and carried out the biggest terrorist attack in history.
					 The shock is past, but the pain is still present. The shock is past, but the
					 anger is still present. The shock is past, but emotions are still present.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a close friend, a neighbour, a fellow member of
					 the great family of western civilization is affected in this way, we cannot
					 remain indifferent. No one here in this House is indifferent. All of us who
					 have been democratically elected to represent the people of Quebec and Canada
					 have a duty to speak our minds on the matter placed on the order paper by the
					 Bloc Quebecois today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has been said many times, it is not just the U.S.
					 that has been affected, but all of the so-called liberal democracies, liberal
					 in the philosophical meaning of the word of course, have been attacked. The
					 first response to this murderous attack, as democracies, is to show the
					 strength of the democratic system, the power of the democratic system and the
					 attraction of living within democratic societies because of their intrinsic
					 values.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past certain people have thought they could take
					 advantage of what they perceived to be the weakness of democracies. They saw
					 them as weak and ready to crumble. They have paid dearly for this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we must not only make use of this crisis to
					 continue our democratic practices but, I respectfully submit, we must also make
					 use of the situation, of these troubled times, to improve our democratic
					 institutions, to make them better, to ensure that the public, the nations of
					 Quebec and Canada and their citizens may feel that they are involved in every
					 decision that has to be taken.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way of doing so is the one proposed today by the
					 Bloc Quebecois, which is to ensure that parliament is even more closely
					 associated with important decisions, with the fundamental and crucial decisions
					 that will have to be reached here.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event of military action by the Canadian forces,
					 the lives of young men and women from Quebec and Canada will be affected. Each
					 of us in this House will have to carefully ponder the consequences of such a
					 decision. There is no decision more important for an elected assembly in any
					 country than the decision to send or not to send its young people to face the
					 rigours and the dangers of a military conflict. That is the main reason it is
					 necessary, essential and fundamental to involve the elected members of this
					 House in such a decision.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What will and must be decided concerns not only the
					 future of Quebec and Canada but also the future of the whole planet. Therefore,
					 every member of this House ought to be involved in it. That is not only for the
					 philosophical reasons I stated earlier but also for reasons of
					 <i>realpolitik</i>.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister would have tremendous clout if, when
					 he goes to meet with the leaders of the Commonwealth and those of the
					 Francophonie, he had the support not only of cabinet and the Liberal Party, the
					 government party in Canada, but also of this House. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such support would give him much greater clout in the
					 positions he would be called on to defend internationally. It would ensure that
					 Canada is listened to even more than it is now, and God knows that it is not
					 always listened to as much as some would claim.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By doing so, Canada would not be a leader,
					 unfortunately, but it would only be following the normal and necessary course
					 in a democratic society and institution. There are several examples.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is the case of Argentina. There is also the case
					 of France, where the prime minister, Lionel Jospin, stated that should it
					 become necessary to make commitments on France's behalf, the executive could
					 not make them without consulting the national assembly and the Senate.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In England, Tony Blair recalled parliament a few hours
					 after the deadly attacks. After meeting with U.S. president George W. Bush, he
					 travelled to Brussels to report to his colleagues, heads of state and heads of
					 government, within the European Union. Upon returning to London, he asked to
					 meet not only with members of the labour party, the governing party, but also
					 with the leaders of the opposition parties. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion is based on the kind of common sense shown
					 by the Liberals on this issue when they were in opposition. My colleague, the
					 member for 
					 Argenteuil--Papineau--Mirabel said it well. At that
					 time, the current Deputy Prime Minister, then leader of the Liberal opposition
					 in the House of Commons, insisted that the House vote before troops were sent
					 to take part in the gulf war. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge all my colleagues in the House, particularly my
					 Liberal colleagues with whom I have had the opportunity to exchange views and
					 who are very concerned with the present situation, and rightly so, to support
					 this motion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This motion rises above any partisan considerations and
					 is aimed at ensuring the broadest consensus possible with regard to Canada's
					 response, that is the response of Quebecers and Canadians, to the murderous
					 attacks in Washington and New York. We must show the whole world that a
					 democracy such as the one we have in Quebec and in Canada is the strongest
					 system of government and that it will resist the deadly attacks perpetrated
					 against all democracies on September 11.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, of course I commend my colleague for his
					 speech. Earlier we heard the Minister of National Defence say something really
					 incredible. I do not know if he is going through or listening to the same
					 things as we are since September 11, but he is talking about a hypothetical
					 situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is taking only one fact, that is whether military
					 personnel are being sent to one specific location. This is the only
					 hypothetical question. The Americans have already deployed military personnel.
					 Yesterday, Great Britain also deployed military personnel.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it incredible that we are being told that the
					 situation is hypothetical. We are not in a hypothetical situation. From what we
					 are seeing, we are probably in a war. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would therefore like to ask my colleague this
					 question. The Argentine government has offered to co-operate with the United
					 States, provided its participation in a military response is submitted to a
					 vote in parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also France. If there is a need to make
					 commitments on behalf of France, they could not be made by the executive
					 without consulting, of course, the national assembly and the Senate. Such major
					 countries as France and Argentina believe it is necessary to have debates and
					 votes on situations such as these.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are we to think about Canada when the government
					 only wants to have take note and consultative debates and does not want to hold
					 a vote on such major issues?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the intent of the motion is to ask that
					 the House not limit itself to take note debates, but to hold votes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to appeal one more time to our Liberal
					 colleagues. I can see that the member for Scarborough is listening to me
					 attentively. I had the opportunity to travel with him in Israel, where
					 democracy is under attack. While we were there, there were terrorist attacks.
					 We were able to observe the vitality of Israeli democracy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appeal to his sense of democracy. I have had the
					 opportunity to discuss different subjects with him for many hours, including
					 how democracies should react to such attacks. I appeal to him and to his
					 colleagues to pressure the government to allow them to vote too. I know that
					 they would like to vote on this. I know that Liberal members would like the
					 opportunity to give their perspective. I know that they are as concerned and as
					 worried as other members of the House. Before sending the finest young people
					 of Quebec and Canada off to battlefields located thousands of kilometres away,
					 I know that they will want to have their say.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I hope that they are pressuring the government. I
					 hope that they are pressuring their colleagues to have a chance to have their
					 say. After all, they are members too. They are just as concerned as we are on
					 this side.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask him this. A few speeches this

					 part of this government that when it was in opposition, when the gulf war was
					 declared, it hounded the Conservative Mulroney government daily with questions
					 and statements to have a vote held in the House? The situation before us is
					 quite similar.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does he not find it cynical that this government, which

					 as we are having today?</p>

					 Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank the House for the opportunity to
					 participate in this important debate. The hon. member for
					 Charlesbourg--Jacques-Cartier has stated that while it does provide some
					 difficulties for us all, there are those of us who consider parliament to be a
					 very significant institution in our country where important matters of state
					 get debated and voted on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However I must take some distance from my colleague. I
					 would like to outline why the motion is premature, hypothetical and absent of
					 facts. The motion states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>That this House urge the government,
						  in any reprisals taken in reaction to the terrorist strikes in New York City on
						  September 11, not to commit Canadian armed forces in any offensive action until
						  the House of Commons has been consulted and has voted on the
						  matter.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a hypothetical motion. At this point in time we
					 have not been asked to participate in any action whatsoever. Any hypothetical
					 request is always a dangerous position to be in, particularly if ultimately we
					 as a government have to make a decision.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also an absence of facts. Is there anyone in
					 the Chamber who has a full grasp of the facts? I read media accounts, as do
					 other members. I do not regard media accounts as facts. I have not been privy
					 to any CSIS briefing or any military briefing which would enlighten me.
					 Therefore I am in a similar position to all other members in the Chamber that I
					 am not in possession of the facts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two weeks have passed since the crisis and there is a
					 propensity to jump to conclusions. One of the conclusions is that Canada is a
					 terrorist haven. The facts seem to be somewhat different, in that virtually all
					 the terrorist activities to date originated in the United States. Nevertheless
					 that seems to be a fixed conclusion by many members of the media. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another fixed conclusion is that our refugee laws are
					 lax. I witnessed a lawyer on television the other night who has several clients
					 in jail on refugee related issues. He was expressing a great deal of
					 frustration about having his clients in jail on what he considered an absence
					 of clear and hard evidence of why they should be kept in jail. That did not
					 seem to make much of a dent in the forgone conclusion that our refugee laws are
					 lax.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been asked to engage in an armed response to
					 this initiative. I ask hypothetically whether the armed response would also
					 include intelligence gathering. Is intelligence gathering part of the armed
					 forces response or is it not part of the armed forces response? Are we being
					 asked to comment on that? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are being asked to comment on that, do we need a
					 parliamentary resolution every time CSIS decides to engage in clandestine
					 intelligence gathering activities both within our borders and outside our
					 borders and in turn to share that material with other agencies?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen a number of conclusions that our
					 legislation is inadequate. Indeed there are gaps within our legislation which I
					 believe the Minister of Justice will be addressing. We have been urged to adopt
					 legislation similar to that of Great Britain and the United States. They are
					 pieces of legislation that some might argue are quite draconian and made no
					 difference on September 11.</p>


	<A NAME="T1300"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1300"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1300)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament is being urged to have a vote on this
					 matter. As I said, I find the motion somewhat premature. We do not have a great
					 deal of facts with which to work, and it is a hypothetical motion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that parliament has not voted
					 directly on any wartime resolution since World War II. We did not vote on
					 resolutions regarding Korea. Resolutions regarding the gulf war had to do with
					 resolutions of the United Nations rather than voting to go to war.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliament has many ways in which it can guide
					 government. Take note debates are one of those ways. I heard hon. members
					 opposite diminish the value of take note debates but I do not take that view.
					 Take note debates are extremely important and give parliamentarians some
					 opportunity to suggest to government various ways to think about specific
					 issues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have the opportunity to engage in debate on
					 days like today where opposition parties get to set the agenda for the
					 day.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is of course scrutiny on a variety of committees
					 and members get opportunities to make their voices heard before
					 government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultimately, there is the confidence vote to which every
					 government is subject. If parliamentarians are absolutely convinced that the
					 government is going in the wrong direction, then presumably they can move
					 confidence in the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last debate similar to this was on the Kosovo
					 issue. The then leader of the Reform Party made six conditions for the
					 deployment of troops, and they were somewhat instructive.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first condition was that parliamentarians should be
					 satisfied that there was a serious international threat and that diplomatic
					 efforts to resolve it had failed. I would not argue that there is a serious
					 international threat. I am not convinced, however, that diplomatic efforts are
					 exhausted, although they do seem to be very close to being
					 exhausted.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second condition was that parliament should be
					 satisfied that as far as possible there was multinational support for military
					 action. Again, that condition, frankly, seems to be met, that there is
					 international support for action, particularly in the NATO
					 countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third condition was that the government should be
					 satisfied that there was a workable plan and strategy for military action. At
					 this point in time, I do not believe that there is a workable plan and strategy
					 for military action, so that in fact would not meet the condition.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth condition was that parliament must be
					 satisfied that any plan for military action was a well defined mission and was
					 a clear definition of Canada's role. Without a workable plan and strategy, I do
					 not see how we have a well defined mission or a clear definition of our
					 role.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fifth condition was that parliament must be
					 satisfied that the role expected was within our fiscal and military
					 capabilities. The question is: “What is being expected of us?”</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sixth condition was that parliament must be assured
					 the command and control structure was satisfactory to Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically conditions three through six have not been
					 met in my mind. I go back to the original point that the motion is hypothetical
					 and premature, and we clearly do not have a lot of facts. The greater
					 likelihood is that this action will be far more clandestine and will be based
					 on intelligence rather than overwhelming military might.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain members of the House, particularly the Privy
					 Council will be briefed and some members of the Privy Council will be more
					 briefed than others. Necessarily there will be a closing of the circle because
					 we do not want to broadcast any activities that we might be engaged
					 in.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that hon. members opposite, and indeed
					 members in all parts of the House, would not want to be advertising what
					 actions Canada would take.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also have the issue of the unintended consequences
					 of signalling a differentiation in resolve. If we take this vote now and the
					 actions do not start for a month, two months or three months or if the actions
					 go in a direction different from what we initially thought we were voting on,
					 we may find ourselves in a very difficult and awkward position.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the issue is: Will this vote be binding on the
					 government and, if so, how is it binding on the government?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My position on this motion is clearly that it is
					 hypothetical, premature and that there is an absence of facts. I forgot to
					 mention that I am splitting my time.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I listened intently to the speech of my
					 hon. colleague across. The events of last week did two things to the people of
					 Canada. First, it brought us all together in support of our neighbour's
					 initiatives to the south. Second, it raised the issue of tolerance. Canadians
					 have known for at least a century that this country is made up of immigrants
					 and the one thing we do not want to do is repeat the mistakes of the past.
					 Therefore, I, like all members of the House, promote tolerance at a time like
					 this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to make some comments on the hon. member's
					 comments on immigration. The House knows that I have raised immigration issues
					 over this past year, certainly on issues of screening. Even if Bill C-11 was
					 passed this very day, including what the government had said it would do to
					 improve the situation, I believe there would be no improvement. Unless there is
					 a will to put the time and effort into ensuring that we have the relevant data
					 to properly screen the people coming into this country, we will keep making the
					 same kinds of mistakes we are making today. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even without the bill in place, there could be a rule
					 that government put more money toward hiring more people. I am told that many
					 of our overseas offices do not communicate with each other. In fact, in Canada
					 our own departments do not communicate with each other. That has to change.
					 CSIS, RCMP, other security agencies and national defence have to work together.
					 Does my hon. colleague see screening as the focal issue when it comes to the
					 security of this country?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, my colleague asked two questions: one with
					 respect to the support for our U.S. brethren and the second with respect to
					 tolerance in this country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the first question with respect to support for our
					 U.S. brethren, at this point our response as a nation has been exemplary. In
					 many ways Canadians have stood shoulder to shoulder with the citizens and the
					 government of the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second question is with respect to tolerance and
					 immigration issues. I believe our Canadian society has some difficult decisions
					 to make, and we may actually make some wrong decisions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I listen to my answering machine in my
					 constituency office, I am somewhat alarmed. It is a bit disturbing to hear some
					 of those comments. I join with the Prime Minister in saying that I would turn
					 my back on those constituents. These are not attitudes that build our
					 society.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the issue of screening, the hon. member
					 is probably right, that this will be where the rubber hits the road. These are
					 very difficult things to do. People do not walk into this country with
					 <i>T</i>'s painted on their foreheads saying “I am a terrorist”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do have differential data and resources to apply
					 that data as well as assessment procedures. I know my hon. colleague has people
					 come into his office where decisions have or have not been made by CSIS or by
					 immigration officials, which leaves everyone scratching their head.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of these events, I am sure that there will be
					 a differential attitude toward screening issues.</p>

					 Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, first I would like to reiterate that
					 Canada is committed to the fight against international terrorism. I think we
					 have clearly demonstrated our support both for the United States and the
					 international community with regard to this issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue before the House is does parliament have a
					 role in this. I think emphatically that, it does have a role. To demonstrate
					 that I would like to review a few points.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the government came to power, it has placed a
					 premium on consulting with and soliciting the views of members of the House,
					 particularly where matters of military and defence issues are at stake. Many of
					 us have participated as recently as last week in those debates. The government
					 does not take lightly its prerogative to initiate military action and deploy
					 members of the Canadian forces. It views the opportunity to discuss these
					 issues in parliament as a crucial step when we are looking at decision
					 making.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From Iraq to Kosovo to central Africa, members of all
					 parties in the House have had the opportunity to voice their views on what
					 Canada's response should be in the face of various international crises. I
					 believe that is the way it should be, and that is the way it is.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, however, we must preserve the ability
					 of any government to respond rapidly, once all views have been heard and the
					 time to act is upon us. We must know when to set aside our partisan differences
					 and speak with one voice as a nation. Our solidarity in support of decisions to
					 deploy troops not only increases the legitimacy of our actions in the eyes of
					 the Canadian public and in the international community, but it lets members of
					 the Canadian forces know the people of Canada are behind them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's approach to consulting members of the
					 House regarding deployment of troops has been well documented. The government
					 recognizes the importance of hearing from all sides when such important issues
					 are at stake. It goes above and beyond its duty to solicit them. I would like
					 to provide some examples of this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has held innumerable consultations and
					 debate, both in the House and at various committees on all aspects of foreign
					 and defence policy issues. Going back as far as 1994, special emergency debates
					 were held regarding Canada's current and future peacekeeping roles in
					 Yugoslavia, Haiti and Rwanda. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One year later another series of debates were held on
					 whether to extend the mission of the Canadian forces serving in UNPROFOR in
					 Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. At that time the Minister of National Defence
					 himself suggested that Canadian participation should periodically be reviewed
					 thereby giving parliament the opportunity to consider our defence commitment at
					 regular intervals. In fact the House has had innumerable opportunities to
					 discuss our deployments in the Balkans right up to and including Canada's
					 participation in NATO led air campaigns in Kosovo. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As many of us will remember, these consultations took
					 many forms. The government held several debates on Canada's reaction and
					 subsequent response to the humanitarian crisis that was breaking out in Kosovo.
					 At the same time, the Standing Committees on National Defence and Veterans
					 Affairs and Foreign Affairs and International Trade received numerous briefings
					 from senior officials from various departments, even as those events were
					 unfolding.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The value of debates and deliberations is not to be
					 underestimated. I think there has been and continues to be the belief that a
					 broad consensus emerges in the House which gives Canada the legitimacy it needs
					 when the time comes to make the difficult decisions to intervene. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me reiterate that the government does not take
					 lightly the decision to deploy Canadian troops in any mission. We value the
					 input provided by members on all sides of the House as well as deliberations at
					 the various committees. Being a member of the Standing Committee for National
					 Defence and Veterans Affairs, the committee has been and continues to be seized
					 by these issues, including the issue of readiness of the armed
					 forces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those issues have come before the House on several
					 occasions and each time the government has made it clear its commitment to
					 preserving the vital role that parliament plays in times of crisis. That has
					 been demonstrated both in words and in deeds. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, today we are reaffirming the position that has
					 been taken by several ministers as well as the Prime Minister. The government
					 is fully committed to consulting parliament on the situation as it unfolds
					 before us. </p>


	<A NAME="T1320"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1320"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1320)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As others have said, no decisions have been made by the
					 United States nor has any request been made for formal Canadian forces
					 participation in any operations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all understandably very concerned about the
					 horrific events that took place on September 11 and their aftermath. We have
					 had the opportunity to express these concerns three times in the House since
					 the House resumed. We saw the Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign
					 Affairs carry that message, the Prime Minister yesterday in his meeting with
					 President Bush.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A resolution passed in parliament. We have had some
					 references to the gulf war. Supporting the deployment of the Canadian troops
					 during the gulf war was the measure taken in support of the various United
					 Nations resolutions at that time. As the campaign on terrorism evolves, it may
					 be necessary to consult parliament further on the issue of deploying Canadian
					 troops much as the government did during the gulf war. However that time has
					 not come. I would agree with my hon. colleague that it is hypothetical at this
					 time. We have not yet been given a motion as to the specifics of what would be
					 asked for.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members of the House need only in my view look at
					 history to be reassured of the role they play in contributing to the foreign
					 policy of the nation. I believe that the role of parliament is to debate it and
					 to make sure that members provide the necessary input for any future government
					 actions.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to all the speeches
					 made since this morning and I sense that the Liberal member, whom I know quite
					 well, is somewhat receptive to the motion. While he could not directly support
					 it, he seems to have left the door open. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second week of debate. I wonder if he could
					 explain to us why given the extraordinary situation in which we find ourselves,
					 the parliamentary committees that are the most appropriate venues to look at
					 this issue, the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Standing
					 Committee on National Defence, were not convened by the government? Meanwhile,
					 we are having a debate here today that was initiated by the Bloc Quebecois, an
					 opposition party. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the hon. member find it normal that, contrary to
					 what it said in its 1993 red book, the party in office is not getting
					 parliamentary committees involved in the study and review of the current
					 situation?</p>

				  </b>

	First of all, Mr. Speaker, as you know, all parties get
					 together to put forth names for the composition of those committees.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, let me say that the steering
					 committee of the Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs,
					 of which I am a member, met last week. We discussed a number of issues with
					 regard to the present crisis.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though formal appointment of members of the
					 committee has not occurred, rather than being idle the members who currently
					 reside on that committee met as a steering committee and had the opportunity to
					 discuss a number of these issues. I know that a member of the Bloc was in
					 attendance and I think there was an opportunity to look at some priority
					 issues, not that they are binding, necessarily, on the future composition of
					 the committee, but given the nature of the discussion I think it would be
					 fairly safe to say that the intent and the direction the steering committee
					 looked at would probably be simply endorsed, hopefully, because a number of the
					 members of the steering committee, particularly on the side of the opposition,
					 indicated that they would be back when the committees are formally comprised, I
					 would suggest probably within the next few days or so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However I think it is important to know that business
					 has not stopped, at least in terms of the defence committee. The member's
					 question was a very valuable one.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the government member
					 if it is not time to show these terrorists what a democracy is all about. We
					 live in a democracy with a parliamentary system. Debates must be held, not just
					 take note debates, but real debates that conclude with a vote.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the hon. member find it normal that the Bloc
					 Quebecois has to use an opposition day to propose a motion to debate such an
					 important issue? This should be a given in parliamentary system that is based
					 on democracy? We are forced to use this day to present such a motion in order
					 to have a debate followed by a vote on this most important matter. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we see the deployments currently being made all
					 over the world by the United States and Great Britain we have no choice but to
					 say “There must be a vote in the House of Commons”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the comments I wanted to make. I would like
					 to hear those of the hon. member. It is important that all of us, as members of
					 parliament, have an opportunity to vote on the issue.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, there seems to be a misunderstanding that

					 the deployment of CF-18s, our discussion with the Americans through Norad, the
					 work at NATO with regard to article 5 or the deployment of frigates.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present time we do not have a formal request.

	Mr. Speaker, in my name and on behalf of men, women and
					 children of Laurentides, I wish to address my first words to the families who
					 lost a loved one, a friend, a colleague, a boss. To all those who survived
					 these tragic events, I express my sincere condolences and I assure them that my
					 thoughts and prayers are with them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said that, as representatives of the people in
					 our respective ridings, we rise in the House on behalf of our constituents.
					 This has never been truer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I always considered myself as a woman who speaks and
					 lives with words like “peace”, “tolerance”, and “openness to others”. However,
					 since September 11, I discovered that I could use a language tinged with anger
					 and fury. Within a moment, I had thoughts that I normally would never have had.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One must not be distracted by acts of extremists such
					 as those we witnessed. We must push to the limits our will to build a peaceful
					 world. There we will find all the signification of this motion proposed by my
					 colleague from Roberval. I will read it to the benefit of my
					 constituents:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>That this House urge the government,
						  in any reprisals taken in reaction to the terrorist strikes in New York City on
						  September 11, not to commit Canadian armed forces in any offensive action until
						  the House of Commons has been consulted and has voted on the matter.
						  </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why should parliament vote on this issue? We have the
					 government's reaction and I hope that, at the end of the day, we will have been
					 able to convince it to support our motion. Democracy itself is at stake
					 here.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a political party is forced to use its opposition
					 day to convince the government that a vote should be held before Canadian armed
					 forces are committed in any action, it means that something is very wrong in
					 parliament. When the government is incapable of making the commitment we are
					 asking it to make because it is afraid that it may not have enough time, it
					 means that something is wrong. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last eight years, the House of Commons has
					 been recalled to deal with issues far less important than this one. I remember
					 sitting during a weekend to deal with issues such as jobs, salaries, labour
					 negotiations and back to work legislation. To say now that there would be
					 hesitation to recall the House to deal with an issue as important as sending
					 Canadian troops to war is absolutely ridiculous. I cannot believe it, and
					 neither can my fellow citizens.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will tell the House what happened in my riding last
					 weekend. Like all members, I must attend certain events in my riding on
					 weekends. Last weekend I attended a function in a residence for the elderly,
					 which was celebrating 25 years of operation. The residence provides social
					 housing to senior citizens. I sat at the same table as the director of the
					 residence, a woman, who told me that I had to do something, that I could not
					 let our soldiers be sent to war like that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another woman sitting at our table said “My son is in
					 the army and I do not want to see him go to war without us knowing exactly what
					 is going to happen. You are my representative and it is your responsibility to
					 decide and to vote”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What am I supposed to say to her? That the government
					 will make its decisions unilaterally without consulting us? It makes no sense,
					 especially on a policy issue. We must not let that happen. As elected
					 representatives, we have to face the situation. </p>


	<A NAME="T1330"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1330"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1330)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a fundamental issue. If we have to raise the
					 question of a vote in the House on the commitment of armed forces in a war
					 against Afghanistan or some other country and I think opposition parties agree
					 on this then I am at a loss.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me remind the House a few facts. In the 1993 red
					 book, we could read this:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>We will continue to support democracy
						  and respect for human rights worldwide and will provide for a more open foreign
						  policy-making process.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>A Liberal government will also expand
						  the rights of Parliament to debate major Canadian foreign policy
						  initiatives—</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this is quite clear and it is not precisely
					 what is happening right now. Here is another quotation, this time from the 1997
					 red book:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>An independent, effective Canadian
						  foreign policy cannot be achieved without the active participation of
						  Canadians, through public and non-governmental organizations.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It speaks for itself.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not like to see our troops sent over without
					 knowing what their specific role will be. We know very well that our military
					 do not have numbers that compare with American, French, or British troops. We
					 should be realistic about this and do what we can with what we have.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, I would not like and I would not accept that
					 Canadian troops be sent over there as cannon fodder. We must not allow this to
					 happen. We must absolutely know how they will be used and what their role will
					 be. As we know, our armed forces have been evolving more to take on a
					 preventative role, acting as peacekeepers, and involved in foreign aid. Our
					 armed forces are not offensive. They could very well be but they have not
					 evolved that way. We have not been involved in a war for I do not know how many
					 years. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must know exactly what role is expected of our
					 Canadian forces and we must reach a decision together with the people we
					 represent. They want to be consulted. If people elect representatives to
					 parliament, it is so that they can speak on their behalf.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to now I have seen myself as the voice of the riding
					 of Laurentides and I want to continue being the voice of voters in my area.
					 This holds true for all of us here in this Chamber, no matter which party we
					 belong to.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of our differences of opinion on some issues,
					 on an issue as important as a war, it is imperative that we be the true voice
					 of our fellow citizens.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, people in Laurentides are extremely
					 concerned, and rightly so. Certainly, if the government were to agree to our
					 motion and vote for it, it would act in a true democratic spirit and with great
					 open mindedness. It would show all of us here in this Chamber, who represent
					 five different parties, that democracy is alive and well in this parliament as
					 it is in other parliaments.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like our position to be taken into account. I
					 want the debate to be peaceful and for everyone to have a say when the time
					 comes for us to make a decision as important as sending Canadian troops, our
					 young men and women, to the front. We will have to make this decision together,
					 based on what our fellow citizens have told us. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would say that, right now, the Bloc

					 This motion we have put forward aims at protecting our democracy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we protect our democracy? When we have
					 representatives, as we do to in the House of Commons, it is a matter of
					 standing up and debating what the government can do. People have to understand
					 to what the word “executive” refers. It refers to the Prime Minister and his
					 ministers. Would they be the ones deciding? No, that is not what democracy is
					 all about.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current international threat of terrorist activity
					 prompts me to ask a very important question. I would like the hon. member to
					 tell us: How could we get the people who are at home, all the people in Quebec,
					 in my riding of Châteauguay and across Canada, to take immediate action to
					 convince government members that our motion is essential to protect democracy
					 and ought therefore be supported?</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague from
					 Châteauguay for his question. It is clear that people are going to react
					 anyway. That have already started to do so. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I receive phone calls. I receive letters at my office.
					 I receive representations from peace groups. It is obvious that actions will be
					 taken to ensure that all members of this House are well aware of these
					 concerns. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People want to know exactly what role the army is going
					 to be called upon to play. They do not want to send our young people to the
					 front without knowing where they are going. People have a lot of concerns with
					 regard to this whole situation because they fear that, when the Americans
					 finally say they need us, the government will send our troops without saying a
					 word, without even asking questions about our army's role in terms of the
					 number of soldiers that should be sent over there or without asking if we agree
					 to send our young people to the front. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talked about democracy earlier. I would like to say
					 this. There are countries with parliaments similar to ours. I am thinking of
					 Argentina. The government of that country has offered to co-operate with the
					 United States, but on the condition that its participation to any military
					 action be put to a vote in parliament. The same goes for France. There will be
					 a vote by the executive, but the national assembly and the Senate will have to
					 be consulted. The same goes for Germany also.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A country such as Canada that claims to be a great
					 democracy is unable to consult. Let us lead by example and let us be a true
					 democracy. Let us make sure that members have the right to make their own
					 decision and vote on this issue. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, last Sunday I attended a presentation on

					 ridings of the lower St. Lawrence and 150 members of the militia. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All militiamen asked the same question: “Will we have a
					 clear mandate of non-liability?” </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, we saw the Americans opinion of Canada.
					 Yesterday, the Prime Minister came out of the meeting and told us that the
					 Americans had set no requirements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As representatives of all our constituents and of all
					 those people in the military, if we do not get the opportunity to make sure
					 they receive a specific mandate, a clear mandate on what will happen, whether
					 it is yes or no to our participation, I think we must at least find out what
					 the situation is. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case, the federal government will be much
					 stronger if it supported by this motion. Therefore, I would like to know if the
					 member considers that it is important for our military and our militia to know
					 exactly what their government will commit them to? </p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, of course it is essential that the
					 military personnel know where they are going and it is also essential to make
					 some provision for this. One cannot come out of a meeting with the president of
					 the United States and say “He did not ask me anything”, and not prepare for
					 anything. Come on, this is not the way this works.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government must do some prevention, be prepared to
					 face the situation and also carry out consultations. The government, the Prime
					 Minister and the Minister of National Defence will have to see what our
					 capabilities are and not make commitments with both eyes closed and both hands
					 tied behind their backs. That is out of the question. We must protect our
					 people and our military forces. We cannot send them to the front without
					 knowing exactly what role they will be playing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At present, we know very well how things are going in
					 Afghanistan. They have an army; they have a different mentality. They are
					 prepared to commit suicide for their cause. This means we must pay attention
					 and be careful. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe we must also rely on the role of
					 international courts, of NATO and the UN. We must work together with all these
					 organizations in order to ultimately achieve positive results, instead of
					 rushing in without any consultations and without knowing where we are going. We
					 simply ask that democracy be applied here in parliament.</p>

					 la-Chaudière, BQ): </b>

	 Mr. Speaker, this being the first opportunity I have
					 had to speak in the House since the September 11 attacks in New York and
					 Washington, I wish to join with all those who have already offered their
					 condolences to the friends and families of the victims.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may be a Quebecer but, in circumstances such as
					 these, we become citizens of the world. What happened in New York and
					 Washington could have happened here. It could happen anywhere. Everyone hoped
					 it would not, but the extent of the devastation is unbelievable. It all
					 unfolded on television; we heard the words of witnesses to the tragedy and they
					 moved us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These attacks took place in the United States but, as I
					 said, they could have happened elsewhere. Basically, it was democracy that was
					 attacked not a country, but the democratic values we all defend were
					 attacked.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of the Sub committee on Human Rights and
					 International Development, I am particularly concerned about this aspect of
					 human rights, not just here or in the United States, but throughout the world.
					 The confrontation which we dread and which will take place will affect civilian
					 populations. The victims of the events in New York and Washington were
					 primarily civilians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As wars and methods of attack evolve, there are
					 increasing numbers of civilian victims, innocent victims who have nothing to do
					 with the will of their leaders, or leaders of groups, as seems to be the case
					 here. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to human rights, it is fairly easy to
					 agree that these issues are related to democracy. Sometimes, when I have a
					 speech to make, I have adopted the habit of consulting a dictionary. For
					 instance, the entry for the word democracy says that it comes from the Greek
					 “demos”, meaning “people”. “Democracy” is defined as follows: “political
					 doctrine holding that sovereignty must belong to all citizens”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find the words “all citizens” very significant. What
					 have we seen across the way for the past week? The Prime Minister says that
					 they have the situation in hand, that he is speaking regularly to officials
					 throughout the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is even speaking with the president of the United
					 States, who has no memory of their discussions, because he neglected to mention
					 him in his speech on Thursday. Democracy is based on respect for the freedom
					 and equality of citizens, of citizens everywhere.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, the House leader of the Bloc Quebecois
					 moved that there be a debate and a vote before committing our armed forces.
					 Military resources naturally mean human resources and financial resources, but
					 we have to bear in mind that those resources should never be deployed any which
					 way. A military offensive action is the last option which should be considered,
					 though it has to be considered. No options should be dismissed. They say that
					 “if you want peace, you have to prepare for war.” Planning is good.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before deploying forces, a decision has to be taken.
					 Based on the meaning of the word democracy, this decision should be taken by
					 all citizens. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did the government react to that proposal? The
					 first speaker was the Minister of National Defence, who spoke about four or
					 five options. His first argument struck me. He said it was contrary to what had
					 been the practice of this government over the last eight years. </p>


	<A NAME="T1345"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1345"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1345)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, it is the opposite. It seems to me that, even
					 if it involved changing this practice in such an extraordinary situation, it
					 ought to be contemplated. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not repeat what other colleagues and the hon.
					 member for Laurentides said, but I will read commitments made in the red book,
					 which clearly stated that before committing important military resources to
					 offensive actions, there would have to be a debate followed by a vote in the
					 House. This was one of the promises upon which the government was elected the
					 first time. It was elected on that basis; that is what the government was
					 saying. Besides, when they were in the opposition, the Liberals said the same
					 thing. Again, I will not repeat the amendment moved by the deputy prime
					 minister to a motion by the then minister of foreign affairs, who is now a
					 member of an opposition party, the Progressive Conservative Party.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is happening here? We are witnessing a situation
					 where people who are in opposition promise to do something, but once they are
					 in power, they do the opposite or do not meet their commitments. How then can
					 young and ordinary citizens be attracted to politics if election promises are
					 not held? I will not talk about the GST and other issues like free trade, about
					 which the government changed its mind, they have already been pointed out, but
					 this is a matter of utmost importance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People listening to me could obviously say: “Yes, but
					 it is impossible to predict such an event. It certainly could not be predicted
					 or mentioned in a red book written more than eight years ago”. However we were
					 in a quite similar situation in 1990 with the gulf war. In all that connections
					 could be made with the current confrontation. However, that is not what the
					 government intends to do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November 29, 1990, the current Deputy Prime Minister
					 tabled an amendment which said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>This support shall not be interpreted
						  as approval of the use of Canadian Forces for offensive action without further
						  consultations with and approval by this House.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say again, the Bloc Quebecois, this is my
					 understanding of our position, has given and is giving its support to the
					 Canadian government in order for it to study, discuss and give its opinion to
					 influence the opinion of the American authorities on this matter. We must of
					 course give our support to the fight against terrorism, to a world war against
					 terrorism. We have to do that. However should the use of military means be
					 contemplated immediately? Worse, should the use of such means be considered
					 behind closed doors? For so-called strategic reasons, we cannot mention what we
					 will do. It is somewhat like baseball. It will be a hit and run situation,
					 where they will hit first and consult later. This is not the way things should
					 be done.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, I believe the greatest paradox is that
					 the Canadian government, through its Prime Minister and its external affairs
					 and national defence ministers, says that it cannot vote for the proposition
					 put forward by the Bloc Quebecois. Whereas the country that has been the most
					 concerned up till now, the United States, through its president, obtained a
					 resolution from its two houses, the senate and the House of Representatives.
					 The president, the one responsible for the strategy, has the sanction of his
					 parliamentary authorities but not Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Laurentides reminded us that France has
					 agreed to support the Americans but that it intends to consult the national
					 assembly before making a decision with regard to the deployment of its armed
					 forces. The same goes for Germany, for Argentina, and I am sure it will be the
					 same most everywhere.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, the Minister of National Defence referred
					 to the constitution when he said that we were a representative democracy. He
					 wanted to show that that is the way it is and that is the way it has always
					 been. I must say that, a few moments ago, someone made a mistake.</p>


	<A NAME="T1350"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1350"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1350)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not hold it against the member who made that
					 mistake. Contrary to what a Liberal member said, there was a vote on the issue
					 of the Korean War. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our society has evolved since 1867. I should remind
					 members of certain facts. Women could not vote in 1867, but they can today. The
					 only people who could vote under the representative democracy of that time were
					 landowners. Today, all taxpayers have the right to vote. Even the voting age
					 was lowered to 18. Now, as elected representatives of the people, we would only
					 have the right to talk. Parliament would be a place for discussion and nothing
					 else. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is something else that I deplore and that I find
					 rather incredible. Parliamentary committees, namely the national defence
					 committee and the foreign affairs committee, are not even used to discuss this
					 issue. It is now my turn to urge all members of the House to support our motion
					 that says that a vote must be taken in the House before offensive military
					 resources are deployed. </p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I listened intently to the speech of my
					 colleague and I would like to ask him a very simple question.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the government's lack of leadership with respect to
					 the vote issue not simply a reflection of its lack of an action plan? The
					 Minister for International Trade, for example, said there was an economic
					 slowdown. The Minister of Finance said there might be a deficit. One day, he
					 says there might be a deficit and the next he says the opposite. After all
					 these statements the Prime Minister himself said that the economy was doing
					 very well and the situation was not so bad.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could we say that the democratic deficit we see in the
					 House and the government's lack of leadership in this regard are demonstrations
					 of the fact that the Canadian government is now totally disabled by the Prime
					 Minister's lack of leadership on this issue?</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I may not be as harsh as my colleague, the
					 member for 
					 
						Kamouraska--Rivière-du-Loup-Témiscouata--Les Basques, by saying
					 “Is there a lack of planning”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we can understand that no one could have
					 anticipated such an unpredictable situation. Clearly, there is a lack of
					 leadership, but I believe there is most of all a lack of influence. We saw it
					 in the United States, where the president, to a certain extent, treated the
					 Canadian Prime Minister as someone who did not have to be consulted, as it was
					 a foregone conclusion that he would give his support because we are
					 family.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somehow, we are the United States of America. In that
					 regard, I can understand that it is not the right time to squabble with the
					 president of the United States, though this attitude is somewhat bizarre.
					 Nevertheless, it proves that the Canadian Prime Minister does not have the
					 influence he claims he does.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as far as planning is concerned, since almost
					 two weeks have passed since the events which took place, I believe that we
					 should do everything in our power, my father used to say “Everything could be
					 turned upside down”, to start planning. However, my main criticism of the
					 government at this moment is its total lack of transparency. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the following question

					 Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will recall the events which took place in
					 Quebec during the summit of the Americas. The Prime Minister, seeing himself as
					 the great champion of democracy, said that he would do everything he could to
					 ensure that there would be democracy in the Americas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the hon. member not think that there is a lack of
					 consistency of the part of the Prime Minister, since he committed himself
					 openly to act as a champion of democracy, while today he is going the opposite
					 way?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-51573"></A><a HREF="#Int-51577"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-51571"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Antoine Dubé:
				  </b>

	Absolutely, Mr. Speaker. However, in terms of
					 consistency, I would say that the Prime Minister is consistent, because I did
					 not find him very democratic and very transparent during the summit of the
					 Americas in Quebec. Quite the contrary. It may have been the case in the
					 speeches with the presidents, but apart from that, we did not feel that the
					 Prime Minister was concerned about this issue or that democracy or respect for
					 the peoples made him lose any sleep.</p>

					 world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Norma E. Walmsley and Ms. Suzanne Johnson-Harvor
					 created MATCH in 1976 because they wanted to work with others to improve the
					 lives of poor and marginalized women in countries in the southern
					 hemisphere.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Canadians we should be proud of the strides MATCH
					 has made in giving hope to thousands of women in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean
					 and South America. The efforts of MATCH over the past 25 years to support
					 self-directed development by women in the developing world has led to new
					 generations of women being aware of their basic human rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fellow members should know that in Sri Lanka MATCH and
					 its partners are working to promote awareness of human rights, good governance
					 and democracy. MATCH is also working in other parts of the world to provide
					 valuable Canadian expertise.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today the Government of Canada and the Canadian people
					 congratulate this special Canadian organization on its 25th anniversary. We
					 wish it many more successful years.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, Canada's health care system is failing its

					 revelation to the thousands of Canadian seniors who require specialty
					 care.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The need for specialized care rises dramatically for
					 Canadian seniors as they reach the age of 75. Many require specialized care on
					 a daily basis to live a comfortable and pain free life. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Medical Association has charged the
					 government with systematically underfunding specialty care. The government is
					 neglecting its responsibility to Canadian seniors and their families.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The health care system should not fail those who need
					 it most. Canada's senior citizens should not fear growing old in their own

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Jeanette Holden, a researcher at Queen's
					 University, is leading a large scale multidisciplinary team that is
					 endeavouring to identify the genes involved in the susceptibility to autism

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research has demonstrated that, with intensive therapy
					 in their preschool years, children with autism are indistinguishable from their
					 peers on test scores by school age.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A screening program could identify high risk infants,
					 allowing them to receive the treatment they need and ultimately lead to the
					 possible prevention of this condition.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Holden and her team deserve congratulations and

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a year of existence, the efforts and
					 entrepreneurship of its founding members have already gained recognition.
					 Télécentre has earned national recognition as well as an international award at
					 the 3rd edition of the Quebec entrepreneurship competition.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The international aspect of Télécentre will enable it
					 to establish business connections with France, as well as to maintain and
					 develop its links with the Belgian local television stations that served as
					 models for the creation of this work co-operative. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These distinctions have made the team's first season
					 very special and will certainly give them a good impetus for their
					 second.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I congratulate these young entrepreneurs on the
					 successful completion of their project, and take this opportunity to point out
					 the contribution made to it by COGECO, a cable company.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the nation's 400 park wardens have been

					 the National Parks Act as a result of a decision by the labour department. In
					 Jasper National Park alone, wardens have been unable to act on any of the 900
					 violations that have been witnessed. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One incident this summer highlighted how ludicrous the
					 situation has become. A diligent park gate attendant saw a pool of fuel after a
					 diesel tanker pulled away. A warden two kilometres away answered the call but
					 his enforcement powers had been neutered. He could not get involved with
					 enforcement. The warden followed the visible stream of fuel from the diesel
					 tanker through the entire park, waiting for the RCMP to show up and deal with
					 the environmental mess, but nothing was done.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heritage minister must agree that wardens need
					 their enforcement responsibilities returned. I ask the labour minister to rein
					 in her department. A little common sense would save our parks.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, counterterrorism law and policy should be
					 organized around five foundational principles.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the struggle against terrorism should be a
					 cornerstone of both domestic and international human security policy. It should
					 mobilize parliaments, governments civil society and security forces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, a clear and principled policy requires clear
					 and principled thinking. We must jettison the notion that one person's
					 terrorist is another person's freedom fighter. Rather, the principle must be
					 that one democracy's terrorist is another democracy's terrorist and that
					 terrorism, from whatever quarter and for whatever purpose, is
					 unacceptable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, it must be clear that this is a war against
					 terrorism and not against Islam or any religion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, the struggle against terrorism should explore
					 and exhaust a multi-layered strategy of diplomatic, juridical, financial,
					 informational and related strategic initiatives short of a military
					 response.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, any military response must comport with the
					 principles of international humanitarian law: the doctrines of necessity,
					 proportionality, protection of civilians in armed conflict and the
					 like.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a word, the new transnational network of super
					 terrorist suicide bombers is an existential threat that requires clear,
					 principled thinking and comprehensive policy and strategy.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I give special thanks to the Thompson Aboriginal

					 Cree bilingual school is the most dynamic yet.</p>

					 superintendent Dave Hutchinson said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking at a recent conference in Winnipeg, Stephen

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The executive assistant to the Minister of Canadian

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An exhibition that was planned well before the events
					 of September 11 can in no way be construed as a political event. However, its
					 cancellation constitutes a vote of non-confidence in the public. It is assuming
					 that Canadians and Quebecers can not distinguish between Arab art and
					 terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would have been such a good opportunity for this
					 government to put its money where its mouth is. When the Prime Minister went to
					 a mosque to reassure Muslim Canadians that other Canadians were tolerant, did
					 he believe what he was saying? If so, then he must ensure that the Arab
					 exhibition takes place on the dates planned this fall.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many pesticides are still registered in Canada that are

					 keeps promising a revamped pesticide act, but 30 years after the first act was
					 tabled Canadians are still waiting.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the 1993 election campaign the Prime Minister
					 pledged in his red book that a Liberal government would introduce new pesticide
					 legislation. Six years later, with no legislation on the books, the auditor
					 general criticized the government for its pesticide management and called on it
					 to overhaul the system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1999 Speech from the Throne the Liberals
					 promised to address the potential health risks presented by pesticides. In 2000
					 I asked the Minister of Health when Canadians could expect to see the long
					 awaited legislation. The minister said it was forthcoming. In 2001 I asked the
					 minister the same question and he told me it was coming soon. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians are tired of waiting. The time for honouring

	Mr. Speaker, since the September 11 attacks, the Bloc

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following his meeting with President Bush yesterday,
					 the Prime Minister committed a faux pas, a major blunder.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the Prime Minister realize that by, reporting his

	Mr. Speaker, yesterday I had a speech to make and I

					 because, if we want this international crisis not to affect Canadians too
					 strongly, we must rebuild the confidence of the business community, following

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is for the Prime Minister. Did he put the

					 first line of attack against terrorism?</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the UN has two special courts in the

	Mr. Speaker, the question of substance is whether the

					 international laws he wants to obey. A coalition, no matter how broad, cannot
					 simply take the law into its own hands. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need the Prime Minister to invoke article 35 of the

	Mr. Speaker, first, international law was invoked by

					 United States or other countries who were under attack is authorized by article
					 51 of the UN charter. That is the position that the European Union and others
					 have taken as well. It is not inconsistent with international law.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, as the hon. member knows, there is no
					 international court at the moment nor is the person accused in anyone's

					 feelings, their thoughts of this historic moment. For the members who had not
					 had the opportunity to express their condolences, this was another mechanism by
					 which they could do so. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In total, 24 hours of debate took place and 85
					 different members of parliament spoke on September 17, 18 and 20.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's debate is the fourth on the U.S. tragedy in the
					 first six days of sitting of the House since we returned after the summer
					 recess. That does not include members' questions and statements under Standing
					 Order 31, some of them as late as today, regarding this terrible
					 tragedy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, I know that Canadians have been pleased
					 that their members of parliament have been debating this issue in the House of
					 Commons. Indeed, my constituents spoke to me about my own remarks when I was in
					 my riding over the weekend. More particularly, I received a scroll signed by
					 thousands of people, at the Rural Expo and International Plowing Match, in
					 which Canadians expressed their wishes of sympathy and solidarity, which I
					 intend to present to His Excellency the Ambassador of the United States of
					 America.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government's respect for parliament and the views
					 of parliamentarians on foreign policy issues reflects its red book number one
					 commitment to expand the rights of parliament and to debate major foreign
					 policy initiatives.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We on the government side oppose today's motion because
					 it, first, breaks with Canadian parliamentary practice and it deals with a
					 hypothetical situation. Notwithstanding what has been said, there has been no
					 troop deployment in a theatre of action as of yet, and there has been no
					 request in that regard, as we all know.</p>


	<A NAME="T1510"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1510"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1515"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1505"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1510)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that it would set an unworkable precedent
					 tying the hands of government when it comes to the timeliness and effectiveness
					 of deployment of Canadian forces, whether in peace time or
					 otherwise.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Canadian parliamentary system the responsibility
					 for troop deployment lies with the government. Since 1950 there have been 50
					 peacekeeping operations of various sizes. In most cases parliament was not even
					 consulted at all, and the previous government failed to allow any voice in the
					 initial decision to deploy Canadian forces in the lead up to the 1991 gulf war.
					 It is important for Conservative members of parliament to know this.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it is important to point out that there was no
					 parliamentary consultation about our entry into the Korean war. Even in 1939
					 there was no resolution declaring war on Nazi Germany.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parliamentary approval was shown in 1939 through
					 support for the Speech from the Throne and the defence estimates. It is a far
					 cry from the consultations we are now carrying out.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, there was no vote and no consultation at all
					 about the declaration of war against imperial Japan. </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, our government has changed all
					 that. We changed the previous government's approach and other governments
					 approaches too. We sought the views of parliamentarians on major policy
					 issues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all remember the paper produced by the parliamentary
					 committee in 1994 and 1995 concerning the role of our Canadian Armed Forces and
					 our foreign policy. It was an excellent report. It was the role of this
					 parliament and its committees. We have ensured that parliament has a
					 voice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had many special debates, which in
					 parliamentary jargon are called take note debates. There was one as late as
					 last Thursday. Were there to be a troop deployment, I commit myself today, on
					 behalf of the Prime Minister and the government, to have such a debate
					 again.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question of combat troops outlined in today's
					 motion is clearly hypothetical. As late as yesterday, Canada was not even
					 formally requested by the United States, not even informally, for such a
					 participation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present time there is no UN, NATO or U.S.
					 request to deploy Canadian troops to respond to the events of September
					 11.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said earlier, the Prime Minister promised, and I
					 made the same commitment, that parliament would be consulted through debates in
					 the House. I would also like to remind the House that, in the past, there was
					 no vote on any of our peacekeeping missions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me also add that today's motion by the Bloc is
					 almost identical to the motion also put forward by the Bloc on April 19, 1999,
					 concerning Kosovo.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, things have not changed. The Bloc is reiterating
					 what they said in 1999 and the government is answering the same way it did the
					 first time around. Of course, this is a different parliament so, technically,
					 this is the first time it has to deal with this issue. However, as I said
					 before, we all realize that it is about the same issue.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The energies of the House are best directed at
					 considering how to respond to the U.S. tragedy, not through engaging in
					 procedural wrangles.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore urge all my hon. colleagues to vote against
					 the motion brought forward by the Bloc.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the government House leader is telling us is that

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is important to point that out. In his own
					 riding, he will have to answer to members of the armed forces, their families
					 and concerned citizens who will be telling him: “Look, you cannot make such a

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, does he intend to listen to what the people of his

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, she should not try to make me say what I did
					 not say. I never said that the government will be making a decision, and I

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do intend to consult the House if troops have to be

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there any precedent in the Parliament of Canada for
					 either house endorsing or granting a resolution or permission to the executive
					 branch to engage in a military action? He mentioned the second world war and I
					 am wondering about other actions such as the first world war, Korea, et
					 cetera.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would he be willing to entertain a general resolution
					 of support for the executive in whatever decision that it needs to take similar
					 to that recently passed in the U.S. congress. It did not take the power out of
					 the hands of the legislature but allowed the legislature to support the
					 executive in these military actions.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I will deal with the second proposition in
					 case I do not get around to the first one for reasons of time. In terms of a
					 general resolution of whatever nature the McGrath committee report of 1985
					 permits the opposition to propose motions in the House on anything. The
					 government does not automatically defeat these motions. As a matter of fact we
					 supported a number of them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the hon. member across and his colleague want to
					 indicate support for the government on any issue, which I wish they would at
					 all times as a matter of general principle on this or any other issue, they are
					 quite free to do so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of the consultation and votes in the past
					 there have been a variety of forms. In the majority of cases there was no
					 consultation at all. There were cases where parliament was recalled, an issue
					 was mentioned in the throne speech and the House voted on the throne speech.
					 That constituted a form of consultation. In other cases it had to do with
					 voting under estimates of the defence department and so on. There were a
					 variety of ways in which that has manifested itself in the past.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I listened to the hon. government House

					 this issue in detail and to put their condolences and remarks on
					 record.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However with respect to actual consultation and input
					 the Prime Minister referred in question period to the fact that he had read all
					 the comments. That is speculative and it is a bit reminiscent of the

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government House leader will recall that in October
					 1990 there was a government order put before the House of Commons, in which he
					 participated, where the House of Commons was asked specifically among other
					 things about the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi forces from
					 Kuwait. It went on to allow for a vote which is the exact request on this
					 supply day.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the government House leader recall participating

					 so?</p>

					 happen to think it was a meaningful contribution. I am sure the Prime Minister
					 read what was said, as he said he did, and considered it for what it was
					 worth.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the government order voted on, there was a

					 put by a member of the Alliance earlier today stating that the opposition is

					 (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a little liberty with
					 the actual wording of the motion before the House today and talk about response
					 rather than retaliation because I have been increasingly concerned about
					 reports in the press about Canada's alleged lack of preparedness in the event
					 that terrorists resort to chemical and biological warfare weapons.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members may remember from earlier interventions that
					 I have made in the past, I am in fact in a former life an expert in chemical
					 and biological warfare weapons and their development. I wrote at one time what
					 was considered the definitive book on the development of these weapons during
					 the second world war. It came out in 1989 and still remains on the syllabus of
					 most military academies across North America, if not across the
					 world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason it would be a Canadian that writes such a
					 book is because Canada was the first to do experiments on the development of
					 biological warfare weapons. The very first field trial to occur anywhere in the
					 world occurred on Balsam Lake in Muskoka in 1940. It was conducted by Sir
					 Frederick Banting who was the inventor of insulin.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of the war Canada went on to develop
					 various types of germ and biological warfare weapons including the mass
					 production of anthrax. This was done at Grosse-Ile downstream from Quebec City.
					 The main research station was in Suffield, Alberta, where Canadians later in
					 co-operation with the British and Americans developed various types of weapons
					 including experiments with botulinus toxin, tuleremia, ricin and various other
					 weapons. The reason for this was because during the second world war it was
					 feared that the Nazis would employ chemical or biological warfare weapons but
					 in fact they did not. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the post-war period this research continued in
					 Suffield and in various other parts of Canada and continues to this very day.
					 The important point to bear in mind is that Canada not only began in this field
					 before any other nation but it continues to be a major player in this form of
					 research, the idea being that we have to know the weapons to develop the
					 countermeasures. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians have developed the most sophisticated
					 automatic detection machine for determining whether biological warfare agents
					 are in the atmosphere. We lead the world in this. It has been with a lot of
					 concern that I read the newspaper and see reports suggesting that Canada has no
					 expertise in this field, which is simply not true.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More important, because of my background and expertise
					 in the history of the development of this kind of weaponry, the Minister of
					 National Defence and the Solicitor General of Canada asked me in 1999 to
					 consult with their officials and review the state of Canada's preparedness
					 regarding the use of biological or chemical weapons by terrorists. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two ministers put at my disposal experts from their
					 ministries. I had a meeting that involved people from the solicitor general's
					 office, the defence department and Emergency Preparedness Canada. There was a
					 representative from the biological and defence review committee and there were
					 others. They were very candid with me and they appreciated that they did not
					 personally have the kind of expertise that I could bring to the table on this
					 issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I produced a report that found there was a disconnect
					 between Canada's expertise in the use of countermeasures against this type of
					 weapon and the possibility of a civilian occurrence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1999, I should explain, all western nations had
					 become very alarmed about the possibility of a CBW terrorist threat. CBW stands
					 for chemical biological warfare. The reason was because there was an attack
					 with nerve gas in the Tokyo subway system in 1995 in which a few people were
					 killed and a lot of people were injured. That event sent a chill around the
					 world. It made all major western nations realize that they were probably very
					 vulnerable to this type of attack and that the new age terrorists might resort
					 to it.</p>


	<A NAME="T1525"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1525"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1525)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Americans immediately made a very major investment.
					 I believe they are investing some $3 billion into trying to create security
					 measures that could respond adequately to this type of attack. Canadians do not
					 have $3 billion but, and this is great credit to the solicitor general and the
					 Minister of National Defence, they are aware of the problem and immediately
					 wanted to take measures to do something about it. I produced a report and the
					 ministers acted upon that report. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the two years intervening, much planning and much
					 thought has gone into a co-ordinated response across the various departments
					 that would be engaged: defence, the solicitor general's department,
					 anti-terrorism, and Health Canada, because all of this of course relates to the
					 control of dangerous biological agents. One of the outcomes was the creation of
					 the office of critical infrastructure preparedness which was announced by the
					 government earlier this year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is all to say that efforts have been put in
					 motion. Just to demonstrate that I am not just talking through my hat, I would
					 like to read a little bit from a letter that I received from the solicitor
					 general on March 21, 2000. As he is familiar with me, he addressed me by my
					 first name. The letter reads:</p>

</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point of this letter is that we are in very close
					 contact with our major ally on this issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to read a few excerpts from a confidential
					 letter from the solicitor general that was sent to me on May 10, 2000. I cannot
					 read it all to the House because it does deal with some details that he has
					 asked me to keep in confidence. He said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Thank you for your letter of April 4,
						  2000, requesting an update on progress towards co-ordinating the government's

						  February 9, 2000, I am happy to be able to report that we have made progress in
						  developing options for a strategy to strengthen national counter-terrorism
						  response capability.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He goes on to talk about the various inter-departmental
					 meetings that have been organized. The two key sentences I would like to read
					 say:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The Department of National Defence
						  now has a representative working full time with the counter-terrorism division
						  of my ministry.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, we finally have synergy between the
					 experts in the Department of National Defence on chemical and biological
					 warfare and the solicitor general. He finally said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The issue of funding remains a
						  challenge and we are still seeking solutions.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That last sentence is important because I think we have
					 come a long way, but one of the difficulties that I know these two ministers
					 had, which they could not report to the House, was the difficulty of persuading
					 their cabinet colleagues to put the money on the table as necessary to provide
					 not the infrastructure, because we have that, but the basic equipment. We do
					 not have enough out there to fully have the kind of protection that the CBW
					 counterterrorism plan calls for.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, it is not cabinet's fault. I remind the House
					 that up until the terribly tragic incident that occurred in New York, no one in
					 the House was talking about the threat of chemical and biological terrorism.
					 There were only a few of us who were even aware that the danger existed so it
					 is not surprising that the funds were not available to these two ministers who,
					 I have to stress, on their own initiative sought to build a program that would
					 be at least in place. It is in place now, thank heavens, but they do need
					 funding. They were not able to get it at the time and at a sufficient rate. I
					 would dearly hope that while we as Canadians do not need the billions that the
					 Americans are spending, a few million would do nicely.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly in my mind the government should be aware

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to think that the Prime

					 and suggested that the government should be spending millions of dollars on
					 counterterrorism along the line of chemical and biological warfare weapons, I
					 probably would have been laughed at in the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This threat has been around for the last 10 years. Most
					 advanced nations of the world have been aware of it. The problem is that it
					 seems like something out of fiction. It is very hard to persuade people in
					 their normal walks of life that this is a genuine danger because it is a very
					 arcane and unusual danger. I should add that it is a very improbable danger. It
					 is not a high risk situation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not surprising that the ministers concerned might
					 have had some difficulty persuading their cabinet colleagues to put money on
					 the table. Right now I do not think there is any argument that the money should
					 be put on the table.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, my party's motion reads as follows:
					 </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>That this House urge the government,
						  in any reprisals taken in reaction to the terrorist strikes in New York City on
						  September 11, not to commit Canadian armed forces in any offensive action until
						  the House of Commons has been consulted and has voted on the
						  matter.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agreed to participate in this debate because since
					 September 11, our individual and collective, freedoms, economic as well as
					 political, have been shattered. I remember several headlines in the newspapers.
					 One in particular said that “On September 11, 2001 at 8:45 the face of the
					 world changed”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world changed on that day and we still have trouble
					 going back to the normal rhythm of our lives. We cannot forget that horror. The
					 breath of the tragedy is almost undescribable and unfortunately we are also
					 witness to what I would call an overdose of information in the media.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For two weeks now we have been seeing the same picture
					 of the plane crashing into the second tower and hearing the noise it made. I
					 have nightmares about it. I wake up and see that plane and hear that noise and
					 still find it horrible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were convinced that no democracy was invincible but
					 what strikes us is the fact that we never thought that such a horrible attack
					 could happen on American soil. We were hoping never to see that in our
					 lifetime. Since September 11, we have even had to change our vocabulary. We
					 have had to change our collective conscience with regard to what is
					 happening.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion we are presenting is totally fundamental in
					 a democracy. Incidentally the Liberals tabled an amendment to the government's
					 motion during the gulf war. I believe it was the member for Saint-Maurice who
					 was then leader of the opposition, or maybe he had not yet assumed that
					 position. However when the then Minister of external affairs tabled a motion
					 the Liberals amended, what did that amendment say? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment moved by the current Deputy Prime
					 Minister said this:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>That this support shall not be
						  interpreted as approval of the use of Canadian Forces for offensive action
						  without further consultation with and approval by this House.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Deputy Prime Minister, who was then sitting
					 on the opposition side, had this to say:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Liberals insist that before Canadians
						  are called upon to participate in any offensive action, such participation must
						  first be brought before Parliament and voted on here in the way it was done at
						  the time of the Korean conflict.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just common sense. This amendment is common
					 sense, it is consistent with democracy and with the rights of members. As
					 representatives of Canadians and Quebecers, we have the right to vote on
					 whatever our government will decide to do to support the fight against
					 terrorism. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, we have to admit that the rules of the
					 game are somewhat outdated. At the time the Conservatives did not see fit to
					 accept the amendment moved by the Liberals, who were then in opposition.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore today, we should be dealing with reasonable,
					 intelligent members who use their common sense and say, “When we were in
					 opposition, we wanted a vote in parliament, so now that we are in power, we
					 will lead by example”.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It feels like watching kids play, irresponsible
					 individuals totally unable to change their minds because when they were in the
					 opposition, they did not get their way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope the Prime Minister will give it some thought and
					 that his government will support this motion and give us the opportunity to
					 have our say and debate the issue, should the executive he heads consider
					 dragging us into a war.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not know against whom, where or for how long. We
					 ask questions and, in the course of the same question period, we get
					 conflicting answers from different ministers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you expect the Canadian people to trust their
					 representatives? How do you expect the Canadian people to find it worthwhile to
					 have members of parliament and all that it entails to have people who sit here
					 all day long trying to accomplish something? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you think people believe that being involved in
					 politics serves no purpose? Because their is only one person who is playing
					 politics here; the Prime Minister is the only one who went to Washington, where
					 he was asked for nothing, and came back here.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, for the time being, he does not have to
					 consult us because nothing was asked of him. If there was a request, what
					 possible scenario could we be facing?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the past is an indication of the future, it seems to
					 me that the Liberals, when they were in opposition, had asked for something
					 that made sense. Today, they should grant us that very same thing, but no, they
					 will not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned when the government leader rises in the
					 House during oral question period to tell us not to worry because since the
					 Prime Minister has been in office, his government has developed a new system
					 and we now have a new procedure, a new process. There will be
					 consultations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government does not know what consulting means. If
					 we look at all the acts under which it has an obligation to consult, which make
					 it mandatory for the government to consult the provinces and territories, we
					 see that the ministers responsible do not meet with their agents, their
					 counterparts in the provinces and territories, to consult them, seek their
					 opinion or ask them how they see things, rather it informed them of the
					 decisions it has made. This is the way every single minister operates. This is
					 what happens in every single department.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not trust that we will be really consulted. This
					 is the tragedy. Not only do we want to be consulted, but we want to have the
					 right to vote because we represent the views of our constituents and they, at
					 least some of them, are asking us not to go to war. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Quebec, the polls are very clear: we have always
					 seen things differently. While terrorism must be fought and ways will have to
					 be found to put an end to it, this does not necessarily mean we have to go to
					 war tomorrow morning.</p>

					 BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, like my colleague, the member for 
					  Rimouski-Neigette-et-la
						Mitis, I too believe it is right to want to have a say, as
					 parliamentarians, on the involvement of this Government, of Canadians who might
					 be called upon to augment military forces in the Middle East.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been elected and we have a responsibility. We
					 have been given the mandate to get involved in debates, knowing what our values
					 are, what we are voting on and what the bills we pass are all about. The
					 current government does not seem to want to consult us, when this is precisely
					 what is expected of it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The significance of this debate has to do with the vote
					 that would be given to every political party, every member of parliament. The
					 appalling tragedy of September 11 hit home and made us reflect.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The generation I belong to has not lived through a war,
					 but my father's generation remembers only too well the bitter fruits of armed
					 conflicts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The World Trade Center and the Pentagon tragedy robbed
					 us of our innocence and made us aware of how vulnerable we truly
					 are.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we get over the horror and bewilderment caused by
					 the attacks, we must avoid rushing into the retaliative actions that are being
					 considered .</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the terrorists responsible for this attack did
					 it on behalf of a particular people or religion, they were condemned by every
					 legitimate representative of the Arabic and Islamic communities of the world.
					 Today, every peace loving human being is in mourning.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, today, every one of us is a little bit a victim, it
					 is equally true that, as human beings, we too bear the responsibility of the
					 sin that was committed. Which people, which religion, which cause has not had
					 its extremists?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human stupidity is not the exclusive purview of one
					 colour, one language, one gender or one religion. Extremism can be found
					 anywhere. It is blind and it strikes indiscriminately. It does not care about
					 justice and innocent people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The victims in New York are the innocent victims of
					 hatred. It could have been anyone else, in any country of the world. It could
					 have been our brothers, our sisters, or a relative. This is why we must stand
					 together with the American people through these difficult times, but also with
					 every other people of the world who is a victim of injustice. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should we do then to counter these unconscionable
					 and unjustified attacks? Should we retaliate by firing on a crowd? Of course
					 not. Vengeance for the sake of vengeance would only increase the level of hate
					 and jeopardize peace in the Middle East and in Asia. Should we deal with the
					 root causes of this evil, that is the racism and the intolerance that are often
					 latent in all kinds of conflicts? Force is not always the best of
					 guides.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some conflicts are lingering throughout the world, and
					 we should look into them to try to find long term solutions. If they are not
					 settled, they will prevent us from concentrating on fundamental problems that
					 undermine any lasting peace in the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning of a new century, with instant
					 communications, we can no longer put our heads in the sand and act as if we are
					 not concerned because all this is happening elsewhere. The attack on New York
					 proves the opposite. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take for example what happened at the world conference
					 against racism which took place in South Africa last August under the aegis of
					 the UN. The conference bogged down on semantic issues between the actors
					 involved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is evidence that as long as there is no peace in the
					 Middle East, more people like bin Laden will be ready to die for their
					 cause.</p>


	<A NAME="T1550"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1550"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1550)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The American tragedy has had a much greater impact than
					 all those forgotten conflicts occurring elsewhere in the world. Naturally, the
					 immediate cause of last Tuesday's attacks is the escalation of violence in the
					 Middle East. However the deeper cause is the despair and frustration which
					 breed hatred. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are so directly affected by those attacks, it is
					 because, for the first time, they happened on our continent. I say for the
					 first time because it was in fact the first time such a tragedy happened after
					 a long and well orchestrated preparation. The problem will never be solved with
					 a simple show of power.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, after a meeting with the president of the
					 United States, the Prime Minister of Canada said that the president did not ask
					 Canada for military support. However, he added: “If they need us, we will be
					 there”. Yet, to resort to armed forces without trying to get to the root of
					 this terrorism will only postpone the solution to this problem. Even worse, it
					 could make things worse.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning, professor Albert Legault of Laval
					 university wrote that the fight against terrorism is first and foremost a
					 matter for the police and intelligence services. That is why we are asking the
					 government to consult parliament before calling on the armed forces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thousands of Quebecers and Canadians have sent letters
					 and e-mails to members of this House to let them know about their fears and
					 concerns. Here are a few examples.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“With acts of pure vengeance, do we not run the risk of
					 provoking an escalation of violence?”</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“How can we be sure that this operation to which Canada
					 could be associated will eradicate all terrorist groups?” </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If Canada totally aligns its policy on the American
					 one, won't Canada also become a target for terrorists?”</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“If we bring about a general mobilization of forces in
					 Middle East countries, will we not create ideal conditions for a regional war
					 elsewhere?”</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the morning of September 11, 2001, the west woke up
					 to a brutal reality. The horrendous attacks on the World Trade Center and the
					 Pentagon have proven that a great terrorist threat hangs over the world, just
					 as some people have been saying for many years, but we called them prophets of
					 doom. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government must be prudent and, for the time being,
					 focus its efforts on the security of our citizens while preventing terrorists
					 from using Canada to prepare attacks on the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the roots of the present problem, it is time that
					 we get out of our comfort and indifference. Let us try to achieve a lasting
					 resolution to all the regional conflicts on the planet. Let us promote justice
					 and solidarity among the nations. This is why we want the government to
					 approach the problems differently in the House. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we want a real dialogue, discussions have to be
					 forced by the opposition. It should rather be up to the government to question
					 all the members of the House, to consult with the leaders of the various
					 opposition parties, raise the issues, including the negotiations underway with
					 the United States and the other countries. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The open and democratic thing to do would be to let
					 parliamentarians participate in this debate, a debate that can be described as
					 urgent and life changing for many Quebecers and Canadians, should we be called
					 up or called out on service.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that we will see a change in the attitude of
					 this government and that we, parliamentarians, will be able to vote on an
					 eventual participation. </p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank my colleague for her
					 question. As the government House leader said earlier, debating is allowed, but
					 what we are asking for is to vote on the involvement of Canada in the
					 counterattack that is being prepared by the Americans. I believe that the
					 members of all the opposition parties would like to have a say on this
					 decision-- </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> Before it is made.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Gagnon: </b>--before it is made. We know that
					 that is not what the government seems to be saying on the question as to
					 whether parliamentarians will be allowed to vote in the House on the issues and
					 on Canada's participation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effectively, as my colleague said, this will have an
					 impact on the people. If many Canadians and Quebecers are called on to
					 participate in battles, all parliamentarians should be able to respond in a
					 responsible manner to the people in general to find out how Quebec and Canada
					 will be involved and what these people will decide with respect to the
					 involvement of their children. It is usually the young who go to war and they
					 are often involved in deadly battles.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If parliament would allow us to get involved in a
					 responsible manner, this would make us very happy. I sincerely hope that the
					 government will change its position and find it urgent not only to let the
					 House discuss the matter, but also to let it vote on the issue.</p>

					 (Bas-Richelieu--Nicolet--Bécancour, BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I wish to congratulate my colleague for
					 her excellent speech and her very accurate and precise representation. However,
					 I wonder if she does not have the impression she is talking to the deaf when
					 addressing the party across the way. This party, as we know, sings two
					 different tunes: one during election campaigns and another when it is in power.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no lack of examples. Suffice it to say that in
					 order to win the election the government promised to scrap the GST. After the
					 election, it forgot all about that promise. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals promised to drop the helicopter project,
					 but after the election they bought helicopters at an even higher price. When
					 they wanted to defeat the Clark government, they promised to eliminate the 18
					 cent tax on gas, but after the election they raised it by 65 cents. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This party has always sung two different tunes. It did
					 the same on the copyright issue and on economic and cultural matters. It says
					 one thing during the election campaign and another once elected. Members have
					 mentioned it in this case and my colleague also said so when she stated that
					 when they were in the opposition, the Liberals had promised, asked and begged
					 the government to consult the House before making a decision on the use of our
					 armed forces or on any military action. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as they took power, they did the exact opposite
					 of what they had promised. They suddenly hid the red book under the table as if
					 it did not exist anymore. Promises are made to win elections. For the rest, the
					 government does not care about Canadians, parliament and members of parliament.
					 It does as they wish.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what surprises me and this is what I want to
					 ask my colleague about. Is she not surprised that Liberal members from Quebec,
					 especially those like the member for Chicoutimi--Le Fjord who have gone to the
					 other side, who switched parties in order to have an influence from within, to
					 have a strong voice and defend the interests of Quebec and its population, have
					 nothing to say? They catch the Liberal members' disease the minute they join
					 them and they lose their tongues and change their speech. Is the hon. member
					 not surprised to see that once again? </p>

					 will continue to work with our allies in the new struggle against
					 terrorism.</p>

					 all sides of the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the full implications of the terrorist attacks of
					 September 11 continue to unfold we must be mindful of our responsibility and
					 our promise to stand shoulder to shoulder with the United States and our
					 allies, and we are mindful. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we have said many times over the past two weeks,
					 this was not just an attack on the United States but an attack on all civilized
					 nations. In one of his first speeches to the American people President Bush
					 said it was an attack not just on Americans but on democracy and freedom loving
					 people everywhere.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same message was reiterated a day or so later by
					 Prime Minister Blair of the United Kingdom. It is the same message that was
					 conveyed by our Prime Minister last Monday. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We stand by our allies and strongly support the
					 decision to invoke article 5 of the NATO charter. We reaffirm our commitment to
					 the alliance and to the principles of freedom and democracy that guide
					 us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States, as we all know, is working to
					 develop an appropriate and strong response to the attacks. However it is still
					 in the planning stages. It is still in the process of determining how the war
					 on terrorism should be handled. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before acting Canada must first know the details of the
					 American plan and the approach of our other allies. As the Prime Minister
					 stated yesterday and as was reported on the news, the U.S. has not indicated
					 what its needs are. It has not yet asked Canada for a contribution. When it
					 does we will assess what our contribution can and will be.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time a plan to debate and vote on any future
					 deployment of Canadian forces would be purely hypothetical and, I would submit,
					 premature. In the weeks and months ahead we will work closely with the United
					 States and our allies to determine how Canada might best contribute. I
					 reiterate that the U.S. is still formulating its plan.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As was said in last week's debate on the issue, we do
					 not expect the campaign to be run by conventional methods of war because this
					 is not a conventional war. People may ask what the difference is. War is war,
					 after all. What is conventional and what is unconventional? There is a
					 distinction to be made. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost immediately after the attacks on September 11,
					 parallels and analogies were drawn to the attack on Pearl Harbor. President
					 Bush was urged at the time to respond immediately in the same way the Americans
					 responded to the Pearl Harbor attack. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However let us be absolutely clear: this is very
					 different from Pearl Harbor. When Admiral Yamamoto attacked the U.S. fleet
					 President Franklin Roosevelt knew exactly who the enemy was and where the enemy
					 was to be found. We are still determining who the enemy is and where the enemy
					 is situated.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we have heard from many reports around the world,
					 there are perhaps 40 to 60 countries which harbour terrorists and in which
					 terrorist cells exist. It is not just one nation against another.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This unconventional war will require the collaboration
					 and assistance of countries all over the world. We must be prepared for a
					 sustained, intensive and concentrated effort that uses all the tools at our
					 command including diplomatic, military and economic ones. That is why it is
					 unconventional.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assure the House that Canada will not rush into
					 decisions concerning our response without thorough and balanced consideration.
					 We have been faced with an outrageous and egregious act of terrorism. We are
					 angry but we must not let our anger affect our judgment. The government will
					 not issue a carte blanche.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However at the end of the day the government will
					 provide the resources necessary to allow Canada to play a clear and significant
					 role in helping the United States and our other allies in the intensive
					 campaign against terrorism. We must remember that this is a war against
					 terrorism around the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a team of professional and dedicated people in
					 the Canadian forces who stand ready to be part of any international coalition
					 against terrorism. We should use this opportunity to say how proud we are of
					 our armed forces.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a saying among soldiers that when interpreting
					 instructions one should think about what the commander wants to accomplish and
					 then carry out the instructions in a manner that would best effect the mission.
					 At the same time the soldier does not consult the superior officer at every
					 step. In the long run he or she is responsible for meeting the expectations of
					 the commander and accomplishing the goals of the mission.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can apply this analogy to our government. We have
					 listened to the citizens of the country and they have given us our mandate. We
					 debated last Monday. We debated last Tuesday on an opposition day. We debated
					 last Thursday. What has been so wonderful is that we have given all members of
					 the House an opportunity to voice not just their own opinions but those of
					 their constituents. The list has been so long that not every member has had an
					 opportunity to speak. With motions such as the one put forward today by the
					 Bloc we can continue to consult with our constituents and give their views to
					 the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However let us face it. It is up to the government to
					 make the difficult decisions that will allow us to accomplish our mission. They
					 will not be simple decisions. They will be difficult decisions and they will be
					 made after consultations. To make them we must remain flexible. We must be able
					 to react quickly and effectively yet prudently, and we must choose wisely from
					 different options and avenues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the subject of flexibility, members must understand
					 that there are times when we must act immediately. Can one imagine recalling
					 the House simply to note that there had been an attack and to ask whether we
					 should let American planes or international flights land? There are times when
					 one must act quickly because time is of the essence. We will not always be able
					 to call everyone together to decide these things and micromanage what is
					 important. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we maintain our commitment to ongoing
					 parliamentary consultations in the face of this and future conflicts, we must
					 always weigh that commitment with our responsibility to our friends and
					 allies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Prime Minister met yesterday with the president of
					 the United States. During that joint meeting he reiterated to President Bush
					 that we are neighbours, friends and family. I know many members of the House
					 who have friends, family and relatives in the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister said we would work together with the
					 United States to build a coalition to defend against terrorism. He emphasized
					 that Canadians support the struggle. He told Mr. Bush quite unequivocally that
					 when the U.S. needs us we will be there, and we will. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to consult the House but we will also

					 let the evil forces of terrorism win.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I support the motion. However I believe
					 that it is an academic discussion. Ex-military people like General Mackenzie
					 have said that we are unable to provide any direct contribution in terms of a
					 combat role should that happen. Another ex-military person said that all we can
					 do is to put three frigates in with the American fleet. We do not have the
					 capacity to get involved in a combat role. In that sense the debate is
					 academic.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish we were debating the measures we need to take so
					 that we will not be caught with our pants down the next time around. There have
					 been many years of neglect, decline and drift by the government with respect to
					 national security and our military, and we are paying the price for it
					 today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are some of the things we can do in the interim
					 besides what my colleague on the other side has mentioned? We should be
					 starting tough anti-terrorism measures in Canada. We should see what is
					 feasible and what can be implemented. We should also be seriously looking at,
					 from an economic and social standpoint, what we can do with our perimeter to
					 keep dangerous people out of North America and to limit this risk.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has the majority and it controls the
					 agenda. Why could it not strike a committee that would actually look at
					 anti-terrorism measures without a precondition that we have to get total
					 unanimous consent from the House?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-51892"></A><a HREF="#Int-51894"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-51890"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Sarmite Bulte:
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.
					 The important thing about the government and the reason I am so proud to be a
					 member of the government is that it likes to act on consensus. That was one of
					 the things we said in our Speech from Throne, that we want to consult with
					 Canadians, listen to the debate and the things that our colleagues on the
					 opposite side have to say.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is surprising that the hon. member on the opposite
					 side asked why we do not strike a committee to look at anti-terrorism. Last
					 week the government House leader stood and suggested that we do exactly that,
					 and it was the opposition party that refused to give unanimous consent.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member talked about conditions. The official
					 opposition's motion about working on anti-terrorism legislation was full of
					 preconditions. A war against terrorism requires a multi-facetted approach. It
					 requires many things such as diplomacy, a look at the economy and possible
					 military action. However all these things must be looked at
					 carefully.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot act alone. This is not a war against one
					 particular country. It is not a conventional war. Canada needs to play a
					 pivotal role and ensure that we talk to our international allies and our
					 partners to discuss how best we can work together to combat terrorism. That is
					 the key thing we need to attack, not other countries. We must work together to
					 combat terrorists wherever they may be.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In times of crisis like the events of the last couple

	Mr. Speaker, it is important to remember what happened

					 members debating what happened.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, with all credit to the official
					 opposition, the opposition made it its opposition day to further talk about how
					 we could deal with this international attack against terrorism. Members were
					 given an opportunity to exchange views, to consult with one another and with
					 different parties.</p>

					 Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, my colleague very eloquently put forward
					 some very valid points. She was about to refer to a comment by the member from
					 whatever that organization is, the coalition. I am having trouble keeping
					 track. I think she was about to refer to a comment attributed to the leader of
					 the fifth party in the House, in 1990, which I will paraphrase. He said, during
					 a debate in this place on a decision with regard to the gulf war, that we
					 cannot wait for deliberative bodies to deliberate and act before taking action.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member made numerous references to the
					 responsibility of the government of the day to act within the constitution to
					 either deploy troops or make substantive decisions that were in the best
					 interests of national security. That was then and this is now. I appreciate the
					 fact that the person I am quoting was at the time under a different
					 understanding of what his responsibilities were.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say first of all that I have been saddened
					 somewhat, as we all have been, by the events of the past two weeks, but
					 particularly saddened, in addition to viewing the tragedy that we have all
					 seen, by some of the reactions of people both in this place and in the media.
					 There is one group in this place that I think has acted responsibly. I have
					 criticized those members in the past for some of their policies and actions but
					 I will not at this time. In fact I congratulate them today because I believe
					 they are acting in the best interests of all Canadians when they use their use
					 their role as members of an opposition party. They are the members of the Bloc
					 Quebecois. It is perhaps a surprise to many of us that this has happened. We
					 might have expected it from other sectors or other people in this place, but in
					 reality their responsibility has been shown by questions in question period, by
					 speeches in debate that focus on the real issues here, the issues that
					 Canadians are concerned and frightened about. They have not all been lobs by
					 any stretch. They have not simply issued a blank cheque supporting the Prime
					 Minister or the government to do as he or it pleases and it is appropriate that
					 they do not.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that the image Canadians have of
					 parliamentarians standing and voting on whether or not to send troops into war
					 is an image that we hoped would never happen, even if we were to agree with it.
					 This is indeed an unusual time in our history, a time when calm resolution is
					 being displayed by our leader and by the leadership of the entire government.
					 What is interesting is that there is now a sense in this debate that the
					 government might act too hastily.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up until now we have heard particularly from the
					 official opposition that the government is not acting hastily enough, that
					 somehow we should be doing what the Pakistanis and the Afghanis are doing and
					 mustering our troops on the border of perhaps the United States, packed and
					 ready to go. This sense that the government is not taking action is purely
					 partisan politics. What is sad about it is that we are losing the benefit of
					 celebrating what Canadians have done by focusing on debates such as the one
					 today and on comments made by people in this place and in the media. Members
					 should think back to what happened. We closed our skies and our airports
					 virtually immediately.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the day it happened, after I witnessed the tragedy
					 on CNN and was as dumbfounded as everyone about what I saw, I had a meeting at
					 the Credit Valley Hospital at 11 o'clock that morning and I thought that I
					 might as well go because I had to do something.</p>


	<A NAME="T1620"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1620"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1620)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was absolutely astounded to see that the hospital was
					 in full emergency planning mode. So was Etobicoke General Hospital. The reason
					 is that there was a rumour, white hot, at 11 a.m. on September 11 that at least
					 one of the planes being diverted to Pearson international was a hijacked
					 aircraft that could turn into a bomb or a missile. What did they do? These
					 people reacted instinctively, calmly and professionally to ensure that all of
					 their staff were aware of the problem and were capable and ready to take action
					 in case of an emergency, in case injured people showed up at the emergency
					 department of Credit Valley Hospital or Etobicoke General. That is a
					 responsible way to act. That was not led by a government. It was under the
					 leadership of Wayne Fysse and his entire team at Credit Valley Hospital.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should be celebrating that instead of all the
					 sniping and political posturing that is going on in what I can only say is an
					 unfortunate attempt to hold somebody on this side of the House, aka the Prime
					 Minister, responsible for all of this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A member opposite accused someone over here of blaming
					 the United States. I have heard members on all sides and I have heard and read
					 media reports that actually blame Canada, actually blame our immigration
					 policies. Our immigration system is not perfect. In fact there are members of
					 the House who sit, or did sit on the immigration committee when we brought in
					 Bill C-11. I recall the complaints from the official opposition critic that the
					 bill was too tough, that we were violating civil libertarian rights and that we
					 were taking away the rights of people to appeal a deportation order just
					 because they were found to be criminals. I heard members from all parties. I
					 expect the former opposition critic for immigration had moved on to another
					 committee, but I am sure these were orders coming out of central party command
					 on what they should be doing in relation to the immigration bill. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If members have heard the latest media report, that
					 bill has been delayed. Why? We held hearings right across Canada on the
					 immigration bill to tell people that it was time we toughened up our
					 immigration laws to ensure that people who are criminals and people who are
					 under deportation orders are actually deported. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hue and cry from the Canadian Bar Association,
					 propagated in many cases by members opposite doing their jobs as critics which
					 I respect, was quite remarkable. Now those same critics sit here and somehow
					 say, as they do every day, that it is awful that our immigration system is the
					 cause of all this. That is the implication. Do we really mean that when we look
					 all of the immigrants in the eye? Some of them are in this very place. Do we
					 not recognize that immigration is indeed what has built Canada? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should we be shocked that there are terrorist cells
					 within our borders? Could someone please name one country where that is not the
					 case? I doubt that they can. From what I have seen, Osama bin Laden's network
					 is in some 30 to 40 different countries, and that is only one terrorist group.
					 Of course there will be people within such an open, democratic, welcoming
					 country as Canada who are not here for the benefit of you and me, Madam
					 Speaker, and who are not here to try to build a nation. They are here to
					 further their own interests whatever they may be. Whether they are based on
					 religious fanaticism or political fanaticism, the bottom line is that we know
					 it is fanatical.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sad thing here is that we are missing the point.
					 There will be debates in this place throughout the entire process. It will be a
					 long, drawn out process to eliminate terrorism and attack terrorism around the
					 world.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am confident that our government will do what is
					 right. I just wish that we could, like the Americans have done, pull together
					 as one great nation, as one great political entity so that we know where the

					 or not he approves the motion presented by the Bloc Quebecois, which simply
					 says this: “Do you agree to consult the House of Commons before making any
					 military decision, as your party has been asking in its program, the red book,

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bin Laden did not consult parliament. He did not
					 consult any parliament. He decided, surrounded by a small group of

					 actions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have we gotten to the point where the Prime Minister of

					 are we not a democracy? That is the question that is being asked
					 today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members were elected democratically. Now, are they
					 prepared to act democratically in this parliament, to respect the people by
					 consulting those who represent the people in parliament? Are they prepared to
					 consult the people before deciding to take any action whatsoever? It is that
					 simple. The answer is yes or no. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to the question is that I am not prepared to

					 obligation of this government to govern. It is also the obligation, and there

	Madam Speaker, there are many things the government has

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he has not done is charged down the street with

					 is showing the kind of leadership that Canadians want. They want to know that

					 terrorism and we support that. I would have hoped that members opposite would
					 have supported it as well.</p>

					 BQ): </b>

	Madam Speaker, first, I wish to extend my condolences
					 to the families and friends of the victims from my riding, from Quebec, Canada
					 and the free and democratic world, following the September 11
					 attack.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the benefit of our fellow citizens who are
					 listening, the motion, as proposed and amended by the Bloc Quebecois, reads as
					 follows:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>That this House urge the government,
						  in any reprisals taken in reaction to the terrorist strikes in New York City on
						  September 11, not to commit Canadian armed forces in any offensive action, or
						  any financial resources, until the House of Commons has been consulted and has
						  voted on the matter. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an unprecedented situation and it must be dealt
					 with seriously. We have been and continue to be intensely affected by the
					 attacks, despite the fact that we all wish to go on with our lives.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One has to admit that it is impossible to get through
					 this crisis without debating the matter in this House, making decisions and
					 holding a vote in the House. This analysis and these decisions are the
					 responsibility of the whole House. That is democracy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duly elected representatives of the people have a duty
					 to debate issues, question the government and vote on important questions like
					 the one at hand as to whether the Canadian forces should take part in any
					 offensive action.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attacks of September 11 were directed against all
					 democratic nations. The terrorists were clearly targeting our democratic
					 symbols. We have such symbols here. We are living in a democracy and we must do
					 everything in our power to keep it that way. This involved taking decisions
					 following a debate and a vote in the House. That is democracy, our democracy,
					 at work.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terrorists wanted to destabilize and annihilate us.
					 As a matter of fact, they wanted to destroy our liberty. It is that liberty
					 that we have to maintain in a clear and explicit fashion. All democratic
					 countries have to affirm this in an eloquent and unequivocal fashion.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is our duty to confront terrorism and to do it on
					 our own terms, through debates followed by a vote in the House. Our response
					 has to be of a political, diplomatic, economic and social nature. A military
					 intervention should not be the priority, not without having first clearly
					 identified the perpetrators of these attacks.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More important we must not participate in any military
					 operation that could put innocent lives in danger. We must not act like the
					 terrorists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, no decision should be made without having
					 first been debated and voted on so as to clearly show that conflicts can only
					 be settled through democratic means.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We practice democracy by debating in this House all
					 decisions to be taken by government and then having a vote. The House of
					 Commons, that is us, and decisions are made by the house as whole, and not by
					 the executive. Our decisions must be representative of our constituents, well
					 thought out, sober and justified. We must be sure of our actions before we act.
					 We must not respond to fear with offensive military operations before a vote is
					 held in the House of Commons. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is out of respect for our citizens that we must take
					 steps, here in this House, in their name and according to their will. That is
					 democracy and that is what the parliamentary process is all about. We must not
					 change our way of life. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the same for parliamentary debates and votes.
					 Changing our way of life and encroaching upon our freedoms would be like
					 capitulating before the fanatical and murderous terrorists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is exactly what the terrorists want. We cannot
					 yield to fear and panic. It is the same for parliament and the House of Commons
					 as a decision making body.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our decisions must be representative, reasoned,
					 sensible and justified. We must be sure of our actions. We must not react to
					 fear with a futile and destructive spirit of revenge. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather we should make sure our reaction to these
					 barbaric acts reaffirm our will to safeguard our freedoms. We must show that
					 our democratic parliamentary process is efficient and essential. How can we
					 prove it? By confirming what we were elected for, namely to represent our
					 constituents. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We represent the people in the House and they clearly
					 want us to react to terrorist attacks by making a decision following a debate
					 at the end of which a vote will have been taken in the House, while taking into
					 account the concerns of our constituents and fellow citizens. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also with our constituents in mind that we should
					 take appropriate and improved security measures. However, these measures must
					 never impede our freedoms. Otherwise, terrorists could believe they managed to
					 scare us and force us to react out of panic. It would be too much like their
					 way of doing things. We have built democracy by acting with balance, in the
					 spirit of duty and within the rule of law. We must continue to do so. We must
					 make sure democracy is respected by showing that it is here to stay.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our choices should not be based on considerations of
					 security, but rather on society. We all agree that the perpetrators of these
					 murderous attacks should be held accountable before the courts. In order to do
					 so, all diplomatic, political, economic and social options should be put
					 forward. Indeed, the military option should be considered, however, it should
					 be set aside as long as possible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Military action should be taken only after debate and a
					 vote in the House of Commons. That is what our parliamentary system is all
					 about. We debate, then we vote. This is democracy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House has to make sure the measures implemented in
					 response to the attacks do not endanger the lives of innocent people. We should
					 not follow in the steps of terrorists. We should rather show them that
					 democracy and freedom have nothing to do with ignorance, obscurantism and
					 violence. Obviously, an exclusively military response would not solve the
					 terrorist threat.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No security measure, no army can defeat terrorists who
					 have no respect whatsoever for human life. The government is looking into
					 actions that will affect all Canadians. Theses actions are of utmost
					 importance. What is at stake is the life of the Canadian people. It is a
					 serious matter. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our response should be unwavering, and we should
					 respond through the democratic process. In our democracy, we must have
					 consultations followed by a vote. True, our life should go on, but so should
					 democracy. How can we make sure democracy goes on? By consulting with
					 parliamentarians, by debating issues of concern for the public and all
					 citizens, and by having votes in parliament. We are the people's
					 representatives.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We agree that life should go on, but that implies
					 protecting our freedoms. We protect them through a dutiful application of the
					 democratic process in elections and consultations. Openness is at stake. It is
					 normal for us to be free in our daily lives. Democracy is also something we
					 take for granted. We will find the normal course of our life again if we can be
					 sure the democratic process will still be there and will still be respected.
					 Consultations and votes in parliament are part and parcel of our freedom of
					 expression and representation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrorist groups do not have this advantage. To the
					 contrary, they have to trample over the basic rights of all societies. Unlike
					 them, we respect the rights and freedoms of our fellow citizens. Consultation
					 is an integral part of democracy. Voting on government decisions is a way of
					 strengthening democracy. That should be our true response to terrorist
					 attacks.</p>

				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, I think the member spoke very well, but
					 I do have a problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will ask everyone to picture this. The World Trade
					 Center has been attacked and 5,000, 6,000, 7,000 people, who knows, have been
					 murdered. President Bush asks the Prime Minister to come to an urgent meeting
					 in Washington the next day to lay out a strategy and asks for military support.
					 The Prime Minister tells the president to hold that thought because he has to
					 go back to Ottawa in order to convene parliament and have a discussion with
					 House members on whether or not Canada will participate and support its allies
					 and friends. That is the preposterous nature of what is being proposed
					 here.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member said in his speech that we should debate
					 whether we would deploy military forces in any action. I think he mentioned
					 civilian risk and that there are degrees of that and no guarantee that people
					 will not be hurt. The question for the member is whether he believes that
					 perhaps this discussion should not be a discussion on a specific event such as
					 the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington but rather should be a debate
					 in the House. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question for the member is whether in fact the
					 motion should have said in the event that a situation occurs where our NATO
					 allies or friends request military action, what are the rules under which the
					 House would ask the government to guide it in its decision making so that we
					 can in fact participate in a timely and constructive fashion?</p>

				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, this is an important question. As was
					 done in France and Argentina, we want to vote before the fact on whether to
					 deploy troops. What could be more democratic? We do not want only to debate, we
					 want to vote as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an emergency situation like the one the
					 parliamentary secretary just referred to, and we are indeed in an emergency
					 situation, we can plan what we want to do. It is important to debate the matter
					 and vote on the different ways to commit Canadian forces, either by a
					 deployment of troops or by the approval of an offensive action by the army.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also a question of the money that will be
					 available, the financial means that will have to be introduced. We have to be
					 able to debate the matter and to vote on it in the House of Commons.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the example given by the parliamentary secretary
					 on the urgency of the situation, what do we do if something happens? We have
					 seen what happened during the attacks. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to be ready. We hear it everywhere. Everybody
					 is saying that we were not ready. The democratic world was not ready. The free
					 world was not ready. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to talk about those things and have a vote to
					 determine our priorities and exactly when Canadians will be ready to engage in
					 an offensive action. Will they ever want to do so? I hope government members
					 will be listening to Canadians and Quebecers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important for the government to listen to these
					 people. How can they get the attention of the government if not through their
					 representatives? The Liberal members across the way were elected and are their
					 representatives. They are not just members of the government. Every single one
					 of them is a member of parliament, a representative of the people who elected
					 them. If they do not listen to their representatives, what do they do? It is
					 not for the executive power to make decisions as important as this one.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, tomorrow morning there is an emergency, they have
					 the authority to act. However they must not forget that parliament can be
					 recalled on an emergency basis. The House of Commons can be called back at any
					 time. We can debate and make a decision.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that we keep up the fight to be able to
					 vote in the House of Commons.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion calls for the government to not commit the

	Madam Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for
					 Châteauguay, who just spoke, even though he took some time away from me. I
					 think he spoke with so much energy and passion that it was worth it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He conveyed very well the idea I wanted to start my
					 speech with, which is that the Bloc motion is a simple matter of respect for
					 democracy. I believe that parliament ought to be consulted and that each member
					 be allowed to express in a vote the opinions and wishes of the people they
					 represent.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the hon. member for Châteauguay aptly pointed out
					 that we represent the people. We must therefore make decisions on behalf of the
					 people, and thus we must be consulted and have the right to vote.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this debate, I also heard members say that our
					 democracy ought to preach by example. I have heard this time and time again. If
					 we really wish to preach by example, as others mentioned, it has to start here,
					 in this parliament. It is here that we must show how democracy works and the
					 government must allow the elected representatives to vote on the
					 issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I became aware with people all over the world of
					 the events in New York on September 11, I was struck by the sheer magnitude of
					 this tragedy. Thousands of men and women had their physical integrity denied or
					 lost their lives.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is easy to imagine the horror that filled their
					 soul. Like many of us, I thought about those who watched on TV the death of
					 their husband or wife, or friends.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought about fathers and mothers who lost a daughter
					 or a son. I thought about children who watched on TV the death of their mother
					 or father.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While we watched this immense tragedy unfolding before
					 our eyes, our first reactions were stupefaction, the disbelief that other human
					 beings can do such a thing and destroy so many lives for a cause. I do not
					 think any cause can justify such acts and the sacrifice of so many
					 lives.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After these first two reactions, stupefaction and
					 disbelief, the third one is probably anger, and that is what we witnessed.
					 However anger is blind and it often makes us do things we cannot justify
					 afterwards.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When anger subsides, we should look for causes. Why is
					 mankind capable of such acts? How can people commit such crimes? I am not in
					 any way tempted to justify these actions. They have never been acceptable and
					 they never will be.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should face the fact that this kind of action is not
					 new. The attacks on September 11 have been more spectacular and dramatic than
					 previous incidents throughout the world, but for decades our democratic
					 societies have been the target of repeated terrorist attacks.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For decades, not one year has gone by without us seeing
					 a new war being fought in some part of the world. With the new millennium, with
					 the fall of the Berlin wall, the men and women who live on this planet had a
					 new hope, the hope that mankind was heading toward a new era, an era of
					 possible peace and prosperity for all. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the 20th century gave us two world wars, my
					 children, our children had the right to expect that mankind would have finally
					 understood that war and violence lead nowhere. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, we have the right to self-defence. The
					 attacks of September 11 call for a response, not vengeance but a
					 response.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those responsible must pay the consequences.
					 Democracies must take measures but they must not act blindly. As democrats, we
					 must use all the means at our disposal to ensure that these kinds of actions do
					 not happen again or at least to try to prevent them as much as possible.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the last few days, we heard many speeches in the
					 House. However few members addressed the real causes of the tragedy of
					 September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The greatest tragedies are born of poverty and misery.
					 Throughout the world, millions of human beings live in poverty, which creates
					 the conditions that lead to dictatorships and terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poverty exists even in our country. It may not be as
					 apparent as in certain third world countries or fourth world countries, as some
					 would say today, but it does exist.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a huge disparity between so-called
					 industrialized countries and poor countries. There is a huge disparity between
					 rich countries and poor countries, as well as between various regions of our
					 country. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois wants democracy to be respected.
					 This is the sole objective of the motion introduced in the House today, that is
					 the respect of democracy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people from Quebec have elected members to
					 represent them in the House. These members represent the people of their
					 ridings. It is this right to representation that we are requesting today
					 through the motion that has been put before the House. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is nothing but the right to represent our people and
					 to present their views that we are asking the House today. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not accept the fact that Canada, as a democracy,
					 can commit to an action without first having given parliament the chance to
					 vote, without having consulted with its representatives. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are only asking for the respect of our values, of
					 the values of all Quebecers and all Canadians. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to reiterate that the democracies and the rich
					 countries will have to share their wealth, to spend more in assistance to
					 developing countries and to support the democratic nations around the
					 world.</p>

	Madam Speaker, I want to contribute to the debate today
					 because I think it is very important in light of what is being talked about and
					 obviously in terms of what is happening in the world. We see the ramifications
					 that are taking place and I think it is important that we in the House do in
					 fact have the time to debate these very important issues.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it is fair to say that on September 11, 2001,
					 the world changed, for Canada and for everyone. The September 11 attacks on the
					 World Trade Center, the Pentagon and the aborted hijacked plane in Pennsylvania
					 were not just vicious attacks on the United States, our closest friend and
					 ally, but rather they were cold hearted, calculated attacks on our way of life
					 and upon democracy itself. They offended what the world and global community of
					 just and democratic nations and law abiding and tolerant peoples hold dear and
					 precious. We have to make sure that we understand fully that they call upon us
					 to defend our most precious and cherished values and our freedoms. It is at
					 this time that we do precisely that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also fair to say that all Canadians have been
					 profoundly affected by the nature and the scope of the attacks. One hundred
					 thousand Canadians gathered to share their grief on Parliament Hill. As we
					 know, that event was widely televised. Canadians from all across this great
					 land of ours opened their hearts and their homes to over 30,000 passengers and
					 crew from over 250 flights stranded in Canada on that terrible day. Canadian
					 firemen and firewomen and relief workers are helping with the recovery and the
					 rescue in New York City as we speak.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However the time to mourn is over. As President Bush
					 noted when he ordered the U.S. flags back to full mast, now is the time to act,
					 not in haste but with determination and resolve. That we will do in concert
					 with our American friends. Let there be no doubt about it. Canada stands in
					 solidarity and in sympathy with our American friend, our partner and our ally.
					 We stand shoulder to shoulder with the U.S. in this campaign against terrorism.
					 Together we will use all lawful means at our disposal to bring those
					 responsible to justice, including extradition or prosecution of those suspected
					 of terrorist crimes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last Friday the Minister of Foreign Affairs met with
					 the secretary of state, Colin Powell. Yesterday our Prime Minister met with
					 President Bush. They discussed how we can work together to forge the coalition
					 and the campaign against terrorism and how we can work together to better
					 protect the citizens of our two countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our security in its broadest possible political,
					 economic and military sense is inextricably linked to the United States. We can
					 never forget that, not just because of NATO or NORAD, not just because we share
					 a common border or the world's most important trading relationship, but our
					 common values and political ideals bind us as well as our willingness to defend
					 those very ideals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister and our foreign affairs minister
					 assured the president and Secretary of State Powell of the full support of the
					 people of Canada and our government. As both Secretary Powell and President
					 Bush noted, they never had any doubts about the commitment and the support of
					 their brothers and sisters in Canada. Those are their words. Both said how
					 touched they have been and appreciative they are of the actions and the
					 solidarity of the people of Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, along with a broad coalition of countries, are now
					 launched into a long campaign against terrorism. President Bush and our Prime
					 Minister have both cautioned that there will be no quick and easy victory, that
					 we must root out the evil that exists without creating a new army of dedicated
					 extremists. That too we will do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be precise and be prepared to use all of the
					 tools at our disposal, diplomatic, legal and financial, as well as military
					 resources, to combat this evil. Our answer must be sober, well judged and well
					 thought through, but also resounding and resolute in its approach.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The discussions that our foreign affairs minister had
					 with Secretary Powell on Friday and those that the Prime Minister had with
					 President Bush yesterday indicate that the administration of the United States
					 of America is clearly on the same wavelength as we here in Canada. </p>


	<A NAME="T1705"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1705"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1705)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We stand, then, shoulder to shoulder with our American
					 friends. They know that a variety of tools is necessary, that it is important
					 to build a wide coalition of governments, that it is important not to act
					 hastily but to act with great foresight and planning and the wisdom that
					 requires.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They recognize that this campaign against terrorism
					 involves diplomacy, intelligence and police work, and the preparations are
					 methodical, both on their side as well as ours. We have given that kind of
					 co-operation and will continue to do so in the best interests of not only the
					 people of Canada and the United States but of freedom loving people wherever
					 they exist in this world of ours.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The campaign has begun. The United Nations General
					 Assembly and the UN Security Council have both underlined, in their forceful
					 condemnations of these attacks, that the perpetrators of this terror and those
					 who abet or harbour them will be held accountable, and justifiably
					 so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States of America together with Canada and
					 other allies have moved to invoke article 5 of the NATO charter for the first
					 time in the 52 year history of the alliance. This step indicates and
					 underscores the iron resolve of all of our members of the NATO alliance to act
					 individually and collectively in self defence against this evil in full
					 compliance with the United Nations charter.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Canada and the United States of America
					 share an extremely close defence relationship based on our common defence of
					 the North American continent. Our forces are fully capable of working with
					 American military units across a broad spectrum of roles. That we are prepared
					 to do when we are asked to do so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his meeting with President Bush, the Prime Minister
					 also focused on the vital necessity of forging a broad coalition against
					 terrorism. The Prime Minister assured the president that Canada will support
					 the United States of America in every way, using our special relationships in
					 the Commonwealth and la Francophonie to rally as many countries as possible to
					 the effort against this terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that, Canada is well positioned. We have an historic
					 and great tradition in these matters in terms of how we can help. We in Canada
					 are prepared, and the Prime Minister has indicated thus, to follow through on
					 that very important matter.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meetings with Secretary Powell and the Prime
					 Minister there was a strong appreciation of how our two countries collaborate
					 together and are ready in the combat against terrorism in North America.
					 Canadian agencies, for example, such as the RCMP, CSIS and immigration,
					 transport, and customs, enjoy already close and intense working relationships
					 with our American counterparts in those areas.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No two countries work more closely in ensuring the
					 safety of their citizens. President Bush and Secretary of State Powell were
					 appreciative of how our security services and police are playing their full
					 role in this crisis. I think it is worthy that the House from time to time
					 recognize the great work that our people do in this regard, our security
					 people, our police services, at whatever level and in whatever capacity. It is
					 a great service they provide, not only for the safety and security of our
					 communities, our neighbourhoods, our towns, cities and villages, but also in
					 this trying time they provide the kind of co-operation that is required,
					 important and needed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will do more. The House is well aware of the
					 legislation we have been working on in the area of immigration and to permit
					 ratification of the convention on financing of terrorism. We have other
					 legislation ready to permit ratification of the convention on terrorist
					 bombings, for example. These instruments will guide our way forward. We welcome
					 the appointment of Governor Ridge as homeland defence secretary. The Prime
					 Minister indicated to the president our desire to invite the secretary to
					 Ottawa as soon as possible after his confirmation. This will allow us to deepen
					 our sense of security and our sense of co-operation with him in that very
					 important role.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that President Bush and Secretary Powell,
					 without prodding, understood the potential damage to our economies if our
					 borders were to become sealed and why it is important that we work together to
					 ensure that our border remains a model for the world.</p>


	<A NAME="T1710"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1710"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1715"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1710)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fluid but secure border is critical to our economies.
					 Again, that is very well understood and we will be working very hard in the
					 next little while to ensure that it carries on. If we do not do that, then
					 those evil terrorists win. We must look at how to find a common approach to
					 enhancing security at the border while still facilitating the vital flows
					 between our two countries that are critical to our economies but always guided
					 by the principle that Canadians are guided by Canadian law and Americans are
					 guided by American law. That is a strong division and a strong and sacrosanct
					 principle. That is something we will carry on with.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada's alliances have always been freely entered into
					 as befits a strong and sovereign nation such as Canada, a sovereign nation that
					 has never hid behind an isolationist or pacifist sentiment; a sovereign nation
					 that has made common cause in war and peace with our fellow democracies to
					 defend our peace and security and the values we cherish as a multicultural
					 democratic society and a free people. We do so again, always in compliance with
					 international law.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1993 we have had the practice of consulting
					 parliament before we involve Canadian forces in military operations and we will
					 continue to observe this practice. In the aftermath of the crisis the
					 government has kept parliament fully abreast of the situation. On Monday,
					 September 17, the House debated a special motion on the tragedy. This included
					 discussion of efforts at NATO to respond collectively through the invocation of
					 article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Tuesday the House debated the strategy during the
					 opposition day as well, including what took place on September 11, and had a
					 special take note debate last Thursday on the Prime Minister's meeting with the
					 President of the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events of September 11 constitute a horrific crime,
					 in fact countless crimes. Canada must act in concert with others using all
					 lawful means to bring those responsible to justice. Before we discuss the
					 possibility of participating in military action let me underline that we have
					 had no request to date from the United States for a Canadian contingent and
					 that no decision has been taken by our government yet to deploy Canadian units
					 in the campaign against terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would want to consult with parliament before any
					 such deployment would take place. However it stands to reason that there will
					 be circumstances where the government will want to maintain flexibility,
					 obviously to respond quickly to emergency situations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we ponder whether there is a role that Canada might
					 be able to play in this campaign, I am sure that parliament will want to
					 provide our ally, the United States of America, with all the assistance that is
					 appropriate. I am convinced as well that the House will want to do what is
					 necessary to protect Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States was not the only victim in the attack
					 on September 11. We too have suffered a great loss. Hundreds of citizens from
					 Canada and other countries died on that day as well and there are thousands of
					 families across the world who have suffered.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I am saying is this. This is a horrific time for
					 us to be going through. I think the Parliament of Canada understands that.
					 Certainly the government understands fully that this is a time of great sorrow
					 but also a time where we have to act in concert with our American allies, and
					 that we will do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the last couple of days have shown that again
					 and again in terms of the bilateral meetings that took place between our Prime
					 Minister and President Bush. It also was underscored when our foreign affairs
					 minister met with the secretary of state to again forge the links that have
					 existed so historically and traditionally between Canada and the United States,
					 to again reassert the great values that we hold in common and that we share as
					 sovereign nations, to say that we will stand by our American brothers and
					 sisters as they would by us and that we will do so in the best interests of
					 Canada and in the best interests of the people of Canada. By extension when we
					 do that, when we stand shoulder to shoulder with our American friends and
					 allies in support, we will provide them with the kinds of requirements
					 necessary to ensure that in fact we underscore our commitment to
					 them.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of all of this, my point is simple. The
					 Canadian government will stand with the Americans in this very important
					 matter.</p>

					 Alliance) </b>

	moved that Bill C-289,
					 an act to amend the Young Offenders Act (public safety), be read the
					 second time and referred to a committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Madam Speaker, I rise tonight to speak to my
					 private member's bill, C-289, which attempts to amend the Young Offenders Act
					 and to achieve a number of objectives. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I proceed, I would like to point out to the
					 House that I initiated the drafting of the bill before the justice minister
					 introduced Bill C-3, a carbon copy of Bill C-7 that died on the order paper at
					 the dissolution of parliament with the call of the 2000 federal election. Bill
					 C-3 was an act to enact the criminal justice act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-289 reflects the sentiments expressed to me by
					 many of the Crowfoot residents during that 2000 federal election campaign,
					 sentiments which have been reverberating throughout the country since the
					 Liberals took power in 1993.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I made a commitment to the people of Crowfoot to
					 restore some sanity to a justice system that has, for far too long, in their
					 opinion, coddled offenders, particularly violent young offenders. Canadians
					 from coast to coast are concerned about their personal safety and the safety of
					 their children.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberals made a promise to Canadians. In successive
					 elections, they promised to make our homes and our streets much safer. It is
					 evident from the lenient justice legislation introduced and subsequently
					 enacted by this majority government, including the subsequent lax amendments to
					 the Young Offenders Act under Bill C-37, that the Liberals have not lived up to
					 those promises; indeed, the Liberals have broken those promises.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal government's soft on crime position will
					 not enhance public safety and personal security. The Liberal's soft justice
					 legislation, such as that enacting conditional sentences, threatens the safety
					 of all Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal justice minister, despite having
					 overwhelming support from people throughout the country, does not have the
					 fortitude to enact the necessary tough measures to hold murderers and other
					 violent offenders, including violent young offenders, fully accountable for
					 their heinous crimes against innocent citizens.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1996, the justice minister mandated the standing
					 committee on justice and legal affairs to review the Young Offenders Act
					 following the 10th anniversary of its enactment in 1984. After months of cross
					 country hearings, submissions and presentations by people with vested interest
					 in youth justice, and at a cost of almost half a million dollars, the committee
					 tabled a report in April 1997. The report contained a number of recommendations
					 for the Young Offenders Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the committee's report and despite the justice
					 minister's promise in June 1997, immediately following that federal election,
					 to make amending the Young Offenders Act a priority, it took her more than two
					 years to do so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking that old habits die hard, immediately
					 following the election I requested the drafting of Bill C-289 anticipating that
					 once again the justice minister would move slowly and drag her feet on bringing
					 in changes to the most despised piece of legislation in Canada, the Young
					 Offenders Act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister proved me wrong and did introduce Bill C-3
					 relatively soon after the 2000 federal election. She did, however, true to her
					 form, bring in a bill with little or no teeth.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, I commend my colleague from Surrey North
					 for repeatedly pointing out the inadequacies of Bill C-3.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fundamental purpose of Canada's youth justice
					 system is the protection of society, which entails dealing effectively with an
					 offender after a crime has been committed. It was not designed to repair social
					 flaws. It was not designed to deal with dysfunctional families. It was not
					 designed to deal with economic hardships. It was not put into place to deal
					 with the deficiencies of our education system. These root causes of youth crime
					 must instead be addressed through effective social programs, sound economic
					 policies, support for Canadian families and early detection and intervention
					 programs.</p>


	<A NAME="T1755"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1755"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1800"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1750"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1755)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By failing to recognize this simple fact, successive
					 federal governments have diluted and weakened the effectiveness of Canada's
					 criminal justice system. Young offenders are no longer being held accountable
					 for their actions in a proper and effective manner. As a result, Canadians have
					 lost faith in their ability to protect their families and their
					 property.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this all sounds familiar, it is because it is taken
					 from the Reform Party, our predecessor, minority report in response to the
					 justice committee's report on amending the Young Offenders Act. A significant
					 amount of time has passed, actually four years, since that minority report was
					 product. Nothing was different as far as youth crime goes. Therefore, our
					 position has not changed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first and perhaps the most important amendment I
					 seek through the private members' bill is to make the protection of society and
					 the safety of others the first purpose of the law respecting young offenders.
					 Appearing before the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs in October
					 1996, Victor Doerksen, who was a member of the legislature of Alberta,
					 said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>In listening to Albertans, one lesson
						  became very clear. The protection of society should take priority over all
						  other considerations and there must be some accountability on the part of all
						  offenders...Alberta also recommends that the declaration of principles within
						  the act be amended to give the protection of society and offender
						  accountability priority over all other considerations.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-3 does not, as recommended by this Alberta
					 member of the legislature and many others who appeared before that standing
					 committee, make the protection of society the first and guiding principle of
					 the youth act. According to the declaration of principles, the safety and
					 security of Canadians is secondary to the rehabilitation and reintegration of
					 young offenders back into society.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside failing to make the protection of society the
					 guiding principle, the new youth criminal justice act effectively enacts the
					 most contentious parts of the old Juvenile Delinquents Act; that is the portion
					 that wrongfully promotes an inequitable application of criminal law, in that it
					 allows or provides far too much discretion to the youth court.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-289 also serves to support section 43 of the
					 criminal code in that it attempts to reinforce the principle that reasonable
					 force may be used to discipline young persons by those with authority over
					 them. Those in positions of authority over youth, including parents, teachers
					 and police officers, should not be afraid to use reasonable means of discipline
					 or intervention in minor incidents.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schools are effectively diverting police officers from
					 far more serious matters by calling them unnecessarily to settle disputes that
					 could be handled by teachers or by other students. However, teachers fear that
					 they themselves may be charged if they inadvertently harm a student while
					 trying to stop a fight or dealing with an uncontrollable student. They are
					 reluctant to do anything but standby, stand back and watch until the police
					 arrive. That must be changed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-289 attempts to do a number of other things. It
					 attempts to lower the maximum age of the Young Offenders Act from 17 to 15
					 years of age. Sixteen and seventeen year olds are legally allowed to drive
					 cars. They are allowed to get married. They are allowed to live on their own.
					 They have the knowledge and the capacity to know right from wrong. They also
					 have the physical strength of most adults. In some cases perhaps more physical
					 strength than what most adults would have. For all intents and purposes, in my
					 opinion 16 and 17 year olds are adults and should be treated as such under the
					 criminal law. That opinion is shared by a number of people who appeared before
					 the committee as well. It is shared by the former Attorney General of Ontario,
					 Charles Harnick, who said before the standing committee:</p>


	<A NAME="T1800"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1800"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1800)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Our first recommendation is that a
						  young offender be defined as a person aged 15 years or under. Until the passing
						  of the Young Offenders Act in 1984, the maximum age for young offenders in
						  Ontario under the Juvenile Delinquents Act was 15-years old. For the purpose of
						  criminal law, 16 and 17-year-olds were considered adults... A 16-year-old can
						  legally drive, work, get married and have a family. If, as a society, we accept
						  a younger person's ability to make serious choices such as that, then we must
						  accept that 16-year-olds have the moral capacity to understand the consequences
						  of doing wrong and should be held accountable for their actions.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My private member's bill also attempts to lower the
					 minimum age limit of the Young Offenders Act from 12 years to 10.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numerous witnesses appeared before the standing
					 committee, including a city councillor from Scarborough, Ontario. That
					 councillor spoke in support of lowering the age of criminality. Councillor Brad
					 Duguid said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--I'd
						  like to see the age lowered in terms of the applicability to 10 years or under.
						  And that's not an attempt to try to throw 10 and 11-year-olds in custody or in
						  jail...It's simply an attempt to try to give the police a little more legal
						  ability to intervene, and I think that's the key, is being able to
						  intervene...</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding lowering the age limit, Constable Sue Olsen,
					 who is a native resource officer with the Edmonton police service, testified. I
					 loved the quote she gave at the standing committee. She said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>I work in the inner city school. One
						  of the issues that comes up for us as street police officers is that there is a
						  gap with the under 12-year-old children who get involved in criminal activity.
						  We're in a sit and wait process, waiting until they're 12 before we can get
						  them into services and deal with them before they become more of a problem down
						  the road.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The officer was saying that as it now applies we must
					 sit and wait until they are 12 years old so that they can get the help they
					 need.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of these young people in inner cities throughout
					 this nation need intervention at an early age. This is not so that people can
					 be incarcerated. This is not so we can take 10 and 11 year olds, hold them in
					 custody and throw them in jail. This is so they can get the rehabilitative
					 programs they need so that they will be successfully integrated into
					 society.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April 18, 1996, Superintendent Gwen Boniface, a
					 member of the Canadian Association of Police Chiefs, said in regard to the
					 anonymity of the Young Offenders Act:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--while valuable from the perspective of not labelling first
						  offenders and for all the very valid reasons that we know of, it is often
						  outweighed by the ability of young offenders to deflect responsibility. The
						  flaw with the system is that it countermands the basic principles that all
						  responsible parents attempt to instill in their children--namely, to accept
						  responsibility for one's actions.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the Canadian Association of Chiefs of
					 Police and in response to Albertans, who support a partial lifting of the ban,
					 my private member's bill seeks to allow for the publishing of all the names of
					 all violent offenders. I believe that the public has a right to know if a
					 violent offender has been released or may reside in their community. I believe
					 that knowledge far outweighs any privacy considerations for the offender.
					 Parents have the right to protect their children.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would submit that they cannot do so if they do not
					 know with whom their children are associating; perhaps with a convicted drug
					 dealer or a violent offender.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recognition that some youth make minor mistakes that
					 they do not repeat, I believe, as does my party, that their privacy should be
					 maintained.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recidivism rate for young offenders clearly shows
					 that the sentencing provisions of the Young Offenders Act have been
					 ineffective. Particularly in cases of violent offences such as sexual assault,
					 the current maximum sentence of only three years does not provide an adequate
					 period of time for rehabilitation to occur.</p>


	<A NAME="T1805"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1805"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1810"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1800"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1805)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has taken years for the offender to develop this
					 behaviour and it takes years to reverse it. The maximum sentence of seven years
					 proposed in my private member's bill would provide judges with greater
					 sentencing options for the most severe cases.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I campaigned in the election the people of
					 Crowfoot said that we needed an act that was not simply there to punish but was
					 also there to rehabilitate. Bill C-289 does that. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reforms are premised on the notion that it is
					 through prevention and meaningful and therefore varied consequences for the
					 full range of youth crime, rehabilitation and reintegration that Canadians are
					 protected over the long term. It recognizes the need to have a separate justice
					 system for youth, special procedural protections, interventions that are
					 proportionate to the seriousness of the offence, and approaches that help to
					 instruct the young person about the consequences of the behaviour. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would provide opportunities to repair harm, support
					 for rehabilitation and reintegration of the youth, and opportunities for the
					 constructive involvement of victims, family members and others. The new
					 direction for youth justice is both a fair and effective response to youth
					 crime and it is supported by Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed changes to the Young Offenders Act set out
					 in Bill C-289 were considered by the justice and human rights committee in its
					 study of Bill C-7 and not adopted. In sum, the proposed amendments allow for
					 less discretion in the system and essentially a punitive approach to youth
					 crime. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-7 embodies a fair and proportionate response to
					 youth crime. Sentences are intended to be adequate to hold a youth accountable
					 for the offence he or she has committed. Youth court judges can apply adult
					 sentences for serious offences, if necessary, to hold youth fairly accountable.
					 However the rule is fairness and proportionality to the seriousness of the
					 offence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who mistakenly believe that punishment alone
					 serves to protect society will never find penalties to be tough enough. Their
					 approach would result in unfair harsh penalties that are not effective in
					 stopping youth crime or reforming young offenders. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies are clear that harsh penalties do not deter
					 other youth. Moreover, there is a growing body of evidence that non-custodial
					 penalties are as or more effective than custodial ones and avoid the risks of
					 incarceration.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth justice system in Canada is already an overly
					 harsh and ineffective system. Young people are sentenced to custody at a rate
					 four times higher than adults. Studies show that Canada's youth incarceration
					 rate is the highest among western countries including the United States. Young
					 persons in Canada often receive harsher custodial sentences than adults receive
					 for the same type of offence. Almost 80% of custodial sentences are for
					 non-violent offences. Many non-violent and first time offenders found guilty of
					 less serious offences such as minor theft are sentenced to custody.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently the youth justice system under the Young
					 Offenders Act is not working as well as it should for Canadians. Too many young
					 people are charged and often incarcerated with questionable results. Procedural
					 protections for young people are not adequate and too many youth end up serving
					 custodial sentences with adults. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overarching principles are unclear and conflicting.
					 There are disparities and unfairness in youth sentencing. Interventions are not
					 appropriately targeted to the seriousness of offences. They are neither
					 adequately meaningful for individual offenders and victims nor adequately
					 supportive of rehabilitation and reintegration.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed youth criminal justice act would address
					 these fundamental flaws by targeting responses of the youth justice system to
					 the seriousness of the offence, clarifying the principles of the youth justice
					 system, ensuring fairness and proportionality in sentencing, respecting and
					 protecting rights, enabling meaningful consequences aimed at rehabilitation,
					 supporting reintegration after custody, and encouraging an inclusive approach
					 to youth crime.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These approaches are now included in Bill C-7 which
					 would repeal the Young Offenders Act and replace it with a legislative
					 framework that would reflect Canadian values and provide for a fairer and more
					 effective youth justice system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendments in Bill C-289 do not reflect
					 what Canadians want in a youth justice system. The proposed provisions include
					 a return to corporal punishment, removing privacy protections, lowering of ages
					 including the age of criminal responsibility to 10, longer youth sentences, and
					 less discretion in the system. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The direction of the amendments is repressive and does
					 not include efforts at rehabilitation, addressing the needs of youth or
					 involving youth in repairing the harm he or she may have caused. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians have seen that tough, disproportionate
					 punitive approaches are not only unfair but ineffective. Bill C-7, already
					 passed by the House of Commons, reflects the values and directions that
					 Canadians want in a renewed youth justice system. They are not the strictly
					 punitive approaches reflected in Bill C-289. Canadians want and deserve the
					 youth justice system envisioned in Bill C-7 that is the product of
					 consultation, advice and thought.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposals that are the subject of today's debate
					 were considered in the development of Bill C-7. They were not adopted then nor
					 should they be adopted now.</p>

					 Alliance): </b>

	Madam Speaker, any time I have an opportunity to
					 discuss the Canadian youth justice system, I do not hesitate to bring my
					 experience to the debate. I would like to commend the member for Crowfoot for
					 his continuing diligence in pointing out to the government Canadians'
					 overwhelming concern about the Canadian youth criminal justice
					 system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unfortunate that this private member's bill is
					 not votable because it would once again point out the government's absolute
					 lack of interest in listening to the concerns of the majority of Canadians with
					 respect to the important issue of youth crime. My colleague's bill encompasses
					 years of study and listening on the part of his predecessor from Crowfoot, Mr.
					 Jack Ramsay; listening not only to the Canadian public but to the judiciary
					 that must interpret the laws of the land and to those agencies most affected by
					 the laws, such as provincial detention centres, police forces, and various
					 educational systems to name just a few.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill, unlike the youth criminal justice act which
					 the Liberal government passed earlier this year, would make the protection of
					 society its primary focus. The Liberals on the other hand continue to put the
					 interests of the offender ahead of the protection of society. In various ways
					 the youth criminal justice act places the safety and security of Canadians
					 behind the interest in rehabilitating and reintegrating the offender back into
					 society. For example in the declaration of principle of the YCJA it lists the
					 following order of importance: one, address the circumstances underlying the
					 young person's offending behaviour; two, rehabilitate and reintegrate; and
					 three, ensure the young person is subject to meaningful
					 consequences.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government tries to assure Canadians that the order
					 does not matter. The order is important because it is what guides judges in
					 their determination of how much weight to assign to specific factors. Bill
					 C-289 would make the protection of society the primary and guiding principle of
					 Canada's youth criminal justice laws. That is not to say that rehabilitation
					 and reintegration into the community are not important. Obviously they are,
					 however the security and safety of the community must be considered above all
					 else.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are numerous examples of how this principle could
					 provide better protection to Canadians. One example that immediately comes to
					 mind is the murder of a six year old British Columbia girl, Dawn Shaw. On
					 October 24, 1992, Dawn was playing with her 16 year old next door neighbour
					 Jason Gamache in Courtenay on Vancouver Island. Unknown to Dawn's parents or
					 anyone else in the housing complex located right next to an elementary school
					 was the fact that Jason was on probation for sexually molesting a young child
					 one year previously. He dragged Dawn off into the bushes, sexually assaulted
					 her and stomped her to death when she tried to cry out for help. He then joined
					 in the search for her and after her battered body was found, he babysat her two
					 siblings while her parents went to the RCMP detachment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the police were unaware of his presence in the
					 community. It is my understanding that it was only after they ran his name
					 during the course of the investigation that he popped up on their information
					 system. Had our youth criminal justice laws given priority to the protection of
					 society, Dawn Shaw would be a flowering young woman today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any legislation that is guided by societal protection
					 would allow the community to know when a violent offender has been released
					 into its midst. How can parents protect their children if the law does not
					 permit them to know the dangers that are present? Unfortunately the new youth
					 criminal justice act follows closely in the footsteps of the Young Offenders
					 Act by imposing numerous restrictions on the naming of violent
					 offenders.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a limited number of instances in which the
					 young person may be named to protect the community, but once again the list is
					 restrictive and does not include all violent or dangerous offenders. The courts
					 retain the discretion to override the identification of the offender. In the
					 opinion of many, the courts have been excessively protective of the rights and
					 interests of young offenders while public and community safety have become
					 secondary. Bill C-289 would allow for the unrestricted public identification of
					 violent young offenders. It cannot be said often enough that the public has the
					 right to know information that will allow it to protect itself.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are so many flaws in the current Young Offenders
					 Act and the pending youth criminal justice act that in having only limited time
					 to talk about the changes the member for Crowfoot is suggesting in his private
					 member's bill, I can only touch the tip of the iceberg. Bill C-289 would lower
					 the age of application to 10 years. Contrary to the Liberal government's spin
					 machine, this is not only a proposition of the Canadian Alliance and its
					 predecessor the Reform Party. The same recommendation was made in a report from
					 the justice committee in the 35th parliament, the very report which forms the
					 basis of the youth criminal justice act. This was a Liberal dominated committee
					 but true to form, the government ignored it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intent is not to throw 10 and 11 year olds into
					 jail. It is to make sure that those taking the first steps down the road to
					 criminal behaviour receive the treatment and assistance they require. Far too
					 often we see these young people falling through the cracks of the current
					 system. Unfortunately, that will continue to be the case. </p>


	<A NAME="T1820"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1820"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1825"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1815"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1820)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of alternative measures is also advocated in
					 Bill C-289. I have mentioned many times before in this place that I fully
					 support this approach as witnessed by my own involvement for the past seven
					 years in the community based diversion program at home in British Columbia. It
					 should be pointed out that although the Liberals would have Canadians believe
					 that what they refer to as extrajudicial measures is their brainchild, Bill
					 C-289 has been around substantially longer than the youth criminal justice act
					 in all of its incarnations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one major difference however. Alternative
					 measures as proposed in Bill C-289 would be restricted to those charged with
					 non-violent offences. In addition, the views of the victims would require
					 consideration if alternative measures were being proposed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth criminal justice act will make extrajudicial
					 measures available to repeat and violent offenders. In my opinion that defeats
					 the whole purpose. Violent behaviour demands a more formal, serious response
					 from society. Alternative measures should be presented as a one time only
					 opportunity for a young person who truly desires to reform.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I indicated earlier, it is unfortunate that private
					 member's Bill C-289 is not votable. If the current Young Offenders Act were
					 amended according to the proposals contained in the bill, there would be no
					 need for an entirely new piece of legislation as was passed in the form of the
					 youth criminal justice act. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youth criminal justice act, due to its mind-numbing
					 complexity and failure to comply with the wishes of Canadians will in all
					 likelihood become as much despised as the Young Offenders Act it is intended to
					 replace.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-51974"></A><a HREF="#Int-51976"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-51970"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Peter MacKay
					 (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I very much attach myself to the remarks
					 of the previous speaker and many who have real, legitimate concerns with
					 respect to the implementation of Bill C-7, the new youth criminal justice act,
					 which like its predecessors, contains a very complex and cumbersome approach to
					 youth justice in this country, one which will not achieve desired ends, that
					 is, an attempt to bring about greater accountability and responsibility in our
					 youth criminal justice system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do disagree with one comment of the previous speaker,
					 which is that accepting this bill in its entirety would do more than bringing
					 about a new youth criminal justice system. Certainly I think it touches on some
					 very important subject areas which have been debated numerous times in the
					 House. The hon. member's predecessor from Crowfoot also brought about numerous
					 suggestions to improve the criminal justice system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we are generally supportive of this private
					 member's bill, it deals with subject matter that will be addressed by the new
					 youth criminal justice system, particularly with respect to sentencing
					 provisions, implementation of rehabilitative programs and early intervention.
					 The elements that deal with the lowering of the age of accountability is
					 something that other members, including myself, have spoken on, have presented
					 private member's business on going back a number of years. This legislation
					 would not, as the previous speaker indicated, be a licence to somehow hammer 10
					 year olds.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members are well aware, it would simply bring about
					 a process where the justice system could intervene at the earliest possible
					 opportunity, particularly when it involves crimes of violence, and particularly
					 when it involves a young person who has exhibited a longstanding record of
					 anti-social behaviour.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the current rate, the police, counsellors and those
					 who want to intervene, including the young person's parents, may have to wait
					 two years until they reach the age of 12 before the system can kick in. The
					 response that is so often given is that there are social services provisions
					 that can react. They do not have the sanctions available under the criminal
					 justice system. More important, they do not have the resources. That is perhaps
					 one of the greatest flaws of this new legislation that my friend of course did
					 not have time to touch upon.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all of the good that might come from implementation
					 of Bill C-7, the new youth criminal justice act, the provinces are still left
					 to carry the majority of the resources and the funding that would implement
					 these rehabilitative type programs and restorative justice models. There is
					 increasing frustration among justice officials, prosecutors, counsellors,
					 probation officers and those who are working in the system regarding the
					 downloading of a very cumbersome, complex bill without the resources and actual
					 tools to implement or enact the programs which do not exist.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some very good programs currently operating
					 without the involvement of the federal government, without the budget. I had an
					 opportunity to visit Pitt Meadows and Maple Ridge, British Columbia where there
					 is a unique, highly effective early intervention style program up and running
					 which is based on restorative justice models. On numerous occasions when they
					 have applied for federal funding for resources,in keeping with the spirit, pith
					 and substance of what Bill C-7 represents, they have been told that there is no
					 money available for such a thing. This is in advance of the government bringing
					 in these changes. One has to question whether it is in good faith that we are
					 going to see this legislation actually implemented.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unfortunate that the bill is not a votable item.
					 In most instances I think the House would like to express its will on such an
					 important piece of legislation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill does reinforce the principle that reasonable
					 force may be used in a disciplinary manner. This is one of a number of omnibus
					 type bills that we see before us. We are generally supportive of these
					 initiatives but I do not think that restating a principle that is already in
					 existence accomplishes a great deal. Judicial discretion is sometimes absent
					 when we make hard and fast rules about what sentences will apply and when
					 judges will be permitted to apply them.</p>


	<A NAME="T1825"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1825"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1830"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1820"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1825)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existing Young Offenders Act and the proposed
					 amendments currently before the Senate allow for a broader range of sentences
					 on certain issues, particularly pertaining to youths aged 14 and up where a
					 transfer may occur in a courtroom. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a good thing. Discretion should be broadened in
					 certain instances, particularly for offences involving violence where judges
					 must weigh a range of circumstances. Some offences, such as assault with a
					 weapon, are deemed violent even when they do not result in substantial
					 injuries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those types of decisions should be left to the courts.
					 Judges should be permitted to hear from both defence and crown counsel
					 regarding the extent of the harm that may have been caused before they make a
					 decision to sentence a young person.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I disagree with the suggestion that we lower the
					 application of the Young Offenders Act to age 16. There is ample evidence
					 before the country and in the criminal justice system that youths at age 17 can
					 still avail themselves of a diminished degree of responsibility in the court
					 system. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With new provisions in place that allow for the
					 elevation and transfer of young people into the adult court system it becomes
					 redundant to lower the age of application of the youth justice system.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The private member's bill puts a number of
					 recommendations before the House that deal with lengthening periods of
					 probation. That is a good suggestion. In the past young people have finished
					 their incarceration and left the closed custody of detention centres only to
					 have no follow up or probation period on which conditions are attached. They
					 are not ordered to avoid certain associations, refrain from the use and
					 possession of alcohol, or stay away from individuals who may have been involved
					 in their offence such as the victim or the victim's family.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probationary conditions are an important part of
					 rehabilitation and the protection of the public, which are of course the
					 fundamental principles that must apply in any justice system. Lengthening
					 periods of probation or making them mandatory is a good thing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-7 would apply a new system of probation that
					 would allow for parole and reduced sentences. That is very much a step
					 backward. Despite its flaws the current system is consistent in the application
					 of sentences. Young people incarcerated for a period of time know they will be
					 there for that set time. They realize that is the sentence that has been meted
					 out and they can avail themselves of programs. Under the new system they would
					 be eligible for parole and early release.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the route we should be pursuing. It is not
					 the direction in which the youth justice system should be headed. It would add
					 to the already intense cynicism that exists throughout the country regarding
					 the light sentences often handed down by our youth court system. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Progressive Conservative Party is generally
					 supportive of the bill. In the past we have consistently emphasized protection
					 of the public and meaningful sentences that bring about accountability and
					 responsibility. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad the new member of parliament for Crowfoot is
					 a convert to the fray and is prepared to bring issues and bills such as this
					 one before the House of Commons. The legislation if enacted would mirror the
					 provisions of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, although not in its entirety.
					 Streamlining legislation is something we should all take seriously. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the impact is grave and has huge implications for
					 a young person's life the public should have a profound understanding of what
					 the justice system is attempting to do. The new youth criminal justice system
					 as currently proposed by the Department of Justice would accomplish the exact
					 opposite. </p>

					 Alliance): </b>

	Madam Speaker, there is an old saying: “If it ain't
					 broke, don't fix it”. The implication is that if it is broken it needs to be
					 fixed. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I grew up on a farm and have an old pickup. That pickup
					 truck is so old and there are so many things wrong with it that if I tried to
					 fix it I would not know where to begin. It does not run well. It blows oil out
					 the back. The mirrors are broken and the windshield is shot. If I wanted to
					 build the thing into a new truck I would not start by replacing the mirrors. I
					 would not know where to begin.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen over the past period of time that the
					 Young Offenders Act is broken and needs repair. The government has said it is
					 broken. There were things in the Juvenile Delinquents Act that were
					 unacceptable. There were contentious parts of the act that the government and
					 all sides of the House said needed to be repaired.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bills and proposals have been brought forward such as
					 Bill C-3 and Bill C-7 which the government has tried to tinker with. As we
					 heard from the Liberal member across the way a new bill has been brought
					 forward, but we are looking at it and asking if it will solve the young
					 offender problem we have in the nation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the things we will grow accustomed to in the
					 House through the years is people standing in the Chamber and saying we need to
					 fix the Young Offenders Act. I believe if we were to ask members opposite they
					 would say yes, there are areas of the act that are not what we would like them
					 to be and they should be fixed, changed and repaired. However the act we have
					 in place does not do that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian public would say we need to fix the act.
					 They would say we see many repeat offenders and many teachers who go to school
					 not knowing their students are young offenders. Some are violent offenders yet
					 their teachers are not aware a threat exists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recidivism rate for young offenders clearly shows
					 that the Young Offenders Act is broken and its provisions are ineffective. They
					 are ineffective in many areas, particularly with respect to violent offences
					 such as sexual assault. The current maximum sentence of only three years does
					 not provide adequate time for rehabilitation to occur. These are, without a
					 shadow of a doubt, young people whom we want to see rehabilitated. We want to
					 see them reintegrated into society as young men or women who can
					 contribute.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It takes years in some cases for an offender to develop
					 a behaviour and it sometimes takes years to reverse it. The maximum sentence of
					 seven years proposed by my private member's bill would provide judges with
					 greater sentencing options for the most severe cases. Currently judges' hands
					 are tied when they feel that a longer disposition is necessary for the benefit
					 of the offender and the protection of society. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The late mayor of Cornwall, Ron Martelle,
					 said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not recommend longer sentences if we do not first
					 ensure that all prison facilities have mandatory rehabilitative programs.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who oppose longer sentences point to the high
					 recidivism rate of young offenders who have been incarcerated. They wrongly
					 conclude that increasing sentences would be ineffective. Others say prison
					 facilities do not provide effective rehabilitation and that this contributes to
					 higher rates of reoffending.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say this is partly due to limited money and
					 resources. Time does not afford me to go on with the list. However, I implore
					 all members of the House and the general public to read my private member's
					 bill and understand that it is a bill of principles. It outlines requests made
					 to me by the people of Crowfoot and the former member for Crowfoot who, as has
					 been noted here, worked diligently in justice issues, especially with respect
					 to young offenders.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would help restore integrity and sanity to our
					 justice system by making the protection of society its guiding principle.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many opportunities through social programs to
					 get to the root causes of youth crime. We need to do that. We need to implore
					 our provincial governments to make sure social programs dealing with education,
					 poverty and a vast number of issues are met.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As legislators in the House, it behooves us to bring
					 down laws that first, would protect our society and communities and then would
					 allow young offenders to be reintegrated into society so they may be
