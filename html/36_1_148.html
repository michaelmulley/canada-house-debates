</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Timmins—James Bay, Lib.)</B> moved for 
leave to introduce Bill C-453, an act to regulate the issue of 
ceremonial statements of service and recognition of duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, having been involved for some 20 years in 
federal politics, I have, on many occasions, encountered veterans 
who were not wounded in any conflict that Canada was involved in 
and therefore have nothing to show in terms of a card.  On the 
other hand, those who were wounded are carrying a health card 
which they cherish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, today I am proud to introduce this bill proposing a 
certificate of service and duty to all war veterans and civilian 
groups who served in support of the armed forces in such 
organizations as the Red Cross and the Merchant Seamen, as well 
as United Nations peacekeeping units. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This certificate will recognize and honour their significant 
participation in any armed conflict or war in which Canada took 
part.  They are all responsible for the freedom we enjoy today. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years, I have on numerous occasions met veterans who 
had nothing to show for their participation in world conflicts. 
I am therefore extremely pleased to introduce this bill today, 
which will enable them to carry in their wallets a mark of 
recognition by the Government of Canada.

<P><A NAME="LINK12"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have three sets of petitions to present.  The first petition is 
signed by 59 Canadians who are concerned about the Copyright 
Board and the recent decision of the Copyright Board concerning 
commercial television royalties which will retroactively reduce 
the royalties of Canadian music creators and adopt the American 
practice of enforcing individual music composers to negotiate 
directly with large broadcasting corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners are requesting that parliament strongly affirm 
this commitment:  That the Minister of Industry immediately 
appoint a judge to chair the Copyright Board in respect of 
parliament's intent that the board be competent and objective as 
a quasi-judicial tribunal.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the second set of petitions concerns marriage and contains 325 
signatures.  The petitioners stated that the majority of 
Canadians understand the concept of marriage as being only the 
voluntary union of a single, that is, unmarried male and a 
single, that is, unmarried female.  The petitioners pray that 
parliament will enact Bill C-225, an act to amend the Marriage 
Act and the Interpretation Act.

the third petition is a gathering of four separate petitions, all 
on the same issue, containing a total of 1,060 signatures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petition pertains to the work of the Reform Party and others 
who are trying to bring in the philosophy of zero tolerance 
relative to drunk driving.  The petitioners state that victims of 
the crime of impaired driving must be given the highest priority, 
as reflected by their impact statements, and that in cases of 
impaired driving causing death or injury sentencing must reflect 
the severity of the crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my pleasure to present this petition on behalf of 1,060 
signatories in memory of Norm and Shawna.

have the honour to table, in both official languages, at the 
request of the Comité des citoyens pour le monorail, a petition 
signed by over 6,200 of my constituents.  They are asking the 
government not to transfer the infrastructure of the Champlain 
Bridge to the Quebec Government until the latter issues a total 
ban on its automobile, bus and truck traffic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners are calling for a monorail project to the 
downtown area, which will use the bridge structure without any 
noise or other pollution.

Speaker, it is my pleasure, pursuant to Standing Order 36, to 
present a petition on behalf of Canadians who are very concerned 
about the multilateral agreement on investment.  They are worried 
that this agreement, if signed, will hamper our sovereignty and 
will limit the social programs that we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously they are very concerned that Donald Johnston of the 
OECD, who is the Canadian heading up that organization, is trying 
to get this agreement signed on behalf of very large 
multinational corporations which will negatively affect 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are skeptical of the assurances that the MAI is dead and, 
therefore, are asking parliament, if the MAI is resurrected, to 
not sign as a country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, 
the government should move immediately to defend the interests of

stagnant farm incomes to a full-blown farm income crisis, and in 
the event no immediate progress is made on this front, introduce 
emergency measures to provide tax relief, lower input costs, 
reduce user fees and address the inadequacies of the farm safety-net 
programs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the 
Leader of the Official Opposition.  Reformers will be splitting 
their time throughout the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin by reading some headlines as they have been 
appearing in the papers out west.  Since the minister of 
agriculture has been denying there is a farm income crisis, I can 
only surmise he is only reading the newspapers from Toronto. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what the newspapers are saying.  From the Calgary 
<I>Herald</I> on October 31, “Outlook cloudy for agriculture 
sector”.  From the Regina <I>Leader Post</I> on October 30, 
“Farm crunch looms”.  From <I>Agri-Week</I> on October 26,  “No 
government aid for farm income crunch”.  From the Winnipeg 
<I>Free Press</I>  on October 30, “Farmers turn up heat on Ottawa 
as farm income plummets”.  From the Saskatoon <I>Star Phoenix</I> 
on October 22, “Subsidy wars killing farmers”.  From the 
<I>Western Producer</I> on October 22, “Net farm income needs 
attention” and “Prairie pools demand feds respond to farm 
crisis”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Need I go on?  Do the Liberals read the papers outside Toronto? 
Apparently not.  The minister of agriculture has been responding 
to opposition questions about the farm income crisis since 
September 24 and has yet to acknowledge there is a real problem. 
On September 24 the minister said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The disaster relief program and the farm safety net program for 
Canadian farmers are already in place. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 28 the minister repeated his mantra by saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have one of the strongest safety nets in the world. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of thousands of farmers in Canada, if Canada has one 
of the strongest safety net systems in the world, why are we 
having a farm income crisis?  Why are so many farmers in trouble? 
I ask the minister to acknowledge at least that NISA is totally 
inadequate in helping farmers compete with unfair foreign 
subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the minister of agriculture to listen to the words of 
just one of the many farmers coming into my office and phoning 
me.  I spoke to this gentleman last week.  He has been farming 
for 33 years.  Here are his own words: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel so terrible.  I can't even put money on the offering plate 
Sunday morning.  I'm probably worth more than most people in 
Canada—I farm seven quarters, fifty head of beef cattle, I got 
seventy bushels of barley and 35 of wheat per acre.  An average 
calf crop.  Productivity is good, but prices aren't.  I haven't 
replaced my equipment in seven years and it wasn't new then.  I'm 
repairing and patching but I can't anymore.  Farming is not like 
other businesses—we don't want to make a lot of money, but we 
can't keep going, and we have no alternatives.  We have no 
alternatives!  Farmers have something to offer the country—it's 
being eroded—it's not just dollars and cents.  It's a sin that 
raw food has no value in exchange for goods and services. Why 
does our nation have a different view from the Europeans on this? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I share this with the House of Commons because this farmer 
expressed better than I the real pressures farmers are feeling on 
a daily basis.  It takes a special kind of person to be a farmer. 
It is not an easy life.  They only want to make a living.  The 
minister should come with me to the restaurants in my riding and 
listen or take some of the calls I get into my office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No matter how one calculates farm income, total net income or 
net cash income or realized net income, farm incomes have been 
flat on the prairies for at least 20 years.  These farmers have 
managed to survive year by year in spite of stagnant incomes, but 
they are in no position to withstand a real income crisis such as 
we are experiencing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The indications of the crisis are varied.  It is taking its toll 
on farmers.  Record numbers of Saskatchewan farmers are calling 
the farm stress line this year.  In September the stress line 
received 147 calls.  The program co-ordinator for the line said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There's been twice as many calls in September compared to other 
months.  The hope is going.  If you don't have hope you don't 
have much to look forward to.  You can only struggle for so long.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Friday the Debt Mediation Service said that inquiries for 
help were already up 22% over last year in Saskatchewan and 
Manitoba.  It estimates that 600 producers will use its service 
this year alone.  These are real people behind the statistics 
that the minister of agriculture is ignoring.  These are not the 
only people the minister is ignoring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Federation of Agriculture says farm income is 
likely to drop by more than 40% this year, due largely to the 
collapse of the Asian market.  Wheat prices have fallen by more 
than 40% over the last 12 months while another hard hit sector, 
hog farming, has seen a price decline of 28%.  Meanwhile total 
federal funding for agriculture sits at $670 million, down from 
$2.5 billion a decade ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saskatchewan agriculture minister Eric Upshall said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have about a 10% subsidy according to the OECD analysis, the 
U.S. has roughly 30% and the Europeans are at 36 to 37%.  So 
there's a tremendous difference.  We're caught in the squeeze. 
We've been the good guys on the block.  We've cut our subsidy. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The world market has been hit from two sides.  On the one hand 
there is a huge grain crop this year made larger because heavily 
subsidized European farmers decided to produce more wheat.  On 
the other hand the booming Asian market is one big bust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Statistics Canada, Canadian farm cash receipts in 
the first half of 1998 were 5.1% lower than the same period last 
year.  In Saskatchewan they dropped 8.9% and 12.5% in some areas 
of Manitoba, blamed largely on a decline in wheat prices brought 
about by record world-wide production and dampened demand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian wheat, barley and livestock revenues were all down 
during the first six months of the year.  Some Saskatchewan hog 
producers say that they are losing between $30 and $40 on every 
hog they sell.  They are asking the province for a bailout. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The price of finished cattle, animals that have been fattened at 
the feedlot, is dismal as well.  Saskatchewan farmers will likely 
see their realized net cash income less depreciation drop by more 
than 60% this year to less than $300 million.  Meanwhile there 
has been no dropoff in freight rates or the cost of chemicals, 
fertilizer and farm machinery.  There has been no dropoff in fuel 
and debt servicing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1995 to 1997 gross operating expenses for Saskatchewan 
farmers have risen from $3.9 billion to $4.36 billion according 
to the province.  The total debt held by farmers has risen from 
$4.48 billion in 1993 to $5.11 billion in 1997.  Last year farm 
debt jumped 7% alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally last week <I>Agri-Week</I> reported: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Never before have prices of almost every major commodity class 
been down at the same time.  This is the first time that the 
agricultural economy has been on its own through the down phase 
of an economic cycle. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prairie pools are calling for an elimination of foreign 
subsidies, a reduction or elimination of cost recovery programs 
which the pools say cost farmers $138 million in 1998, and the 
development of a national disaster assistance program.  Why is 
the minister not listening? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can we conclude from all this?  Our farmers could compete 
if only our government had not mismanaged affairs so badly.  Our 
tax burden makes input costs for farmers very high.  Some have 
estimated that for some items the farmer must purchase the input 
costs may be almost 50% tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The responsibility for the mismanagement of the agricultural 
portfolio rests squarely on the shoulders of the government and 
the last two ministers of agriculture.  If the Liberal government 
and the bureaucrats were doing their job, agriculture would not 
be in this crisis. 
With the big bucks that are being poured into the department of 
agriculture bureaucracy, they should have been on top of this 
situation and had it solved before it became a crisis.  Other 
countries did.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a wonderful country.  We all enjoy high quality food

deal to it.  We should hang our heads in shame for the little 
regard we have for them and the value they are to us. 
<P><A NAME="LINK32"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I join today with my colleagues in the House in saying 
that what we are facing in agriculture is a real emergency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my province of Saskatchewan the statistics show that in 1997 
net farm income has dropped by 84%.  People are suffering because 
of that.  This is no surprise.  If your income, Mr. Speaker, was 
to drop by 84% you would be in the House probably asking for an 
emergency injection of cash because you cannot survive when your 
income goes down by 84%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is compounded by the fact the United States about two weeks 
ago passed a farm bill in Congress to subsidize its farmers by $6 
billion.  There are subsidies in the European market of 
approximately $200 a tonne for wheat.  Because of that our 
farmers are caught in a terrible cost price squeeze. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently the Saskatchewan legislature passed a motion, I believe 
it was unanimously, calling for an emergency farm package.  We 
are dealing with a situation where there is to be a small surplus 
next year.  The House should look at investing part of that 
surplus into an emergency farm package for farmers so that they 
can survive.  In the meantime it would also stimulate the economy 
by creating jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my colleague who just sat down agree that we need an 
emergency injection of cash, an emergency aid program of several 
hundreds of millions of dollars, so that farmers, particularly 
grain farmers, can survive? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I once again remind the House and the minister of agriculture 
that net farm income in Saskatchewan has dropped by 84%.  That 
affects everybody in our province and everybody right across the 
country.  When the farmer is worse off the small towns are worse 
off, the cities are worse off, the unemployment rate goes up, and 
people stop spending money.  There is a cyclical effect which 
affects absolutely everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the Reform Party will join with us today in calling for 
an emergency farm package of several hundred million dollars to 
inject some cash into the pockets of farmers within the next few 
months to seed their crops next spring and so they can survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
support that I am getting with regard to the motion we have put 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate what I said in my speech in case people missed it. 
First we have to acknowledge that there is a crisis.  The 
minister has yet to do that.  We cannot begin to solve the 
problem if we do not first acknowledge that there is a crisis. 
That is where we should begin.  If we are to solve that crisis we 
have to go to the root of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers know the root of the problem.  For us to sit in the 
House and try to dictate what the solution is to the farmers in 
Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Alberta, Nova Scotia, Ontario or wherever 
a crisis is being experienced, will not work.  The bureaucrats 
here have mucked it up so badly that they will not do a better 
job, in my estimation, if we continue along this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I saw statistics a short time ago where if we took the salaries 
of all the bureaucrats—there is one bureaucrat for every 5.7 
farmers and they do not work for peanuts—and divided it among 
farmers, we would probably not have a crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at the big picture.  We have to look at what 
farmers are telling us.  If the solution comes from Ottawa it 
will distort the market even more.  We need to have the solution 
coming from farmers.  We have to do it soon.  The crisis is here. 
We have to address it right now.  That is where we begin.

Speaker, I represent an urban riding, Calgary Southwest.  To the 
best of my knowledge all my constituents are in the habit of 
eating three times a day.  Thus all of them, as indeed all of us, 
have a vested interest in the financial health of the 
agricultural sector, which is the subject of the motion before 
the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe I am now the only party leader in the House who was 
actually raised on a farm.  I urge the other leaders to join in 
this debate in recognition of the importance of agriculture to us 
all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first purpose of the motion before the House is to draw the 
attention of the House and the media to what my colleague from 
Saskatchewan has rightfully called the farm income crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of my other colleagues will describe the nature and extent 
of this crisis by reference to its impact on particular producers 
and their families in rural ridings.  But the basic facts are 
clear, some of which have already been cited.  Farm income is 
likely to drop by more than 40% this year as grain, beef and pork 
producers all face declining prices.  This is in addition to a 
steep price decline last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wheat prices have fallen more than 40% over the last 12 months 
while hog farmers have seen a price decline of 28%.  On a 
provincial basis, to cite only two examples, the realized net 
farm income of Saskatchewan farmers is expected to drop by more 
than 60% this year to less than $300 million, and Prince Edward 
Island's realized net farm income for 1998 is expected to be 87% 
less than the 1992-1996 average. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that if the prices or incomes in any other industrial 
or commercial sector such as the auto sector were to drop by 30% 
or 60% or 87% we would immediately recognize and acknowledge a 
crisis.  That is what this motion now calls on the government to 
do with respect to agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second purpose of this motion is to urge the government to 
respond to this crisis with more than empty words and assurances 
that what it has been doing is good enough.  We are all familiar 
with the government's standard excuse for non action, the 
tiresome argument that the general slowdown in the Canadian 
economy and the particular income crisis in agriculture is all 
due to factors beyond the government's control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition takes a different and more proactive 
approach.  We divide the causes of our current economic 
difficulties into two categories.  One category identifies 
factors beyond our control which we ought to monitor like the 
Asian downturn and the worldwide downturn in commodity prices. 
But the other category includes factors contributing to the 
economic downturn and the crisis in certain sectors which are 
within our control and which we can and should be doing something 
about.  It is to this category of factors that we draw the 
attention of the House and the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The slowdown in the Canadian economy in general and the farm 
income crisis in particular is aided and abetted by high debt and 
taxation levels at home and by the slowness of the Liberal 
government to attack domestic and external barriers to trade. 
Every Canadian producer, including every Canadian agricultural 
producer, has a domestic monkey on his back that negatively 
affects his ability to compete internationally.  That monkey is 
the excessive levels of taxation in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of agricultural producers the tax component of input 
costs, in particular fuel and fertilizer, reduces disposable farm 
income year after year.  Broad based and immediate reduction of 
taxes including taxes masquerading as user fees is therefore one 
measure the government should employ to deal immediately with the 
farm income crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government had followed the fiscal plan first 
advocated by Reform which called for a balanced budget early in 
the 1990s and tax relief and debt reduction immediately 
thereafter, the disposable income and savings of agricultural 
producers for the last five years would have been significantly 
higher than they are today, thereby putting them in a much better 
position to withstand the current downturn in commodity prices. 
In other words, the best income support program is not some 
government safety net after the fact but tax policies that leave 
more dollars in the pockets of Canadian producers and consumers 
to start with. How many income crises will it take for this 
government to learn that lesson? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, every Canadian agricultural producer has another monkey 
on his back in the form of unfair subsidies and unfair trading 
practices by foreign countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada's case the most damaging of these foreign monkeys has 
been the excessive agricultural subsidies paid to European Union 
and American farmers, subsidy levels in the order of 30% to 37%, 
and recent attempts by several U.S. states to blockade shipments 
of Canadian livestock and grain in complete violation of the 
spirit and the letter of the free trade agreement.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As everyone in this House knows, the Liberal Party of Canada has 
a checkered record with respect to both subsidies and free trade. 
Throughout the 20th century Liberal administrations have 
instituted far more subsidies than they have removed, which makes 
them very poor champions of subsidy reduction on the 
international stage.  Because it bitterly fought the Canada-U.S. 
Free Trade Agreement in 1988 and even promised at one time to 
revoke it, Liberal Party protestations against violations of that 
agreement are treated with extreme scepticism in Washington. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why this motion calls for more vigorous action by this 
government to defend Canadian farmers from unfair subsidies and 
unfair trading practices by foreign countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one final observation.  When we ask Canadian farmers to 
evaluate this government's performance on agriculture more and 
more of them are responding by saying it is like what it has done 
to their taxes and health care.  What they mean by that is 
mismanagement, mismanagement that is leading to a lower standard 
of living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians will be judging the government's ability to 
respond to the general economic slowdown by how it responds to 
the immediate income crisis in agriculture. That is why this 
debate is so important.  If the government cannot respond more 
quickly, more positively and decisively to the downturn in one 
sector, the agriculture sector, who will believe that it is 
capable of responding quickly, positively and decisively to the 
general economic downturn which the finance minister himself is 
predicting? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government wants to restore some measure of confidence in 
its ability to manage economic crises other than by resorting to 
denials, excuses and diversions, let it respond positively to the 
motion before the House.  I urge hon. members to support the 
motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to pose a couple of 
questions for clarification to the Leader of the Opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his comments a minute ago he accused the Liberal government 
of giving a lot of subsidies to farmers in Canada.  I am just 
wondering if what he is saying now is that he feels we should do 
more.  I will address how I think we can assist farmers in the 
future but I want to ask him if he would square that.  He 
contradicted himself fairly severely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if he would comment about the fact that in the lead-up 
to the last election his party said it would take $640 million 
out of a number of ministries and another $690 million out of 
regional agricultural support.  If we add the two together it 
comes to a sizeable number, about 80% of the agriculture and 
agri-food budget, which includes the funding of $600 million a 
year at the present time to agricultural support to Canadian 
farmers. I wonder how the hon. member thought he could remove 
that much money, add more subsidies and do it with only 15% of 
the agriculture budget we have now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister 
for his questions.  Let me deal with them in the order in which 
he raised them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, my general point was that in the 20th century the record 
of the Liberal government has been to grant far more subsidies 
than to grant subsidy relief.  The minister can check that out 
and go through all the subsidies. I am not talking only about 
agriculture.  I am talking about the Liberal government's general 
record in subsidization.  Yes, there has been some removal of 
subsidies in the agriculture sector in the last number of years. 
But the overall record of the government has been to resort to 
subsidies time and time again.  My point is that when it is a 
government with a reputation for subsidization it makes it a poor 
advocate for subsidy reduction in other countries because they 
simply point to the government's record and say “you guys are 
great people to talk”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1040"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point with respect to this subsidy question is by 
leaving NISA, the net income stabilization account, as the primary 
farm support program we would think the government would be more 
interested in increasing net incomes during the times when prices 
are good.  If we are to rely on a NISA type program it is 
stronger when prices are low if we leave more dollars in the 
pockets of consumers when prices are high.  Net income 
stabilization works better if we leave more income in people's 
pockets during the boom time.  That is why I hope minister would 
be an advocate of tax relief with the finance minister because 
that would make the one program he is relying on work better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point the minister made is typical of the questions 
and reactions of Liberal ministers, half the story.  The minister 
referred to our proposals for reductions in some government 
spending, including reductions in his department.  What he forgot 
to mention was the tax relief that those reductions when added up 
across all the departments made possible.  Yes, we advocated 
reductions in some of the overhead spending of the agriculture 
department, but the net effect to doing that over five years was 
to deliver $20 billion in tax relief to Canadians, including 
significant tax relief to Canadian farmers, tax relief greater in 
its aggregate than any reduction to agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest the minister read both sides of what we are talking 
about, the pain of reduction but the benefit of tax relief.  We 
end up with a net benefit and a net benefit to Canadian farmers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I went to the Council of Europe, an organization which 
meets quarterly in Europe.  It is members of parliament from all 
European and eastern European countries. They have a number of 
committees which discuss the various issues, including economics 
and agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the agriculture committee about three years ago what it 
was planning on doing with subsidizing agriculture in its 
countries.  This was the year when the Liberal government 
eliminated the Crow benefit to Canada farmers.  The Crow benefit 
was a transportation rate, a subsidy which provided producers 
with an opportunity to sell their products to market under the 
old Crow benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was eliminated by the government because it said WTO warrants 
the elimination of this subsidy.  So it is gone.  It has been 
gone for three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Europeans told me they would never sacrifice their farmers 
for the U.S.A. with respect to subsidies.  They also told me they 
have five years under WTO to address the subsidy issues.  We are 
three years down the road and subsidies in Europe are as high as 
they have ever been, rightly or wrongly.  We have in our country 
abandoned our farmers.  We have no national agriculture policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the Americans and the Europeans have not sacrificed 
their farmers by eliminating subsidies, would the Leader of the 
Opposition support subsidies for our farmers now in view of the 
fact that there is a crisis in our farm communities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know the instinctive 
gut reaction of the NDP to any economic crisis is to yell for a 
subsidy.  We are open to listening to the arguments members are 
putting for emergency aid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that the long term strategy of the government should 
be to do what we can to reduce and eliminate those subsidies by 
our big competitors, particularly with respect to the United 
States.  I suggest three things that are more practical than 
anything I have heard from this side of the House or that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the government should use that dispute settling mechanism 
more actively and quickly.  This crisis was seen coming.  It took 
six weeks to activate that mechanism and it should not do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the government should move more actively to lobby U.S. 
consumer interests.  Our allies in this fight with the U.S. are 
American consumer interests gouged by the U.S. subsidization 
programs and protectionism as much as our farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, get into this European-American dialogue which is going 
to put great pressure on reduction of European subsidies.  Those 
are three things that can be done on a proactive side to reduce 
and eliminate the subsidies.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to discuss the 
concerns that are being debated here today on the very serious 
situation of farm income for this year.  I remind members that 
every time I have stood in the House in the last number of weeks 
to discuss this matter and answer questions, I have fully 
recognized the unfortunate situation of the farmers. I share with 
the farmers and members of the House their concerns over the 
difficulties of many of Canada's farmers today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I hope to leave hon. members with a fuller appreciation of 
the situation which is without question a complex one.  I know 
that they read the newspapers.  And yes, I read the newspapers. 
Yes, I hear what is being said on TV.  I want to show how closely 
the provincial governments, producer organizations and the 
federal government have worked over the last decade to put in 
place a pretty good system of safety nets to protect farm income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that I will say that there is no absolutely perfect safety 
net system in our lives, whether it be personal, or business or 
in government. That is why it was discussed at the 
federal-provincial ministers meeting this summer. That is why we 
have moved forward even faster.  We saw what was coming with the 
financial situation of too many Canadian farmers this year.  We 
moved forward and fast tracked the process of review of Canada's 
safety net system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have taken a pragmatic approach and will continue with a 
strategic approach to fiscal challenges across the country.  As a 
result, Canada's economic fundamentals are sound and should we 
not all be thankful.  As Canadians we are better able to address 
the worldwide financial situation than most other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian farmers have made a big contribution to that.  They 
have made a big contribution in putting the federal books back in 
the black.  That was the first step we had to take.  We have 
recognized that as a result of the contributions from farmers and 
all Canadians we are all reaping the benefits of lower interest 
rates and low inflation.  That certainly has an effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all aware that global markets are going through a period 
of incredible turmoil.  This has affected the income of farmers. 
We plan to continue on the course we have charted for the future. 
We will continue to target our resources, to reduce taxes as we 
have in the past, to pay down public debt, to invest in the 
knowledge of our people and to safeguard and improve our health 
care system.  All of these, including addressing the unfortunate 
situation of many Canadian farmers today, have to be our 
priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that farm producers are dealing with the 
fallout from fluctuations in foreign markets.  For example, in 
Asia and Russia less buying power translates into much lower 
sales of our food exports.   It is higher with grain and lower 
with dairy products, but I remind the House and everybody 
watching that on average 48% or 49% of the farm gate income comes 
to Canada and those producers.  We are in the export business. We 
have a tremendous ability to produce.  We have to export the 
products or drastically cut our production, eat the products here 
at home and hope that nobody wants to compete with supplying that 
market.  That is not the way to go.  We have to work with the 
industry, and we do, to find the markets where the products can 
be sold at a profitable level or at the best price attainable at 
that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, many prices are set by the world. All that is 
happening in the world translates into lower sales of food 
exports.  It is affecting the income of many of our farmers. 
Combined with this is the reality of a cyclical downturn in 
prices for some commodities which always happens in agriculture. 
There are pockets of poor production in a country this size. 
There are not going to be top yields in every hectare or portion 
of the country every year.  It means some farmers will have 
significant reductions in their income this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stress that this situation is not universal.  Not all regions 
or sectors are affected to the same degree.  At the national 
level, recent numbers indicate that without question farmers will 
see a decrease in their income compared to the average over the 
last five years.  I stress that is not the same in all regions 
and all sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular the situation in Manitoba and Saskatchewan is 
severe because of the low prices for hogs, cattle and grains. 
We are all concerned about what lies ahead next year for these 
producers.  Nobody is more concerned than I am.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said a number of times that I have asked all the farm 
leaders to come to Ottawa tomorrow.  I am pleased that all the 
provincial ministers of agriculture will be here to discuss the 
nature and extent of the difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our forecast was done in conjunction with all the provinces. 
When the final, most accurate numbers do become available, which 
are numbers that have been put together with the co-operation and 
agreement of the provinces, I will remind members that some of 
the numbers they have been stating in the last half hour in this 
House are incorrect.  I hope they will look at those numbers when 
they become available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not diminishing that there are some very severe areas. 
These forecasts will indicate what the market price picture is in 
affected areas.  We have to also be aware that it may worsen in 
1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the bad news.  The other news is that because of the 
unfortunate reality that many farmers, including myself, went 
through in the 1980s, farmers are better prepared.  They are not 
necessarily totally and fully prepared.  That does not always 
happen as much as it should or as we would like to see, but they 
are better prepared for this cyclical downturn we are in at the 
present time.  They have had a number of years of pretty good 
prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers are very smart business people and many of them have 
been able to put their money to good use.  They have looked at 
their balance sheets, have seized new ways of doing business, 
have learned to manage their operations better, have worked hard 
to get their costs down, have increased their productivity and 
have invested in new technology when the money was available so 
they could be prepared for the reality that is in agriculture. I 
hate that reality but it is there.  I farmed for 25 years. Some 
years were better than others.  Some commodities were better than 
others in some of those years but it goes up and down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farmers have taken advantage of this.  They have used a lot 
of tools that the provincial and federal governments have helped 
them to put in place. They have diversified their operations and 
have been paying closer attention to market signals.  They have 
been making decisions on growing what they know they can market 
and not trying to market what they like to grow.  We know that 
and they know that.  They have to look at the market and use 
their crystal ball the best they can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to underestimate or not give enough credit to 
farmers.  They deserve a pile of credit for the tough decisions 
they have made over the last decade.  They have used their wisdom 
and most important their foresight after the disaster of 1980s. 
In doing so, on average the net farm worth in Canada is 
significantly higher than it was.  Assets have reached historical 
highs and debt to equity ratio has been declining since 1991. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many small farmers have sources of income outside the operation 
of their farm.  This certainly helps.  People will say that 
should not have to happen and I agree with them fully.  However, 
I say to opposition members everywhere that it does not matter 
what business one goes into today, because of the overhead in 
starting up a business or however the finances are, many people 
need to address having other sources of income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, I farmed for 25 years.  My wife taught school for a 
few of those years.  My wife worked off the farm for a number of 
those years.  One thing farmers know, is that it is a risky 
business.  It is a business that is always at the mercy of global 
markets and mother nature.  Unfortunately, that is not going to 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has changed is the way we deal with that.  We have a number 
of tools in place.  We are reviewing how they are being used and 
how they can be used.  Each year the federal government has put 
$600 million into the safety net package.  The provincial 
governments have put in another $400 million.  We have crop 
insurance, companion programs and the NISA. As has been said, our 
safety net advisory committee is looking at how we use those and 
how we can maybe put in place a national disaster program in 
order to assist those farmers who need it right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a lot of talk about this issue.  I will leave no 
stone unturned as we go forward. 
I look forward to the contribution of members across the way. I 
know collectively we can turn every stone possible in order to 
assist those farmers who are suffering at the present time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have just one question for the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the minister's remarks there was not one single reference to 
tax relief as a possible tool for dealing with this problem.  I 
wonder why that is.  The government has a surplus, so at least 
tax relief is a live option; it is not something that is 
academic. The federal government is one of the greatest imposers 
of taxes on agriculture that there is, so it is not as if it is 
not in the taxation game. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NISA program is a net income dependent program.  If the 
minister would calculate what the amount of the NISA might have 
been if there had been five years of tax relief prior to this 
particular period, surely he would see that that program would be 
stronger than it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the minister not, for the sake of his producers, become 
an advocate of tax relief as at least one of the measures that 
would have helped this situation and still could help? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I remind the Leader of 
the Opposition to go back and read <I>Hansard</I> because I 
specifically stated that we are continuing to target resources, 
reducing taxes, paying down public debt and investing in the 
knowledge of people and safeguarding and improving our health 
care system.  If I am not mistaken, a number of those are goals 
of the official opposition as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With reference to the NISA, when there is a safety net put in 
place there is always the challenge of distribution.  Some 
producers made a business decision not to take part in the NISA. 
Some people said it was a decision that they could not take part 
in the NISA as beginning farmers or whatever their reasons might 
have happened to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the size of the NISA in Canada, its value, the 
total amount of money available. I have repeatedly said that we 
are looking at how we can do other things, use other resources, 
how our producers can use all of the tools presently available in 
the toolbox. Let us compare the value of the NISA to the United 
States industry which is between eight and nine times the size of 
ours. Eight to nine times $2.5 billion would mean that our NISA 
funds are equivalent to over $20 billion relative to the United 
States.  That is a considerable sum of money. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as an 
aside, I am very appreciative, as I think all members of the 
House would be, to see the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food 
here for this very important debate.  I know we are sometimes out 
of order when we try to say who is not in the House, but I think 
we are probably in order when we recognize that people do take 
the time to come and listen to the debate.  I want to say very 
sincerely that I appreciate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened attentively to the minister and I noted that he did 
not make any reference to cost recovery.  We have seen that rise 
dramatically in recent years.  I think Canadian farmers are 
paying something in the order of $134 million per year in cost 
recovery.  This apparently is a decision to reduce the debt and 
deficit situation.  It is not a countervail against the WTO or 
GATT.  I would like the minister to comment on that and see 
whether we could do something to bring some of those costs down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, I am 
pleased to be here.  There is a cabinet meeting going on at the 
present time and I will not be able to stay for all of the 
morning or all of the day, but I can assure hon. members that I 
will be following today's debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a freeze on cost recovery.  That commitment was 
made by my predecessor and by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency 
and the department.  The approach to cost recovery in the future 
is another one of those stones that we are not going to leave 
unturned.  We are looking at that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1100"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why it is so important that we take a look at absolutely 
everything.  We have these tools.  We have to ask:  What can we 
do here and what can we do there?  If we could do something more, 
how would we do it?  How would we fund it?  Are we prepared to 
shift resources from here to there in order to do it at the 
present time?  What are the repercussions of doing that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that whatever we do we have to do it in a 
different way than the United States.  The $6 billion put into 
agriculture last week by the United States goes to producers 
whether they individually need the support or not.  There will be 
large producers in the United States who do not need support who 
will get millions of dollars.  That support is not targeted to 
the producers who need it.  I think members opposite will agree 
with me that whatever we do in our safety net system, the system 
must target those who need it.  It must not be a system in which 
we simply throw out money on an ad hoc basis, as some people 
think we should do.  That will not do the job.  We should invest 
that money as it should be invested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I appreciate the fact that the minister of agriculture is 
here and there are a couple of things which should be clarified. 
I would ask for the consent of the House to extend the time by a 
couple of minutes so that I might ask the minister a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the House give its consent to 
extend the time for questions and comments to the minister for 
five minutes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to express my appreciation to the minister for 
taking a few more questions.  I realize he has a meeting to go 
to, so I thank him very much for his time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four items were raised in the minister's speech which I would 
like him to clarify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, he said that our economic fundamentals are sound, that 
they are in good order.  Would he not admit that our debt load is 
twice that of the Americans, our nearest competitors, and that 
because of that we have a much higher tax burden which puts our 
farmers at a distinct disadvantage?  As the minister knows, I 
quoted some figures in my speech that show our farmers are 
experiencing a much higher tax burden than American farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said that it is a business decision not to 
participate in NISA.  It has not been a business decision by 
farmers not to participate in NISA.  It is because they cannot. 
Farm incomes have been so low that they have been unable to 
contribute.  Those farmers who are being hurt the most have been 
unable to put funds away in NISA so the government could match 
those funds and they could withdraw them at this point.  There 
are farmers who are well off and there are certain sectors which 
have not been touched or hurt by this crisis, but others are 
unable to contribute.  Would the minister not agree this is the 
case? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It almost shocks me that the minister would say that farmers 
need other sources of income if they want to continue farming. 
Is the minister saying that farmers should not expect to make 
their living from agriculture?  That is a serious matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My final question is:  Did the minister's bureaucrats not see 
this coming? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if the member wants to 
take five minutes to ask his questions, I need equivalent time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the debt load, this government has been very 
clear.  We agree that personal income taxes in Canada are too 
high.  We have taken steps to address that.  Last year 400,000 
Canadians were taken off the tax rolls.  I could go on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as NISA is concerned, I made it very clear that it is a 
business decision or an economic decision.  For whatever reason, 
some people made that decision.  Eighty-five per cent of 
participants with eligible production are covered.  Well over 85% 
of producers in Saskatchewan are enrolled in NISA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, I do not like to see farmers searching for 
other sources of income.  I do not like to see somebody starting 
up a manufacturing business in the industrial park in Belleville 
who has to ask one of his family members to provide another 
source of income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will bring it closer to home.  My son bought the farm from my 
wife and I.  He is farming 800 acres.  He is heavily in debt.  He 
made a personal decision to burn the candle at both ends.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not like to see that happen, but he is working off the farm 
full time.  I asked him why he is doing it and he told me he 
wants to pay his debt and mortgage down sooner.  He said that if 
he did that for a while he would be in a better position to be 
able to be on the farm full time.  That is decision.  He made 
that for his own personal reasons.  I do not like to see it 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like everybody who wants to farm, be a doctor, run a 
garage or start up a small manufacturing business to be able to 
do it.  I would like to see them all succeed.  Unfortunately that 
is not reality.  There is competition out there.  There are 
expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, there is a big debt, but we are now paying down the debt. 
We reduced the deficit from $42 billion to zero much faster than 
Canadians thought it could be done.  We now have very low 
inflation.  Our interest rates have been below those in the 
United States for a number of years.  Nobody in the world denies 
that the economic fundamentals in Canada are the best they have 
been in many, many decades. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the minister mentioned NISA many times and said that we hang our 
hat on the NISA program.  The minister also mentioned that there 
is $2.5 billion in NISA.  Would the minister agree that it is an 
accumulated amount which is sitting in accounts and that, in 
fact, NISA contributions are not made specifically by the federal 
government?  There is a contribution from the producers, from the 
provinces and from this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we compare the $2.5 billion in Canada to the $20 billion in 
the United States, that is an unfair comparison.  In fact, the 
Americans right now are acknowledging that they will put $6 
billion into support programs and an immediate $2.9 billion will 
be in cash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the minister please correct the impression that in fact 
the $2.5 billion came from the federal government and that it is 
enough to combat the $6 billion in the U.S.? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if we put the forward 
thinking of the producers, the provincial and federal governments 
into the perspective of any good group of people in business, 
they plan for a time down the road that might not be as good or 
might not be as bad as today.  That is forward thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the industry, the provincial governments, my 
colleagues on this side of the House, and those who sat before us 
on this side of the House for putting in place a system to 
prepare the industry for those future times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, it is a joint contribution, in comparison to the United 
States, but it is very significant.  I said very clearly that it 
is not the be all and the end all.  It is one of a number of 
tools that we have which we will continue to address and adjust 
in co-operation and in partnership with producers and the 
provincial governments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Bloc 
Quebecois supports the motion of the member for Yorkton—Melville. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agricultural sector in general is experiencing a major 
crisis and much of the blame for this lies with the federal 
government, which is providing the sector with increasingly less 
financial support.  In addition, the federal government's 
inaction in this period of budget surplus does not help resolve 
the problems facing farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the situation in the agricultural sector right now? 
There are crises that cannot be ignored.  Let us look first at 
the Asian crisis, whose effects are being felt worldwide. 
Demand for all farm products is down, and grain and meat prices, 
including and primarily that of pork, are down.  World demand 
for wheat and pork has just about evaporated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This drop in demand means that farmers can no longer sell their 
products and accordingly find themselves more often than not in 
an income loss situation.

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Income for the first half of 1998 was down by over 5% compared 
to the first half of 1997, which means a drop of some 7% in 
crops and 4% in livestock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The figures obtained by the Canadian Federation of Agriculture 
indicate that net farm incomes could drop by as much as 40% this 
year.  The Asian crisis is not an isolated event.  Canada's 
exports of farm products for the country as a whole increased by 
over 65%.  They reached a record level of $22.3 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agriculture and agri-food sector alone will account for 
nearly a third of Canada's trade balance in 1997. 
But a downside of this success is the increased dependency of 
Canadian producers on international markets to earn a living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, we have been witnessing the federal 
government's withdrawal from agriculture. Since it took office, 
the Liberal government repeatedly cut funding and services to 
farm producers in Quebec, while making them foot a larger part 
of the bill for whatever services are still being delivered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, Quebec producers have less and less money to 
operate. Government support has dropped by more than 60%, from 
$2.8 billion in 1993 to approximately $1 billion in 1997, in 
spite of the fact that, under international rules, $4 billion 
could be made available to further support the agricultural 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cost recovery fees have been imposed on no less than 42 
industries over a three-year period according to Agriculture 
Canada's estimates. And what about privatization efforts, where, 
once again, the farming community, the producers have to pay for 
services they are entitled to and used to get for free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its 1996 budget, the federal government announced the 
elimination of all dairy subsidies. For our producers in Quebec, 
this represents a $107 million loss they are still suffering 
from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Crow rate was abandoned in 1995, the government granted 
$3 billion in compensation to western producers, but there are 
no plans to compensate our producers for the loss of the dairy 
subsidy. 
Only $66 million was paid in Quebec in adjustment measures after 
the Crow rate was abolished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, there is a double standard in which Quebec is the 
big loser. In this respect, I could give you an example I have 
often used in this House: the scrapie crisis in Quebec. Not only 
have 11,000 sheep been put down—on the basis of a mere 38 
screening tests, which raises serious questions—but active 
measures to support this industry have yet to be put in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the government mentioned a few measures to increase 
maximum compensation to $600 per animal, but this is not enough. 
The whole industry must get back on its feet, and all these 
measures must be retroactive, because the people most affected 
are those who got involved and who tried to solve this problem 
from the very beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the government obsessed with the idea of complying with the 
new WTO rules? Is this why it stopped helping farmers over four 
years ago and why it gutted out these various farm support 
programs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that while the American government reduced its 
global support for agriculture by 23% over a seven-year period, 
the Canadian government cut its support by 21% over three years. 
What do our farmers have to gain by complying with the WTO rules 
before their main competitors who, incidentally, often enjoy a 
better climate than we do?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation in the farming industry is such that it is now 
essential to reinvest in basic support structures to secure long 
term sustainability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile, what are the Americans doing? They are supporting 
farmers. According to the figures released by the American Farm 
Bureau, subsidies in 1998 will total $15.2 billion in the United 
States. This unfair competition raises legitimate concerns among 
farmers in Canada and elsewhere. While the federal government is 
abandoning our farmers, the U.S. government is helping their 
American counterparts to keep their heads above water. Faced 
with this unfair competition, what should our farmers do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are there solutions?  I think there are.  The first one is very 
simple.  The government must wake up to the seriousness of the 
situation farmers are facing.  Second, the government must sit 
down with the industry and its representatives to discuss better 
ways of at least alleviating the effects of the present crisis 
and, finally, other measures will also have to be taken, which 
will undoubtedly mean that the federal government will have to 
increase funding to the farming sector.  We cannot stay 
competitive if we are at a disadvantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying a few words about the situation in 
Quebec.  Obviously, this issue brings home to me all the more 
clearly the need for the people of Quebec to attain sovereignty 
because, in continuing to pull out of the farming sector, the 
federal government has not acted in the interests of Quebec 
farmers, as I have shown with respect to the sheep and dairy 
industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Quebec government that was master of its own destiny would 
have worked exclusively in the interests of Quebec farmers. 
That is what we did in the case of hogs.  We sorted out the 
situation ourselves, as we are doing with our crop insurance, 
farm income stabilization insurance and CNRS programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members often do not understand that these companion programs 
are applied differently in Quebec than in the rest of Canada. 
The reason for that is that my country, Quebec, takes an 
interest in farmers. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate the member for her speech.  There are a few 
things I think should be clarified when it comes to the 
scrapie situation.  The standing committee had extensive 
hearings on scrapie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister and the department had very close productive 
discussions with sheep producers in Quebec on the situation they 
had and the situation with scrapie as far as improvements made to 
the program being very substantial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to that, I think something we always forget is that 
the federal government has transferred $200 million to the 
province of Quebec which chose to spend that money in a different 
way.  Rather than have it for disaster relief, Quebec chose to 
spend it on price support. When there was nothing to sell because 
of the disease, the producers were not getting anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to put some blame on the producers themselves and on the 
provincial government, which chose to spend the transfers from 
the federal government in a different way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that had been spent differently or if the provincial 
government now decides to maybe reconsider how to dispense with 
the transfers, not just in sheep but in hogs and in other 
livestock, we could have a better program, a NISA type program 
for the province of Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond to my 
kind colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have indeed had great co-operation from the Standing Committee 
on Agriculture and Agri-Food in connection with scrapie, but 
there are two things I need to point out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we cannot accept the lack of retroactivity for those 
sheep farmers who were the first to subscribe to the wholly 
federal program of a wholly federal agency, and who in so doing 
had the honesty and courage to, perhaps, save the Canadian sheep 
industry.  We expect them to get the same compensation as others 
who will come along in future.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question raised by my colleague—and I am glad he 
raised it because that was what I was saying at the end of my 
speech—is that, unlike the other provinces, Quebec does not have 
the same measures for its farm safety-net programs, its companion 
programs, and does not apply them in the same way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is so much the case that a departmental employee—Mr. 
Richardson, if I remember correctly—told the committee that, 
even if Quebec wanted to take the famous $200 million—and 
Minister Julien wrote to the Minister of Agriculture to this 
effect—this would be impossible because the rules established 
with the federal government are different for Quebec than for 
elsewhere in Canada.

<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
colleague talked about a compensation package offered sheep 
producers who have problems with scrapie.  It seems she suggested 
that the $600 a head offered in compensation to those sheep 
producers is not adequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a cattle producer I know that when someone slaughters a cow 
toward the end of her useful life they may not get much more than 
$600 for her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was wondering if the member could explain what she thought 
would be reasonable compensation for victims of the scrapie 
outbreak. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Alarie:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was probably misunderstood. 
The $600 figure was discussed and accepted by industry.  We are 
very much in agreement on this amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our major problem is that the 10% production loss in Quebec will 
never be properly compensated for because the measure is not 
retroactive.  If the agency cannot allow retroactivity, the 
minister can create retroactive compensation through an ad hoc 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to state before this House that Quebec is currently the 
hardest hit province.  Our sheep came from all over Canada and 
were sold all over Canada.  What is happening to us today I 
would not wish on any other province.  No one is exempt from 
this, however, because there is a very strong genetic link where 
this disease is concerned.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too am 
very pleased to take part in this important debate today on the 
crisis in farm income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was looking through notes yesterday and we first started to 
raise these questions in February of this year, continued on 
through the spring and we certainly have focused on since 
parliament has come back on this very important crisis in rural 
Canada in general, in western Canada in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As colleagues have mentioned, net farm income declined by 
some 84% in my province of Saskatchewan in 1997 and it looks like 
it is going to fall by another 40% this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, 
attempted to have an emergency debate on the crisis in farm 
income on October 5. That was not successful.  My colleague, the 
member for Regina—Qu'Appelle, and I held a news conference in 
Regina on October 16.  We invited some farmers who were 
particularly hurting from this crisis.  Lloyd Pletz who farms 
north of Bell Prairies was one of those individuals.  He told the 
assembled media that day “I'm finished.  I have no way to hang 
on”.  Donnett Elder, who was also attending, has worked in the 
farm stress area answering phones for the past 10 years and she 
reports that it has never been worse out there with the phone 
ringing off the hook from farmers who are terribly concerned 
about the situation.  She is looking at a $40,000 shortfall in 
1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mention people like Lloyd Pletz and Donnett Elder because we 
are attempting to put a face on a very serious and growing 
crisis.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the word crisis is a frequently overused word but it is a 
word that certainly applies in this instance.  The Canadian 
Federation of Agriculture has noted that net farm income will 
decline by 40% overall and we are even looking at worse numbers 
on the prairies.  It is incredible when one adds in the 84% loss 
in Saskatchewan and then add to that 40% to 45% this year.  For 
farmers in Alberta it is 35% and in Manitoba it is 40%. Hog 
farmers virtually from coast to coast are looking at losses of 
$40 per animal when they get them to market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This crisis is largely as a result of economic and trade 
conditions over the last couple of years.  The economic meltdown 
in southeast Asia has been a large part of it.  However, other 
countries have the same problems, not just Canada. Farmers in 
European countries and in the United States would face similar 
problems but their governments have taken steps to cushion the 
blow and reduce the impact on farmers in those communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada we are left with the situation where so far the 
minister of agriculture agrees that there is a crisis but nobody 
is yet prepared to do anything about it.  It reminds me of the 
old tea ad “only in Canada, you say”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. administration is kicking in $2.857 billion under 
market loss payments.  It begins today to help offset heavy 
losses resulting from historic low commodity prices, the very 
same problems many Canadian farmers are facing. European farmers 
are receiving a subsidy for wheat of up to $205 Canadian a tonne, 
well above the current projected world price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been told by our senior international trade negotiator 
that in the United States the subsidy support for wheat farmers 
is some five times higher for American wheat than what is 
available to their Canadian counterpart.  The bottom line is that 
Canadian farmers simply cannot compete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian farmers are as good as any in the world.  We hope we 
have a goal in to double our agricultural exports by 2005 but 
there is no way Canadian farmers can do that without some help 
soon from their governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked yesterday in the House when help was going to be 
forthcoming to ensure that farmers were planning to plant a 
spring crop in 1999 rather than planning for an auction sale in 
the same year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States is pumping up farm subsidies which are not 
countervails by the WTO or the GATT.  Europeans are pumping up, 
as I noted a minute ago.  Here at home help for our farmers has 
been slashed significantly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 when the WTO was negotiated, Canada agreed to reduce its 
subsidies on agriculture by about a billion dollars over five 
years.  In other words, we are going from $5 billion to $4 
billion over the course of five years.  In the usual boy scout 
way that Canada often operates, we have done much better than 
that.  We have slashed some 60% of farm subsidies.  We have gone 
from $5 billion to perhaps $2 billion and some people insist that 
it is probably less than $1 billion in subsidies at the moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We look good on the international stage but our farmers are 
really in dire straits.  They have paid more than their fair 
share on the war on the deficit.  It is time for a reinvestment 
in agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Saskatchewan net farm income is forecast for this year to be 
$320 million less than it was last year. 
Just in passing, that is almost exactly what Saskatchewan farmers 
used to receive from the Crow benefit.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect of this argument is that Canada has been assisted 
greatly by Canadian farmers in balancing the books because of our 
agricultural exports.  If there is not some action taken quickly 
I am very concerned there is a great danger we will end up 
killing the goose that laid the golden egg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister continually relies on the net income stabilization 
account and crop insurance.  He says that they are very good 
programs.  For the sake of argument I will not disagree with that 
except to say that they are not answers to the problems we are 
facing now.  NISA and crop insurance were not designed to look 
after low commodity prices or the ice storm of last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point the minister makes constant reference to is that 
most farmers in NISA—and we heard him say that again this 
morning—on average have some $18,000 in their accounts.  I saw 
some numbers recently in terms of NISA which I would like to 
share with the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers earning between $10,000 and $75,000 per year gross 
income on their operations account for some 62% of all farmers. 
The average amount in their NISA accounts is not $18,000 a year. 
It is not $12,000.  It is not even $6,000.  The average in the 
NISA accounts of the smaller farmer is $5,925 per year.  It is 
scarcely worth talking about.  It certainly is not a program that 
can be relied upon to assist farmers in the emergency they find 
themselves in now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My time is just about up.  We are seeing farm costs increasing 
sharply.  There has been a 21% increase in machinery over the 
last five years.  Fertilizer is up 57% and chemicals, 63%.  I 
asked the minister what he was doing about cost recovery, about 
the $138 million more that Canadian farmers are paying for things 
that are not counter to GATT or the WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in this corner of the House are very concerned that the 
Liberals are continuing to dismantle rural Canada.  The rail 
system, the transportation system, is in sad shape.  The costs 
are three times higher for shipping grain to the coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking for help for the farm sector.  We feel that the 
minister could redeem himself and his government by announcing 
today that he is prepared to help out farmers with long term 
disaster relief. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have a question for the hon. member for Palliser.  He talked 
about the NISA program and how the minister of agriculture 
basically held it up as being the be-all and end-all of the farm 
crisis.  Today we heard the Leader of the Opposition suggest that 
support mechanisms should not be put in place but that it should 
be long term tax breaks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member for Palliser give me some indication as to what 
his party would actually like to see with respect to farm support 
programs?  Does he have any idea how they should be delivered to 
agriculturalists or producers that will have some difficulty 
putting crops in this coming spring season? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we certainly do not have a 
problem with some long term tax breaks for farmers.  Our concern 
is that we have to do something immediately because it will take 
some time.  This is a crisis situation that demands an immediate 
response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to support Canadian farmers as the Europeans are 
supporting their farmers and as the Americans are supporting U.S. 
farmers, or we will see such an exodus from the land that it will 
scarcely be believed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question we are witnessing the end of the family 
farm.  We are moving to agribusiness and corporate farms. 
Perhaps a few new generation co-ops will be sprinkled in, but by 
and large we are seeing a real revolution in agriculture which 
will be hastened without help from the government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the NDP member describe how we need relief 
and how we need it immediately.  I agree.  It is a desperate 
situation and we have to do something right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The devil is in the details.  How would members propose to 
deliver this relief?  How would they make sure that it gets to 
whom it belongs? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is no question that 
the government could very quickly ascertain who requires relief. 
I notice the U.S. secretary of agriculture is saying that the 
$2.857 billion support program coming into effect today will go 
exclusively to farmers who need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I disagree with the minister of agriculture when he says it will 
end up that millions of dollars will go to big farmers who 
basically do not need it.  The Americans know which farmers 
require help and which farmers qualify.  I am sure the Canadian 
department of agriculture can devise ways to ensure it goes 
without any great difficulty to the folks who really need it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
certainly over the last days, weeks and months there has been a 
call from throughout Saskatchewan and western Canada for some 
type of farm support program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Palliser, by the way, has become the member 
of parliament for a large part of my old riding of Moose 
Jaw—Lake Centre.  How much does he think needs to be put on the 
table as part of a farm support program?  What percentage would 
need to go to Saskatchewan or any other particular area, given 
the fact that the numbers we have heard this morning certainly 
vary from area to area?  Some areas are in much worse conditions. 
Obviously Saskatchewan is one of those areas that is in very dire 
straits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. 
I think we are talking in the hundreds of millions of dollars, 
somewhat under $1 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of what would go to Saskatchewan and Manitoba, which 
everyone recognizes are the two provinces under the most stress 
at the moment, I would not be able to hazard a guess.  I would 
assume they would take a significant portion of that money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member for Regina—Qu'Appelle and I met with the 
media a few weeks ago, we talked about somewhere between $500 
million to $700 million to deal with the situation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK48"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
issue on the floor of the House of Commons today is a very 
important one.  It is more so important perhaps to my 
constituents and me than to a lot of other members on either the 
government side or the opposition benches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will clarify that by simply saying that coming from 
Brandon—Souris the economic backbone of my constituency is 
without question agriculture.  Both from a direct and indirect 
standpoint the total economy developed in my community is based 
on agriculture.  Therefore I feel very comfortable and very 
privileged to speak in the House, hopefully with some ability to 
convince the government the situation we are facing right now is 
one of crisis.  That word has been used substantially today. I 
cannot help but use it again to identify the total crisis in the 
farm economy today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the Reform Party, once and probably the 
last time in my illustrious political career, for putting the 
motion on the floor today so that we have an opportunity to 
debate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  I do not think those members should 
get on their high horse just yet because there is a but here. 
I find it ironic that a party which obviously comes from the 
grassroots of Alberta, Saskatchewan and British Columbia would 
not make it a votable motion so that the government's feet would 
be held to the fire.  Then government members would have to stand 
and indicate which way they voted on the motion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Leader of the Opposition mentioned, the motion speaks 
more to long term tax relief.  As was mentioned earlier, I do not 
think there is as member on this side of the House, and perhaps 
on that side of the House, who does not agree with long term tax 
relief.  However long term tax relief does not solve the problem 
we face today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being that I come from the wheat city I get an awful lot of 
people coming through my constituency office.  I can honestly 
say—and I am pleased to say it—that many of the people who are 
coming through my door now perhaps would not have come through my 
door a year or two years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are farmer producers who have suffered in silence 
throughout the decade or the numbers of years of downturn in the 
farm economy.  Quite frankly there is no more suffering in 
silence.  They are coming through the door and saying “Rick, 
this is not good for agriculture”.  They are saying that if 
something is not done within the next three to six months they 
will not be able to put in a crop this spring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are saying that they have suffered in silence and have done 
all they possibly could.  They have taken the equity out of their 
land.  They have taken the equity out of their farms.  Their 
operating lines are to the maximum right now.  Unfortunately 
there is no more help on the horizon.  If they try to go to their 
suppliers or if they try to go to the banks to get more money to 
put in their crops, they will be told to sell their land, that 
there is no hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we as Canadians want to get farmer producers off their land, 
we are heading in the right direction.  My party and I say that 
help should be put in place today.  We should not look five or 
ten years down the road when we can in fact bring in tax reforms 
and give them some relief from their taxes.  The producers I talk 
to do not pay taxes because they have no income. They are not 
generating income and therefore are not paying taxes.  Tax relief 
will not help them.  They need support programs to offset the 
American and EU support programs that are in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give some examples of what is happening out there.  It is 
not simply the producers who will be affected.  It is the 
community that producers support on a regular basis.  I am 
talking about the industries that will be affected such as bulk 
fuel dealers, implement dealers, grocery stores and people who 
sell goods and services to farm producers.  The economy goes 
around.  If there is no income in the farm economy there is no 
income in the communities.  When those industries stand up and do 
not suffer in silence the government may well get the message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give some examples of what is happening in the farm 
economy.  I have received a number of letters, but I pulled this 
one from a farm wife.  She sent me a copy of the grain receipt 
statements she received when her husband delivered his wheat 
quota for this spring.  They sent in $19,677 worth of grain or 
almost $20,000 worth.  The deductions for elevation, 
transportation and cleaning were $6,281.  They received 
approximately $12,000 from $19,000 or $20,000 worth of grain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would be fine if that $19,000 worth or grain could have 
been $40,000 or a reasonable amount to compensate them for 
putting the crop in the ground.  It is not.  It is $20,000 and a 
third of it goes to other uncontrollable costs.  The $12,000 they 
received is not sufficient to be able to break even with their 
inputs and what it cost them to produce the commodity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another gentleman walked into my office and gave me a complete 
financial statement of what it cost him to put in 160 acres of 
crop and his return. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1145"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are producers who are good managers.  These are producers 
who have done everything right.  The problem they found is that 
they cannot sell the commodity for what it is worth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An individual producer walked in, showed me his financials and 
said for every quarter section of land that he puts in right now, 
he is losing $115.  That does not include the debt servicing of 
the land.  That is strictly the input cost and the revenue that 
is coming off the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would anybody here stay in business and produce a commodity that 
will be less than what it costs to grow or produce? The answer is 
that it cannot be done very often unless the equity comes out of 
the land.  That is what they are doing right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When our government was in power we supported agriculture. 
Currently we have the ability under our trade agreements to have 
support programs in place that would equal $3 billion to $4 
billion annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently that contribution is less than $1 billion, so there is 
room within the trade negotiations that we have already entered 
into but the government in its wisdom has decided that the 
agricultural producer is to take a great deal of the burden when 
dealing with the deficit that it so gladly says it has brought 
under control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give an understanding regarding what we did for 
agricultural producers.  We have a record of stating quite 
emphatically that we will support agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1984 and 1985 support for our farmers was greater than 
ever before.  Crop and income insurance totalled $21.7 billion. 
The PC government eased the burden of borrowing from the Farm 
Credit Corporation by setting up new programs like low interest 
refinancing of loans with the size of payments tied to price of 
products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers were also helped by a one time interest rate cut for 
those locked into long term loans with high rates.  Farm debt 
review boards were set up to help farmers in financial trouble 
make arrangements with their creditors.  A special fund was set 
up to help restructure debts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We eased farm input costs with rebates on gasoline and diesel 
fuel bought for farm use.  We doubled the ceiling for advance 
payments under the Advance Payments for Crops Act.  We changed 
the Farm Improvement Loans Act so that farmers could borrow money 
not only to improve their farms but to diversify and develop new 
marketing ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Grains and oilseeds farmers hurt by the 1988 drought received 
$850 million in emergency help.  In 1985-86 and 1986-87, $146 
million helped farmers through another season with no rain.  A 
$15 million rural water development program was set up in 
1988-89.  I could go on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were there when farmers needed us.  All I am asking is that 
this government be there when producers need it today.  It is 
very difficult to say what has to be said in 10 minutes, so I ask 
for questions and comments.  I would love to have more time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  There is a lot of 
interest in questions and comments.  We will do it very quickly. 
The questions will be one minute and responses will be one 
minute.  I will be on my feet in 60 seconds.  Make sure you have 
framed your question and your response.  That is what you will 
get, not one second more. 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand—Norfolk—Brant, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have not spoken on this issue yet and I hope to do a 
five minute but I do want to ask the hon. member a question. He 
said his party has a record of stating it would support Canadian 
farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should know that in the last election, under the 
famous Tory blue book, the Tories wanted to take $600 million out 
of the ministry of agriculture.  It says: “The first is to merge 
four existing federal departments: Agriculture and Agri-Food, 
Environment, Fisheries and Oceans, and Natural Resources. A Jean 
Charest government will continue to expand the practice of cost 
recovery.  With the trend of these negotiations, a Jean Charest 
government will be moving to reduce and eventually eliminate all 
farm subsidies. Since agricultural subsidy programs will 
inevitably be phased out around the world, there is a distinct 
advantage to Canadian farmers of making this transition as soon 
as possible”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the hon. member how he can—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is nice to see that 
the member can read another platform.  It is too bad that they 
cannot put into place their own platforms right now to support 
agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we did say emphatically is that there would be an 
amalgamation of a number of departments.  The money saved from 
the administrative function of those departments, however, would 
go back to the people who really deserved it, the producers. 
That was the premise of that policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the hon. member's position as to whether 
subsidization should be stopped, times change.  It is unfortunate 
that the government cannot deal with the change in what is going 
on around us right now in the global economy.  Those negotiations 
were in place and subsidies were to be reduced from the EU and 
the U.S.  It is not subsidies— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my question to the member is based on the emergency we 
face today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Net farm income in Saskatchewan fell by 84% in 1997.  It has 
gone down again in 1998.  What we want in our party is an 
emergency aid project or program now for the farmers, some 
emergency aid to the farmers who really need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to know whether we can count on the Progressive 
Conservative Party of Canada to support an emergency aid program 
now.  I know it is in the midst of a leadership race.  I think 
Joe Clark is very understanding of that.  If I were a Tory, by 
the way, I would support Joe Clark, but I am not a Tory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern is that I hear that David Orchard is coming on like 
gangbusters in the Conservative Party.  With David Orchard coming 
on like gangbusters, can the hon. member assure us that if David 
Orchard is the new leader of that party he would take a stand on 
supporting emergency aid?  I know Joe Clark would but I am 
worried about David Orchard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very surprised 
actually because David Orchard espouses the policies of the NDP. 
It is nice to see that the hon. member would support Joe Clark, 
as I have done right from the beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not like to refer to it as emergency aid.  As the minister 
has rightfully said, we do not want ad hoc programs.  We have 
always said in this party that what we need is a crisis program, 
a natural disaster program to deal with crises, the ice storm, 
the Red River flooding, the commodity crisis in the marketplace 
right now.  Yes, we need a program in place to provide the 
necessary financial resources for farmers to put in the spring 
crop.  I cannot say that any more emphatically.  That is what we 
would support and I would be more than happy to put our vote on 
the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>David Orchard, fortunately for our purposes, will not be in our 
party much longer.  I am sure he will be embraced by his previous 
party, the NDP. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am glad the member for Brandon—Souris would like to 
see this motion votable.  He must know that it is a longstanding 
policy of the Reform Party that we want to see all motions 
votable.  I hope his party would support us in that initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said he has farmer members in his constituency who do not pay 
any taxes because their income is not high enough to get them 
into income tax level.  These people must not buy anything 
because everything they buy contains an enormous tax component. 
The taxes paid by everybody else get passed down to them through 
their purchases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did some calculations a few years ago and worked it out that 
50% of a farmer's input costs were taxes paid by other people. 
Would the hon. member please explain? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is very laudable to 
suggest that every motion should be votable, and we agree.  Had 
the Reform Party felt that this was a very serious issue, I am 
sure it could have made it one of its votable supply days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for taxation, I agree with the member that producers pay 
taxes as do every other sector of society in Canadian life.  What 
I said was that the tax relief program put forward by the 
official opposition will not resolve the problem we have today. 
A five or ten year tax regime ultimately is the best thing for 
Canadians. It will not resolve the problem of those producers who 
cannot put a crop in this spring.  That means there has to be 
support programs put into place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Reform Party wants to hang its hat on a five year program 
of tax relief, then unfortunately the people now finding 
themselves in difficulty will not be around in five years to 
support its tax relief program.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The member for Brandon—Souris was interested in more 
time.  We got unanimous consent in questions and comments earlier 
to extend that.  I wonder if we could extend it for a few more 
moments.  Many people would like to address some of the concerns 
he raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent?

<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage—Lisgar, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this is an interesting debate as the debates usually are 
when we talk about agriculture.  It is a very sad day when we get 
up in the House and talk about the problems on farms.  Our 
producers put food on the tables of everybody in Canada and 
supply that same commodity to millions of people around the 
world.  It is not just a tragedy but a crime that they cannot 
maintain a lifestyle where they can put food on their own tables. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell the House of the kinds of subsidies we farmers have 
to put up with.  The European farmer gets $175 an acre to sow his 
crop and grow it.  That is right off the start.  Then he is 
guaranteed that if there is a surplus they will at least pay $2 a 
bushel to the exporter to get rid of the product.  That is what 
Canadian farmers are dealing with. It is disastrous out there in 
farmland today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the World Trade Organization was negotiating, our trade 
negotiators agreed to a 15% reduction in subsidies on farms. That 
is what everybody was supposed to follow.  We reduced subsidies 
by 85%.  We gave them an unlevel playing field that would break 
every single farmer in western Canada.  This put the feed prices 
down to such a level that every farmer who had a buck went into a 
livestock operation.  Governments encouraged that. Today the hog 
industry in Saskatchewan alone is losing $20 million every six 
months.  How long do we think that industry can survive?  It is 
impossible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was astounded when I picked up a paper with a backgrounder 
about what was going on.  The Canadian Wheat Board suddenly 
realized that they are the lowest prices in the last four years. 
Where was this organization in 1995-96 when prices were the 
highest in the world?  Instead of selling our grain the board 
allowed it to back up in our bins.  It had a million bushels of 
wheat left over which was more wheat than it had the previous 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally Mr. Beswick got fed up with this type of marketing and 
quit.  He told western Canadian farmers that in the last year the 
board had lost western barley producers $180 million. That kind 
of marketing system does not work.  The wheat board is there for 
a purpose.  It is supposed to get us the best price, not the 
worst price. That is why farmers are in trouble. Did the Liberals 
know about this?  I think they did.  I think they had a policy in 
1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No matter what happens with commodity prices, the Americans and 
the Europeans are going to look after their farmers.  This is 
what the Americans have done so far.  They just passed a bill 
that will give $3 billion in market losses to farmers in the U.S. 
They have agreed that law makers will give a tax break worth 
around $4 billion for farmers and small businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. gentleman from Brandon—Souris said farmers do not pay 
any taxes.  I paid my property taxes last week.  Grain prices in 
wheat and barley markets have been dropping by 40% to 70% but my 
property taxes have gone up by 9%. 
That is what happened to my input costs. That is what we are 
dealing with.  Not only that, but look at the parts prices. If we 
want to fix a combine, a tractor, a lawnmower, the prices have 
escalated to points where we just cannot afford to operate these 
things any more.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  That is another thing.  My hon. 
colleague remarks that we have to buy them from the U.S. in 
Canadian dollars and we know what they are worth. There is a 
tragedy out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the American government negotiated at the World Trade 
Organization meeting it maintained at that time 24% of its 
subsidies in a green box which is allowable.  Our Canadian 
government only maintained 8%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what is going on in western Canada today.  That is what 
we are dealing with. I do not know what I can say to impress upon 
people how serious it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I came through the crisis in commodity prices in 1969-70 when 
farmers were forced to sell three bushels of barley for $1. 
Seventy cents would buy any amount of wheat to put into a 
feedlot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberal government came to power in 1970 or 1971, 
western farmers asked the Prime Minister who had created a just 
society to please help them sell their wheat.  What happened? He 
gave them the finger.  That is how the Liberal government looks 
after farmers and agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am told here today that the agriculture minister said farmers 
should not be able to farm as an occupation, that they should 
have a job off the farm.  Is this government trying to create an 
industry like the one there was in the Soviet Union?  People 
worked at a full day's job and then grew their food.  Using a 
small spade in their gardens they supplied one-third of all the 
food that was produced in the Soviet Union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to see what can happen to a country where the farmers 
are protected and where farming is not profitable, just go over 
there.  Pay them a visit.  Today, if the American government does 
not give that country free grain, people will starve to death 
because they cannot afford to buy it.  That country owes billions 
of dollars to other countries. That country was number one in 
1981 when I visited there. That country was the mightiest power 
in the world. Because that country did not look after its economy 
in the local market and its farmers, it is now the world's 
biggest basket case. From 1912 to 1917 it was the bread basket of 
Europe.  That country has half of the agricultural land in Europe 
and today it is begging other countries to give it food so people 
will not starve to death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is how serious the situation is in western Canada.  The 
majority of farm families today have one of the partners and in 
many cases both partners out working.  They cannot survive even 
if they get other jobs. That is why this government has to look 
at what these farmers need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals promised in the 1993 election that they were going 
to come in with a whole farm support program that would look 
after us if we had to fight the European subsidies. They have 
reneged on that.  Not only have they reneged on it, but they have 
also done away with the programs we had.  On the NISA program, 
which they brag about, we were just told today in West Block by 
witnesses who were appearing that out of 140,000 NISA accounts, 
42,000 have less than $1,000 in them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young farmers cannot survive today.  If we want the young 
farmers on the unemployment line, they will be there. Very soon 
it will not just be Case or Flexi-Coil that shut down their 
lines of production.  There will be shutdowns in other 
industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to have people stay in their jobs not just in the 
farming industry, it is important that we make the farm viable. 
Today in western Canada 45% of all jobs have some link to 
agriculture.  If that is not maintained, the $7 billion surplus 
in the EI fund will be eaten up and will disappear.

the taxes I pay on my property and I lose anywhere from $30 to 
$50 an acre, that is unfair. That should not be happening.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as 
a point of clarification, when I said the tax relief situation 
was not sufficient to make sure producers were back on the land 
this spring, what I said was that they do not pay enough personal 
income tax or corporate income tax, that any type of tax relief 
would make the difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talks about property taxes.  I am sure he 
recognizes that is not a jurisdiction of the federal government 
but in fact is the jurisdiction of municipal government whom he 
should probably talk to if his property taxes are too high. Any 
tax relief would not relieve him of anything on his municipal 
property taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the Leader of the Opposition say let us negotiate, 
let us get out of the subsidies with the EU and the U.S., let us 
make sure that there is tax relief.  He did not mention the fact 
that there has to be support programs today.  The member said 
that there have to be support programs.  Would the member please 
clarify that the Reform Party is advocating relief and support 
programs right now for this year's agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that 
question from the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out to him that about 60% of my property taxes 
are education taxes.  Part of that comes from the federal 
government in transfer payments so it does affect me on my 
property taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the farm input costs on fuel.  The tax on that is almost 
prohibitive not just to the farmers but to the railways and 
truckers for delivering the product.  That is where we can reduce 
the taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to take away all the hidden taxes I would bet there 
would not be 10% of the costs. On a combine that costs $130,000 I 
am told there is only $13,000 of physical property costs in that. 
The rest is all taxes and labour.  We are paying a lot of tax 
and we are not getting anything in return for it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, what is it the Reform Party would like to see done 
first?  Its motion reads that Canada should defend the interests 
of farmers by challenging the unfair subsidies and unfair trading 
practices of foreign countries, and that failing that it should 
come up with emergency measures to provide tax relief, lower 
input costs, reduce user fees and address the inadequacies of the 
farm safety net programs.  Before the hon. member answers, I 
would like to know which one the party wants first.  I would say 
that if there is no emergency relief right away, it does not 
matter about the first suggestion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do wish to remind the Reform Party as it so eloquently fights 
for farmers on the central Canadian plains, as does the NDP, we 
also have a crisis in farming on the east coast in Nova Scotia, 
particularly in the Annapolis Valley and the Musquodoboit Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to remind the member of the crisis we are facing as 
well.  I would also like him to answer the question I asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 our trade negotiators knew what kind of subsidies we 
were fighting and what had to be done to get a market that would 
be fair and provide a level playing field to farmers in North 
America.  That was not done.  That was neglected. We were 
sympathetic to what had to be done.  Instead of reducing our 
subsidies 15%, we reduced them 85%.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers were willing to do that because they knew what the 
problem was.  As long as there was a market and decent prices, we 
did not complain about losing the extra profit.  Today that has 
to be returned to the farming sector.  The unfairness of the deal 
negotiated by the trade negotiators was not the fault of the 
farmers.  It was the government's fault.  The Liberals are the 
government.  We as the opposition can only point out to them what 
the problem is and what funds are needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does the books and it has to make sure that the 
money is somewhere. I do not think farmers care from where it 
comes, whether it is out of NISA or out of the GRIP program which 
was dissolved in all three prairie provinces.  Farmers have to 
have some support to tide them over until we get a level playing 
field and prices improve.  And they will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1971 the government gave us $6 an acre to summer fallow and 
we had a billion bushels of wheat that we could not sell.  By 
1974 we could not find a kernel of wheat in a granary anywhere 
because the demand was there.  When millions of people are 
starving to death—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask for consent to split my time with the member for 
Dauphin—Swan River.  This is an important issue to many of us 
and he would like a few minutes to voice his opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Lethbridge would like to split his time.  The member would have 
five minutes on debate and two and one-half minutes for questions 
and comments. Is it agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we have talked about a lot 
of issues today but the main thing which was pointed out by the 
member from the NDP is that this is a Canadian issue from coast 
to coast. All farmers are being affected by this. The problems as 
we see them are that we are facing the lowest commodity prices in 
years and farm incomes have dropped right off the table.  There 
are some reasons for this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have border disputes which are mainly due to poor regulations 
and losses at the trade table.  Farmers are not allowed to 
compete fairly with choice in the market.  We are facing unfair 
subsidies by the EU and U.S. governments.  The government has not 
helped, as I mentioned, at the trade tables.  The NISA program is 
not sufficient and was not designed to handle this magnitude of a 
problem across Canada. This government has been unprepared and 
unwilling to come forward and admit that there is a problem. 
There are high freight costs across the country and our 
transportation system is in disarray. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our motion points out some things that the Reform Party proposes 
could be done to rectify the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian farmers are facing some of the toughest times they have 
seen in 30 years.  Farmers are accustomed to having to deal with 
the cyclical patterns of the markets.  However, prices of nearly 
all major farm commodities are down drastically and not just down 
seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers are worried about the border trade disputes, whether 
they will have enough cash to seed next spring, even whether they 
will have enough cash to pay their bills at the end of this year. 
When farmers cannot pay their bills, it has far-reaching effects 
right across our economy. Gross farm income continues to decline 
yet input prices continue to rise.  How are our farmers supposed 
to survive? What is at the root of these problems?  There are 
many things but I will try to elaborate on a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are American and European farmers who seek massive 
subsidies from their governments.  European farmers are having a 
record year.  American farmers are in line for nearly a $6 
billion handout and they will receive tax breaks, something that 
we have been requesting for many, many years.  Give our Canadian 
taxpayers a break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has not offered Canadian farmers any of these 
things.  Canada has been very diligent in cutting off its 
subsidies when it comes to agriculture.  The government has 
repeatedly thrown Canadian farmers to the wolves, all in the name 
of WTO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has not protected our farmers.  Our farmers are 
the ones who put food on the table for every Canadian and they do 
it with a passion.  Canadian farming is not just a business, it 
is a way of life.  It is a way of life that is unique and 
important to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of cutting the Crow rate, producers have had to 
absorb the full cost of freight which is sometimes as high as 33% 
of the cost of production. 
Railway lines have been abandoned.  Producers who 20 years ago 
had to pay for the upgrading of railway lines are now facing the 
prospect of these same lines closing.  The government is so 
short-sighted that it does not realize the implications of this. 
It does not understand that a huge increase in truck traffic will 
require a huge increase in road upkeep.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government collects $2.7 billion in fuel taxes from 
the four western provinces, yet it only returns $35 million. 
These taxes are supposed to be used for road maintenance, but 
most of it disappears into general revenue.  The roads in this 
country will be ground into dust if the government does not 
return the money that has been sucked out of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my area, the intensive livestock area, the fact that the 
infrastructure cannot handle the switch that the farmers have 
made into intensive livestock is the subject of much debate. 
They are paying money every time they start their vehicle through 
fuel taxes, but that money is not being returned to upkeep the 
infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has no comprehensive plan to deal with this 
situation.  NISA is not the answer.  As has been pointed out, 
many of the NISA accounts have $1,000 in them and the average 
account is $18,000.  That does not go very far in paying a 
farmer's bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports our farmers.  It has consistently been 
the voice for the man in the field.  This government has shown 
that time and time again it does not care about farmers.  It has 
been in power for over five years and has done nothing to improve 
the lot of our agriculture community.  This government is in 
control of the next budget.  When will it make agriculture a 
priority? 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the west coast fisheries report came out today and there 
is one statement in it that applies very equitably to agriculture 
and farming in this country.  It says “Our fisheries and marine 
policy on the west coast is a perfect example of how Canada does 
not work, how unaccountable and dysfunctional our system of 
government can be”.  If we get rid of the words “fisheries and 
marine policy” and replace them with “farming and agriculture 
policy” would the member not agree that statement is accurate 
when it comes to farming and agriculture in this country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the basis of the problem is 
receiving fair value for the product produced, whatever that 
product may be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agriculture community is one of the only areas where farmers 
have no influence over their input costs.  They have no influence 
over the taxes they pay and somebody else tells them how much 
they are going to get when they sell their product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking personally, I have a small farm.  I hauled in my crop 
this year and sold it through the board.  It was durum wheat.  I 
had 100 tonnes of crop off a quarter section of dry land and I 
received $7,300 net in my pocket.  It does not matter how many 
quarter sections there are, that is not going to cut it.  That 
does not pay the bills and it does not put food on the table.  It 
does not keep the economy going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could apply that to any industry, whether it be fisheries, 
farming, forestry or our retail sector.  Anybody who is in 
business, and farming is a business, has to receive a fair price 
for the product they are producing.  That is what we are after. 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
first I would like to thank the member for Lethbridge for 
splitting his precious time with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding is Dauphin—Swan River and it certainly is a rural 
riding.  Farming is the backbone of the riding.  There is no 
doubt that the health of all the communities in my riding depends 
on the cash in the pockets of farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a real farm crisis whether the government realizes it 
or not.  It is impacting farmers, and certainly farm families, as 
many of them are going broke and they rely on farming for their 
livelihood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have received a countless number of calls on this issue.  At 
times as a member of parliament I feel very helpless.  All I can 
do is bring the messages to this House and I am very glad to have 
the opportunity to relate those messages to members of this House 
today.  Hopefully the government will listen to the real people 
in the ridings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to put some face to the concerned farmers and 
farming families and tell the House what they have asked me to 
do.  I will begin by saying that the president of KAP, the 
Keystone Agricultural Producers Inc., has talked to me about the 
crisis in farming.  This organization represents many farm 
producers in Manitoba.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those producers are very concerned.  This is not only a crisis 
in Manitoba, it is a crisis in all of western Canada.  In the 
upcoming months KAP will host meetings throughout the province to 
listen to farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lady by the name of Audrey Warkentin from Fork River called 
me.  She is concerned that their family farm is at risk of going 
under.  She is concerned about the prices at this time because 
they cannot meet cash requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>David Hanlin from Miniota in my riding wanted to talk about the 
low prices of grain and the high prices of chemicals and 
machinery.  The price of grain has bottomed out.  He tells me it 
will eventually put him out of business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stan Yaskiw of Birtle, Manitoba, is very concerned about the farm 
economy as it has been impacting his life and his family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bert Stewart of Benito, Manitoba, is concerned about the farming 
economy and low prices.  The cash crunch is impacting on his 
family farm.  He has farmed most of his life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Don Ray from Russell, Manitoba, called about the low grain prices 
and his farm income, which is in jeopardy.  He told me that he 
has 1,500 acres and that it requires $250 an acre to maintain 
equipment and pay for fuel.  He has also experienced a crop loss 
due to flooding, not from a flood like the one in Winnipeg, but 
from too much rain.  Part of my riding received too much rain 
over the past summer.  In his area there were numerous fields 
which were flooded.  There was a 50% loss due to excessive 
moisture.  He wants to know how the government can help him 
survive as a farmer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bert Stewart from Benito has the same concerns.  In fact, 55 
cents per bushel of barley puts him at great risk.  He told me 
that 333 bottles of beer are produced from one bushel of barley. 
He would like to see some of those returns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cam Mateika from Swan River is paying more for freight now and 
he is getting less money for his crops.  He cannot survive.  He 
says that many farmers are talking the same way.  There certainly 
is a crisis out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>David Wilson from Rapid City has a problem surviving.  He says 
that GRIP has been a total disaster as far as he is concerned. 
Farmers were counting on it.  He has also heard many horror 
stories about NISA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Barry Durston, another constituent of mine, is concerned about 
commodity prices, freight rates and NISA.  He is not happy with 
the whole business of NISA and how it has been dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a crisis out there.  People are pleading for help. 
These are real people.  The government needs to be accountable to 
these people.  We help people in crisis situations like the ice 
storm and floods.  This is a time when the government needs to 
help people who farm for a living because their livelihood is at 
stake. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
member for Dauphin—Swan River for his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member comes from a province with the most diversified 
agricultural base in western Canada, and people have done a lot 
in that regard.  They do not rely on one or two crops.  They are 
very diversified these days.  They are even growing a lot of 
potatoes.  They are in competition with my province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has brought up individual situations.  I would like to have 
his comments on the fact that the government has to take into 
consideration the suffering of all farmers and the different 
commodities across Canada.  We cannot take an ad hoc approach and 
simply write a cheque today.  We have to look at the statistics 
and we have to look at individuals on an individual basis to 
ascertain who is most in need and who has been taking advantage 
of the NISA program.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is going to take a little time.  I do not think the hon. 
member wants us to sit down tonight, write a cheque and send it 
to Manitoba.  The government has to get in touch with its 
provincial counterparts, with the producers in those provinces 
and in those commodities and do what is right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know if the member agrees with that way of doing 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of 
the hon. member opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difference here is that farmers in the west are open to the 
global impact of markets and farmers down east do not have that. 
We do not have the protection of marketing boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, we are talking about farmers who diversify.  They grow 
different crops, and not only cash crops, they also have cattle 
and hogs.  But the whole bottom is falling out because of what is 
happening on the international markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The domestic market in eastern Canada is protected by marketing 
boards, but western farmers do not have that protection and 
safeguard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would state at this time, because of the circumstances, that 
the farmers out west do need help.  It is a time of crisis for 
them and their livelihood totally depends on that help. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome—Missisquoi, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of 
all, I would like to inform you that I will be sharing my time 
with one of my colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is indeed worthwhile to take whatever time is 
required to look at the situation of the agricultural industry 
across Canada. Needless to say it is an industry of vital 
importance. The agri-food industry accounts for about 9% of 
Canada's gross domestic product, employs nearly two million 
people and generates almost $91 billion a year in sales on the 
domestic market. It is appropriate to take stock of what is 
going on in the industry and paint a realistic picture of the 
current situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nationally, net farm income is expected to drop from the 1997 
record level, given the prices of major commodities like pork, 
cattle and grains, which undergo cyclical downturns, and the 
fact that some of our best foreign markets have been affected by 
the so-called Asian flu. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, depreciation expenses will grow in 1998 to take 
into account the substantial capital investments made in this 
industry in recent years. It is also to be expected that 
Saskatchewan and Manitoba will be particularly hard hit. 
However, I want to make it clear that this is not a widespread 
situation. Cyclical downturns do not affect all industries the 
same way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, income from dairy, eggs, poultry and horticulture 
will remain stable. Farm cash receipts in a number of industries 
have actually been good these past few years, resulting in 
record revenues in 1997. 
However, it is important to recognize that the difficulties 
experienced in the agricultural industry are part of a much 
larger economic problem. Indeed, no one is immune to the Asian 
flu. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the finance minister indicated in his economic and financial 
update last week, most countries in the world are experiencing a 
recession, and the International Monetary Fund now predicts 2% 
economic growth worldwide this year, instead of the 3.1% growth 
forecast just months ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stock markets around the world have plunged, and commodity 
prices have dropped nearly 30% from the peak reached at the end 
of 1996. In absolute terms, they are now closer to their all-time 
low since the early 1970s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the global economy will recover from this difficult period, 
as it has in the past, and Canada is in a particularly good 
position, because it has put its fiscal house in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the agricultural industry, the price of most of the products 
that we sell has always been determined by world markets. When 
commodity prices go down, farm income does also. Conversely, 
when the global economy is on the upswing and commodity prices 
bounce back, farm income follows the same trend. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1230"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers will tell us that cyclical downturns are unavoidable, 
that they often anticipate them, and that they do their best to 
cope with the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a government, we have done our best to help farmers prepare 
for cyclical downturns and we continue to do so. The Standing 
Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food is currently hearing 
representations from those concerned, so that, together, we can 
find solutions to provide greater security to our farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each year the federal and provincial governments invest $1 
billion in farm income protection programs. 
This money is in addition to the contributions made to the 
various programs by the farmers themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result is that farmers have now accumulated over $2.5 
billion in net income stabilization accounts, which are the 
cornerstone of our national income security program. According 
to preliminary studies conducted by Agriculture and Agri-Food 
Canada, the majority of those contributing to net income 
stabilization accounts have enough money in their accounts to 
meet their needs during the winter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, crop insurance will probably make payments of about 
$430 million this year to help farmers who have suffered a 
shortfall. The government also set up services to help farmers 
who, for one reason or another, could not meet their cashflow 
requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most farmers remain optimistic about the future.  The primary 
production industry is in most cases in a good financial 
position and things look very positive.  In fact, levels of 
investment in the industry continue to increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Long term positive outlooks for the sector are in fact one of 
the reasons for this situation.  The healthy cash flow and 
credit positions of many farm operations is another reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other important factor is the general good health of the 
Canadian economy, characterized by a lack of deficit, low 
interest rates and relatively low inflation.  As the minister 
mentioned, the government has taken a pragmatic and strategic 
approach to the financial challenges.  We have set guidelines. 
We have followed them and will continue to do so in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give members an example.  At one point, as tangible 
support, the Farm Credit Corporation initiated the agristart 
plan. 
The agristart program provides a new range of farm loans to 
ensure the future of farmers expanding their operation and to 
help pass on farm operations from one generation to the next. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three types of loan.  There is the family farm loan, 
which enables the developing farmer to finance the purchase of 
farm assets, or transfer shares in a family farm business.  The 
1-2-3 grow loan permits farmers starting or expanding an 
enterprise to defer payments over three years or longer in order 
to accommodate the drop in their income.  The payday loan is for 
people wanting to start a farm or people with off-farm employment 
wanting to expand their operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is continuing to work closely with farmers and 
the provinces to set up an income protection program that meets 
the sector's current and future needs.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, if we listen to the conversation in the Liberal Party we 
would think there is nothing wrong with our farming communities 
and farm families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the fact is that farmers are in a crisis and need 
help now.  They do not need further consultation with industry 
leaders and Liberal backbenchers or government people.  They need 
emergency assistance now, and not just on the prairies but from 
coast to coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned that some industries and some parts of 
the farming practices were doing well.  I remind him that the 
farmers and agricultural producers of the Annapolis Valley, as 
well as the Hants East area and the Musquodoboit Valley in my 
area, are suffering due to weather droughts and everything else 
that is happening.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the federal government are downloading responsibility 
on to the backs of the provinces.  It is similar to what they did 
in health care.  It is similar to what they did in the fishing 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have a national agricultural policy.  That is one of 
the main reasons we have such a crisis today. If the government 
had paid attention to rural Canadians and their needs, we would 
not be having this discussion today. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Paradis:</B> Mr. Speaker, if my hon. colleague listened 
carefully to what I was saying earlier, he will realize that we 
have many existing programs to serve farmers' immediate needs. 
As for the future, and this is important as well, there are the 
upcoming negotiations with the World Trade Organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the present crisis and farmers' reduced incomes, we all 
listening to communities from all provinces. Their spokespersons 
are appearing before the Standing Committee on Agriculture and 
Agri-Food and together we are trying to find the best solutions 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, we are preparing Canada's position for the 
upcoming negotiations with the WTO. 
An important fact that I did not raise earlier, but one which I 
would like to mention to my hon. colleague, is that the present 
state of the Canadian dollar allows us to increase our exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from Brome—Missisquoi, a riding bordering on Vermont. 
Because the Canadian dollar is weaker than the American dollar, 
farmers in my riding can cross the border, sell more on the 
American side, as well as diversify our farm economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are positive measures that farmers themselves are taking, 
which result in a favourable balance of trade. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to comment on the Reform member's answer to my question that this 
appeared to be a western Canadian issue.  I remind the official 
opposition that there is a beef industry in the rest of Canada. 
There is a hog industry in the rest of Canada.  There is also a 
wheat board in Ontario.  To say this is strictly a disaster for 
western Canada is misplaced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government supports Canada's agriculture and agri-food 
industry in a way that works for industry shareholders and for 
all Canadians.  We have not abandoned our agriculture industry 
and we will not abandon the people who feed our nation and our 
planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada invests $600 million each year in 
safety nets for Canadian farmers.  The provinces add another $400 
million to that total, which means that Canada has one of the 
most stable and reliable farm safety net systems in the world. It 
is not perfect but it has been working, helping farmers to 
achieve stable incomes by banking money in the good years to use 
in the bad years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not minimize the challenges facing some of Canada's 
producers today.  Some are dealing with the fallout from 
fluctuations in foreign markets.  Some are dealing with normal 
cyclical downturns in prices for some major commodities.  Some 
are dealing with poor yields.  That is why the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food has called together farm group leaders 
and provincial ministers of agriculture for a meeting tomorrow in 
Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the past several years governments and producers have worked 
closely together so that today we can manage the challenges 
facing us.  That partnership will continue at the meeting 
tomorrow.  The current situation will be discussed as will the 
tools government and producers have worked to put in place to 
deal with this kind of situation.  There are $2.5 billion in the 
net income stabilization accounts of farmers.  These accounts 
were put in place to help out in situations like the one facing 
farmers today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the net income stabilization account or NISA 
farmers can take advantage of crop insurance which protects them 
against losses from hail, drought or other natural disasters and 
is expected to pay out about $430 million this year.  Farmers can 
also use province specific programs to which the federal 
government contributes $200 million.  That will not stop the 
government from working with farmers and the provinces to explore 
what else can be done for farm income protection programs.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as we began preparing for this situation five years ago, we 
are preparing for the future today.  We have positioned ourselves 
through our safety net programming to meet and manage both the 
foreseen and the unforeseen blips that show up from time to time 
on our radar screens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The advance payments program also helps farmers manage risk by 
providing loan guarantees so that farmers can receive cash when 
they need it but still have the flexibility to negotiate the best 
possible price for their crops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This program kicked in for the benefit of grain producers 
earlier this summer.  Given the early harvest and the resulting 
need for cash, federal government and Canadian Wheat Board 
officials worked to get cash advances issued two weeks earlier 
than normal, a full four weeks earlier than last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that farm safety net programs are not 
the only way in which we are supporting the agricultural 
industry.  The government is making a number of strategic 
investments to help Canadian producers be competitive.  These 
investments help to improve access to the latest technology, 
access to up to date and relevant industry information, and 
access to new markets abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our agriculture and agri-food minister was a farmer himself for 
many years.  He knows how important research and investment are 
to Canada's agriculture and agri-food industry, important enough 
that as a country our total spending per year on research in the 
sector amounts to about $1 billion.  The Government of Canada is 
the largest single contributor, investing more than $350 million 
annually.  Much of the research is done in partnership with the 
private sector in programs like the matching investment 
initiative which helps to ensure we meet the industry's research 
priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of our activity Canada is a world leader in 
innovative agri-food research and farmers reap the rewards from 
that.  Because of research producers have access to new and 
better crop and livestock production techniques, more 
environmentally and economically sound ways to manage disease and 
insect pests, and cutting edge technology.  All these add up to a 
more competitive industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We further enhance our competitiveness through trade agreements, 
export and marketing programs, and export credit facilities that 
help farmers not only satisfy the domestic market but expand into 
markets abroad as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also investing in the sector in other ways that encourage 
farmers to diversify production and adapt to changing consumer 
demands.  The Canadian adaptation and rural development fund is a 
$60 million a year fund designed to help farmers and others in 
the agri-food industry adapt to changing market conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers and other agri-food stakeholders are able to take a very 
hands on approach to this program.  Through their participation 
on councils in each province and their involvement in national 
programs, they help to decide on the priorities and expenditures 
for CARD related activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On another front the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food has 
been working with provincial agriculture ministers and deputy 
ministers to develop an investment strategy designed to improve 
the investment climate in Canada.  This summer they agreed to 
focus their efforts on promoting Canada as an investment location 
and on securing increased investment in Canada's agriculture and 
agri-food industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Short and medium term work plans will be implemented to increase 
investment activity.  Departmental officials will establish 
performance targets so that we can track progress and make sure 
we provide top quality service to interested investors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Federal-Provincial Steering Committee on Investment is 
continuing to work to ensure that our investment strategy is 
implemented and that the Canadian agri-food industry is duly 
consulted.  I am confident that these efforts on the investment 
side will also contribute to a stronger agricultural sector and a 
better livelihood for Canadian farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers have made tremendous progress since we last experienced 
low commodity prices in the mid-1980s.  They deserve credit for 
working hard to embrace new ways of doing business, to manage 
their operations better and to take advantage of the tools that 
governments have put in place to help them manage risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result the net worth of farmers on average has gone up. 
Farm assets have reached historical highs.  The debt to equity 
ratio has been declining since 1991.  This is good news.  It 
indicates that most of our farmers are in good shape as we enter 
this period of depressed income in certain areas.  In short, the 
system we have may not be perfect but an ad hoc system like the 
one in the United States is not the answer.  Our farmers want a 
system that is reliable and predictable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our challenge now is to continue to work together to refine our 
system so that it meets the needs of Canadian farmers now in 
these difficult times and long into the future.  That is exactly 
what we intend to do.

different world from where I live.  He quoted NISA as the answer. 
Perhaps his part of the country is different, but in mine the 
average NISA account will not pay the fertilizer or chemical bill 
for one year.  In my part of the world farmers when they have a 
good year invest it in their operation to improve it and not into 
an RRSP for their retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about the advanced payment scheme as a safety 
net program. What good is an advanced payment scheme when the 
cost of the commodity they are selling is lower than the cost of 
production? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe this member would stand there and throw out 
these systems in place as the answer or even anywhere near the 
answer to the problems facing agriculture. Farmers are are 
producing hogs at $30 less than the cost of production.  How will 
those programs help those farmers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for 
Athabasca quoted me out of context.  What I said is that farmers 
are in good shape as we enter this period of depressed income in 
certain areas.  That means we are in better shape than we would 
be if we had not put the programs in place that we have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian farming community is coming off the best five years 
on average in the history of the country.  That is not saying 
that all this money is in the bank waiting to be spent. But there 
is $2.5 billion in the NISA accounts which is put there 
specifically for this purpose, to access in times of a downturn 
in the economy whether it is a collapse of markets or a collapse 
of price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have these programs like advanced payments for crops in 
place.  The situation would be much more difficult if these 
programs were not in place and if farmers had not been saving and 
putting money into the NISA accounts.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand—Norfolk—Brant, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the parliamentary secretary for his words today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that opposition members keep trying to suggest this is 
somehow a western Canadian problem.  As usual they always try to 
pit the west against the east. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is from Prince Edward Island which is also one 
of the hardest hit areas in Canada.  I wonder if the hon. member 
can bring us up to date as to the situation in his home province 
which I know he is very concerned about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in Prince Edward Island we 
have a hog industry that is in very poor shape, as it is right 
across Canada.  As was indicated earlier, we do have a supply 
managed system in dairy and in other areas.  This is why the 
marketing boards were put in place in the first place.  They put 
order into chaos.  Canadian farmers are benefiting from the 
forethought and the planning of previous Liberal ministers in the 
Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is not as difficult as it may be in areas where a 
supply managed program would not work.  It is difficult to have a 
supply managed program for grains.  It is a crop that relies on 
exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case there is a downturn because the markets for exports 
in grain have diminished. The demand for pork in the Asian 
markets has collapsed.  Therefore there is a more serious problem 
in the western provinces than there may be in the east.  There 
are a lot of producers in the east, in Prince Edward Island, New 
Brunswick, Nova Scotia and in Quebec.  We can look back to a few 
weeks ago when there were hog farmers blocking the Trans-Canada 
Highway.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are problems in eastern Canada with the same commodities 
as there are in western Canada, even though we are more 
diversified.  However, the west is becoming more diversified in 
agriculture and that is because of the programs put in place by 
the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. 
Before we continue debate can I get the consent of the House to 
ask the member a couple of key questions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate being part of this debate.  From my point of view and 
my constituents' point of view this will be one of the most 
important debates in this session of parliament.  Farmers across 
the country who are certainly listening as we discuss this issue 
in the House will hopefully get some indication of where the 
government is coming from on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to have a productive and useful debate, the members 
opposite must be open to the arguments put forth by the 
opposition parties.  That does not appear to be what is happening 
today.  This is the case, of course, in all debates but it is 
particularly crucial when debating an agricultural issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers from across Canada are suffering serious economic 
hardship.  Unfortunately few are represented by Liberal 
government members in this House.  Outside of Ontario the Liberal 
government holds very few rural seats.  It is extremely difficult 
for rural farmers to make their voices heard when dealing with an 
urban based government. It is for this reason that debates like 
this one are so important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a rural Canadian third generation farmer, I am especially 
close to this issue.  I am extremely troubled by the government's 
dismissive attitude toward the issue.  Thus far the government 
has done little more than minimize the magnitude of the problem. 
We heard just that from the previous two speakers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government ministers have not even gone so far as to acknowledge 
there is an income problem let alone a net farm income crisis. 
Whether the government has acknowledged it or not, the farm 
income crisis is very real, painfully real, for farmers feeling 
its effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The 
minister fully admitted there was a problem this morning in his 
remarks. Maybe the members opposite should be a little more 
truthful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member would not want to 
suggest that anybody was not being truthful, but I think he would 
also know that what he is really raising is a point of debate.  I 
am sure he will get ample opportunity in questions and comments 
to make his point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in recent months I have 
sat around the kitchen table with farmers and their families who 
are feeling the real effect and it is extremely painful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1996 to 1997 farm income declined by a whopping 55%.  This 
decline was especially felt in the west where farm net income 
dropped by 35% in Alberta, 40% in Manitoba and 84% in 
Saskatchewan.  Farm income will likely fall another 40% across 
the country this year.  Like last year, this decline will be felt 
more severely in the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am dumbfounded as to how the government can deny there is a 
crisis in light of these statistics, especially in light of the 
fact that other governments have responded to this problem. The 
United States has already announced a $6 billion package for 
agriculture producers.  This package includes $3 billion in 
market loss payments to offset low prices and $2.5 billion in 
disaster relief for crop loss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measures taken by the U.S. are significant for two reasons. 
First, the U.S. government has not only acknowledged the crisis 
but has responded to it.  Already our government is two steps 
behind.  Second, further subsidization in the U.S. can only 
worsen the crisis in Canada.  It is imperative that the Liberal 
government deal with the issue of trade distortion and foreign 
subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important that the government take these issues 
seriously.  I have little confidence that this government will do 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This fall when mid-western states began disruptive actions 
barring the entry of Canadian livestock and grains into the U.S., 
some government ministers dismissed these actions as election 
year nonsense.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Election year nonsense was not the problem.  Falling commodity 
prices are at the root of the dispute and they will not disappear 
after the U.S. election. That is just one small example of the 
way the agriculture portfolio has been handled over these years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In each of the three generations of farming in my family there 
was one or more income crises, although perhaps varying in 
degrees of intensity.  In each case the government went through a 
period of denial before taking action.  This denial stems from 
fear as the government has never had a comprehensive plan to 
ensure secure future for the agriculture industry in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to questions about this crisis, the minister of 
agriculture has repeatedly stated that the net income 
stabilization account will adequately address the current 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NISA was never intended for a crisis of this magnitude.  NISA 
accounts contain an average of only $18,500 per account which is 
not enough to cover the average fertilizer or chemical bill for 
even one year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program has not had enough time to accumulate adequate funds 
and the government is partly to blame for this as there were 
years of delay in making the decision to implement a farm safety 
net program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many businesses will not have enough money to finance the 
upcoming season and many more will go bankrupt if the crisis is 
permitted to continue even longer.  This is an urgent matter. 
Measures must be taken now so that farmers can make decisions 
about the upcoming spring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of its election platform the Liberal government 
committed to a whole farm safety net program to see farmers 
through such crises.  Now the crisis is here.  Nothing has been 
done and the government is poorly prepared to deal with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government must make modifications to the existing safety 
net program such as NISA and follow through with promises to 
develop a whole farm safety net program that includes disaster 
relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must also address trade issues.  When the world 
trade agreement was signed in 1994 the intention was to level the 
global playing field for Canadian farmers.  If anything, the 
playing field has grown steeper with Canada at the bottom of the 
slope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is fighting an uphill battle against heavily subsidized 
American and European producers.  American farmers will receive 
billions of dollars in extra assistance this year. Americans also 
have emergency aid for natural disasters. In addition, the 
Americans have income support to offset depressed commodity 
prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Canadian Wheat Board Americans receive $2.68 
per bushel in direct subsidies.  Meanwhile their competitors in 
Canada receive a subsidy of less than 40 cents per bushel.  This 
difference is nothing when compared to the difference between 
Canadian and European subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>European grain farmers receive direct area support payments of 
$175 per acre just for being farmers.  European farmers also 
receive intervention support that creates floor prices for grain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>OECD's analysis of this situation shows that Canadians have 
approximately a 10% subsidy, Americans 30% and Europeans 36% to 
37%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have upheld their commitment to reduce subsidies and 
have proceeded quicker than required.  Now it is the 
responsibility of the government to address foreign subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must ensure that our foreign competitors are 
meeting their commitments and trade responsibilities.  No one can 
know how long this crisis will continue or how serious it will 
become. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Asian economies represent approximately 20% of Canada's 
agri-food exports and there is no way to know when these 
economies will recover. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Livestock and grain sectors are the most susceptible to declines 
in income and will be most severely impacted by the collapse of 
world commodity markets.  Something must be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am truly shocked that the government is so dismissive of an 
industry so central to our nation's existence.  One of the 
fundamental factors determining the success or very existence of 
a nation is its ability to feed its people.  A country becomes 
vulnerable once it is dependent on other countries to feed 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By allowing American and European competitors to provide unfair 
advantage to producers through subsidies and refusing to provide 
additional assistance to farmers, this government is jeopardizing 
the future of agriculture in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues and I are not asking for retaliatory 
subsidization.  Canada has been moving toward production and 
trade based on competitive advantage, a steady progression we 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, global free trade must also be fair trade.  At this 
point Canada is getting the short end of the stick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I implore the government to address this problem immediately. 
There are a number of measures that could be taken, including 
eliminating or placing a moratorium on all cost recovery 
programs, eliminating the excise tax on farm fuels, improving 
transportation to help farmers in the long term, introducing 
general tax reductions for Canadians, and introducing some 
flexibility to enable the Farm Credit Corporation to deal with 
the crisis in agriculture.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is imperative that the government push for reductions to 
foreign subsidies and for the elimination of trade barriers which 
continue to depress the prices our producers receive.  The first 
step is acknowledgement of the problem and that has yet to 
happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my sincere hope that by the end of the day the government 
will be able to admit that Canadian farmers are in crisis and 
that the farm income crisis is an issue worthy of its immediate 
attention.  Ignoring this crisis amounts to jeopardizing the 
backbone of Canadian society.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, was I mistaken or did I 
hear the member for Athabasca say that the governing party was 
largely an urban based party?  Did I hear that correctly?  If I 
did, do I have to remind the hon. member that the government has 
probably more rural based members than the official opposition. I 
suggest the hon. member take a look at the province of Ontario 
and what rural members have accomplished in that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize the member for Athabasca resents the ethanol biomass 
program.  However, I would point out that if he makes a speech 
that is on record and goes to the people of his constituency, he 
should put it in the proper perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I stand by my comments. 
The governing party is largely an urban based party.  I did not 
say it did not have any rural representation.  It certainly has 
no rural representation in Saskatchewan or Alberta, but it is 
well representative of the legal profession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All those things aside, I am not here to debate the percentage 
of farmers or farm based people in my party or in the governing 
party.  I am here to debate the crisis in agriculture.  That is 
simply a diversion from the issue that we are here to debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my colleague in the Reform Party makes an excellent 
point.  The government is trying to paint this as a partisan 
issue of some sort.  It is not a partisan issue.  If we wanted it 
to be a partisan issue, we would have made it votable.  We could 
have done all kinds of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everybody is trying to take shots at everybody else here.  We 
are trying to highlight the fact that the government has bungled 
this portfolio badly.  We need to address these issues now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it unbelievable that the parliamentary secretary 
continues to defend NISA.  We are here to try to debate the 
issue.  NISA is not cutting it.  Farmers have to contribute to it 
and many farmers have not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To demonstrate how out of touch the government is, I take one 
phrase the parliamentary secretary used.  He said that it has 
been the best five years in the history of agriculture.  Where do 
these people live?  I concur with what my colleague said.  They 
must be living in downtown Toronto to make a statement like that. 
They cannot live in rural Canada and maintain that stand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then they went on to talk about advance payments.  Farmers do 
not want to borrow more money.  That is not why we are bringing 
forth the motion today.  We have to walk and chew gum at the same 
time, I guess.  We have to look at the long range and we have to 
look at the short range.  We have to fix what is broken and help 
them out in the meantime.  That is what has to take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by going back to one thing the minister said.  If 
this is his answer to the whole crisis, we are in big trouble. He 
said that they wanted to show farmers how to use all the tools in 
their toolbox.  They should not throw a wrench in the gears and 
bring the whole agricultural machine to a grinding stop and then 
make that kind of statement.  This is ridiculous.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government ripped out the Crow subsidy.  It did not have 
time for transportation costs.  It did not provide for any 
competition and so on.  There has been so much misrepresentation 
on the part of the government in this debate that it needs to be 
corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Chatters:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my colleague 
demonstrates the passion with which some of us view this issue. 
He is very correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said in my presentation, I am the third generation on my 
family farm.  When my grandfather arrived in this country he just 
barely settled on the farm and had to face the depression of the 
thirties.  That pattern has repeated and repeated itself and 
every time the government came up with some emergency measure and 
promised a long term whole farm program of some sort to deal with 
the problems in agriculture, the cyclical nature of prices. Every 
time it has failed to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking the government to live up to the commitment it 
made in the election campaign and sit down with the stakeholders 
in this business to develop a long term whole farm program that 
will work, not to continue with ad hoc emergency programs that it 
keeps coming up with. 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my colleagues have spoken at some length on the big 
agricultural picture.  Others will probably do so.  I will 
address a very specific problem which the government could solve 
quickly with a few strokes of the pen at no cost to the general 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government would remove some of the obstacles it has 
created to value added activity, there would be immediate 
measurable benefits to prairie agriculture.  I am not referring 
only to the onerous payroll taxes.  These are not specific to 
agriculture when they are the bane of all entrepreneurs, not just 
farmers or farm enterprises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am referring to the requirement that grain used in production 
of food for export out of its province of origin is subject to 
the same freight and elevation charges as grain shipped to port 
position.  This bizarre situation is actively hindering economic 
diversification and benefiting overseas processors of our grains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Excessive freight and handling charges are the largest single 
component of a grain farmer's production costs.  With the Crow 
benefit gone the prairie grain industry's best hope for long term 
survival is to get away from the century old mentality of 
exporting, to process more grain at home and to export more 
finished product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paying $30 or $35 a tonne to move a lesser quantity of high 
value finished product makes a lot more economic sense than 
shipping raw material to port position.  The federal government 
does not force mining companies to ship unmilled ore or logging 
companies to ship only logs, although I would say that with the 
abysmally stupid softwood lumber agreement they are not allowed 
to add value beyond sawn lumber for the U.S. market.  Sometimes I 
wonder whose side the government is on, but that is another 
debate for another day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After a producer has paid the cost of trucking grain to a miller 
or maltster, which in some instances may be 200 or 300 kilometres 
from the farm, there is no logic or justification for hitting him 
with freight, elevation and terminal charges.  Where is the 
incentive to deliver to a domestic facility when merely 
delivering the grain to the local elevator through the CWB for 
export, as is, gives the same net return? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government rationalizes that the price received, for 
example, at the malting facilities at Biggar, Saskatchewan, has 
all the freight and handling charges built in and that the 
deduction is therefore only a bookkeeping exercise. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1310"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is utter nonsense.  To be sure, without government 
intervention through the board the market price in Biggar would 
probably, as the minister loves to reiterate, be lower than the 
Vancouver price including freight and elevation.  Would it be $45 
a tonne less?  The maltsters' freight costs for exports are based 
on the quantity of product, not on the quantity of raw barley 
used in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way did you know, Mr. Speaker, that a farmer receives 
six-tenths of one cent for the barley used to produce a bottle of 
beer?  I thought I would just throw that in for your information. 
The minister himself stated three years ago: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the cost of shipping raw unprocessed grain increases, the 
wisdom of shipping possibly lower volume but higher value 
processed grain product also increases.  By further processing on 
the prairies the proportion of the value of the commodity which 
is spent on transportation is reduced, thereby improving returns 
to the local economy. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not have said it better.  If the minister really 
believes what he said, why has he not initiated changes to the 
constipating regulations and enabled producers to benefit from 
that exercise?  Obviously it would be nearly impossible to market 
all our export grain as pasta, flour or malt, but any significant 
increase would help to move us away from being hewers of wood and 
drawers of water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three years ago the minister's grain marketing panel recommended 
that organically produced grain be removed from board control. 
Polls have shown that the majority of board supporters would 
support that.  Neither the board nor grain companies provide any 
service to organic farmers who must personally market and arrange 
shipment of bagged grain or flour, mostly for the yuppie market 
in the United States.  Nevertheless their production is subject 
to the board's buyback provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, Arnold Schmidt of Fox Valley, Saskatchewan, has 
been producing exceptionally high quality organically grown wheat 
for more than 10 years.  There is a high demand for the raw grain 
and the flour milled on his farm.  By the way, he employs five 
people in his operation to upgrade his product.  There is high 
demand for his product not only in Canada but in the United 
States where it sells at a very good premium price.  He never 
gets to see one penny of the premium because it is forcibly 
extracted from him for services that he does not receive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To consummate a sale into the U.S., Mr. Schmidt is first 
required to go through the charade of selling to the wheat board. 
The grain does not actually pass through a grain elevator because 
even the slightest contamination by other grain would destroy its 
premium value.  Nevertheless he has to pay the grain company 
about $200 for doing the government paperwork on a 20 tonne 
shipment.  Then he pays the board a buyback premium of $2 a 
bushel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Levying a huge charge for which the farmer receives absolutely 
nothing can only be described as extortion.  When organized crime 
engages in activities of this nature the perpetrators sometimes 
go to prison, but for organic farmers the situation is reversed. 
Confiscation of the fruits of their labour by busy little 
bureaucrats is protected and enforced by the majesty of the law, 
but a producer who resists is subject to heavy fines. It is no 
wonder that the business of supplying certified organically grown 
wheat to the U.S. specialty market is stagnating when it could 
and should be the bright spot in our otherwise dismal 
agricultural picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our trade competitors are giving their farmers multibillion 
dollar subsidies, and we are not asking for that.  We know that 
Canada with its feeble economy could not possibly sustain a trade 
war with the economic giants with whom we have to compete.  Only 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage is silly enough to think that 
we could do that.  We are asking that the government stop beating 
up on the agricultural industry through its discriminatory 
regulations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thoroughly enjoyed the member's comments.  He has made 
an excellent point, one which has not been made thus far today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard him speak on the issue of rail transportation in his 
part of Saskatchewan.  Could he elaborate on the concerns farmers 
have about government policy with regard to rail line 
abandonment, on some of the problems that have been created 
because of the lack of competition in that area?  Has he heard 
any concerns from his constituents with regard to the 
transportation problems they are encountering? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, prior to the eruption of 
this extreme cost price squeeze, the only thing I was hearing 
from farmers or anybody else in my riding were complaints about 
what is happening with the rail industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new Canada Transportation Act it is extremely easy for 
a railway to divest itself of a line.  There is nothing to it. It 
only takes about six months of activity to get rid of it. This 
can be done regardless of what economic effect it may have on the 
community affected by that line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is done with—and I use the word advisedly—the connivance of 
grain companies that want to see these lines closed down so they 
no longer have to operate the delivery points in these more 
remote areas.  They can force farmers to transport their grain to 
distant terminals.  The farmer is the one who has to take the 
responsibility and the economic rap for the extra transportation. 
He gets hit twice, not only through the actual cost of hiring 
the transport truck to bring the grain to the terminal, but he 
also pays the taxes to the municipalities for the destruction of 
the roads that are now taking the place of the railways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rail freight cannot be carried in large quantities on light duty 
roads without creating a very severe problem.  There is a double 
problem.  There is the loss of the lines which not only affects 
farmers but everyone who lives in the small communities.  With 
the loss of the rail line and the grain elevator, they probably 
lose a third of their tax base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When farmers have to truck their grain anywhere from 50 to 100 
miles to an elevator at a larger delivery point, they tend to do 
their shopping when they get there.  Therefore the businesses in 
the small towns that have lost the elevators also suffer.  We 
have already ended up with what we call 7-Eleven towns where some 
of the lines have been lost. There is nothing left of the former 
thriving community except the convenience store. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are killing the agricultural community in as many ways as 
this government can seem to figure out.  In the end, the economy 
of the whole country is going to suffer.  I do not care what 
country it is, agriculture is the fundamental base on which the 
entire economy is built.

the hypocrisy of the Reform Party?  It is the party that loathes 
the heavy hand of government, the party that loathes state 
intervention, the party that loathes regulation, but when it 
comes to rail line abandonment, which is a very legitimate issue 
and concern on the prairies, what does the Reform Party want?  It 
wants state intervention.  It wants more regulation.  It wants 
more heavy handedness from the government. 
There is absolutely no party on the face of the earth that is 
more hypocritical than the Reform Party.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Chatham—Kent Essex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to take part in the 
debate today. This debate is one that is very vital to the 
agricultural industry of this nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just by accident that Canada ranks as one of the 
world's largest economies and is doing business in a very 
positive way throughout the world.  Our success is the result of 
the efforts of the Canadian government, the provinces and the 
Canadian people all working together.  Those joint efforts have 
made Canada's agriculture and agri-food sector an important and 
dynamic part of the world economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This same model of partnership prevails in the agricultural 
sector.  Producers work closely with the provinces and the 
federal government to set directions for today's programs, those 
in the past and those in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is providing many ways so that all 
regions of Canada can work in the agriculture sector.  The 
Government of Canada works hard to balance the needs of regions 
and the sectors, providing support for each and every area of the 
country.  Federal investment fosters the growth of the sector by 
encouraging the development of our export markets, our food 
supply and in developing new innovative food products.  A healthy 
dynamic agricultural economy means jobs for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Past federal investment in the sector tended to be governed by 
specific crops or market failures.  Thanks to the combined 
efforts of farmers, provincial governments and the federal 
government, the farm income production system we currently have 
takes into account both the different needs of individual farmers 
and the agricultural economy as it varies across this country. 
The safety net agreements that we have in place result in a more 
market driven program.  They also provide inevitable and 
reasonable support for commodities, producers and provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is this system of safety nets that will help stabilize 
incomes and reduce the need for ad hoc assistance.  All provinces 
enjoy substantial advantages in being part of the Canadian 
federation especially when it comes to the agriculture and 
agri-food sector.  While it is not easy to put dollar figures on 
many of these national advantages, they are every bit as valuable 
as federal support that goes directly to individual farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By working co-operatively with provincial government partners 
and with our clients, the Government of Canada will ensure that 
the advantages of federalism continue to be fully exploited to 
the benefit of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As mentioned by my colleague the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, we do have the tools in place for farmers.  We spent 
the better part of a decade working closely with farm leaders and 
our provincial colleagues to put in place an effective system of 
farm income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I should have noted at the beginning that I am 
splitting my time with my colleague from 
Haldimand—Norfolk—Brant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current safety net system, we have three components: 
crop insurance, the net income stabilization account, and 
province specific companion programs.  Those tools are funded 
partially by farmers but a large chunk, $1 billion, comes from 
governments.  Each and every year the federal government puts 
$600 million and the provinces put $400 million into that 
program. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1325"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this calendar year alone, the national crop insurance program 
which is offered to Canadian farmers at low or no cost will 
provide farmers with an estimated $430 million in direct 
payments.  The program has a participation rate of 55% to 60% 
nationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point I would like to take the opportunity to speak 
about the third component of the Canadian farm safety net system, 
the province specific companion programs. While crop insurance 
and NISA are national in scope, the $200 million in federal money 
devoted to companion programming supports initiatives specific to 
a province based on the needs and make-up of that particular 
province's farm sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The companion programs that have been put in place are generally 
of six types: additional producer and government contributions to 
enhance the NISA program; enhancements to existing crop insurance 
programs; whole farm income disaster programs providing 
government assistance to those who have major income shortfalls 
for reasons beyond the farmer's control; adaptation and 
development programs to strengthen the overall competitiveness of 
the farm sector; residual price support programs, available in 
Quebec, Ontario and Nova Scotia; and the experimental programs, 
such as self-directed risk management in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These companion programs have been very positive. They allow 
different provinces to experiment with new programs that lead to 
better production for farmers.  For instance, the income based 
disaster programs run by British Columbia, Alberta and P.E.I. 
have proven so popular and effective that the national safety 
nets advisory committee is exploring the possibility of a 
national program based on similar principles. It is part of the 
long term review process mentioned earlier by the Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food. I want to emphasize that no decisions 
have been made to this date, although I am sure it will be one of 
the things that comes up in tomorrow's discussions with farm 
leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many members know by now, the minister has called a meeting 
in Ottawa to discuss with our partners in the safety net system 
what producers are requiring, where producers see the government 
could provide support.  The minister has also invited the 
provincial ministers of agriculture to deal with the current 
situations that are faced by our agriculture sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do want to assure members of the House that the federal 
government is not about to implement a unilateral program within 
the safety net system that does not have the support of all 
producers and provinces throughout this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, the Government of Canada's approach to safety nets 
is a true reflection of Canada's strong 
federal-provincial-producer partnership in ensuring the future of 
Canadian agriculture.  I am quite certain that the meeting 
tomorrow will produce outcomes that will be beneficial to those 
farmers who are presently feeling a great deal of difficulty. The 
minister will work with the provincial ministers to ensure that 
our goals meet the needs of the farmers, the provinces and the 
federal government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to stand today and ask questions of my 
colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For years and years this country has had a cheap food policy. 
Through this farm crisis we have not seen the price of a loaf of 
bread take a dip.  My colleague from Cypress Hills—Grasslands 
talked about six-tenths of one cent worth of barley in a bottle 
of beer that is worth $1.50 on average.  Food costs in Canada are 
one-quarter to one-third of what consumers pay in Europe.  It is 
no wonder our farmers are going broke. We pay all the costs and 
subsidize the consumer as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am wondering if the member would care to comment on who is 
going to feed Canadians when the farmers are gone.  We have a 65 
cent dollar here which will not buy much produce from offshore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad that everyone 
in this country does not have the morbid point of view that my 
colleague just raised. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1330"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT42"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT42"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1330

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe there is a great deal of pressure on many farmers in 
this country but the reality is that in many respects the 
government is trying to put in place quality programs.  It is not 
doing it on a unilateral base.  It is doing it in conjunction 
with the farm community.  It is discussing these issues with farm 
leaders on a regular daily basis.  It is discussing the issues 
with provincial leaders on a regular daily basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not going down a stream of the federal government not 
understanding the realities in every region of the country.  As I 
tried to point out, we are trying to put in place programs and 
resources that will help our farm communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest the member is correct.  Canada does have an extremely 
low price when it comes to agricultural and food commodities.  As 
many others, I am very interested in making sure Canadian farmers 
get a fair return for their dollar.  I am not opposed to making 
certain that a fair return does come back to the farm and there 
is no question when we raise that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would not like to leave on record that we are looking 
at a monstrous unfair system either.  We as a government are 
trying to do our best to support farm communities and make 
certain they have the tools to work with. 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the farmers 
of West Nova over the past two years have suffered very difficult 
times living through two very dry summers.  Last winter when the 
ice storm hit Ontario and Quebec we quickly saw that if, for 
example, there was no farming taking place in the Atlantic 
provinces, particularly in my riding of West Nova, we would have 
effectively been cut off from milk, produce and things of that 
nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farming is very important in my riding and that is why I am 
standing up today to say that.  It is so critical for farmers to 
receive just compensation for the hard work they do.  In the past 
years that has not taken place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My comments are for the minister of agriculture.  I would just 
ask him to work together with his provincial counterparts because 
it is very important for the farming community to be taken care 
of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is absolutely true. 
The comment made by my hon. colleague is so clear. Farmers are 
exposed to the elements.  They are exposed to any kind of 
disaster that happens in nature.  They do not have a guarantee at 
the end of the year that they will be able to harvest the crop 
they plant.  It is a business that has a lot of risks to it which 
are extremely difficult to deal with at the best of times.  There 
is no question about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that it is a desired direction we need to go in.  We 
need to make sure we have programs in place which help take those 
high risks out of it and give farmers an income they can count on 
for support.  We have to do this in conjunction with the producer 
groups, the provincial governments and with anyone who will sit 
down and work out good policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague does raise an important point and one that all of 
us have to be aware of.  Farming is probably in the only business 
in the western world that is so uncertain because of the 
uncertain weather conditions. It is something we all have to 
consider every day. 
<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Speller (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I can stand in my 
place today on behalf of the constituents in 
Haldimand—Norfolk—Brant, particularly the farming community, 
and say that our hearts go out to the many farmers and their 
families suffering through this crisis which is one that is not 
of their own making. 
The opposition would have us believe through its motion that this 
crisis, which it is, was made primarily because of unfair 
subsidies and unfair trading practices of other countries.  I 
think that does a disservice to the Canadian people.  They would 
agree that unfair subsidies and unfair practices are a problem. 
They would agree that Canadian trade representatives around the 
world are fighting on behalf of not only Canadian farmers but 
Canadian businesses in this area and are doing an admirable job. 
Under the WTO last time we came out with a good deal for Canada, 
a deal which was supported by all the commodities across this 
country, farm commodities, and I think the opposition would agree 
with that.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the situation in the world, the financial crisis in 
Russia, the Asian financial crisis, the problems in Latin America 
and the fact that a lot of countries around the world told their 
producers to get into pork, for instance, we have had a situation 
where there are a lot of these commodities on the market.  This 
is the problem we need to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can deal with the trade situation.  We have people in place 
and we are working at that.  How do we deal with some of the 
fundamental problems?  I want to say to the Canadian people that 
this is a crisis, particularly for those in urban areas. Some 
people may be watching today and saying what are these farmers 
complaining about, they have a good life. We do in the rural 
areas but there are times, because of the nature of the world and 
because of trade, when beyond our control situations hit us. This 
is one of those times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been here for 10 years.  When the Progressive 
Conservative government was in and then when we came in in 1993 
and took government we debated on how we deal with the WTO and 
the trading rules.  We signed an agreement in 1993.  Part of that 
was to deal with the situation of farm income. So we brought in 
NISA.  I agree with those who say that NISA was never made for 
this situation.  There was always an intention under the third 
line of defence to have something there for an emergency 
situation. Governments at both levels and the farm leadership 
failed in getting that through.  I think we failed in the House 
in making sure that aspect did not go through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we can rectify that if all the parties can come together 
and agree that we need to deal with an emergency situation. 
Whether it be tax cuts, like the opposition says which has some 
merit, and certainly we on this side have moved over the last 
number of budgets to cut taxes directly, or whether it be some 
sort of relief that would come in to these farmers or some sort 
of payment is debatable. We need to agree first that something 
definitely is needed and that we need to take action.  In 
listening to the debate, I think we could probably get all 
members in the House to agree to that.  It is a question of what 
and how we go about doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that the farm leadership in the provinces and the 
minister when he meets with it in a couple of days come up with 
an emergency package to deal with the situation.  I call on all 
members to support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not simply a problem of western Canada. Granted, places 
in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Prince Edward Island will feel the 
heat.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If and when the premiers come to Ottawa to discuss the issue and

that my speech would not become some sort of partisan attack on 
me or on our government. I could definitely get partisan in the

barbs across the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A solution to this will be found in all people across the 
country coming together and saying we need to have a united 
front, all different commodities no matter if it is pork, dairy, 
supply managed or grains and oilseeds.

Commons today.  If the Liberal government wishes to know exactly 
what is going on in farming communities across the country, not 
just in the prairies, the meeting should be held in Strasbourg, 
Saskatchewan or in Upper Musquodoboit, Nova Scotia.

of the minister of agriculture toward the farmers is absolutely 
appalling.

rapidly and that is one of the major reasons why we have such a

really concerned that I must stand here today to make a speech 
that I, quite frankly, hoped I would never have to make.  On the 
other hand, it is important to talk about the crisis that our 
farmers are facing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a reason I had hoped I would never have to rise to make 
a speech like this.  I am the member of parliament for Lakeland 
constituency, which is a very large rural constituency in 
Alberta.  Agriculture is the most important industry in that 
constituency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a farm myself.  I worked to help support the farm for 
many years as a farm economist with the Alberta department of 
agriculture.  In this job and in private consultations with 
farmers during the 1980s and early 1990s I saw things that I hope 
I will never see again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sat at the table with members of farm families whose farms 
were failing.  This did not just happen once or twice or a dozen 
times.  I literally met with farmers and helped them deal with 
situations dozens and dozens of times when I knew, often from the 
very start, that the end result would be that a farm family would 
be forced off their farm.

downsizing of a farm in a way that the family never expected and 
never wanted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem in the 1980s was caused by many of the same things 
that are causing the current crisis.  For that reason I hoped it 
would never happen again.  I really, really hoped that this 
government would recognize the problem and would deal with the 
situation so that we would not face this kind of crisis again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, we are here today debating a motion, which I will 
read again: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should move 
immediately to defend the interests of Canadian farmers from the 
unfair subsidies and unfair trading practices by foreign 
countries, which have changed the problem of stagnant farm 
incomes to a full-blown farm income crisis, and in the event no 
immediate progress is made on this front, introduce emergency 
measures to provide tax relief, lower input costs, reduce user 
fees and address the inadequacies of the farm safety-net 
programs. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are.  We must talk about this.  I think it is really 
important to go through what has happened in the last five years 
since this government has been in power, and indeed before that, 
to recognize clearly what has led to the situation that Canadian 
farmers are facing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the situation is a Canadian-wide situation, although I 
believe that the crisis is worse on the prairies.

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to look first at what has caused this situation. 
There are many causes for this situation.  The first of course is 
the Asian economic problem.  We recognize that as being part of 
the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second cause is normal market cycles, for example with hogs, 
which has been made even worse by the economic crisis which has 
spread beyond Asia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those things were not really preventable by Canadians and the 
Canadian government, but there are many things that were and 
those are the things we have to talk about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to talk about the preventable factors that have led to 
this situation becoming as critical as it has.  To do that we 
have to look at what has happened over the past five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I think back to the first speech I made in the House of 
Commons, we were talking at that time about farm safety nets and 
about the farming situation.  One of the things being discussed 
was the elimination of the Crow subsidy.  The Crow subsidy was 
causing a lot of harm on the prairies, in particular in 
processing industries.  Processing was not happening on the 
prairies, where it would have made sense.  Jobs were being 
exported as raw commodities left the prairies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform supported the elimination of the Crow benefit, but called 
for putting at least part of the capitalized value of the Crow 
benefit into a trade distortion adjustment program. We campaigned 
on that in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at what the Liberals allowed to happen.  They did eliminate 
the Crow benefit, but instead of putting that money into 
something like a trade distortion adjustment program, which would 
have been there now to help farmers deal with this crisis, they 
made a $1.2 billion payout which really was done for political 
reasons and did farmers almost no good whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, we are in this situation with nothing to help 
farmers deal with the crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A trade distortion adjustment program, which we campaigned on in 
1993 and which was presented in this House by Reform MPs again 
and again after 1993, right up to the time the Crow benefit was 
eliminated, would have put some of the capitalized value of the 
Crow benefit into a fund which would have been there to deal with 
unfair trade practices in other countries.  In other words, if 
commodity prices were hurt, as they are being hurt right now due 
to unfair trade practices on the part of Europe, the United 
States and Asian countries, there would have been money in this 
fund to help farmers deal with that situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have unfair trade practices.  For example, the European 
Economic Community has subsidies which are higher than the price 
we get for our alfalfa.  European subsidies alone are destroying 
our alfalfa industry.  It is very near collapse.  We have nothing 
to help deal with this situation.  That fund was not established, 
in spite of the pressure that was put on this government to do 
that.  That is sad because now our farmers face a situation they 
should never have had to face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we go through the list of things that happened in the last 
parliament and did not happen, it is a long list and it is a sad 
indictment of this government.  It is important to point these 
things out.  If we do not, then this government will not do what 
has to be done now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can start with the elimination of the Crow and the fact that 
the money is no longer there to help anyone.  Farmers face 
extremely high freight costs and, with low commodity prices, it 
is causing an unnecessary hardship on farmers.  Had that fund 
been established, with this situation being forced on farmers, 
the money would have been there to help.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can go through the list.  There was the privatization of CN. 
We supported the privatization, but we did not support the 
legislation.  There was nothing in it to ensure that competition 
would be allowed and that there would be fairness in dealing with 
situations involving a dispute between farmers and others and the 
railways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the Canadian Transportation Act.  We called for the same 
kinds of things to be put in the act, but they were not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of cost recovery and user fees, one after another has 
been piled on farmers, often at costs that are much higher than 
need would be and no competition is allowed in terms of who can 
provide the services that these fees pay for.  That is costing 
farmers a lot of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax increases on things like fuel, which affect all farm inputs, 
have put an undue and unnecessary burden on farmers.  Tax 
increases across the board are one of the single biggest factors 
that have caused the problem we see today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prohibitive regulations have topped all of this off and made it 
extremely difficult for farmers to deal with the very difficult 
crisis they are facing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This list of indictments is something the government should take 
note of.  I want to see the government stand in this House today 
to say exactly how it is going to make up for the wrongs that it 
has committed in the past and for the lack of action that has 
been shown on many issues.

increased.

protects society, one that is administered efficiently and 
fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians deserve a system that is accountable, one that is more 
responsive to the needs of victims and communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians deserve safer communities, ones that are free of crime 
and free of the fear of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All ministers expressed their commitment to working together to 
establish a more effective and more equitable justice system in 
which Canadians can have confidence.

according to last week's supplementary estimates the government

including $4 million for millennium art projects; $22 million for 
new chanceries in Colombia, Haiti, Venezuela and South Korea; 
$3.2 million for senators; and $1 million for international

for hepatitis C victims and pepper sprayed APEC protesters.  It 
cannot even give employers and employees a break from the burden

there is nothing for them but there are millions for arts

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, every time Canadian workers get their paycheques they 
see the Prime Minister has skimmed something off the top.  For 
three out of four workers the Liberals skim 2.7% off their 
paycheques for employment insurance alone. 
The chief actuary of the employment insurance plan says that 
those workers' premiums should not be higher than 1.9% which is 
enough for a safe and reliable plan.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the Prime Minister taking 2.7% off those paycheques for 
EI when he ought to be taking only 1.9%? 
<P><A NAME="LINK117"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we reduced employee contributions from what they were 
supposed to be in January 1994 from $3.30 to $2.70.  The Reform 
Party said in its fresh start platform that we should cut EI 
premiums by 28% for employers only.  It is on page 11.  As usual, 
there is no caring at all about the employees, just about the 
employers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK118"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister appears to be confused but that 
should not be not unusual.  We see from the papers that the Prime 
Minister is suffering from a peculiar delusion.  He thinks he is 
a baseball player of some sort who is in a batting slump.  At 
least now he is using his baseball bat for recreational purposes. 
The question still remains why is the Prime Minister taking most 
workers for 2.7% on unemployment insurance instead— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The Right Hon. Prime Minister. 
<P><A NAME="LINK119"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, that is another strikeout by the Leader of the 
Opposition.  I just explained that we have taken care of employee 
contributions.  We reduced them from $3.30 to $2.70 and we did it 
in every one of the five budgets of this government.  We did this 
while the Reform Party was proposing that we reduce them just for 
employers.  I am happy we did not listen to the Reform Party.  We 
thought about the employees.  That is always the concern of the 
people on this side of the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK120"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that is another swing and a miss from the Prime 
Minister.  The Prime Minister is taking 2.7% off of most workers' 
paycheques when he should only be allowed to take 1.9%.  That 
costs the average worker about $350 a year and it costs the 
average small business about $500 per worker per year.  To get it 
straight I will ask the Prime Minister again.  Why is he taking 
2.7% when he should only be taking 1.9%? 
<P><A NAME="LINK121"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we have explained to the people, and I am happy to 
explain again, that we have reduced premiums since becoming the 
government.  We have done it in a very responsible way.  If we 
had listened to the Reform Party we would have reduced only 
employer premiums.  I am happy we are not listening to the Reform 
Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been doing it in a rational way.  This fund is sometimes 
in surplus and sometimes in deficit.  That is why we have to 
manage it carefully.  The Liberal way is always to be careful. 
<P><A NAME="LINK122"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
arrogance is not a mistake and it is not a slump.  It is a 
character flaw.  When the Prime Minister says he wants to 
confiscate $350 in premiums from workers and $500 from employers, 
that is a calculated decision, it is arrogance.  It is not a 
mistake and it is not a slump. If the minister really wants so 
desperately to redeem his reputation, why does he not allow 
people to keep their money? 
<P><A NAME="LINK123"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, let us take a look at what the Reform Party has 
suggested.  It has said that income taxes should be cut by $9 
billion and that the debt should be cut by $9 billion.  That is 
$18 billion.  Now Reformers want another $7 billion reduction in 
EI.  That is $25 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talks about confiscation.  I will tell him what 
confiscation is.  It is confiscation of Canada's health care 
programs if we follow through with that.  It is confiscation of 
our research and development policy. It is confiscation of 
equalization. It is confiscation of everything Canadians hold 
dear.  That is what they would do.

will advocate is that the Leader of the Opposition should not

contribution rate and that this rate will be either frozen or 
slightly lower than that of last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister acknowledge that a freeze or a slight 
reduction is illegal and this is why he might be tempted to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the past points the way to the future.  Every year since we 
formed the government, we have reduced the premiums at budget 
time.  We are looking at the problem at the moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have made a lot of progress.  As I was saying earlier, the 
employment insurance fund has been in a deficit position at 
times in the past and in a surplus position at others, and 
happily this is the case at the moment.  This is why we have 
reduced employee premiums over the past five years from $3.30 to 
$2.70.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if

government pockets.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The wars touched the lives of all Canadians, without regard to 
age, race or class.  Fathers, sons and daughters died in action, 
were wounded, and many came home changed for evermore.  Those 
who remained in Canada also served—in factories, as volunteers 
and wherever they were needed. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together they fought a war and they forged a nation, a nation 
that we proudly call our Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standard they set was repeated by those who followed in the 
World War II and in Korea.  It is a tradition of service and 
international respect that continues today with the courageous 
efforts of our peacekeepers in hot spots around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To all these people, these Canadian heroes, today we the 
representatives of 30 million Canadians say thank you.

them so much also.  Our pledge is never to forget their sacrifice 
and to pass on their legacy to our children and our children's 
children.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>REMEMBRANCE DAY 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Veterans Affairs and Secretary 
of State (Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency), Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I address veterans of the great war and other veterans 
who are with us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly this is a special occasion for special people at a 
special time.  As we approach Remembrance Day and we celebrate 
veterans week, we who are so fortunate to have largely known only 
peace in our lives would do well to remember those who built our 
nation in the earlier years of this century.  For so many war was 
a constant companion of their youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Remembrance Day is a special one for it is the 80th 
anniversary of the signing of the armistice that silenced the 
guns for the first world war.  The killing fields of Europe 
became remarkable at long last for their silence.  More than 
650,000 young Canadian men and women served.  More than one in 
ten or 68,000 never returned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These figures are just figures.  They do not show the human side 
of war.  They do not show the cold, the wet, the rats and the 
stench of trench warfare.  They do not show the fear and the 
horror of war.  They do not show the sorrow, the broken hearts 
shared both on the battlefield and by friends and families back 
home when entire battalions and regiments would be cut down as 
they marched in the maelstrom of enemy machine gunfire, whether 
it be the virtual annihilation of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment 
in a mere 30 minutes fighting at Beaumont Hamel or the 80% 
fatality rate suffered by Canadian regiments during 10 days of 
drawn out fighting at Passchendale. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These figures do not show the triumph of Canadian spirit, 
ingenuity and determination during such battles as Ypres, Vimy 
Ridge or Amiens.  It was indeed during the first world war that 
Canadians would earn a reputation for being among the most 
professional and effective soldiers.  These brave Canadians 
earned for our country international recognition, respect and 
independence. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a sad fact that not many veterans of that war are with us. 
Perhaps there are a few hundred.  Some would say their steps are 
a little more tentative these days, their hands perhaps a little 
more shaky, and their eyesight somewhat dimmed. 
After all, as the nation approaches the millennium, veterans of 
the great war are approaching and have surpassed their own 
centenary.  Despite the many changes that age visits upon us, 
their legacy to their home and native land remains etched in 
time.  We consider them a national treasure.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are delighted, indeed honoured, to have our World War I 
veterans with us in the House today and, as we have done earlier, 
we salute them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No sooner was that war over and won, a mere two decades later 
Canadians again were called upon to offer up their lives in the 
fight against tyranny in World War II.  They fought on land, at 
sea and in the air.  They fought for their homes, for their 
families and for their country.  Just a few years later we 
answered the call to Korea. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time a country came under threat of occupation and 
enslavement, Canada answered the call, and our peacekeepers have 
kept up this military tradition by maintaining peace for over 
half a century. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week it is our turn to say to those who lost their lives 
and to their families and to those who returned to build a great 
nation that we the inheritors of their courage and determination 
will continue to honour their sacrifice by acts of remembrance 
and the telling of their story to our children from one 
generation to another.  We will not forget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  To the member who sent me this note asking 
how old our veterans are and to all members, the baby is 98 and

<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as 
we rise in the House today to recognize the glory and sorrow of 
our veterans valiant efforts for Canada and Newfoundland in World 
War I in battles like Vimy Ridge and Beaumont Hamel, we should be 
reminded of the words of one young man from Guelph.  No finer 
example of inspirational significance has been born by the horror 
of human conflict than <I>In Flanders Fields</I>:

</I></B></P><P align=left>Lieutenant Colonel John McCrae paused to reflect on the high 
price of peace and of man's duty to serve.  His pen spoke out 
from the fields of war 83 years ago.  He spoke for all who have 
faced their soul in the finality of the theatre of war.  From 
Korea to the gulf and through two world wars he could well be 
speaking of all brave men who have soldiered the world to defend 
Canadian beliefs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The brave young men who fought in the two world wars served in 
our armed forces and merchant fleet, contributing so much to the 
end of global war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His words are carved in the walls of the House and are as 
enduring as is the threat of future war.  This year marks 80 
since the guns of the war to end all wars grew mute, a war the 
world learned not from even with a price of 60,000 Canadian dead. 
Canada's losses would continue in 20 short years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our veterans of Korea, the gulf war and peacekeeping duties know 
too well the significance of his words.  This century the price 
of peace was war.  One hundred thousand of Canada's young never 
grew old.  One hundred thousand youths lie in foreign graves, one 
hundred thousand from the Korean and two world wars. 
When I visit foreign graves with Canada's war veterans I am 
deeply moved by their moments of reflective grief for their 
comrades they left behind so far from home so long ago.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Time has not yet healed their wounded souls.  Near one century 
hence memories fade not.  Near one century hence they still have 
not forgotten that by mere chance alone they survived as other 
did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As veterans grieve for long lost friends they ponder why the 
price of peace is war and is so very high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Soon John McCrae's words will echo in this hall and resonate 
throughout the land as we pause to give respect to our honourable 
war veterans and remembered war dead.  “If ye break faith with 
us who die, we shall not sleep, lest we forget”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Godin (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me 
pleasure today to rise in honour of Veterans' Week, from 
November 5 to 11.  This week is set aside to commemorate the 
contributions and sacrifices of the men and women who gave up 
their lives for peace, democracy and our freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As they gather around the cenotaph on November 11, thousands of 
people will remember the courage of those who died at the front 
fighting for peace in the great world wars.  This moment in 
honour of the memory of these people should be a time of 
reflection on the atrocities that have marked world history. 
Often, the past may appear to explain the present, but it can 
never convince us that human lives must be sacrificed for a 
cause, whatever it may be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thousands of them died in the line of duty, were wounded or 
taken prisoner.  On Remembrance Day we honour their memory and 
that of all the other veterans of 20th century wars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>War also affected the lives of all those left behind by the 
soldiers who died in the war.  Their families will remember this 
great meeting with destiny that was beyond their control and the 
painful moments that will remain always. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this Remembrance Day there will be veterans who are surely 
remembering their friends and colleagues as they were before 
they fell. 
I think of the wives making their last farewells as their 
husbands went off to war, never to return, of the parents whose 
children never came home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us remember, so that there is never again an armed conflict, 
and our children never have to learn the horrors of war. We have 
a duty to ensure that Remembrance Day receives the respect due 
to it, and retains its position among our noble traditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have travelled with veterans' delegations returning to visit 
the battlefield sites, and the graves of their fallen comrades. 
Veterans now in their seventies and eighties trying to locate 
the resting places of comrades who lost their lives in their 
twenties, if not younger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always been impressed with their appearance at these 
ceremonies, as they stand stiffly at attention, just as they did 
when they were still in the Forces. 
As soon as the speeches and prayers are over, they wander off in 
search of the resting places of their dead comrades, lost in 
their memories and grief for a brief moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These unforgettable experiences have made me realize the reality 
of war.  Such pilgrimages are both extremely sad and extremely 
gratifying, gratifying because of the appreciation shown by 
those who were liberated by our veterans.  For instance, during 
my visit to Dieppe in 1997, I realized that our servicemen were 
true heroes in the eyes of the French.

year marks the 80th anniversary of the armistice that brought 
World War I to an end.  On November 11, 1918, all of humanity 
pledged that there would never be another war.  This universal 
hope was short-lived. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Twenty years later, the world had already forgotten the war's 
atrocities and launched into an even more deadly conflict, World 
War II, which lasted from 1939 to 1945.  Six years of civilian 
and military losses.  Six years of fighting for our freedom. 
These were the six most defining years in history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, I pay tribute to the men and 
women who gave their lives during the two world wars, the Korean 
war and in numerous UN peacekeeping missions.

with great honour and humility that I mark Remembrance Day on 
behalf of the New Democratic Party caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eighty full years ago from this Remembrance Day, the great 
terrible guns of the first world war fell silent on the 11th hour 
of the 11th day of the 11th month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the great war began in 1914, the Canadian regular army was 
made up of only 3,110 Canadians.  Yet over 66,000 died in the 
killing fields of France and Belgium, with so many more deaths of 
our merchant mariners, our navy, the Newfoundland forces and the 
Royal Flying Corps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>World War II brought our death toll to over 100,000.  With great 
pride and great sadness and with tremendous respect I recognize 
the ultimate sacrifice given by those killed in all wars and the 
terrible sacrifice also of their loved ones and their friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will soon be joining these honourable veterans and other 
members of this House in France and Belgium to pay our respects 
to Canada's dead from the first world war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This day is marked to ensure we never forget those who gave 
their lives for all of us.  Let us never forget those veterans 
who suffered unspeakable horror in Korea, Japan and Hong Kong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let all of us in this House commit to doing all we can to ensure 
that those who served in our merchant marine are treated with 
respect and justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us recognize those who fought fascism as part of the 
Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion in Spain.  Let us also ensure that 
those brave Canadian prisoners of war sent to the Buchenwald 
concentration camp receive the justice they deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the first black member of parliament for Nova Scotia, it is 
my honour to remember those who served with the segregated Number 
Two Construction Battalion in World War I. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As aboriginal veteran day approaches on November 8, let us also 
not forget the over 7,000 aboriginal Canadians who served in the 
two world wars and in the Korean war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Remembrance Day is honoured by many people in many ways.  My 
comments have already spoken to those who died and their families 
and loved ones, but now as a parent I believe Remembrance Day 
must always address our youth.  It is now their lives that we 
need to protect through remembering war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If anything, let this day give each of us more strength and 
vigour in working for peaceful and democratic solutions wherever 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I finish with the words gracing the tombstone of Corporal Hugh 
Rocks of the Queen's Own Rifles of Canada who died on D-Day, June 
6, 1944 and who is buried in the Canadian graveyard at 
Beny-sur-Mer in France: “There is a link death cannot sever. 
Love and remembrance last forever”.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too many times this century tyrants and dictators raised their 
ugly heads and expanded their realm through force.  For 
individuals this meant seeing their villages burned, their 
families murdered and their freedoms extinguished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Against the expanding tyranny of Germany and Austria in the 
first world war, Nazi Germany, Japan and Italy in the second 
world war, and communist North Korea, China and the Soviet Union 
in the Korean War, Canada held firm.  Young, vibrant Canadians 
with their futures ahead of them understood the importance of the 
call and put their lives on hold and at risk.  Soldiers, sailors 
and airmen travelled to the farthest reaches of the globe to 
protect their families at home, safe in Canada. Too many of them 
never came back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, thanks to their sacrifice, we continue to be safe here at

this century, our leaders must remember its lessons.

</H4><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK219">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is good to pause for a truce once in a while in the 
battles we engage in regarding the policies of the government and 
the affairs of this great country. We have a lot to be thankful 
for and many people have sacrificed their lives so that we may 
have peace.  We pay them our respects. It is not easy to do 
battle in this House as we battle with words and that is what 
parliament is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In posing my question I need to explain to Canadians that it is 
not easy to get a resolution on to the floor of the House to be 
debated and battled over.  I want to thank all of those who 
helped me in the battle to have agriculture discussed.  Farmers 
have gone to bat for us and they have done a lot for this 
country. We need to recognize that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government gets the chance to choose what is debated here 
most of the time.  The official opposition gets to name the topic 
for debate about one day out of every month and generally the 
topics submitted for debate are much more important to most 
Canadians than what the government puts forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot emphasize enough the importance of this topic to all 
Canadians.  We may not debate agriculture very often, but I have 
no control over that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not want this to be a partisan issue and so I did not 
press to have it votable.  However my colleague had become quite 
partisan in his comments by documenting the failings of the 
Liberal government.  Would it not be more productive to work with 
the government rather than chastise it for its failings?  That is 
the question I would like the member to address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate the 
question from my colleague.  I would say yes, normally it would 
be much better if we could work together in a non-partisan way 
toward solutions.  I think the member would know as well as 
anybody that in the last five years we have been in Ottawa we 
have tried that approach.  We have worked hard in committees to 
try to move government along the way that farmers and Reform MPs 
think it should go.  It has not worked.  It is to the point where 
we have a crisis in agriculture that was completely unnecessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before we can force or push this government into doing something 
about it, we have to make it very clear to the government how it 
failed farmers.  The government has failed farmers in terms of 
the legislation it has brought forward, like the legislation that 
eliminated the Crow benefit.  It was handled very poorly. The new 
Canadian Transportation Act does not encourage competition, is 
not fair and will not lower the cost to farmers. The 
privatization of CN which was a good idea has been handled 
poorly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ever increasing user fees and what the government calls cost 
recovery have put an undue tax burden on farmers and have made it 
so they cannot make ends meet. The increase in taxation at every 
level and in every imaginable way has been loaded on farmers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of these things together with the weak position of this 
government and previous governments during trade negotiations 
have allowed this completely unlevel playing field which our 
farmers are forced to compete on.  This all shows that the 
co-operative approach does not work with this government.  That 
is why we have to point out the government's errors of the past. 
Hopefully by doing that we will get it going in the right 
direction so this crisis can be dealt with. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the debate today— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Excuse me.  Normally 
we go from side to side and I did not see the hon. Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  I am sorry 
but I have already recognized the hon. member for Crowfoot.  I 
guess I owe you one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay:</B>  If the hon. member across the floor is 
concerned about not having time and has to leave the House, I 
would certainly acquiesce and allow him to stand and speak. 
Nevertheless, I have been given the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been asked to meet with the municipal council of the town 
of Wainwright as well as the district council next week based on 
the crisis in the farming community in that area. Some of the 
farmers there have been told by the bank that they must list 
their land for sale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This whole business of leaving things until we reach a crisis 
situation is not the way to do it. It seems that the only time 
the government will listen to us is when it is afraid of what the 
people are going to do at the next election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sorry but I 
must interrupt.  The hon. member for Lakeland for a very quick 
response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Wainwright area was 
in the constituency that I represented last time but due to 
boundary changes it no longer is.  They have the same situation 
there that we have in the Lakeland constituency which is a 
drought following several years of drought. The situation is made 
much more difficult because on top of that are the low commodity 
prices and all of the problems that have been caused by inaction 
and improper action on the part of this government.  It is a 
crisis situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to get ideas from the people affected by this crisis and 
make sure that the government really listens to the ideas so that 
some action will be taken to deal with this crisis.  It is an 
extremely serious one. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in the debate on the Canadian 
farm crisis.  Of course we all know that it is Canada wide and 
that is why we are raising the topic here today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure all members of this House at some time in their lives 
were faced with the situation in which they had to scramble to 
overcome misfortune.  Either due to choices they made or ones 
that were arbitrarily made for them, they awoke one day to 
discover that they were out of a job or that they had some sort 
of financial crisis looming over them. I just want members from 
urban centres to keep that picture in mind so they can appreciate 
what we are talking about today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not like losing one's job.  A Canada wide farm income 
crisis is like losing the best part of one's life and all that 
one has worked toward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present crisis in farm net incomes is nothing short of a 
financial earthquake rumbling across Canada toppling lives and 
livelihoods for years to come.  One of the buzzwords we have 
heard in this House lately is child poverty. Child poverty is 
erupting and rearing its ugly head out on the prairies where I am 
from and across Canada due to the rural crisis. Like natural 
earthquakes, this one was preceded by tremors and will be 
followed by aftershocks that will reverberate in areas far from 
the epicentre on Canadian farms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike natural earthquakes, farmers cannot count on the Canadian 
forces coming to their assistance. In fact they cannot count on 
federal authorities to do anything except to keep many of the 
counterproductive, bureaucratic programs that they have loaded on 
to the Canadian farmer over the last number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Simply put, the price that anyone can get for their produce 
minus their input costs and taxes determines whether or not they 
can succeed and invest for their future.  Right now, economic 
turmoil in Asian markets is reducing demand and prices as well. 
The resulting oversupply in world markets is reinforcing this 
downward pressure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what about the input costs?  In a free market, producers 
should be able to reduce their costs and adjust to a reduction in 
demand.  That is not happening.  That it is not happening is the 
fault of interference in the marketplace by a variety of players, 
including governments.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's dollar is down and though the Prime Minister was too 
busy playing through to notice this summer, the effect has been 
devastating.  For some exporters the low dollar stimulated sales, 
that is true.  But for farmers the lower price for their products 
offset by massive agriculture subsidies by our neighbours to the 
south and even more by our so-called friends across the Atlantic 
have added to that situation. Furthermore, that low dollar cannot 
buy as much fertilizer, chemical, new machinery and/or parts 
which tend to be based on American dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course the expenses connected to farming are not just the 
ones that go into the ground.  Like every household and business 
in this country, farmers cannot seed or harvest a stock of grain 
without answering to a bureaucratic program or shelling out for a 
mandatory fee which is a tax. Farmers know as well as anyone that 
there has to be some tax to pay for government services, but we 
hold the opposite view of government members who display a desire 
to have constantly rising taxes pay for a constantly expanding 
government and its programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a regular basis we have to question where these revenues come 
from, where they go and whether there is not a better way to 
provide certain services or manage public concerns.  We do not 
see a commitment to re-examine the status quo on a host of issues 
from taxation to democratic accountability from that side of the 
House.  We do not expect to see any imaginative resolutions to 
the present agricultural crisis either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farmers are doing their best. One of my constituents, Mr. 
Rene Cadrain, wrote in the <I>Western Producer</I> “They say 
diversify.  I've been diversifying all my life and things are 
getting worse by the minute”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government can try to pawn off its responsibility by 
saying that Asia has depressed prices and there is nothing it can 
do about that.  But what is really happening to the price of 
grain worldwide?  We can see that a loaf of bread still costs the 
same.  As a baker, Mr. Speaker, I am certain you can answer to 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Europeans are injecting billions into subsidies to keep 
farmers growing wheat when the market is already well served in 
that area.  Insulated from the real price they should be getting, 
European farmers are contributing to a glut that nonetheless 
leaves millions of starving people around the world.  That is 
obviously something that needs attention all by itself.  But this 
government has done nothing to counteract the mistaken policies 
of its trading partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We scaled back our agriculture safety net from $2.5 billion to 
$600 million in accordance with the world trade agreement.  Good 
for Canada, but we forgot to hold our allies to that same 
standard. The Americans are getting into the act now with their 
own bailouts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite Canadians selling only 1.5 million tonnes into that 
market that consumes 35 million tonnes, this government does 
nothing as frustrated Americans stop our trucks.  It is certainly 
ironic when a prairie farmer tries to sell his own wheat in the 
U.S. and he is arrested by his own government, and when his 
government tries to truck the wheat down there, it is turned back 
by state troopers.  It gives you a greater appreciation of the 
comment in the <I>Lethbridge Herald</I> recently that wheat 
production is 10% grain and 90% politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that this government will be going to international 
conferences soon to discuss these issues, but will it just be a 
replay of Kyoto?  No plan until they step from the hotel, no idea 
of what Canadian farmers need to compete and prosper and no idea 
of the cost and implications until it is too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should all recognize the difficulty that governments face 
when they try to satisfy many competing interests.  This is a 
diverse sector.  Any policy has unintended consequences and is 
bound to have as many detractors as it has beneficiaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the difficulties experienced by farmers in this time of 
falling net income relate to the tax burden.  Federal income and 
payroll taxes are bad enough, but due to offloading by senior 
governments, many rural municipalities are forced to rely on 
excessive property taxes to maintain their services.  This type 
of tax is not tied to the ability to pay and looms larger as land 
values fail to reflect the drop in value of the crops grown on 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senior levels of government brag about how they have balanced 
their budgets, but they are bragging to the same taxpayer who is 
getting squeezed at the local level.  It is a shell game that no 
longer fools many Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course jurisdictions cross at the federal and provincial 
levels with negative consequences.  The federal government is 
responsible for the railways, but has not come up with a policy 
to make the system more efficient.  It offered a one time payout 
to eliminate the Crow rate which equalled one year's worth of 
freight.  We are still shipping product.  The effect is that now 
farmers are paying an extra 30 cents a bushel for freight, a 
major input cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have now are piecemeal rail abandonments, the 
destruction of elevators and the towns that support them, and 
longer hauls to market for crops.  The roads take a pounding 
without any dedication of fuel taxes to compensate the local 
governments to fix them.  The farmers' costs go up and grain ends 
up sitting in bins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The feds and the provinces cannot agree on who is responsible 
for the environment either.  We all have a stake in it of course, 
but policies that impose flat charges on a whole range of goods 
and services without any recognition of whether a large western 
farm of 3,000 acres has the same impact as an eastern farm of 70 
acres of a diverse crop can wipe out that narrow margin of 
income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxes and environmental fees on automotive parts and petroleum 
products can loom larger for a farmer than a high volume urban 
operation. 
We are never sure whether that money is going toward an 
environmental purpose or into general revenues. Farmers are 
certainly willing to pay their fair share and they have been but 
the key word here is fair and we just do not see that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am calling for the government to stand up for Canadian farmers 
on the international stage and to re-examine how the agricultural 
sector is treated within our borders.  Farmers as businessmen 
need flexibility, accountability and efficiency from government 
policies.  They need to see a thorough re-evaluation of the many 
short term band-aid solutions that have piled up over the years. 
They do not want handouts.  They are very self sufficient.  But 
they could use a playing field that would allow them to compete 
fairly and efficiently now and when times are good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote my constituent, Mr. Cadrain, again:  “Wives have to 
work to put food on the table and pay utilities.  Why should we 
who feed the world go with less than the people we feed?” 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I really would have 
enjoyed getting up for the previous speaker but you would not 
allow me.  I do not want to get into a partisan fight on this 
issue although it is awfully hard not to get drawn into one by 
the remarks made by the last member, especially with some of the 
less than accurate information he was talking about on what this 
government is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason some farmers were arrested for trying to move grain 
to the United States is that they were violating the marketing 
system in this country which is there to maximize for producers 
the returns that are in the marketplace.  Thank goodness we have 
the Canadian Wheat Board or the returns would have been even 
lower.  That's a fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Give us a little credit.  We have some programs that make sense. 
The supply management industries, which the member's party is 
not too supportive of, are reasonably healthy because we have 
organized marketing.  Perhaps we should be looking at organized 
marketing in other areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a serious farm crisis that is increasing.  In this 
debate we have to try to find some solutions.  We on this side 
are willing.  I did not hear any proposed solutions in the 
member's remarks.  Could he give us some solutions to consider 
rather than his rant against past policy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am thankful the member did 
not get partisan.  I would not know where to start.  He speaks 
about the marketing system of the wheat board maximizing returns. 
A while ago I heard the movie line “show me the money”.  I 
have not seen it.  I am a western Canadian farmer who is under 
that system.  Of course the parliamentary secretary is not 
because he is in a different part of the country.  I have not 
seen that maximization of returns.  Nobody can show me the bottom 
line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are trying to take their products across borders because 
they are frustrated.  They do not have any black ink on their 
bottom line.  Bankers are saying the only way they are going to 
get out of it is to sell their land.  Where do they go?  What do 
they do?  I have farmers in my riding who are 55 to 60 years old 
who are ready to pull the plug because there is no tomorrow for 
them.  They have diversified, they have agriculture, they have 
done everything government levels have told them to do, and they 
cannot be there for next spring's seeding. Where are they going 
to go?  At that age what are they going to retrain in or retool 
to do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals have killed jobs in this country.  What jobs are these 
farmers going to take on?  Their wives are driving school buses, 
they are driving school buses.  They are doing everything they 
can to put bread on the table and they cannot keep it up. So 
where do we go? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no open accountability in the wheat board.  The member 
says the board maximizes our returns.  Look at the 
continental barley market a couple of years ago.  It took barley 
and drove it right through the ceiling for price. Everybody loved 
it.  It had to shut it down after two months because it was 
competing against other forces that the wheat board did not want 
it to be competing against. When we took oats out from under the 
board, productivity in oats went up by 2000% on the prairies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those facts and figures are there to be verified.  I could go on 
all day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter:</B>  You're not making any sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz:</B>  I will answer to that at home.  I will 
not answer to it to the member's potato producers in P.E.I. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a cheap food policy in this country.  We have not seen 
the cost of a loaf of bread following the price of wheat.  If it 
were we would be buying bread for two bits a loaf, and we are 
not.  Mr. Speaker, you are a baker.  You know the price of bread 
is up there on the quality stuff.  You pay for that quality.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a quality wheat product in this country which is better 
than anywhere in the world.  But we do not get a premium price 
for it.  Why is that?  The wheat board is maximizing our returns. 
We have high protein.  We have the best milling wheat grown in 
the world.  We have the best durum grown in the world.  The 
Italians like it for their pasta, but we cannot get it to them. 
The Americans love it.  Why are we handcuffing our farmers by not 
letting them have the flexibility to make their own decisions? 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James—Assiniboia, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to participate in this debate and to speak 
about one of the principal strengths of Canada's agriculture and 
agri-food sector, its innovativeness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sector has long been a leader in forward thinking and 
strategic planning.  The agri-food sector demonstrates a keen 
business sense and a healthy enthusiasm for competition.  Staying 
at the forefront of developments in this sector is a constant 
process, a process of adapting to changing conditions, of 
adopting new technologies and improving one's position in the 
marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly if we are serious about this effort we have to put the 
money where it matters.  Research is a critical investment.  The 
work done by scientists in the agri-food area provides the 
foundation on which farmers are able to build a competitive 
business that returns them a reasonable income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, a recent study by the Government of Canada called 
“The Economic Benefits of Public Potato Research in Canada” 
found that from 1971 to 1995 public research on potatoes returned 
$10 to the industry for every $1 invested.  Other studies have 
shown that the return on investment in cereal research is 30%. 
That means for every dollar we spend we make $1.30 through things 
like increased exports, higher quality products and lower 
production costs.  This is a very important figure when we 
consider how important and competitive the world market is for 
cereals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With its commitment to both basic and applied research the 
Government of Canada is working hard with the agri-food sector to 
make that return grow.  Canada's agriculture and agri-food 
research capabilities amount to a success story.  They are key 
factors in helping our agriculture and agri-food innovate for 
further economic development and environmental sustainable. With 
the inevitable downturns that are a fact of life in the market 
system the strength of the connections between the research and 
technology development community and the wider agriculture and 
agri-food sector has never been more important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada public and private spending on research in the 
agriculture and agri-food sector amounts to $1 billion, and $350 
million of that comes from the Government of Canada. If we think 
research is expensive just try competing without R and D against 
the likes of the United States, the European Union and our other 
main competitors.  It will not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Producer organizations representing farmers in many commodities 
are participating in steering committees on research and 
development at the national level of Agriculture and Agri-Food 
Canada's research branch as well as at individual research 
centres across the country.  This means that producers are 
playing a direct role in the direction of research and technology 
development activities.  These activities will lead to new 
products and new processes to enhance productivity, open new 
markets and add value to agricultural products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through programs such as the matching investment initiative and 
the Canadian adaptation and rural development fund, producers 
have contributed both input and funding to support research and 
technology development activities in a wide range of areas, from 
biotechnology to environmentally sustainable farming practices. 
They deserve praise for their proactive efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Research activities are supporting diversification by 
developing, testing and adapting new crops and techniques to 
Canadian conditions.  Scientists are working to develop new 
applications for existing crops such as varieties of wheat better 
suited to pasta. 
From cranberries to canola, Canadian farmers have access to 
expertise and advice from researchers on lucrative new crops or 
niche marketing opportunities.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Research is also helping farmers lower their costs of 
production, whether through new soil conservation methods or high 
technology for livestock grading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Research also facilitates the transition to a more global 
market.  We are in a difficult stage of that transition right 
now, no doubt.  The current situation has been shaped by an 
almost unprecedented combination of events.  But both the sector 
and its partners in the federal and provincial governments remain 
actively engaged on all fronts to see that the farm income 
support system continues to work well and to evolve.  That is 
what the meeting the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food has 
called tomorrow is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the background, research and technology development 
activities across Canada are laying the groundwork for future 
success.  That helps explain why Canadian agriculture is among 
the best in the world.  Our expertise in things like irrigation, 
tillage, crop breeding and disease control is no accident.  It is 
the product of hard work and investments on the research side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agriculture is high tech.  Farmers make great use of technology. 
In wise and skilful hands the tools of technology can bring rich 
harvests.  Go to any region in this country and look at its farms 
and its processing operations to get a measure of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moving technology from the lab to the farm requires a close and 
ongoing relationship between Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada's 
18 research centres and producers in their regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some examples for my hon. colleagues to consider.  At 
the Lacombe Research Centre in Alberta, the Canadian Cattlemen's 
Association is involved in a study using computer vision 
technology to accurately grade beef. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Saskatoon Research Centre the Canola Council of Canada is 
working jointly with federal researchers on a study using the 
latest biotechnology methods to improve the quality of canola oil 
and meal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Horticultural Research and Development Centre in 
Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, work has led to diagnostic standards to 
correct mineral deficiencies for peas, beans and corn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Fredericton Research Centre, in a project supported in part 
by the New Brunswick Potato Agency, has developed a technology to 
improve blight forecasting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are just some examples, and they dramatically illustrate 
the point that whether it is new approaches to crop and animal 
production or learning how to control weeds and combat diseases 
that can cripple a harvest, what is accomplished at research 
centres will positively affect us all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increasing production is a great thing but we know that we are 
living on borrowed time if we ignore the long term quality of the 
soil, water and air.  Using water and fertilizers more 
effectively means improved soil structure, conservation of water 
and a reduction in the so-called greenhouse gases that are behind 
global warming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members wish to debate the current situation in 
agriculture, but I would think we should broaden the debate to 
focus on now and the future, because research is helping to shape 
the future of agriculture.  In many ways it is helping to ensure 
there will be a future for agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In assessing the current situation we must not lose sight of 
what is being done to build on the many strengths of Canadian 
agriculture, and there are many strengths.  Without question the 
agriculture and food sector in Canada is leading the way in 
setting priorities and making decisions and investments that will 
generate long term benefits at all levels of the food system, 
from producers to consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  On questions and 
comments we will have one minute for the question and one minute 
for the response. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I find it rather interesting that a member with a 
background in media and communications would give us a speech 
which is very obviously a canned speech straight off the shelf. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1600"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if he understood anything he read.  He does read very 
well.  He gave us a lot of platitudes.  He said farming was high 
tech.  I am lost for words.  He said water and fertilizer should 
be used effectively.  He is into a lot of fertilizer all right. 
Mostly he spent time singing a hymn to our agricultural research 
establishment.  It is great.  It is one of the best in the world, 
but it has been around for over 100 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is quite clear in the 
intervention of the hon. member that he is not interested in the 
debate.   Despite the fact that farmers deserve a healthy debate, 
the member is not prepared to give it.  He would be happier 
simply hurling allegations and insults across the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my prepared speech I was trying to talk about the fact that 
research is playing a vital role in agriculture and agri-food. If 
the hon. member from Saskatchewan wants to belittle that, that is 
fine, but I do not think his constituents will be very impressed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage—Lisgar, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, with all the research being done—and we know costs have 
to be cut—why is it that the Canadian Wheat Board for the last 
three or four years has been marketing less and less grain but 
costs have still gone up about 8% to 10% a year? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where could we do some cutting in that marketing agency?  When 
prices drop from 40% to 70% for grain, surely there should be 
some cutbacks instead of continual increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, farmers on the prairies 
will have an opportunity to look at the problem he raises.  As he 
well knows, there is an election process taking place right now. 
Ten of the fifteen directors will be farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is an issue which concerns farmers, and I am sure it 
does, the new board of directors will look at it.  If there are 
some solutions to bringing down the overhead of the wheat board, 
I am sure these new directors will find them and implement the 
new ideas they bring to the board. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
always find it very interesting to come here not just to talk to 
agriculture issues but to a lot of other issues.  Members of the 
government come in with canned speeches and read from them as if 
they were quoting from the Scriptures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the member been out of Winnipeg lately to talk to farmers 
and to find out how serious the situation is?  Does he have a 
clue what the motion is today?  Are we talking about R and D in 
agriculture or are we talking about a farm income crisis?  The 
questions are quite simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is typical of this 
member that he generally does not know what he is talking about. 
I assure the member that I grew up on a farm in southern 
Manitoba.  I have scads of relatives and friends who work farms. 
I see and talk to them all the time.  He may not want to believe 
that, but if he wants to check it out I invite him to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very familiar with the motion.  I find it very interesting 
that in effect the Reform Party is asking us to look at the farm 
crisis right now and do it on an urgent basis.  There is nothing 
wrong with that, but the motion asks us to deal with other 
countries around the world concerning unfair subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would take a number of months, if not years, to negotiate 
some new deals with other countries on subsidies.  Yet that is 
exactly what members of the Reform Party want.  They want us to 
spend years dealing on these international matters and at the 
same time hop on the farm crisis tomorrow.  It is one way or the 
other.  They cannot have it both ways.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton—Kent—Middlesex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity today to join in 
the debate concerning the future of the Canadian agriculture and 
agri-food sector because it is a fundamental concern that unites 
us all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a former agriculture producer of asparagus, cauliflower and 
tobacco, I know very well the ups and downs of farm income, low 
commodity prices and weather conditions.  There is much the 
government can do and should do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we acknowledge that farming is a risky business, our 
government is working from coast to coast to coast in support of 
agriculture and our agri-food sector.  Together with farmers, 
local organizations, provincial and territorial governments we 
are working co-operatively to improve producer efficiencies, to 
develop market opportunities, and to encourage sustainable 
environmental practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the minister pointed out in his remarks, farmers and 
governments have both planned well ahead of time for a market 
downturn in farm commodities.  We are now, however, experiencing 
a farm crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the October 15 meeting of the National Safety Nets Advisory 
Council there was a discussion of a national disaster program. 
The federal and provincial representatives as well as farm 
leaders from across the country agreed that farmers were facing 
some very difficult economic times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food stated in my riding 
two weeks ago, he does not want Canadian farmers left twisting in 
the wind if the current bout with poor commodity prices continues 
for long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jack Wilkinson, president of the Canadian Federation of 
Agriculture, feels a program could be finalized relatively 
quickly even by February.  While he is not sure what the final 
program may look like, it could be premium free and could be 
triggered by individual farm operators suffering from a drastic 
loss of income caused by either crop losses or reduced market 
prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“A whole farm approach may be taken and a program will have to 
be designed to be trade neutral”, stated Mr. Wilkinson.  He 
suggested that any new program, if put in place, will complement 
existing programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For Ontario farmers existing programs include the market revenue 
program for grain and oilseeds producers, the NISA program and 
crop insurance, but we also need a third line of defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changes have been made to NISA already, enabling farmers to take 
advantage of early withdrawals based on estimated income 
projections rather than on year end tax statements.  There are 
whole farm disaster type programs now in place in Alberta, 
British Columbia and Prince Edward Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NISA program moneys are available to Canadian farmers and add up 
to about $2.5 billion.  That equates to $17,000 for the average 
Canadian participant and about $16,000 for the average Ontario 
participant.  I would be remiss in saying that there are 
approximately 40,000 who have $1,000 in that program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now live in a global economic environment and there is much 
more competition for our product.  On October 23 I had the 
pleasure of taking the minister of agriculture to four operations 
in my riding to see hemp, sugar beets, soybeans and a large farm 
implement dealer.  I believe it is important to hear from the 
grassroots about what they are thinking, what their concerns are 
and their ideas for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chatham—Kent in southwestern Ontario is Canada's largest 
producer of hemp.  A new firm called Kenex Limited, headed by 
Jean Laprise, is an example of the ability of our agriculture 
entrepreneurs to succeed in an increasingly competitive world. 
Already it has invested over $4 million in harvesting and 
production, making inside door panels for cars and trucks, floor 
mats, hemp cheese and hemp nuts, all for export. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is assisting in their enterprises.  I was 
pleased this summer to announce funding for Kenex through the $60 
million per year Canadian adaptation and rural development fund 
to help set up a processing line.  It is one way we can help our 
rural communities adapt to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many farmers across Canada are diversifying their operations and 
trying new crops, aiming for new markets.  I also announced this 
summer funding for asparagus growers in my riding to assist them 
in the niche crop they are exporting.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sugar beets are returning to southwestern Ontario after a 30 
year absence.  Some 3,000 acres were grown last year and this 
year 6,500 acres were grown by 103 growers, with estimated gross 
sales of $8.5 million, and 100% of this product is shipped to 
Michigan. It provides an additional crop rotation, increases 
employment through the supply, production, piling and 
transportation chain, and provides a future for many farmers. 
These are but a few examples of success stories in the agri-food 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those of us who represent ridings in rural Canada, who have 
raised their families and earned a living in rural Canada, know 
full well the importance of farming in the agri-food sector. 
Producers, processors and retailers from the field to the fork 
represent a vital contribution to Canada's economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those of us who live in rural Canada also know that many 
commodity prices are at or near record lows.  Low grain prices, 
low hog and cattle prices, along with rising input costs, are 
causing income related concerns among producers.  Since grains 
and oilseeds have been heavily hit by the loss of international 
markets, prairie farmers are most affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The shift toward canola and special crops like beans and lentils 
is no coincidence.  Farmers are paying close attention to market 
signals and using that information to decide what to produce and 
how to produce it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure we can all agree that the current troubling situation 
was not created by factors only within Canada.  The Asian 
financial crisis and Russia's economic woes have meant lost 
sales.  Good crops combined with reduced demand have resulted in 
an oversupply in the marketplace and lower commodity prices. 
These low prices are expected to continue through 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the long term diversification means a stronger farm and a 
stronger farm sector and farmers know it because it accords with 
their keen business sense and strong competitive spirit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Staying at the forefront of development is a constant process, a 
process of adapting to changing conditions, of adopting new 
technologies and of improving one's position in the marketplace. 
Hemp and sugar beet producers are doing exactly that in my 
riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question then becomes what is the government's role in 
cushioning the impact of the farm income crisis.  The government 
and our Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food are addressing this 
issue in the most prudent and effective manner.  In the short 
term the net income stabilization account holds $2.5 billion that 
Canadian farmers can access.  This represents an annual 
contribution of $600 million by the federal government, $400 
million by the provinces, and $600 million by farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The safety net program is available to the farmers right now. 
Seventy-five per cent of NISA participants have sufficient funds 
to bring 1998 incomes up to average earnings in the 1993 to 1997 
period.  Any simplistic short term solution is not in anyone's 
best interest.  Only a long term solution to the low commodity 
prices is appropriate.  This solution cannot encourage trade 
sanctions and provoke a trade war.  Sanctions would hurt the long 
term viability of Canada's agriculture and agri-food sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian farmers do not want a stop gap or an ad hoc approach. 
Upon the invitation of our minister of agriculture, farm leaders 
and provincial government representatives are meeting tomorrow to 
discuss the problem.  Let us hope the discussions are productive 
and fruitful and are in the interest of our farmers first and 
foremost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Diversification cannot prevent downturns in the market but it 
can blunt some of the effects of that downturn.  Diversification 
is not the only solution but is part of the effort to ensure the 
best possible prospects for the Canadian agriculture and 
agri-food sector. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I must express my appreciation.  It is good to see 
somebody on the other side who knows something about agriculture. 
It is also reassuring to see the hon. member working at committee 
to recognize the difficulties that farmers are having.  She 
talked about a third line of defence.  I am glad she is willing 
to look at other things that work.  Unfortunately she needs to 
inform herself a little more fully about NISA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like her to reply to a question.  How do we communicate 
the importance of this issue to all Canadians?  The concern we 
have over here is that not enough people are made aware of the 
importance of agriculture to Canada. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1615"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can appeal to Canadians by putting this in context by saying 
that we are talking at great length about whether we should give 
a 1% or 2% raise to our union members, postal employees, 
teachers, workers in the automotive industry, electrical, 
telephone and delivery services.  We express grave concerns that 
these people are not getting a 1% or 2% raise but here we have 
farmers taking a 75% cut in their pay.  That is very serious.  It 
affects a large part of Canada and yet we are unable to get most 
Canadians to recognize the seriousness of the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can talk about $22 billion in exports and we know how 
important that is but if we go beyond that people's eyes glaze 
over at these numbers sometimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. 
colleague for his comments.  I certainly agree that we have a big 
learning cycle out there to educate our non-farmer consumers on 
this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All too often we hear that it is the farmers' problem.  Prior to 
being a member of parliament I worked as a constituency 
assistant. I had a man of the cloth who came in and was right 
downturned on farmers.  Being a farmer I did not take too kindly 
to his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said he did not know why farmers needed subsidies.  He said 
the shelves are full in the stores. I said that was wonderful and 
was glad he realized that but I also asked him if he realized the 
food was not grown in cans on the shelves in the stores. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe our urban colleagues are certainly understanding our 
situation with the pricing and to see exactly what is out there. 
I think we have a little battle ahead of us but I do believe they 
are recognizing the vital importance agriculture plays in our 
society, not only farmers but the further processors.  Many 
people have family members who are connected indirectly or 
directly with the agriculture sector. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know the member 
for Lambton—Kent—Middlesex is very concerned about the farm 
crisis and agriculture issues.  I have heard her talk 
passionately on it many times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One common theme runs through all farm crises. We have had farm 
crises in past generations. It does not matter in what generation 
the farm crisis occurs or what commodity or community. There is 
as a result of a farm crisis economic violence, I would call it, 
inflicted on farm families. That is the level I want to deal 
with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we have anything in place?  What about the Farm Debt 
Mediation Act or is there anything in place that the government 
can do to deal with that kind of economic violence that will take 
place within farm families at the community and individual level? 
That is what we have to deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. 
colleague for that question.  I can certainly understand where he 
is coming from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been very fortunate to be on the front lines working in a 
constituency office and addressing some of these concerns over 
the past years when there have been crises within our communities 
in the farming sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the revamping of the farm debt review board has a 
program that will help some of these farmers.  Being a farmer in 
my past life, we always think next year will be a better year. 
Sometimes our pride gets ahead of common sense a little by 
thinking that another struggling effort can be made to put in the 
crops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this program farmers can actually access information to see 
if there is a possibility of them continuing next year.  They can 
see the avenues or how they could change their farming practices. 
I think it will be tapped into on a regular basis in the next 
few months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to tomorrow's outcome when we have the provincial 
ministers and agricultural leaders in town.  These are the people 
who will give us the best answers as to how we address this 
national disaster program.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be splitting my time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the chief critic for the Reform Party on agriculture I find 
it a pleasure to be here today to speak on this Reform supply day 
motion dealing with the income crisis currently occurring in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We found it necessary to bring this supply motion forward and to 
bring a motion forward in the agriculture standing committee to 
move the government along on this issue and recognize there is a 
problem today and that it will be even worse in the future. There 
is every indication that the government was not prepared to take 
any immediate action to deal with this problem and was looking 
down the road that maybe it would solve itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make a correction to what has been going on in 
the House.  A number of members on the government side have 
repeatedly stated that we have raised this issue simply as a 
western crisis.  We well know that when one sector of the 
agriculture economy goes into a crisis situation on the income 
side that it is not too long until a major portion of the 
Canadian economy follows suit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer directly back to the comments by the member for Calgary 
Southwest.  He said we recognize that there is a Canadian income 
crisis which is why we have raised this debate today.  Politics 
has to take a back seat to the issue facing people today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many farmers even when they are making a profit are not in the 
rich and wealthy category.  We have heard the same story today as 
we have heard in the House in past weeks, the same reasons why 
the government feels it did not have to really do anything.  It 
was kind of along the idea that the global market has failed us, 
the farm income crisis is due to the Asian flu or the Russian 
economy going down the tubes.  It is just a cycle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also we have heard that NISA and crop insurance will address all 
the problems.  That is just not the case and I have noted the 
government is moving along the road to admitting that there is a 
major problem and that something has to be done.  Tomorrow the 
agriculture ministers are appearing in Ottawa from across the 
country and that will help move this issue along further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is sincere about ensuring the future of 
agriculture it will have to take the actions required so that a 
farmer does not need two or three jobs off the farm.  The 
minister of agriculture has made comments to the effect that the 
farm economy goes up and down and suggested that farmers look for 
some outside source of income.  A viable agriculture operator and 
his family cannot be put under greater stress by getting a job to 
supplement his farm income when it is not sufficient for him to 
make a living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That suggestion is fine for the small farmer who maybe has only 
a few acres or is only part time farmer at best, but it certainly 
cannot be applied to our commercial farmers.  The government has 
to create an environment which producers can make an adequate 
living from farming.  I believe that we are debating this issue 
today because the government has failed to do its job over the 
past 30 years without going into a long history of 100 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A government needs the foresight to look down the road and have 
in place programs and policies that enable a vital industry like 
agriculture to continue through the good and bad times that are 
always coming along.  I do not just fault the Liberal government 
on this.  The Conservative government shared in that past.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The few people who would buy it tried putting it through 
livestock and that soon went down the tubes also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had this before and somehow, someday a government has to 
put in place programs and policies that will ensure farmers carry 
through when the next downturn comes along. That opportunity is 
now available to this government and that is where the farming 
industry is looking for solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The priorities of this government also need to be examined. 
Education and health are major issues and major programs that 
have to be fully funded and cared for.  These should be at the 
top level of this government's next budget. In addition, 
agriculture should be added as a top level area to be addressed 
in the next budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the examples of misguided priorities have probably been 
examined here today.  They include the spending with regard to 
the Firearms Act.  I would be surprised if my friend from 
Yorkton—Melville did not mention that. But $330 million going 
into a program that will not do any good shows a misguided 
attempt to priorize government spending to an area that will buy 
votes in some sectors of the country, big cities perhaps, but it 
will not do anything effective for the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot of money in many parts of government departments 
similar to that wasteful spending that could be marshalled to be 
used to deal with the crisis before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had several speakers from the different parties and I 
note that our friends to the left, the NDP, are singing along the 
lines of $1 billion here or $1 billion there. That is not the 
solution to this crisis or the long term crisis. The Conservative 
Party has been repeating some of the same things and I find that 
disappointing also. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has stated this government has frozen user fees for 
the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.  What about eliminating that 
agency?  What about a corresponding reduction in income taxes? 
What about the cost recovery programs of the Canadian grain 
commission?  What about pilot fees on the Great Lakes?  Will the 
minister commit to eliminating these costs today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, we have to create an environment with a viable farming 
community and we must reduce the cost of government to enable us 
to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I end with an analogy.  We had the famous Prime Minister batter 
situation arise and I think the Prime Minister is really more of 
a pitcher.  The pitcher is supposed to be the leader of the team. 
He has the ball in his hands and it is up to him to throw that 
ball and make the next action, address the issue in front of him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this pitcher, this little guy from Shawinigan, throws the 
next baseball into the dirt on this issue, the taxpaying farmers 
of Canada, along with many other taxpayers, will soon recall him 
from the team and probably bring in a reliever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  It is my duty pursuant to Standing 
Order 38 to inform the House that the question to be raised 
tonight at the time of adjournment is as follows: the hon. member 
for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, agriculture.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know the member 
for Selkirk—Interlake has farmers in mind in terms of the farm 
crisis and I want to back him up, but this is not a western issue 
and I do not believe people on this side of the House believe 
that it is in fact a Canadian issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His remarks lacked specifics.  There is a funny thing about the 
farm crisis.  If one has not experienced the farm crisis 
personally it is very difficult to understand the loss of pride, 
the loss of one's heritage and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member have any specifics?  Would he support utilizing 
the Farm Credit Corporation in some fashion to deal with this 
crisis?  Would he support introducing green programs?  Are there 
extra tools that the member could offer that the farm debt 
mediation board could utilize in terms of dealing with this 
crisis? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the crisis that is 
facing us today has a long history and a long track record.  It 
goes way back to the previous government of which the questioner 
was a member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have raised this issue and brought it to the attention of the 
government along with many industry players and representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry and the opposition parties do not have control of 
the budget that will be coming down in February.  We do not know 
how much has been committed to other programs that are not 
related to agriculture.  We do not know where the government will 
be able to get that money by repriorizing its spending.  Heaven 
knows, it may even raise taxes.  Who knows what it will do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that no one can tell the government what to do in 
its next budget.  We can suggest, but it is up to the government 
to come up with solutions in its budget and to repriorize its 
spending toward agriculture. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened intently to the member for 
Selkirk—Interlake.  He accused the NDP of wanting to throw a 
billion dollars here and a billion dollars there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the hon. member that our agriculture critic, the 
member for Palliser, has estimated that anywhere from $500 
million to $700 million is needed for emergency aid now so that 
farmers right across this country can get through the winter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a former member of the fisheries and oceans committee, I want 
to express this statement, relating it to farming and 
agriculture, and see if he agrees.  “Our fisheries and marine 
policy is a perfect example of how Canada does not work and how 
unaccountable and dysfunctional our system of government can 
be”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we relate that to farming and agriculture, would he not agree 
that is a valid statement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, he certainly seemed to 
have the agreement of a lot of members in the House after his 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The crisis that we are talking about has to have a two-pronged 
solution, both for the short term and the long term.  Simply 
throwing money at the problem is not going to solve it in the 
long term.  That is what the budget is for in February and that 
is where the government has to move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to wait until all of the industry players have had a 
chance to put their solutions forward.  At that time, through the 
committee on agriculture, we will be able to put forward reports 
with recommendations that will have a viable, long term solution 
for the government to follow.  We are going to get that done in 
time for the February budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take great pride in the fact that Reform has been the party 
pushing this issue forward the most at this point. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it has been very, very difficult to have questions 
answered by the government.  I asked this question earlier and I 
must emphasize once again that the government is ignoring the 
question.  What are the bureaucrats in agriculture doing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I read an article in the paper awhile back that described how 
many bureaucrats we have in all of the departments of agriculture 
across this country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 5.7 farmers for every bureaucrat.  Farmers have come 
to me and asked:  “What are these guys doing?  This crisis is 
coming down the pike and nobody has prepared us for it”.  It is 
the very same thing that the member asked: “What would you do?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not need more programs designed by bureaucrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, with the limited 
resources of any economy we have to use the resources available 
to us in the wisest fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things such as excessive numbers of employees, starting programs 
simply to have a program in a given area, to get votes in that 
area and to make everybody feel good have to be cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard today in committee a suggestion that a task force be 
created to address the very issue of wasted, misguided spending 
by various departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry believes that a lot of money can be found for 
agriculture in the existing budget.  That is the challenge for 
the government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very glad to be able to get in on the latter part 
of this debate, having just come from a constituency where 
another problem related to agriculture is very, very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the area where I come from taxes rank third.  For some dry 
land farmers it is freight, fuel and then taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to show how this government, by a reversal of form, is 
killing rural government in Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rural government in Saskatchewan is maintained by rural 
municipalities.  Generally it has an elected reeve and six 
councillors.  We recognize and my friends in the rural government 
recognize that some of the land that is under their taxation 
jurisdiction, as part of the municipality, now comes under Indian 
land claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This argument is not about rural municipalities versus native 
claims.  It is a direct concern of the little rural municipality 
out there with 400 or 500 people.  This humongous government has 
reversed a policy and is forcing the rural municipalities to 
raise their taxes.  It is not just one rural municipality.  Many 
will follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a federal issue.  What this government is doing is 
trying to pass on a debt that is owed by this government to the 
rural government of Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the previous government there was a treaty land 
entitlement.  I want hon. members opposite to listen carefully to 
this.  That government agreed that the rural municipality from 
which the land would be taken would receive compensation based on 
22.5 times the previous year's taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After 10 years this was agreed upon.  Harry Swain, deputy 
minister of Indian and northern affairs, wrote to the 
Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities and said “The 
mechanism agreed with Saskatchewan in the September 13 
cost-sharing agreement on treaty land entitlement appears to be 
appropriate”.  That is when they agreed to pay 22.5 times the 
previous year's taxes.  He was referring to the specific land 
claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just one year later, in 1992, deputy minister of Indian and 
northern affairs Dan Goodleaf wrote “The federal government 
recognizes that the recent TLE framework agreement has created a 
level of expectation by RMs that a standard of 22.5 times the 
previous year's tax revenue will be paid in all cases of reserve 
creation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My time does not allow me to read all of it, but I want to point 
out that one year after that promise there was a change in 
government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government was elected.  By the way, five Liberals from 
Saskatchewan were elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened?  This government unilaterally, after a commitment 
was made to the RMs of Saskatchewan, changed the 22.5 times to a 
lousy five times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to ask the question:  Where were the Liberals who were 
elected from Saskatchewan to support the RMs during that time? 
Where were those Liberals? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It means this.  People who owned a piece of land with a tax rate 
of $1,000 were promised that they would receive $22,500 and the 
RM would maintain the roads.  This government has now said that 
it will give them $5,000 and they can maintain the roads forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RMs have been slapped in the face.  As a result they have to 
raise taxes in the balance of the RMs because of the lost 
revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real problem is in the fact that no one in Saskatchewan can 
understand why the previous minister of Indian affairs and 
northern development refused to meet with SARM, the Saskatchewan 
school trustees and the provincial government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economy of Saskatchewan is in dire straits.  Would this 
minister meet with the groups which are so drastically affected 
by this reversal? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A former Prime Minister of Canada from Saskatchewan finally 
erected a dam across the Saskatchewan River.  Up until that time 
this hon. gentleman said that the federal government said 
Saskatchewan was not worth a damn.  That is exactly what this 
government is saying to the rural municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is saying that it will give people $5,000 
instead of $22,500 and they can maintain the roads.  These people 
cannot do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the situation.  The government negotiates a treaty with 
an Indian band.  The RM knows it is going to get 22.5 times the 
last assessment or the taxes on that piece of land.  It does not 
happen.  What happens?  Revenue goes down.  There is no money 
available for the schools.  People are moving out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six or seven more land claims are imminent.  This government 
sits here, smacks us in the face and says that it unilaterally 
decided it is going to be five times the assessment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where have the members of the NDP been?  Where have the NDP 
members been in protesting this in rural Saskatchewan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are supposed to believe that the premier of Saskatchewan can 
pick up the phone to call the Prime Minister.  All the premier 
would have to say is “back off and give Saskatchewan what it 
deserves.  Give rural Saskatchewan what was originally 
promised”.  Or do they really agree and continue to knock it 
away?  More farmers are being affected very quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a debt which is owed by the people of Canada.  This 
government is saying to those 300 or 400 people in the rural 
municipality:  “Who are you?  You are not going to get the 22.5 
times the previous year's taxes.  You are going to get five times 
and you people can bloody well get your change out of your 
pockets and pay more tax dollars”.  This is just one RM, but it 
is gaining momentum throughout Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure members that this local government, as well as the 
trustees, as well as the villages and towns, want to know if the 
government is going to continue this robbery.  These people want 
to know if this government is going to continue smacking us in 
the face with five times the assessment and making the RMs 
responsible for maintaining the roads forever. 
This is an utter disgrace.  It is a smack in the face to 
agriculture. It is a smack in the face to the people who have 
built the roads and everything else.  Let us show a little 
concern.  Let us reverse this and go back to the original 
agreement and do not slap Saskatchewan in the face again and 
again with every land treaty that is settled.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have been here 
most of the day during this debate.  In all seriousness I am 
really wondering why the motion by the Reform Party was put 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have asked several times for Reformers to come forward with 
specifics and they have not.  The member opposite was not on the 
farm crisis really at all.  Are they just blowing smoke over 
there?  Is this a debate for their pet peeves about other issues? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen all kinds of attacks on the government, on the 
Canadian Wheat Board, on this and on that but we have not seen 
one specific from the Reform Party in terms of dealing with this 
farm crisis. The farm crisis is serious.  It must be dealt with 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tomorrow the minister of agriculture has a meeting with the farm 
leaders and all the ministers of agriculture from across the 
country.  He is being proactive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is an opportunity today for Reformers to put forward some 
suggestions and we are hearing none.  Let me ask again, could 
they give me some specifics.  I know their policy talks about 
using market mechanisms.  Are they now recognizing that there is 
a crisis out there?  Are they willing to go beyond the market 
mechanisms and go to ad hoc programs? Are they willing to use 
farm credit?  Are they willing to use green programs?  Does the 
farm debt mediation board need to be strengthened?  Give us some 
suggestions, some specifics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member opposite 
made the suggestion that I should be more specific.  How much 
more specific can anyone be as it relates to the taxes of the 
farmers in a growing number of areas within my constituency? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was elected to serve my constituency first.  That is what I am 
doing.  How much more specific does the member want?  This 
government reneged.  Instead of giving 23.5 times the taxes of 
the previous years, it is going to cut it down to 5. Then the 
government latches on to the RMs and says they can maintain the 
roads on top of that.  They are losing money.  This is a debt. 
That is specific.  It is a debt of the federal government.  It 
was promised by the federal government.  It was promised to the 
RMs.  It was promised to the taxpayers and the Liberal government 
is not living up to that debt, and that is specific. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the member for Souris Mountain asked where was the NDP 
in all this.  I can assure the hon. member that when farmers are 
in trouble or anyone in this country is in trouble they can 
always count on the NDP provincially and federally for support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last parliament it was not the New Democratic Party that 
voted for the privatization of CN.  It was not the New Democratic 
Party that voted for the privatization of our transportation 
system in Bill C-101. It was not the NDP that voted for the 
dismantling of the Crow rate.  It was not the New Democratic 
Party that laid the burden on farmers for the transportation 
problems right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government and the Reform Party must have known that when we 
download that kind of financial responsibility on the farmers 
they are going to have problems down the road.  Would the member 
not agree that because we do not have a national agricultural 
policy that is one of the major reasons why we are in such 
trouble today? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
comment.  I still believe, however, that the New Democratic Party 
could help on this issue.  I believe it could help on the 
taxation issue.  I think the NDP should get together with the 
premier of Saskatchewan and do something about it.

situation like this, farmers are looking at this massive 
bureaucracy.  For every five and a half farmers we must have a 
government employee.  That is part of the problem.  The other 
problem is taxation.  I just vented one area of taxation.  Time 
does not permit me to get into two more areas of taxation which 
drop right smack in the laps of the members opposite. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings—Frontenac—Lennox and 
Addington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am thankful for the 
opportunity to speak on this motion.  I will be splitting my 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada recognizes that Canadian primary 
producers face unique challenges in operating their businesses. 
Not only must they deal with the pests, the diseases and the 
unpredictable Canadian weather, they must also do business in a 
highly volatile, competitive and often heavily subsidized 
international marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To help Canadian producers meet those challenges the federal 
government is investing $600 million each year in farmer safety 
nets.  The provinces are spending an additional $400 million. 
This envelope of $1 billion in addition to the funds contributed 
by producers funds a system that helps farmers deal with the 
production, the material risks and the market risks they must 
manage in their farming operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cornerstone of this system is the net income stabilization 
account, NISA, a voluntary program that can provide a source of 
money for farmers during market downturns.  This money can be 
used for whatever purpose they choose, to pay input suppliers, to 
meet operating and term loan payments or to supplement their 
personal incomes.  As the minister mentioned earlier, NISA has 
been a tremendous success with participants accounting for 85% of 
the net sales of commodities eligible for the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will briefly describe how the NISA system works and how it 
helps Canadian farmers deal with market downturns.  Each year a 
producer participating in the program can place up to 3% of his 
or her eligible net sales into his or her individual NISA account 
with a maximum of $7,500.  The federal and provincial governments 
match that money and pay a 3% interest bonus on the farmer's 
share.  That is fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a downturn comes, producers can withdraw funds from their 
account up to the level of their average income over the last 
five years.  Since 1991 Canadian producers have saved almost $2.5 
billion in their NISA accounts.  Most of that money has been 
contributed over the last three or four high income years.  In 
general, producers of all primary commodities except for supply 
management products like dairy, eggs and poultry are now eligible 
to participate in this program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers who are not already enrolled in NISA are permitted to 
make a late application up until the end of December.  Benefits 
for the 1997 year that would be reduced by a late filing penalty 
could still add up to a significant amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most farmers choose to participate in this excellent risk 
management program.  That means they have a tool to help them 
manage through a price slump or a market downturn like the one 
currently being experienced.  On a national level, an Agriculture 
and Agri-Food Canada preliminary analysis suggests that the 
majority of active NISA participants have enough money in their 
accounts to see them through the winter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By contrast, American farmers did not have this.  They had to 
wait and see what kind of bailout package Congress and the White 
House would devise but in Canada farmers and governments have 
been putting money into the bank every year. Thanks to NISA, most 
Canadian farmers have money in the bank to fill in their income 
gaps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian farmers have helped federal and provincial governments 
to build the farm income system we now have in place.  It is a 
system that puts farmers in charge, that encourages farmers to 
save money during the good years and helps them to manage their 
way through the lean years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year we implemented a new interim withdrawal mechanism for 
NISA so farmers can have access to their money when they need it 
the most.  So far producers have withdrawn only 3% of the $2.5 
billion that has been accumulated in NISA.  If the need for 
additional funds increases in the coming months, they will be 
able to decide based on their own individual circumstances when 
and how much to withdraw from their accounts.

worked with Government of Canada and the provinces to put in 
place the kind of tools they need to help them through tough 
times.  They continue to work with the government and with the 
provinces through the long term review process of the farm income 
production system currently underway and scheduled to wrap up 
this coming spring.

meeting with farm group leaders and provincial ministers tomorrow 
to discuss this serious farm income situation.  As well as the 
tools we have in place now for these farmers, they will discuss 
how these tools can be used to maximum effectiveness and if there 
are other adjustments that we should be making to our safety 
system for farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once more farmers themselves are at the table deciding how to 
deal with the ups and downs in the markets and what the weather 
and world conditions can bring.  I am glad to see so many 
commodity groups, along with all the provinces, joining our 
minister tomorrow.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great attention to the hon. member. What 
we have, in those famous words, is a failure to communicate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is once again deluding himself and his 
government colleagues that there is not a problem out there. He 
went on at great length extolling the virtues of the NISA 
program.  Yet the member has to know that NISA as it is presently 
constituted helps those who really in many cases do not need the 
help.  In the past it has been the people with the highest net 
incomes who were in the enviable position of being able to 
contribute to the NISA. The people who had no net income and were 
struggling and did not have the money could not invest in that 
program.   We have always said it was a good program.  We have 
said we would expand it to be an all-farm NISA. It is not the be 
all and end all.  I do not want the hon. member to leave that 
impression with the farmers who are viewing this debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask him if that is his intention. He said it was great that 
the Liberals were able to deliver tools they need to help them 
through tough times.  The reality is these farmers do not have 
the tools they need because the Liberal government has failed 
miserably to act when it had the opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know the hon. 
member's colleagues on his side will tell him that we had four 
hours of meetings on the agriculture standing committee today 
with farm leaders such as Jack Wilkinson and the western pools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NISA is a good program but it is not the answer to all our 
problems.  That is why we spent four hours in committee listening 
to these people and asking questions.  This is a serious 
situation.  No one has all the answers.  That is one of the 
reasons my hon. colleague from Prince Edward Island on this 
side of the House today asked what he proposes.  The supply 
management sector is healthy at this time. Does he support that? 
What would he like us to do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He does not want us to help anybody out.  He wants to cut money 
from all these programs.  Yet he wants us to help the western 
producers.  I want to do that too.  We have to look at how bad 
the circumstances are and see what we can do.  This is not a 
short term problem.  World prices are at the very lowest in 
commodities.  We want to work together with our colleagues. 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to clear up a misconception that was given by the member for 
Selkirk—Interlake when he implied that it was the government 
that stated this was a regional issue with western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a member from his party, the member for Dauphin—Swan 
River, who brought the topic up that this was a western concern 
and that eastern Canadians were fine because they had marketing 
boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go from there to the chair of the rural caucus about that 
particular topic.  The downturn of commodity prices is a national 
catastrophe.  It is a national issue. 
Would he describe the effect of this downturn on his home 
province of Ontario?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this morning in rural 
caucus as we met at 7.40 individual members from Ontario were 
discussing how serious this situation is and how it is affecting 
our producers.   Individuals talked about hog producers.  We 
wonder what their future will be.  There is an overproduction and 
commodity prices are at an all time low, and following the Asian 
flu there is less demand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have many neighbours who are involved in supply management and 
are thankful that the government is supporting that.  There are 
also many people who grow cereals and grains who are concerned 
about the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad to see the motion on the floor.  At committee we 
supported bringing the motion forward, although we may have 
wanted to change a few words in it.  This is a serious crisis. 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
let me say at the outset, which may come as no surprise to 
members, that I am not a farmer.  I have spent some time on a 
farm like many Canadians.  In fact, my wife's uncle has a 600 
acre farm in a little community called Iron Bridge just about 80 
kilometres this side of Sault Ste. Marie, which is my home town. 
It is a farm that grows mostly rocks and a bit of water.  He also 
raises some cattle.  Over the years he raised hogs and therefore 
has had to deal with commodity difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My family and I have actually spent a lot of time there over the 
years, mostly in the summer months, some of it bringing in the 
hay and working on the farm.  My boys spent many of their years 
as youngsters working for their Uncle Ted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not necessarily give me credentials as a farmer.  I do 
not pretend to have them.  However, I think is important that all 
Canadians understand what the position being put forward today 
represents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear.  An opposition day is an opportunity for the 
opposition party in question to put forward a motion that somehow 
in some way might embarrass the government.  It is not about 
serious policy.  It is not about putting forward arguments and 
debate to the farmers of western Canada or southwestern Ontario. 
It is not about putting forward policies that make sense.  It is 
about ranting, raving and railing on about how awful it is that 
this dastardly government is ignoring farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has principles.  If we do not like them it has 
others, which is exactly what we are seeing here.  One part of 
the motion states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—to provide tax relief, lower input costs, reduce user fees and 
address the inadequacies of the farm safety net program. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet we can see it is the Reform Party's position.  It is quite 
interesting.  Members of the Reform Party, in their own document 
referred to as the blue book, call for a self-reliant and 
economically viable agricultural industry which will use market 
mechanisms, including the free operation of comparative advantage 
between regions and commodities, free entry into all sectors of 
production, and marketing and global free trade to meet the needs 
of consumers.  If their policies were adopted they would create a 
trade war which they know full well would not benefit farmers or 
consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us in this place, whether we represent farm communities 
or urban communities, represent people who need a successful 
farming industry.

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand they would do all these miraculous things. They 
consider themselves to be primarily free traders and on the other 
hand they would create a trade war that would see farmers across 
the country penalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about some contradictions because hypocrisy 
sometimes is amazing.  It is amazing to see some of the 
differences.  They also support “the phased reduction and 
elimination of all subsidies, support programs, trade 
restrictions and non-tariff barriers in conjunction with other 
countries and domestic sectors”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They go on to say that they will vigorously use federal safety 
net programs to support Canadian food producers that are 
struggling.  Which is it?  Are we to use programs like NISA to 
support farmers who are struggling food producers, or are we to 
phase out and eliminate all subsidy support programs?  What is 
NISA?  Is that not a support program?  On one hand they want to 
eliminate it.  On the other hand they want to use it to support 
farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This takes me back to the election campaign when the leader of 
the Reform Party would say one thing when talking in eastern 
Canada, perhaps about Quebec or whatever, and another thing when 
talking in western Canada.  There seemed to be two messages or 
more.  I cannot explain it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am reading from their document.  This is not Liberal 
propaganda.  They will support the phased reduction and 
elimination of all subsidies and support programs.  However they 
will vigorously use federal safety net programs to support 
Canadian food producers.  It is pretty clear to me.  They cannot 
have it both ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some other interesting statistics out of the blue book. 
In their supposed taxpayers' budget of 1995 they called for $640 
million to be saved by downsizing guess what department? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry McCormick:</B>  What department? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  The department of agriculture.  There 
were others: industry, fisheries and oceans and natural 
resources.  Their knives knew no boundaries.  They were prepared 
to slash and burn and put up figures regardless of sustainability 
or of the impact it would have on those ministries in regions of 
the country.  We can imagine what would happen in fisheries and 
oceans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No wonder they do not have a seat in eastern Canada.  They 
should go into eastern Canada and tell them that they want to cut 
money out of those ministries that support Canadians working in 
those industries.  They would cut $640 million by downsizing 
agriculture, industry, fisheries and oceans and natural 
resources.  They did not say the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day the debate in the House was about how all 
environmental issues should be turned over to provincial 
interests.  Someone even suggested that the municipalities could 
do a better job, that the federal government had no position to 
play as custodians of the national environment, and that it 
should abdicate its responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would not surprise me in the least if the day arrives in the 
not too distant future when members of the Reform caucus will 
call for the Minister of the Environment to invoke tough federal 
regulations to protect a particular interest that they may have 
that day or that they have read about in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
or the <I>National Post</I> that morning, which seem to be the 
fundamental research documents used by the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, a further $690 million would be cut from other 
regional and sector specific funding through the department of 
agriculture.  They talk about environment, industry and natural 
resources.  It is truly astounding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion calls for emergency measures including tax relief and 
yet their own documents do not support it.  One thing I find most 
interesting is how this seems to be a johnny-come-lately for 
Reformers.  Where have they been in question period?  Where has 
the critic for agriculture been?  Where has the leader of the 
Reform Party been to stand and ask amazingly tough questions of 
the government and hold its feet to the fire?

</I></B></P><P align=left>They do not ask questions during question period.  Rather they 
sit in the back room and concoct some kind of emotion to throw on 
the floor and try to pretend they are the saviours of Canadian 
farmers and Canadian businesses, that they are the only ones who 
can foster tax relief.  It is hypocrisy in its purest form, and 
the Canadian people know it full well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
may I straighten the member out as I usually have to do.  At the 
time he was talking about with regard to the 1995 budget there 
was a $40 billion problem.  The finance minister increased taxes 
and slashed the guts out of health care by slashing $7 billion. 
We do not have to take any lessons from him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everywhere I go I have people coming up to me and talking about 
the issue of taxation, taxation and taxation.  When I was talking 
to farmers in the maritimes that was the number one issue.  I do 
not understand why the member, in spite of the fact that he comes 
from an urban constituency, cannot understand that everyone 
including farmers needs a tax break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member will know that 
there was $7 billion in tax relief in the last budget.  The 
member will know that when we took over government in 1993 the 
inherited deficit left by Mulroney's Conservative Party was $42 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will know that our finance minister recently 
announced a debt reduction of $3.5 billion in addition to the 
fact that debt instruments totalling $9 billion were not renewed 
by the government.  The member will know in his heart but he will 
not admit it that the government has started the country on the 
road to tax relief from which farmers will benefit far more than 
the nonsense being proliferated by the Reform Party. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is really odd that the member attacks us for what he 
calls nonsense and yet the people by and large on this side who 
are speaking are farmers, people who have lived their lives on 
the farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member figures he can speak about the issue because he 
once picked rocks on Uncle Ted's farm.  If he wants to talk about 
hypocrisy, I will tell the member about hypocrisy.  Hypocrisy is 
making the deep cuts as was done by the government and then 
holding itself up as the great defender of not only agriculture 
but health care and every other social program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw the member's attention to the fact that the Reform Party 
said it would repriorize programs in agriculture and develop a 
program called the trade distortion adjustment program.  Has the 
hon. member ever heard of that?  That is what we said we would 
have done five years ago.  Had the Liberals done it, our farmers 
would not be in this mess today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I give the member a 
point.  Picking rocks on Uncle Ted's farm certainly does not 
qualify me to be a farmer, and I do not pretend to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being elected to a national parliament requires dealing with all 
kinds of different issues.  I have never worked in a mine and yet 
I am very concerned about the mining industry in the province of 
Ontario.  I have never worked in a steel plant, although my 
father, my uncle and cousins did, but I am very concerned about 
the impact of downloading and the pricing problem in the steel 
industry.  I have never worked in the fisheries.  Does that mean 
as a nationally elected politician I should have no concern for 
Canadians in Atlantic Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have never worked on an active farm.  I admit that but it has 
nothing to do with it.  The point is the hypocrisy I am pointing 
out in that party. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the government went into the 1993 election and into the 
1997 election and never told the Canadian public what it would 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It ended up gutting health care.  It gutted education funding. 
It hit the Canadian Coast Guard in Manitoba.  Icebreaker fees are 
rising. 
The other day the government gave $500,000 to professional hockey 
in Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all on record.  The government's record of slashing, 
burning and cutting into Canadians' economic well-being is well 
documented.  Every Canadian knows what it is.  I ask the member 
to list for us the dollar figure of the total cuts that have 
happened since the 1995 budget.  How much was cut out of these 
departments by the hon. member's government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will give the hon. 
member one list.  There was a $42 billion deficit which was 
eliminated by this government.  That is clear.  I will give him 
another point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is looking for quick fixes with this motion. 
In fact in the short term NISA holds about $2.5 billion that 
Canadian farmers can access.  This represents an annual 
contribution of $600 million by the federal government, $400 
million by the provinces and $600 million by farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The record is clear.  This government stands ready to support 
small business, fishermen, miners, steelworkers.  Absolutely we 
will support farmers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>   Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this motion. 
Actually I did not think I would get the opportunity to speak 
because there are so many people who want to address this very 
important debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an important debate for Canadians all across the land. 
Farmers from coast to coast have been experiencing ongoing 
difficulties in meeting the bottom line and putting food on the 
table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of my colleagues have spoken very, very eloquently 
today.  Despite the absolute rubbish that has come from a few of 
the members, and I add that it is only a few, there are some hon. 
members across the way who actually tried to sincerely address 
the debate today.  I appreciate that and I am sure farmers 
watching the debate today appreciate that. But members such as 
the one who just spoke do a great disservice to this place and 
certainly to farmers out in the real world who are watching the 
debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak briefly because, with the unanimous consent of the 
House, I would like to give one of my colleagues the opportunity 
to speak in this very brief time slot.  My hon. colleague from 
Blackstrap would like to address the House. I would like to take 
perhaps five minutes of the 10 that is remaining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The member for 
Prince George—Peace River has requested that his 10-minute slot 
be split into two fives with corresponding questions and 
comments.  Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Prince George—Peace River has three and a half minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, while I certainly appreciate 
the consent of all members who are in the Chamber at this time, I 
will say it is very, very difficult to address this issue in 30 
minutes let alone three and a half minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make one brief point on behalf of the producers of 
Prince George—Peace River, the riding which I am always pleased 
and honoured to represent in this Chamber. Most members present 
today have heard me speak over the past two years about the 
difficulties faced by the farmers of the Peace River country, not 
just the B.C. Peace River region, but also that part of the 
extended prairies known as the Alberta Peace River region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had two years of disastrous weather leading up to this. 
Farmers struggled very hard and valiantly to try to bring in a 
reduced crop in the past two years.  The vast majority of the 
crop for those two years was left out in the fields.  It was an 
absolute—I cannot say a disaster any more than I have already 
said it.  Farmers were faced with this crisis. A lot of farmers 
could not meet commitments and pay their bills. Governments both 
at the provincial level in British Columbia as well as the 
federal level were very slow to react to the disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year should have been a great year for the Peace River 
country.  We had good growing conditions for the first time in 
three years.  Farmers produced an abundance, a great crop, 
particularly in its quality, although the quantity was not what 
they had hoped for.  The majority of the wheat was number one 
high protein, which is not often seen that far north. It is a 
credit to the farmers themselves that they produced such a great 
crop. But it was a disastrous year for prices.  Members have 
addressed that quite well today.

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak on behalf of those farmers.  We should try and 
put ourselves in their place. They finally had a year where they 
hoped they could put a little bit of money into NISA and into 
these other accounts and pay down some of their bills that had 
been accumulating over the past two years when despite their most 
valiant efforts they could not bring the crop in.  They finally 
had a year where they produced a crop and the price has gone into 
the tank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said a few moments ago, this government should have shown a 
little bit of foresight and should have reacted when it became 
government some five years ago.  It should have done what we had 
suggested. One of the suggestions was to reduce programs down to 
a few and prioritize them in order to help farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the programs we said should be put in place was a trade 
distortion adjustment program to protect farmers from exactly 
what is occurring today, against unfair subsidization in Europe 
and the United States, our biggest trading competitors.  Then our 
farmers would have been protected and there would not have been 
the need for this debate today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to ask a very simple question of the hon. member who just spoke 
about his concern for the farmers in the Peace River district. 
Does he know how many of the farmers in his riding opened NISA 
accounts?  We are saying NISA should at least be a help in times 
as he is describing.  If so, how many of those farmers did access 
their NISA accounts? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question that 
was put forward. The reality is that a great many of those 
producers are enrolled in NISA.  I myself have farmed in the 
neighbourhood of 20 years in the Peace River country.  My brother 
and I were enrolled in NISA and he continues that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When farmers do not have any crop, when they cannot harvest 
their crop, when their land is a quagmire and there is nothing 
there to harvest, they do not have any money to contribute to 
their accounts.  That is the sad part about NISA, especially for 
a region like the Peace River country that has experienced 
natural disasters for two years back to back. There was no money 
to go into the accounts to build up for a rainy day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the farmers' best efforts, we have a situation where 
because of what foreign countries are doing in subsidizing their 
farmers, the price has plummeted.  Farmers are looking at 
breaking even at the very best and probably a loss for the third 
year in a row.  This year the loss is caused by price rather than 
by yield. 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank my colleague from Peace River for allowing me to 
have these few minutes to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today some members have said that they take great pleasure in 
standing to address this issue.  I take no pleasure in addressing 
this issue.  This debate should not have had to take place in 
this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to pick up on a point that my colleague from Peace River 
made a few minutes ago and which others made before him.  They 
talked about what happened in 1993 when the Liberal government 
was first elected.  Had the government at that time taken some of 
the advice that we had laid before the House on a program called 
TDAP, we would not necessarily have been in great shape and the 
crisis before us today may still have been there but not to the 
degree that it is. But time and time again over the last five 
years I have looked across the way and I have seen lawyers from 
downtown Toronto and downtown Winnipeg telling farmers from 
Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and northern British Columbia how 
to farm.  That is indeed the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a serious problem.  I want to recount very quickly about 
what two people whom I have talked to in the last few days are 
doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One is a person about my age, a good friend of mine, who is a 
good farmer and has been a good farmer for many years.  As we 
speak he is working on a potato farm in Outlook, Saskatchewan 
digging potatoes with a spade to make an extra buck to help pay 
his bills.  That is how serious the problem is.  It is not fun. 
It is not nice.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked to another good friend of mine who is a good farmer. In 
fact he is a Liberal supporter quite clearly and openly and he 
still happens to be a good friend of mine.  He said that he is 
going to quit the business because he is no longer prepared to 
take money out of his equity to keep farming.  He is a good 
farmer.  He is a great manager.  He is one of the most optimistic 
people I know yet he is going to walk away from farming because 
of this problem.  That is how serious the problem is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has done nothing in the last five years for a 
long term approach, to make long term changes, so that these 
problems do not happen again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point in standing was to illustrate how serious the issue is. 
I want to illustrate that nothing has been done.  We look at 
what the long term solution should be or could be.  Yes, we 
should still continue to work on a long term solution to the 
income crisis of farmers because this happens from time to time 
over and over again.  This will not be the last time.  There will 
be more down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the government to look at a long term solution.  I 
encourage the government to finally listen, to pay heed to not 
only our party but to other parties in this House and other 
groups that may have possible solutions. I would also have to ask 
this government to look at possible short term solutions.  After 
all, the crunch will come between now and next April when farmers 
will not be able to put in their crops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked about two farmers whom I know personally who are on the 
edge of quitting a business and an industry that they love 
because they cannot make a dollar at it.  They have done their 
share over the last few years.  They have diversified.  They have 
changed their way of farming in order to be economically 
feasible.  These farmers have done their share. The government 
has not done its share. 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have said a 
number of times today that yes, I agree this is a serious issue. 
I will try again to get some specifics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that when the farm community was called upon to 
increase exports and hit the targeted exports, it did that. 
Farmers hit the targeted exports.  When the farmers did that they 
assisted Canada in terms of meeting its balance of trade issues. 
They drew foreign dollars into the country and did a lot for 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there comes a time when Canada has to stand by its farm 
community in terms of this crisis.  That is true.  But I thought 
the purpose of the debate and the motion today was for the Reform 
Party to put forward some specifics that the minister could deal 
with at his meeting tomorrow and that the government in general 
could deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask again.  I have heard no specifics from the Reform Party— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The hon. member for 
Blackstrap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Allan Kerpan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am shocked.  That was 
the point of my whole speech.  We put forward specifics for five 
years.  When was the last time the government paid any attention 
or listened to what we had to say? I would be happy to sit down 
with the government but there has never been one solid concrete 
suggestion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals must remember that they are the government.  They 
are the ones who make the decisions.  They are the ones who are 
failing the farmers, not our party. I would remind the party 
across the way that if they truly want the farm industry not only 
in western Canada but right across the country to continue, they 
must do something.  It is on their shoulders.  It is their 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It being 5.30 p.m., 
it is my duty to inform the House that proceedings on the motion 
have expired.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CONCENTRATION OF PRINT MEDIA IN CANADA 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK257">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK258"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.)</B> moved: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
consider the advisability of establishing a commission of inquiry 
to examine the concentration of print media in Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, we are here today to discuss the issue of 
the concentration of ownership in Canada's media.  This is an 
issue that has become very important to many Canadians. Ownership 
concentration, in my opinion, needs to be examined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who has read the newspaper, watched the news or listened 
to radio in the last year, knows that this is an issue of debate 
that has been around for a long time.  This has recently taken on 
new dimensions. Canadians have started to ask themselves whether 
we should worry about this once more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fundamental question and the questions revolving around this 
matter are whether Canada's media ownership is in the hands of 
too few people.  Furthermore, does the concentration of media 
ownership present a true dilemma relative to the amount of 
influence that these owners have on what is published or 
broadcast? If so, I would therefore recommend that the government 
study this issue further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not necessarily asking for a commission of inquiry.  Rather 
I am interested in what my colleagues in this House have to say 
about this matter. Let us take a look at these questions before 
going on any further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's media is comprised of many facets, including radio, 
television, print and electronic through the Internet. Each 
medium reaches a wide number of Canadians and is a large part of 
many of our lives.  Few are the Canadians who do not read the 
newspaper, watch television or listen to radio every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a daily basis the citizens of this country are bombarded by 
information about the goings on around Canada and around the 
world.  But one has to ask whether they are receiving a balanced 
presentation of the news. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taking a look more particularly at the concentration of 
ownership in Canada's newspapers, we realize how concrete this 
issue really is.  Ownership of the newspapers of our nation has 
been a target of much discussion over many years but has become 
an even more intense debate recently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First let us examine a few facts revolving around Canada's 
newspapers.  The three biggest newspaper chains in Canada are in 
charge of 72% of all the circulation of daily papers. This in 
itself demonstrates concentration of ownership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more impressive is that two out of these three chains 
are owned and run in essence by the same person.  Hollinger Inc., 
through its owner Conrad Black, owns 27 of Canada's newspapers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In July of 1997 Hollinger secured a large portion of Southam 
Inc., Canada's largest chain owning 34 papers.  Now 58.6% of 
Southam is under the control of Hollinger and of Conrad Black. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Together these two companies control almost 60% of Canada's 
newspapers and approximately 42% of the country's circulation. 
They own all the daily newspapers in Prince Edward Island, 
Saskatchewan and Newfoundland, as well as 14 out of British 
Columbia's 16 dailies.  In addition, they control papers in every 
provincial capital except for Winnipeg, Toronto and Quebec City. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have demonstrated, Canada's print media is controlled in 
big part by one company, Hollinger Inc., and by one person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another very influential newspaper company in Canada is Torstar 
Corporation which owns 100% of the Toronto <I>Star</I>, the 
country's single largest newspaper in terms of circulation. This 
corporation is another example of a company securing quite a 
large portion of ownership and circulation in Canada's media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just last week Torstar Corporation announced plans to stage a 
hostile takeover of Sun Media Corporation.  Together these two 
conglomerates would control a total of 26% of Canada's daily 
newspaper circulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area of concentration is cross ownership of newspapers, 
radio, television, news services and web sites.  But the question 
remains on the issue of influence. We can easily say that the 
majority of Canada's newspapers are in the hands of a few people, 
but is it too concentrated? 
Are there too few people at the helm of Canada's media? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1815"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT93"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT93"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1815
<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT92"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To really know if it is overconcentrated we must look at the 
integrity of the papers themselves.  Are they presenting a 
balanced approach to the news?  Are the facts being put out in an 
objective standpoint way?  Do Canadians in all market areas have 
access to differing points of view? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides the danger that might exist in very few companies having 
too much influence on the papers, another danger might arise. 
While it is said that publishers might not directly control 
policy at each paper, certainly those in charge are conscious of 
what publishers like and expect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do they, for example, follow their own personal standards and 
guidelines or do they try to please the person who signs their 
paycheques?  With the number of papers within one publisher's 
control the chances are fairly good that some papers' editors do 
not always work in a totally unbiased state of mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand the publisher of the Southam owned Victoria 
<I>Times Columnist</I> insists that he does not feel any pressure 
to go one way or another on issues.  The mission for him, he 
says, is to get in touch with the community's agenda and not the 
publisher's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would not necessarily be that a newspaper would neglect or 
falsify information, but certainly they might put emphasis on 
certain facts more than others.  Any editorials may present 
opinions following a publisher's philosophy or political point of 
view.  As we can see, although a publisher might not be in 
complete control of what is printed, those who are in charge of 
content could be easily persuaded or inclined to undertake 
methods to make their publisher happy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us inspect yet another aspect that adds to the ramifications 
of the debate.  As it was officially announced earlier on this 
year, Hollinger Incorporated launched just a week ago the first 
edition of <I>National Post</I>.  This new paper is competing 
against the Toronto <I>Star</I>, Canada's most read newspaper, and 
the <I>Globe and Mail</I>, the only other paper that claims to be 
national. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the paper is to be successful it may take readers from the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I> and the Toronto <I>Star</I>, particularly in 
the important Toronto market.  If the <I>National Post</I> ends up 
taking many readers from the aforementioned papers, not only will 
they suffer but there will be greater concentration and obviously 
less competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada in the past has taken a closer look at 
media ownership.  In 1970 Keith Davey and others studied media 
issues, one of which was the concentration of media ownership. 
The three biggest chains controlled 45% of daily circulation at 
that time in comparison to the 72% that the three largest chains 
now own.  This study led to the creation of the Royal Commission 
on Newspapers 10 years later.  This commission was formed after 
Southam closed its Winnipeg <I>Tribune</I> and after Thomson shut 
down the Ottawa <I>Journal</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tom Kent, commissioner of this organization in the 1980s had 
suggested restricting the number of papers that any one company 
could own.  His recommendations were soundly rejected by the 
industry, an industry that has consistently rejected government 
intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our federal government to this day has never implemented any 
regulations in this matter and that in essence is the foundation 
of this private member's motion.  I am asking other members and 
Canadians in general for their opinions on the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we as Canadians need to worry about media concentration? 
Should we be implementing legislation to regulate ownership of 
the media or are the present mechanisms in place all that is in 
fact needed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a related note, the Canadian public has expressed concern 
with the matter of bank mergers which would give the so-called 
megabanks too much power and control.  I would argue, as have 
others, that the issue of newspaper ownership is at least as 
important as the subject of bank mergers.  Should we not then be 
examining the issue of media ownership in the same light? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have already mentioned, there exists at present no law 
restrictions in Canada on how many newspapers one company can 
own.  Some have argued that we should be more concerned about 
media ownership since it is more important to democracy than any 
other industry.  It plays a powerful role in shaping our nation's 
public opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently major players in the newspaper industry expressed 
reason for concern over the increasing concentration of newspaper 
ownership.  Paul Godfrey, chairman of Sun Media, last May was 
quoted as saying it was wrong for the newspaper industry to be in 
few hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>John Honderich, publisher of the Toronto <I>Star</I>, made 
observations earlier this year when Southam bought six British 
Columbia newspapers from Thomson Corporation. 
He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can't remember a time when so much has been dominated by one 
chain.  What is enough?  Is this level of circulation too much? 
Should it be allowed? 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to ask who should answer these questions and went on 
to suggest that Ottawa should intervene.  As Mr. Honderich said, 
“I don't think it can be the industry itself or the people we 
appoint”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will end with that question.  It is important at the very 
least to explore this potential problem.  We might realize that 
the media are in no way influenced by ownership concentration. On 
the other hand we might find that they are and that information 
presented is not balanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the very least it is our duty as Canadians and as members of 
the House of Commons to examine and discuss this matter.  It is 
important that we do so in a manner consistent with the values, 
the institutions and traditions of all of us as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps all we can do at this time is simply to monitor the 
situation.  There may come a time when other action is required. 
I look forward to hearing what my colleagues in the House have to 
say on this important issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK259"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise on Motion No. 423 as the chief 
opposition critic for industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who have just joined the debate and for those watching 
the proceedings on television, the motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
consider the advisability of establishing a commission of inquiry 
to examine the concentration of print media in Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is certainly timely as we are all aware of the 
Southam launch of the <I>National Post</I> just days ago, a 
national paper which includes within its pages the former 
<I>Financial Post</I>.  We are also aware of the impending 
<I>Toronto Star</I> takeover of the Sun Media Corporation, a 
merger that will give Torstar 26% of the total weekly circulation 
of daily newspapers in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I compliment the hon. member for Waterloo—Wellington for the 
impeccable timing of the motion.  On the issue of timing I only 
hope for his sake that he owns a large block of Sun Media stock 
since it went up over 60% as a result of the takeover bid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make this remark in good humour, but there is an important 
point in all of this.  The success of these private businesses, 
the profits they make, are disbursed among literally thousands of 
shareholders.  Many of these people are average hard working, 
overtaxed Canadians investing in mutual funds for their 
retirements because the government messed up their pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be known that all Canadians benefit from profitable 
industries.  We should not be concerned when businesses make 
decisions to enhance their profits.  I would be pretty worried if 
businesses stopped concerning themselves with profits as this 
would destroy the Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first message as it applies to the motion is that we need not 
be concerned about those in the print media industry merging to 
improve their economies of scale and their bottom lines.  We need 
not be concerned with the impact this may have on consumer 
choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the interests of consumers are concerned it should be 
appreciated that companies become profitable and remain 
profitable by offering consumers quality goods and services at a 
low price.  They make money only when they serve the interests of 
their consumers.  The better they serve, the richer they become. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When companies work against the interests of consumers they lose 
money because they lose market share.  Therefore the free market 
is the best corrective mechanism by which to address any alleged 
market coercion or manipulation.  Furthermore, the House cannot 
support both property rights and free enterprise while proposing 
to create a government body that would have the power and the 
mandate to prevent companies from exercising their property 
rights freely through voluntary exchange.  The motion is an 
attack on free enterprise and on property rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When speaking to Bill C-20 in the House some time ago I brought 
my concerns regarding the Competition Act to the attention of my 
colleagues.  I share those concerns again so that members of the 
House can understand why those who understand and respect the 
workings of the free market cannot support the motion.

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Competition Act rests on the assumption that the government 
can meddle and regulate its way into a free market.  In his 
recently published book entitled <I>The Myths of Antitrust</I>, 
author Armentano wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Trades of private property are either voluntary or they are not; 
one cannot legislate the free market or create competition.  To 
have a free market the government must leave the markets alone; 
to have the state make markets “free” is again a contradiction 
in terms. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also reminded of Nobel prize winning economist Dr. 
Friedman, who wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A monopoly can seldom be established within a country without 
overt and covert government assistance in the form of a tariff or 
some other device. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect, competition and free enterprise are concepts that 
are not properly understood by my colleague from 
Waterloo-Wellington.  The number of companies providing a product 
or service is not a reliable indicator as to the competitiveness 
of the market.  The key to ensuing competition is removing the 
barriers to access and entry into the market and into that 
segment of the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I add at this point that the television industry should be the 
focus of our attention.  The CRTC acts as a barrier to 
competition.  As long as no such regulatory body encroaches on 
the print media industry, we need not be concerned with 
concentration of the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we can learn a lesson from the banking industry that 
might help my colleagues understand why the motion must be 
rejected.  The government has created an environment in Canada 
that has encouraged the creation of a banking oligarchy.  Instead 
of deregulating the banking industry to allow for competition, it 
meddles further into the banking industry with foreign ownership 
restrictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canadian small businesses cannot get adequate financing for 
new innovations, they justify the need to create another 
government program called the Small Business Loans Act.  We can 
see how one government intervention leads to many more until we 
are so far removed from the free market that we cannot begin to 
understand the potential for market based solutions to public 
policy problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Competition legislation is nothing but a bundle of 
contradictions.  The entire purpose of being in business is to 
drive competitors out of business.  Every entrepreneur wants to 
capture more and more of the market share by providing a better 
product at a better price than his competitor.  This is called 
anti-competitive pricing and dumping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Entrepreneurs eager to obey the government should not try to 
outdo their competitors by providing consumers a better price. 
They should keep their prices and services at the same levels as 
those of their competitors.  That too is against the rules.  It 
is called collusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Entrepreneurs should raise their prices far above their 
competitors so that they are not guilty of anti-competitive 
pricing or collusion.  Wrong again.  This is called price 
gouging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our competition laws are an unenforceable mess of 
contradictions.  If members of the House give these laws some 
honest consideration, they too will come to this conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party believes that the creation of wealth and 
productive jobs for Canadians is best achieved through the 
operations of a responsible, broadly based free enterprise system 
in which private property, freedom of contract and the operation 
of the free market are encouraged and respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Economic competition and the resulting prosperity that will come 
from it are the results of a deregulated market and cannot be 
achieved by government intervention.  As the critic for industry 
I will work with the private sector to identify and remove the 
barriers to entry that may be limiting competition.  However I 
will not allow the government to use its power to further meddle 
into the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude my remarks by asking members of the House to give 
some thought to all the benefits a vibrant and free economy has 
given to Canadians.  I would like members of the House to look 
beyond big government solutions to public policy problems and to 
start working with the private sector to create laws and 
regulations in Canada that will bring us prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once we all come to understand the importance of economic 
freedom, we will also come to understand why we should not be 
concerned with print media concentration in Canada.

consider the advisability of establishing a commission of 
inquiry to examine the concentration of print media in Canada. 
</UL>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is in total agreement with the members of 
this House who are wondering about the reduction in sources of 
information and the concentration of the ownership of newspapers 
in the hands of a few magnates.  It also feels that this 
situation represents a threat to freedom of expression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, two commissions of inquiry have already examined the 
issue: the Kent commission in the early 1980s and the Davey 
commission in the 1970s.  None of the recommendations of these 
two commissions was ever implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission, which published its report in 1981, was tasked 
with examining the decreasing competition between dailies, that 
is the disappearance of newspapers within a market, and the 
increased concentration of ownership in the industry within the 
hands of a few people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was also asked to examine the growing trend among newspapers 
to belong to chains, a trend which has increasingly taken hold. 
The commission was also asked to indicate the effect on services 
offered by the print media to the public, and to make 
recommendations if it saw fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This commission made recommendations on such matters as the 
acceptable level of ownership of newspapers in a particular 
market, the process of divestment of newspapers, measures to 
ensure editorial independence from a newspaper's owners, and the 
adoption of a national newspapers act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Library of Parliament study examined the Kent Commission's 
recommendations with a view to determining the areas of 
jurisdiction involved.  The study concluded that, under the 
division of powers set out sections 92(13) and 92(16) of the 
Constitution Act, 1867, a large number of the Kent Commission's 
recommendations fell within provincial areas of jurisdiction. 
These sections recognize that property, trade and civil rights 
are provincial matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus it was that in Quebec, for instance, an order in council 
was passed by the government on July 13, 1988 after an agreement 
was reached with Hollinger and Groupe Unimédia to structure the 
future sale of Quebec City's <I>Le Soleil</I> and Chicoutimi's <I>Le 
Quotidien</I>, so that Quebec buyers would have a chance to become 
owners of Quebec newspapers, while maintaining the plurality of 
ownership of dailies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concentration of print media is a greater concern today, 
however, than it was when the Kent Commission was created.  In 
1970, in English Canada, the three major newspaper chains 
controlled 60% of the circulation of dailies.  In 1980, this had 
increased to 75%.  Today, through Hollinger and Southam, Conrad 
Black controls 61 of the 105 dailies in Canada, or approximately 
60% of the circulation of newspapers in English Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is opposed to the creation of a commission of 
inquiry because it is not at all convinced that this is the 
right way to go about correcting the problem.  The Davey and 
Kent commissions did their work at a time when the situation was 
much less alarming than it is today, and their recommendations 
were not followed up, primarily because of the issue of 
jurisdiction and legal precedents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to note that Canada's three most recent 
commissions of inquiry cost taxpayers a fortune, and their 
findings were not worth the money spent, with the possible 
exception of the Erasmus-Dussault commission on aboriginal 
peoples, although the final bill was $50 million.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Létourneau inquiry into the events in Somalia cost 
approximately $12 million, not to mention the expenses of the 
Department of National Defence and the legal expenses of other 
parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Krever commission, which left hundreds of thousands of 
people dissatisfied and not even entitled to a small amount of 
compensation, ran up a bill of some $15 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It looks to the Bloc Quebecois as though the government is 
soothing its conscience by creating commissions, by giving the 
public the impression that it is looking after real problems, 
while spending millions on commissions whose reports are shelved 
and never followed up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the Bloc Quebecois is concerned that ownership of 
almost 60% of Canada's newspapers is concentrated in the hands 
of Conrad Black, a man famous for interfering in his newspapers, 
a man who does not hesitate to hire staff who share his views 
and to quickly get rid of anyone who disagrees with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is concerned that the majority of Canadian 
newspapers are owned by a man who says that Trudeau is mistaken 
when he compares today's Quebec with the Quebec of Duplessis' 
time.  He put it this way: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unwise for Trudeau to muddy the waters, diluting his attack 
on the bigotry and the undemocratic impulses of the separatists. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This appeared in the <I>Ottawa Citizen</I> on Friday, October 9.  Dear 
Mr. Black also said: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Radio-Canada is a separatist propaganda agency and it has been 
for 30 years and operating courtesy of and to considerable 
expense of the taxpayers of Canada. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That man who has no respect for Quebec's language 
legislation, which was passed democratically and which 
recognizes the rights of the minority, as the Council of Europe 
so eloquently pointed out.  That man who favours partition 
and used his Montreal newspaper to spread his own views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Various voices have been raised against the concentration of 
print media, including our own.  But we have a great deal of 
difficulty accepting the idea of creating a commission.  We are 
concerned by the apparent unanimity in English Canada regarding 
how the sovereignist cause should be treated by the media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, all the independent studies, those done by independent 
researchers—be it the Fraser Institute or Denis Monière or even 
the CBC ombudsman—indicate that the anglophone media, both 
electronic and print, are not objective in their treatment of 
the Quebec issue and present it negatively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe a lot needs to be done in Canadian newspapers to 
ensure the public is well informed.  We also think it is 
important not to exaggerate the concentration of print media. 
We would like a longer debate to find a way to prevent this sort 
of thing. A commission of inquiry, however, does not seem to be 
the solution.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak to Motion No. M-423 which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
consider the advisability of establishing a commission of inquiry 
to examine the concentration of print media in Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must start by registering a regret.  My regret is that this 
motion does not go far enough.  It does not go past the 
discussion stage to the action stage, to the legislation stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I for one, and I speak for the New Democratic Party, believe 
that we need media concentration legislation in this country now 
and that we needed it 20 years ago.  Media concentration has been 
studied and studied.  I have two studies here in front of me 
which I will refer to momentarily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To show how long media concentration has been debated in this

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tommy Douglas rose to ask Pierre Trudeau about the three volume, 
1117 page study which was the Senate special committee on mass 
media report, sometimes called the Davie report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of the findings of this committee that the profits earned 
by media corporations, that is by broadcasters and publishers, 
are, in their words, extraordinary and astonishing, and in view 
of the evidence of the growing concentration of power in the 
hands of fewer and fewer media corporations, what actions does 
the government propose to take? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While <I>Hansard</I> does not record gestures, the answer was an 
obvious shrug. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals in the Senate spent over two years studying 
corporate concentration in the media.  They discovered it was a 
problem requiring government action.  The Liberal response was do 
nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1980 another study was launched by the Liberals, the Kent 
commission, this time in response to the simultaneous shutdown of 
the Ottawa <I>Journal</I> and the Winnipeg <I>Tribune</I>, wiping 
out over 185 years of journalist tradition in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This eloquent report starts with a quote from a judgment of the 
Supreme Court of the United States: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Freedom of the press from government interference does not 
sanction repression of that freedom by private interests. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The royal commission on newspapers reported in 1981 and, 
surprise, media concentration is a problem requiring government 
action, not more studies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically, the Kent commission called for halts to further 
concentration, with limited divestment relating to cross 
ownership in different medias and the divestment of the <I>Globe 
and Mail</I> from Thomson.  It said that a newspaper owner should 
either be national or local. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another key set of recommendations in the Kent report was 
designed to protect the editorial independence of the newsroom 
from the interference of the boardroom through the use of an 
independent board to hire the editor of the local paper and the 
establishment of a central press panel which would oversee the 
independence of the newsroom.  The government response at the 
time, a Liberal government headed by Pierre Trudeau, was a little 
more encouraging.  It flew trial balloons in the form of a draft 
bill on the watered down press council with limited divestment. 
Then it blew the balloons out of the water and did nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worth noting that the minister who tried to do something 
about this, James Fleming, was removed from cabinet.  He then 
tried to have a private member's bill pass on the same topic.  It 
was a bill that was strongly opposed by his Liberal colleagues. I 
notice a pattern of behaviour here.  Liberals study and then 
Liberals do nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem of corporate concentration in the media is in 
crisis.  Conrad Black, the <I>Star</I> fighting for the <I>Sun</I>, 
Global and Shaw carving up WIC, these events will continue to 
escalate unless the government acts now.  Unless the government 
does something now and unless the government makes a real 
commitment to protect Canadian media at upcoming trade talks, 
Canada can expect to see the eventual takeover of media giants 
like Baton and Global by American giants like NBC and CBS. We 
need government action now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where do we start?  I spoke to Tom Kent in recent weeks.  When 
he wrote his report 34% of the daily newspapers were in the hands 
of one chain.  With the launch of the <I>National Post</I> Conrad 
Black now owns about 55% of Canadian dailies.  Given that, I 
asked Tom Kent what recommendations from his report were still 
doable given the rise of Conrad Black and since then the 
<I>Star</I> wars in Toronto.  Mr. Kent felt that the future he 
predicted had come to pass and therefore the divestment options 
are probably not available.  He strongly felt that the setting up 
of independent committees in the newsrooms to protect the paper 
from boardroom interference was still doable but also more 
important than ever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also spoke with people who know the media business like Gail 
Lem, a former journalist and now an organizer for the 
communications workers, and David Robinson from the Canadian 
Centre for Policy Alternatives.  It is clear that there are 
things that the government must do now to control the situation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government can and should ban newspaper owners from owning 
broadcasting corporations.  The government should also ban any 
further concentration and cross ownership dealing with the weekly 
newspaper sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government can implement the sections of the Kent commission 
dealing with the press rights panel and the newspaper advisory 
committees for all daily newspapers.  This does not cause 
government interference.  It protects editorial independence of 
content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government can place controls on the foreign ownership of 
all media companies in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must re-fund the CBC so that Canadians have a 
strong independent standard voice across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government can and must encourage community organizations of 
all types to participate and buy their local weekly papers, 
stopping the massive concentration of weekly chains and making 
weeklies truly community papers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government can instruct the CRTC to force cable stations to 
have a higher level of standard, community run programming on its 
community channels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CRTC, as part of the current exercise it is conducting, 
should also be asked to advise the government on controls which 
may be placed on the cross ownership of media corporations as 
they relate to the new medias which are emerging daily on our 
computer screens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I regret that I will not be able to support 
Motion M-423 because it falls far short of what is required now. 
I believe that the member moving this motion is sincere and 
concerned.  I also think Canadians are concerned about media 
concentration. We all want a free press.  We all know, almost 
instinctively, that having the ownership of the press in a very 
few hands threatens freedom of the press. What we need now 
however is not more study but action. 
<P><A NAME="LINK262"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to rise today and address Motion M-423, a motion which 
proposes: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
consider the advisability of establishing a commission of inquiry 
to examine the concentration of print media in Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The timing of this motion could not possibly have been scheduled 
at a more appropriate moment.  Who would have thought that on the 
eve of the debate of this motion we would see a blockbuster 
takeover attempt such as that of the Toronto <I>Star</I> versus 
Sun Media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a little hard to believe that it was merely five months 
ago that Torstar was calling for just the type of probe that this 
motion is seeking.  Of course when this motion was introduced, I 
very much doubt that the hon. member for Waterloo—Wellington was 
targeting his party's friends at the Toronto <I>Star</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, this motion is being made so that the Liberal Party, which 
has never shied away from big brother style interference in the 
marketplace, could effectively interfere in the operation of 
Hollinger Company.  Make no mistake.  Today we are not debating 
the inherent problems of dominant position within the print 
media. This could not possibly be the discussion for we already 
have an effective Competition Act to handle just such an issue. 
In essence, what we are really discussing is just how far 
government should go in its interference with private industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to say that if we were capable of setting aside our 
principles, it would be moderately seductive to entertain this 
motion.  I would like to assure the hon. member that as a 
Conservative, I do not relish the potential future of the print 
media situation in the greater Toronto area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Already I can envision a scenario on the eve of the next federal 
election.  The Liberal mouthpiece Toronto <I>Star</I> headline 
will read “GST, free trade and helicopters aside, this time we 
really believe them”, and across town the Toronto <I>Sun</I> 
headline will read “Ditto”.  It is enough to send shivers up 
your spine but it is not enough to warrant interference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us examine the Torstar proposal on its merits.  On October 
28 Torstar offered $16 per share for all of the common shares of 
Sun Media Corporation on a fully diluted basis.  The question 
becomes, is this is a good and fair offer? Indeed that is the 
question, however it is not for the Government of Canada to 
answer.  It is instead up to the shareholders of Sun Media to 
decide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps a 62% premium over the closing price last Wednesday is a 
very good deal.  Perhaps it is not.  Once again it is not for us 
to decide.  Large and small investors will make this decision 
alike, including the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, Trimark 
Mutual Funds, Talvest Mutual Funds and others.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not to say that every merger that gets dreamed up in the 
minds of deal makers should remain outside the scope of 
inspection, not at all.  But this is where I come back to the 
Competition Bureau and the Competition Act which my party 
implemented in 1986. The Competition Bureau has been given the 
necessary tools to complete this task so let it do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Print media is not a new media form, unlike the Internet 
explosion.  This House would certainly have taken print media 
into consideration when it crafted this act just over a decade 
ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems we may very well be debating nostalgia today.  The 
world we are living in has changed dramatically in the ways in 
which information is delivered.  No longer are newspapers merely 
competing against a few radio stations and a couple of television 
networks.  Instead news is now available on different networks 24 
hours a day.  The Internet is available 24 hours a day.  This has 
forced the print media industry to re-evaluate its own 
efficiencies and competitive advantages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far from being an industry that is fading away, we have 
witnessed a rebirth in this nation.  Canadians now boast two 
national newspapers that must be included in the competitive mix 
of every market in the country.  Canadians in general have become 
news junkies as they read more, tune in more and surf more. Our 
media outlets, already among the most scrutinized in the world, 
thanks to the work of the CRTC have grabbed hold of the 
information age and in many ways lead the revolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My background is not in competition law but we should take a 
moment and review what we are looking at in terms of level of 
competition.  I am certain my hon. colleagues in this House have 
all seen the breakdown of print media numbers as a percentage of 
circulation.  According to those numbers, if this deal goes 
through, the Toronto <I>Star</I> parent company will control 
approximately 26% of the print media circulation. However, it is 
unfair to base any review simply on circulation. Should it not be 
reviewed as a percentage of holdings versus all other media 
outlets including broadcast and the Internet? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One phenomenon that has long existed in Canada is the 
acceptability of monopoly markets as it pertains to the newspaper 
industry. Historically we have learned that it is not reasonable 
to expect there to be more than one newspaper in our smaller 
market cities.  In fact the 1970s saw the consolidation of 
outlets across the country.  It was reasoned that the result was 
an acceptable level of competition due to the existence of 
non-print competitors as well as the reality of market forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I understand that my colleagues in the Liberal Party are 
loath to accept market forces at any time when they think they 
can get in and start interfering.  However, there is nothing that 
can be done by legislators to increase demand.  I trust this will 
not discourage those would be manipulators into believing that 
our media marketplace is not vibrant.  In fact quite the opposite 
situation exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look back to 1971 and the demise of the old Toronto 
<I>Telegram</I>, it became apparent that a void existed.  A group 
of 60 displaced workers and $650,000 led to the formation of the 
Toronto <I>Sun</I>.  This is not something that could have been 
addressed by parliament.  Instead what was needed was a passion 
for the industry, proper financing and a void in the marketplace. 
Basic market forces and a group of entrepreneurs filled that 
void. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 27 years since then, the marketplace has changed 
dramatically.  The Southam chain is now under new ownership, the 
once mighty Thomson chain is substantially smaller, and the 
Ottawa market's second largest newspaper will turn 10 years old 
this Saturday.  I use these examples to illustrate my point that 
the print media industry is a dynamic one, yet some remain 
unconvinced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a constituency out there that was addressed by the 
publisher of the Toronto <I>Star</I>, John Honderich, when he 
called for a royal commission five months ago. The member for 
Waterloo—Wellington responded to this challenge. I am not 
convinced that the gentleman who started this ball rolling would 
still be enthusiastically supportive of it today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the fears that are inherent in this motion.  They 
stem from the basic reality that newspapers are not widgets. 
Newspapers go to the heart and soul of communities.  Newspapers 
often fuel fundamental debate in this country.  It is because of 
these factors that the marketplace will not tolerate uniformity. 
It will not accept uniformity of thought, nor will it accept 
uniformity of product.

Conservative Party that a commission as set out in this motion is 
needed.  We feel very comfortable with the present make-up of 
regulations and on how the Competition Bureau and the CRTC 
administer them.  A commission of this type would result in 
unnecessary government duplication.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the 
opportunity to address the House on Motion 423 which was 
introduced by my colleague representing the riding of 
Waterloo—Wellington. The motion calls for a debate to express 
the concerns of the member's constituents, colleagues and 
Canadians on the concentration of print media in Canada.  I would 
also thank my colleague for the research and effort that was put 
into his motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of this House are aware, the print media marketplace 
in Canada has been undergoing significant changes in recent years 
with several newspapers changing ownership. One recent example is 
Southam Inc.'s acquisition of the <I>Financial Post</I> from Sun 
Media Corporation in return for four southern Ontario dailies, 
including the Kitchener—Waterloo <I>Record</I> circulated in my 
colleague's riding of Waterloo—Wellington.  The most recent 
concerns the announcement of a possible takeover of Sun Media by 
Torstar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I understand it, some people perceive that newspaper mergers 
can be detrimental to Canada for two reasons.  First, there is a 
fear that increasing ownership concentration may leave Canadians 
with reduced access to both ideas and sources of information. 
Second, there are concerns that newspaper conglomerates might be 
able to conduct business in an anti-competitive manner with their 
subscribers, advertisers or journalists. I will address the 
anti-competitive business behaviour point first as it clearly 
relates to something that falls within the purview of the 
industry department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Competition Bureau headed by the director of investigation 
and research is an independent law enforcement agency of Industry 
Canada with responsibility for enforcing the Competition Act. 
This act is a law of general application.  It applies with few 
exceptions to all sectors of the Canadian economy, including 
newspapers, magazines and other print media. The law touches on 
the everyday life of all Canadians by seeking to maintain and 
encourage competition in the marketplace with the objective of 
providing consumers with competitive prices and a variety of 
choices in the goods and services that they purchase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The director actively enforces the Competition Act by monitoring 
developments in the marketplace and reviewing complaints from 
consumers, competitors and other interested individuals to 
determine whether there is evidence of any anti-competitive 
activity in the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of mergers, the act mandates that all transactions 
of substantial size be reviewed by the director, whether the 
bureau receives complaints about them or not. The test applied by 
the director in his review of mergers is whether or not the 
proposed transaction would or is likely to substantially lessen 
or prevent competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, the Competition Bureau reviews all major print 
media mergers.  The bureau's review centres on a merger's 
economic impact, which in the case of a newspaper merger 
primarily revolves around advertising issues.  Every transaction 
is thoroughly examined on a case by case basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to encourage anyone who has information 
that anti-competitive activity is ongoing or that might be 
facilitated by a merger to bring it to the attention of the 
director. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The director's view is that the provisions of the legislation 
are adequate to deal with anti-competitive behaviour in the print 
media industry.  For instance, they have allowed the director to 
successfully challenge Southam Inc.'s acquisition of a chain of 
real estate advertising papers in Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the provisions of the Competition Act are subject 
to regular review in order to identify appropriate amendments to 
the law.  In this regard, a set of amendments to update the law 
is currently before the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will return to the first issue that the motion seeks to 
address, that increased print media concentration may lead to a 
lack of diversity of sources of ideas and information.  I wish to 
point to the conclusions of a prior commission of inquiry on this 
very topic, the Kent commission of 1980.

<A HREF="#LINKT101"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Kent Commission felt that increasing print media 
concentration was a cause for concern as it might limit the 
dissemination of ideas and information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been almost 20 years since the Kent Commission report. 
The Canadian information landscape has changed tremendously.  The 
growth of broadcast media has been explosive. Canadians can now 
partake in an ever expanding universe of general interest and 
specialty channels, several of which are devoted exclusively to 
news, debates and editorials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What also bears mention is the incredible communication 
potential of the Internet and the proliferation of so-called new 
media or multi-media services.  In Canada the Internet is 
irrevocably on its way to becoming an integral part of every 
Canadian's life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Peter Desbarats, a member of the Kent Commission, recently 
mentioned, Canadians now benefit from a wide array of choices 
when they seek ideas and information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, Canadians are concerned in some areas.  Regardless 
of the vast array of choices that individuals have in accessing 
information on events throughout Canada and the world, the 
newspaper has come to symbolize freedom of expression and the 
exposure of facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, our newspapers have presented Canadians with a virtual 
buffet of analytical perspectives reflecting many different 
points of view.  When one person or one company acquires many 
different newspapers across the country people might rightly ask: 
Are views being suppressed?  Are the views of one perspective 
over-represented in the newspaper media? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An example can be seen in British Columbia where the owner of 
the <I>News Group</I>, Mr. David Black, recently told his editors 
of the 60 weekly newspapers to oppose the Nisga'a treaty and to 
run a series of eight columns against it.  Black's action set a 
dangerous precedent of management interference.  This strikes at 
the very heart of editorial interference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might also ask if local flavour gets sacrificed in favour of 
a cookie cutter approach from a large corporate super structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should Canadians decide that they are not being well served by 
the change in ownership structure that we are currently 
witnessing, what can be done? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the key to this is to ensure that our information 
marketplace must be as free of barriers to entry as possible.  In 
other words, we must continue to create a business climate that 
makes it possible and attractive for existing and potential 
competitors to provide Canadians with alternatives that they 
seek. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maintaining a competitive marketplace is an important role for 
government and I look forward to working with my colleague from 
Waterloo—Wellington to make sure that we pursue the right 
policies to make it attractive for new and fresh perspectives to 
enter the business of providing information to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member for Waterloo—Wellington for giving us the 
opportunity to have this debate today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK264"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to thank all of the members who shared their 
opinions and expressed their points of view regarding this very 
important matter.  I think the importance of this issue has been 
demonstrated through their thoughtful interventions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the eyes of some media, ownership concentration, until now at 
least, does not seem to have caused many noticeable problems. 
But as ownership continues to be put in the hands of fewer and 
fewer people, problems may arise.  This is why the potential 
exists for the Government of Canada to examine this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me reiterate a few important facts that were brought up in 
my introductory comments and which other members alluded to as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The three biggest newspaper chains in Canada are in charge of 
72% of the daily circulation.  One person owns Hollinger Inc., 
which controls 27 of Canada's newspapers.  This company owns over 
half of the interests in Southam Incorporated, Canada's largest 
chain, with 34 papers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two companies, essentially in Conrad Black's control, are 
in charge of 60% of Canada's newspapers and distribute 50% of its 
dailies.  Their control spreads across the country and is present 
in most of the provincial capitals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Owning 100% of the <I>Toronto Star</I>, Canada's largest paper in 
terms of circulation, Torstar Corporation also has a very large 
grasp on the information being given to Canadians.  Its bid to 
take over SunMedia Corporation, still in the works, would provide 
it with an even greater hold on the newspaper industry in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is obvious that Canada's newspapers are in the hands 
of a few people.  The question that we must ask ourselves, 
though, is whether or not the concentration of the media's 
ownership adversely affects the ability of Canadians to obtain 
different points of view on the affairs of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The newspaper industry has a tremendous impact on public opinion 
in Canada.  The information presented by this medium reaches many 
people in our nation. 
Therefore it is everyone's duty to ensure that this information 
be presented in a balanced fashion, showing differing points of 
view.

<A HREF="#LINKT102"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must therefore all work together to ensure that the media are 
giving the public what objective information is needed and is 
desired.  At the very least I think it is our duty as Canadians 
and here in the House of Commons to examine and discuss this 
matter.  It may be difficult to judge whether media ownership 
concentration is detrimental to the industry or to society as a 
whole but it is important to talk about it nevertheless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should therefore be vigilant as mergers and acquisition tend 
to concentrate the media even more. This is especially true in 
many areas of the country. Accordingly, I reiterate that we 
should exhibit caution as mergers and acquisitions in the media 
take place.  We should monitor the situation closely, recognizing 
there may come a time when further government action is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank all hon. members for participating in this very valuable 
dialogue and debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The time provided 
for the consideration of Private Members' Business has now 
expired and the order is dropped from the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 7.07 p.m., this House stands adjourned until tomorrow 
at 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 7.07 p.m.)
