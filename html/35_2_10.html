	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.)</B> 
moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House take note of the importance of the North American 
Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD) in the security and defence of North 
America, and of the government's intention to renew the NORAD agreement 
with the United States for a further five years.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I want to express my appreciation to all 
members of the House in agreeing to this important debate. This is 
the second time in three weeks that we have had the opportunity as 
parliamentarians to look at a critical aspect of Canadian foreign 
policy.
<P>
	In this case we are dealing with one of the most important 
bilateral treaties that has been established between ourselves and 
the United States over the last almost 40 years; the renewal of the 
North American air defence agreement which has represented a 
major issue of security and defence co-operation between our two 
countries.
<P>
	NORAD has been a key element in this co-operation since 1958. 
It has served our countries well during a variety of changes, 
particularly during the period when we were concerned about the 
surveillance of airways during the cold war.
<P>
<B>(1105 )</B>
<P>
	It is our assertion, one I believe most Canadians share, that the 
continuation of NORAD can serve us equally as well in a post-cold 
war environment, an environment which despite the reduction and 
elimination of the ballistic missile threat to North America still 
remains full of many uncertainties in the world we live in.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	NORAD represents a key element of our foreign and security 
policies. For 40 years, this agreement has been a strong link in our 
bilateral relationship with the U.S. That is why we are proposing 
today to renew this agreement for a further five years effective May 
12, 1996.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	My colleague, the Minister of National Defence, will further 
review during this debate the specific military and defence 
requirements and aspects of this agreement.
<P>
	I will concentrate my remarks on the rationale, the new 
objectives, the new security context as well as the foreign affairs 
dimension of this proposed NORAD renewal.
<P>
	I hope we can encourage members to participate in how we 
situate this important resigning of the NORAD agreement within 
the broader context of our relationships with the United States.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Four sets of issues have dominated Canada-U.S. relations in the 
past few years: first, economic and trade relations following the 
implementation of NAFTA; second, culture; third, the 
environment; and fourth, defence matters.
<P>
	Defence relations have been the least controversial of the last 
three sectors. In fact, the U.S. and Canada generally share the same 
vision and interests with respect to the security of North America.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This very close co-operation in defence and security matters has 
constituted for 55 years a fundamental and important foundation of 
our relationship in the North American continent with the 
Americans.
<P>
	The question before us today is how these fundamentals evolve 
in a post-cold war era. Times have drastically changed, as we all 
recognize, since the basic text of NORAD was last updated in 1981. 
Canadians can legitimately ask whether we still need a NORAD 
agreement.
<P>
	Since becoming the Minister of Foreign Affairs I have carefully 
studied the reviews of NORAD undertaken by Canada and the U.S. 
in the last two years. I have read the recommendations of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="496"> 496 </A></B>
<P>
special joint committee on Canada's defence policy and the special 
joint committee  that reviewed Canadian foreign policy, both of 
which endorsed the renewal of NORAD.
<P>
	In that assessment and review I conclude the following. Even 
though Canada does not face the same threat or concern about 
bombers, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles it did during the 
height of the cold war period, the capability and the necessity to 
continue to exercise effective surveillance and control over 
Canadian air space are still basic defence requirements with 
important implications for Canadian sovereignty.
<P>
	A binational aerospace defence co-operation through NORAD 
remains a highly effective, cost effective means to meet this basic 
national objective. What we are saying is that NORAD itself is a 
very important way in which the continued protection and 
advancement of Canadian sovereignty and responsibility can be 
maintained at a cost within our means.
<P>
	To date the central purpose of NORAD has been to provide both 
Canada and the United States with the means to ensure an 
appropriate level of air sovereignty, attack warnings, assessments 
and responsive defence. The agreement offers a number of key 
advantages which are just as relevant today as they were a few 
decades ago. Let me cite a few.
<P>
<B>(1110 )</B>
<P>
	First, NORAD provides a comprehensive warning capability 
against any residual stocks of ballistic missiles and provides 
defence against bombers and cruise missiles.
<P>
	Second, NORAD discourages criminal activity, especially drug 
smuggling and illegal immigration, which we do not need in this 
day and age. It is evident that we need continual protection against 
terrorism and common criminals who may seek access to our 
borders through the use of air means.
<P>
	Third, it gives Canada access to valuable military and 
technological intelligence in the aerospace field that is unique 
among all countries.
<P>
	Fourth, it substantially enhances the ability of the Government 
of Canada to ensure its will is respected throughout all areas within 
Canadian jurisdiction by providing in a very cost effective way the 
capability to monitor and control developments within our 
aerospace.
<P>
	Fifth, it gives Canadians a voice in the planning and operations 
of the aerospace defence of North America, developments which 
whether we were in NORAD or not would directly affect our 
interests.
<P>
	For these reasons alone NORAD continues to make good basic 
sense. While NORAD has continued to serve these basic national 
interests our government felt strongly that aspects of the agreement 
needed to be substantially updated to meet current and future 
defence needs. In the last two years new considerations have come 
forward and are being addressed in the new agreement.  This is not 
just an old NORAD agreement; it is a substantially revised 
agreement.
<P>
	I will cite four major changes in the proposed renewal. First, 
there is a concern about the proliferation of advanced military 
technology including weapons of mass destruction in the hands of 
rogue governments that may support terrorism. As we all know, 
Canada is a leader in the effort to deter the proliferation of weapons 
of mass destruction and their means of delivery. We recognize this 
is an essential component of an effective defence against attack by 
nations or terrorists using nuclear, biological or chemical weapons.
<P>
	The reason for this leadership is that there is concrete evidence 
that the number of countries working together to acquire these 
weapons is increasing. In this regard the end of the Soviet Union 
diminished one threat, a nuclear exchange between east and west. 
At the same time it increased another threat, the opportunity for 
other countries to acquire the expertise and materials to build their 
own weapons. This is a concern that has become increasingly 
apparent as we see the trade and exchange of components of 
nuclear weapons, delivery and manufacture.
<P>
	The new NORAD agreement will provide clear provisions of 
aerospace warning and control to meet the potential of this new 
threat of arms proliferation. It is one way to provide a clear 
deterrent against that expansion we so greatly fear.
<P>
	There is another equally important reality. In renewing the 
NORAD agreement we faced the growing importance of space in 
military operations. The special parliamentary joint committee on 
Canada's foreign policy recommended Canada should be prepared 
to renew the NORAD agreement, but should press for a further 
shift of emphasis from air defence to global space surveillance. 
Canada should require prior consultations on any move to abrogate 
the anti-ballistic missile treaty or to place weapons in space.
<P>
	The new agreement does exactly that. It is one way we can 
ensure full protection against developments that would increase the 
risk of new space based weapons. As a result of the NORAD 
agreement we are now in a position to exercise real control and 
judgment.
<P>
	I want to make one thing very clear: NORAD's technology 
remains the best in the world to provide surveillance and warning 
functions with efforts to defend our aerospace. However, that new 
technology is not the stuff and matter of a star wars program. It 
involves no weapons in space, a concept we as Canadians oppose. 
There is no anti-ballistic missile system in any way connected to 
this NORAD agreement. NORAD has evolved to reflect the threats 
faced by Canada and the United States and this process will 
continue if we decide to renew the agreement.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="497"> 497 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	In fact, one important objective which was sought by Canada and 
will be met in the renewal of the agreement was to develop a more 
formal mechanism for the two countries to consult on 
developments with implications for North American aerospace 
defence and through which NORAD's missions could evolve. 
Because of NORAD we will have a place at the table to determine 
the pace and timing of any developments and the ability to say no 
or to register our concerns.
<P>
	Moreover, the agreement will make clear that these missions 
will require the approval of both governments to proceed. In effect, 
we have a veto within the North American defence agreement to 
say no to these particular proposals.
<P>
	A third consideration when renewing the agreement was the 
increased use of North American air space for legitimate purposes, 
such as civil air traffic, which has expanded geometrically with the 
signing of the open skies agreement. Unfortunately, it is also 
becoming increasingly penetrated by illicit activity from the air. 
That is particularly true when it comes to the drug trade and their 
use of air space to make their connections.
<P>
	The agreement we are proposing will clearly refer to the need to 
co-ordinate national systems for the surveillance and control of 
North American air space to cope with these added activities, both 
of a legal nature and of an illegal nature so that both governments 
can make sure that the best protection for our citizens is provided.
<P>
	A fourth consideration, and one that I know is of great 
importance to members of the House, was the need to reflect the 
contemporary concern for environmental protection. Up to now the 
NORAD agreement has not contained any clause on environmental 
protection whatsoever.
<P>
	At Canada's request, a new clause will be added in the accord to 
refer directly to environmental issues, expected to be few, but that 
reference will go to the permanent joint board of defence by a 
national group made up of defence and diplomatic representatives, 
the chair of which is the member of Parliament for High Park, who 
is our representative and the co-chair in that area.
<P>
	With these changes, ensuring again that any problems related to 
the environment under the new agreement will be relayed to that 
joint board and decisions will be made jointly, I think that 
completely and clearly answers the concerns expressed by 
members of the House during those hearings.
<P>
	With the changes I have just outlined, I believe that the revised 
agreement will transform NORAD from a cold war defence 
arrangement to one of the 1990s and beyond and will give us a 
much better ability to protect our sovereignty and provide for 
increased co-operation in  areas of vital concern to us in the use of 
our valuable air space.
<P>
	As rewritten, the new NORAD agreement should meet today's 
security environment as well as Canadian interests and needs. It 
will also provide a clear indication of the government's 
commitment to Canada-U.S. defence co-operation and reaffirm at 
the highest level our intention to continue the co-operation in North 
American aerospace surveillance and air defence.
<P>
	Let me in closing take a moment to talk about how NORAD fits 
into the broader context or scenarios of Canada-U.S. relations. We 
have all read from our school days on, the variety of cliches that 
abound about Canada-U.S. relationships. However, beyond those 
cliches there is one fundamental truth. The most comprehensive 
relationship between any two countries in the world is that which 
exists between Canada and the United States. It exists in the 
hundreds of thousands of transactions that take place every day 
between private citizens and businesses across borders. It also 
exists in a wide variety of areas such as trade, culture and the 
environment. In these cases we have been able to or tried to 
manage these relationships in a variety of ways.
<P>
	Much of what we do bilaterally, regionally and internationally 
relates directly to the special management of our unique 
relationship with the United States. Our co-operative yet complex 
relationship stands as a model. I do not believe any two countries in 
the world have been able to manage these complex relationships in 
the way we have. In saying that, it is clear we have our differences, 
and sometimes the differences tend to be a lot more visible than the 
matters in which we share common interests, common values and 
common visions.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	We are all very aware of the irritants which characterize the trade 
and environment areas, to take just two examples. The 
extraterritoriality being proposed under the Helms-Burton bill, or 
the disputes on Pacific salmon which are now being dealt with, are 
serious integral challenges to our basic interests. I can assure 
members of the House that we will take all necessary steps to 
defend the Canadian national interest in these two areas.
<P>
	We also have differences of opinion, not just in direct 
relationships about larger foreign policy issues such as the reform 
of the United Nations. We think the United States has a 
responsibility to pay its bills. We believe on the issue of Cuba that 
an active program of engagement is the best way to provide for the 
evolution of democracy and the treatment of human rights in that 
country rather than a policy of isolation.
<P>
	We know how to work out those differences in a productive and 
friendly manner through good debate and dialogue. Subject to the 
recommendations of this debate, Canada's intention to renew the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="498"> 498 </A></B>
<P>
NORAD agreement  offers yet another illustration of a good 
working relationship with the United States.
<P>
	Furthermore, the NORAD agreement offers to those elected 
representatives in the United States who have been making some 
comments in the last few weeks about Canada's position, how 
things should properly be done: where we sign an agreement; 
where we have a framework; where we engage in dialogue; where 
there are rules of the game; where there is processes to follow. That 
is the way two countries get along, not by calling each other names 
or having certain members of the senate make aspersions about our 
past history.
<P>
	The NORAD agreement is the model on how we conduct our 
relationship, not the kind of statements made by the chairman of 
the Senate foreign relations committee, the senator from North 
Carolina.
<P>
	I believe a renewal of this agreement provides a very strong 
message, a very effective message, to Canadians and Americans 
alike. This is the way to do business together. This is the way to get 
along together. This is the way to co-operate together and to do it in 
an orderly rules based system that allows us to express our 
differences but at the same time to co-operate where that 
co-operation is in our mutual interests.
<P>
	We have differences and similarities. The way to deal with these 
is to have rules in place to make sure that those rules and 
similarities have their best expression and their best outlet. It is a 
relationship that must continue to be based on mutual respect and a 
solid understanding of our respective individual and independent 
needs and priorities.
<P>
	The new NORAD agreement that we are putting before the 
House today for debate builds on this relationship. It demonstrates 
to both our populations how we can continue to advance and secure 
good, co-operative relationships with our very important 
neighbours. Perhaps it can demonstrate to other countries around 
the world that is better to get along than to have disputes. The 
NORAD agreement is one clear way of doing that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today in this House to speak to the renewal of the 
NORAD agreement between Canada and the U.S, especially since 
this debate was requested by the Bloc Quebecois in its dissenting 
report on reviewing Canada's defence policy.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank the new Minister 
of Foreign Affairs for agreeing to give the official opposition 
enough time to prepare for today's debate. The new Minister of 
Foreign Affairs' open-mindedness is in stark contrast to the 
arrogant and disrespectful attitude toward the opposition taken by 
this government since the beginning of its mandate with respect to 
this type of debate.
<P>
	During the election campaign, as you may recall, the Liberal 
Party of Canada promised-in an effort to increase transparency, or 
so it claimed-to regularly consult the House on major issues in 
foreign and defence policy that may require Canada's involvement. 
Since the 1993 election, we have in fact noticed that the few 
debates hastily organized by the government-supposedly to 
consult Parliament-were nothing but a sham.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	Most of the debates were announced with less than 24 hours' 
notice, with the government providing the motions, relevant papers 
and briefings at the last minute, before we finally realized that the 
dice were loaded and that the government was consulting the 
House merely for appearance's sake.
<P>
	Despite somewhat inadequate preparation due to a lack of time, 
we have always insisted on taking part in these debates, if only to 
be heard. We are therefore happy to see that the government has 
finally decided to give us enough time to prepare adequately for 
this debate.
<P>
	Yet, I fear that this debate will have no more impact on the 
government's decision, since it seems that the foreign affairs 
minister's signature is a mere formality. According to a report in 
the February 24 edition of <I>Le Devoir</I>, the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs has already approved the final version of the new NORAD 
agreement and will sign this agreement with his American 
counterpart during a visit to Washington on March 13 or 14.
<P>
	Let us point out that the minister's officials have informed us 
that no decision in this regard had been made so far. This raises an 
important question: if the minister feels that today's debate is 
serious, does he really believe that major amendments could be 
made to the new NORAD agreement in the 24 to 48 hours 
following this debate?
<P>
	Which leads to this other important question: Why does the 
minister refuse to provide the official opposition and the other 
parties represented in this House with a draft of the new NORAD 
agreement before it is finalized? Why are the various opposition 
parties not allowed to give their opinion on this agreement on the 
basis of all the relevant information that would enable them to 
really discuss Canada's participation in NORAD?
<P>
	In this sense, we would greatly appreciate it if, out of respect for 
parliamentary democracy and for the people of Quebec and 
Canada, the minister provided all parties in this House with a draft 
of any agreement or accord contemplated before it is implemented. 
This would enable the opposition parties to better fulfil their 
parliamentary duties, while at the same time enhancing the quality 
of debate for the benefit of our fellow citizens. That is what I call 
real transparency.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="499"> 499 </A></B>
<P>
	This being said, as you no doubt know, the NORAD agreement 
was not negotiated overnight. Allow me, therefore, to backtrack 
briefly to try to understand why such an agreement came about 
in the first place and to try to see more clearly whether or not 
the NORAD agreement should be renewed.
<P>
	First of all, note that this agreement originally derived from the 
Ogdensburg Declaration of 1940, in which the idea of joint defence 
arrangements between the U.S. and Canada was officially set out 
for the first time.
<P>
	At the time-must we be reminded-the United States and 
Canada were at war with the Axis powers, which greatly 
encouraged closer formal military ties with our American allies. 
Later, in 1947, our two countries set out the basis of a new military 
co-operation, particularly for air defence. A few years later, in 1954 
to be precise, Canadian and American air force officials came to 
the conclusion that the best way of ensuring both countries' air 
defence was to place it in the hands of a single organization under a 
single command.
<P>
	The U.S. and Canada conducted negotiations that eventually led 
to a bilateral agreement being signed in 1957, establishing an 
integrated air defence command based in Colorado Springs, 
Colorado. The following year, on May 12, 1958, the North 
American Aerospace Defence Command Agreement, commonly 
known as NORAD agreement, was entered into by Canada and the 
United States. At first, this agreement was to be renewed every ten 
years, but this time frame was shortened to five years, in light of 
the ever changing geostrategic global situation.
<P>
	Note also that, since its beginnings, the NORAD agreement has 
been renewed seven times. Initially, the main purpose of this 
agreement was to ensure active air defence against Soviet long 
range bombers. To this end, NORAD's integrated command was 
equipped with ground based radars and with fighter interceptors.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	It is interesting to note that NORAD's defence system was set up 
shortly after the U.S.S.R. developed an atomic bomb, thus creating 
a real threat for North America.
<P>
	It is also to be noted that a major element of strategic balance 
changed following the launching of the first Soviet satellite in 
space. Indeed, in the ensuing years, the U.S.S.R. developed 
delivery vehicles capable of making decisive hits on Canadian and 
U.S. targets.
<P>
	During the arms race, the United States also developed 
intercontinental ballistic missiles, commonly called ICBMs. These 
missiles were equipped with nuclear warheads and were also 
capable of hitting Soviet targets. However, given its lack of 
effective defence systems against this type of attack, the U.S. found 
itself, for the first time in its history, vulnerable to the Soviet threat.
<P>
	Consequently, in the mid-sixties, NORAD put the emphasis on 
early warning in case of an attack. NORAD's early detection of 
soviet missiles would ensure a swift response from the U.S. and 
became part of the nuclear deterrent strategy. However, even 
though it had lost some of its importance, air defence against 
bombers remained a priority.
<P>
	When the NORAD agreement was renewed in 1981, and 
following the development of cruise missiles launched from 
airplanes and submarines, air defence against such a threat became 
again a top priority. It goes without saying that these developments 
resulted in a strengthening of east-west and northern security 
measures. The name of the organization was also changed. The 
term ``air defence'' was replaced by ``aerospace defence'', so as to 
reflect NORAD's increasingly greater concerns regarding 
aerospace threats.
<P>
	NORAD continues to play an important role in terms of 
surveillance and defence of the North American air space. 
However, given the end of the cold war and the dismantling of the 
Soviet Union in the early nineties, we now have to ask ourselves 
whether it is necessary to maintain such a structure and, if so, 
whether its mandate should be redefined.
<P>
	Even though the cold war is over and Russia is not the aggressive 
and threatening power that the Soviet Union was, we must remain 
alert and on the lookout for any outside attack. While NORAD was 
set up to counter the Soviet threat, it would be overly simplistic to 
assume that, since the U.S.S.R. no longer exists, we do not need 
this type of aerospace defence system any more.
<P>
	It is true that, in times of peace, the relevancy of such a system 
may not be obvious. History, however, has taught us several lessons 
including this one: to be naive when it comes to security could have 
disastrous consequences.
<P>
	It is an accepted fact that, to survive, a state must be able to 
ensure the security of its territory and of its population. Even today, 
the Canadian state cannot escape this simple but unavoidable 
obligation. But we would be kidding ourselves if we thought or 
claimed that Canada can ensure its own security. That is why it is in 
the best interests of both Canada and Quebec to be realistic and to 
renew the NORAD agreement.
<P>
	Nobody can deny that Russia as it exists in 1996 still possesses 
mass destruction weapons and nothing can guarantee that we will 
not see, in the years to come, changes of government or changes of 
attitude toward the west, particularly toward the United States. And 
the same goes for other powers such as China, for example, which 
also possesses mass destruction weapons and has very large 
military capabilities.
<P>
	Since the end of the cold war, dozens of armed conflicts have 
arisen throughout the world and no country can claim to be immune 
from that. Every  country tries to get the maximum from the means 
at its disposal. It is well known within the international community 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="500"> 500 </A></B>
<P>
that several countries are presently trying to acquire or to develop 
chemical, bacteriological and nuclear weapons.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	These weapons, combined with the use of missiles launched 
from submarines, ships, airplanes or by other means, could 
eventually become a threat to us. Let us not forget that terrorism 
has become a problem in our societies and that state terrorism is a 
reality that we have to live with.
<P>
	On the other hand, we must ask ourselves what would be the 
possible consequences of Canada's non-participation in NORAD. 
What could be the impact of this non-participation in terms of the 
inviolability of our air and aerospace sovereignty, the effectiveness 
of our military defence and the costs that an autonomous defence 
would create?
<P>
	It is obvious that the NORAD agreement has been particularly 
beneficial to Canada's defence policy. The establishment of an 
exclusively Canadian air and aerospace detection system would 
have been extremely costly for Canada. Sharing the costs of the 
current system with the United States has certainly helped us save 
tens of millions of dollars.
<P>
	At the present time, we spend about $300 million each year on 
the NORAD aerospace defence system, which is about 10 per cent 
of the total costs associated with this system. It is absolutely certain 
that, if we were on our own, Canada could not have the same level 
of protection it is enjoying now for the same amount of money.
<P>
	Canada's participation in NORAD has even allowed us to protect 
our sovereignty in the far north over the last 35 years. Because of 
the scope and efficiency of the detection system in place, Canada is 
spared from having to maintain a major military presence in this 
region. Canada's position and credibility concerning the 
demilitarization of the Arctic is therefore defensible.
<P>
	Canada is also able, through NORAD, to obtain highly 
significant strategic information from our American allies which 
would otherwise be unavailable.
<P>
	Our NORAD membership provides us with access to 
information concerning Canada, while sparing us the heavy 
expenditures related to developing, launching and maintaining 
such satellites.
<P>
	NORAD also provides Canada with access to space monitoring 
technology, which is nothing to be sneezed at. That access takes a 
number of different forms, one of which is the training Canadian 
military personnel in American military installations.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois sees another advantage in Canadian 
membership in NORAD: Canada's partnership with the Americans 
in aerospace defence has, undeniably, given it some clout with the 
U.S. in this field. Canada has some degree of control over what 
goes on in Canadian air space. Without NORAD, would it have 
been possible for us to defend ourselves against the designs the 
U.S. had on our air space? That is far from certain.
<P>
	I would like to take advantage of this opportunity to indicate the 
Bloc's support of the government's recent commitment not to 
authorize any weapon deployment in Canadian air space.
<P>
	While the Bloc does agree that the NORAD agreement has 
served Quebec's and Canada's interests well, and while it is 
prepared to support renewal for a further five years, this does not 
mean there are no changes to be made to it.
<P>
	In fact, in its 1994 defence white paper, in connection with the 
renewal of the NORAD agreement, the government committed to 
``look closely into those areas which might require updating, given 
the new challenges to continental security''.
<P>
	The Bloc finds it most regrettable that the government has let 
slip the opportunity offered by renewal of the NORAD agreement 
to do as it had suggested in its own white paper: redefine the 
primary mission of that organization within the present 
international context. Why indeed has it not seized the opportunity 
afforded us here to make changes, such as an expansion of 
NORAD's mandate to enable it to support UN peacekeeping 
missions in the Americas.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	In this regard, the Bloc Quebecois wrote in its dissenting report 
on the foreign policy review that Canada should review ``its current 
military alliances and adapt them to strategic missions in 
accordance with the needs of the United Nations. This approach 
would inject new life into these organizations and would make 
them more effective in protecting safety and in resolving conflicts. 
It would also make it possible for Canada to meet its public 
security objectives, which are crucial to its own domestic 
security''.
<P>
	As regards UN regional peace missions in North America, could 
NORAD not help the UN with its mandate, in Haiti for example, by 
doing air surveillance? This new mandate for NORAD might help 
the UN increase its chances for successful peace missions in the 
region.
<P>
	Furthermore, by supporting this new mission for NORAD, as 
proposed by the Bloc Quebecois, the government could tighten up 
its notion of collective security. It could thus play a more important 
role with the United States in this regard in North America.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois also feels it is time the NORAD agreement 
was expanded to include our other American economic partners. 
We feel that NORAD could provide a  valuable means of linking 
our economic and trading interests to our common interest in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="501"> 501 </A></B>
<P>
security. This could ensure the sustainability of the incipient 
political stability in countries in Central and South America.
<P>
	In this regard, we could start first by extending NORAD to 
Mexico, which is also a party to NAFTA, and then, little by little, to 
other countries, in South America. We could thus eventually end up 
with an alliance of the Americas. The aim of this alliance, 
essentially, would be to set up a common air, land and sea 
surveillance network. It would enable Canada to set up a tighter, 
and better co-ordinated defence structure at less cost to taxpayers.
<P>
	NORAD could also be used to a greater extent in the fight 
against drug trafficking. It could be used more intensively against 
drug traffickers using Canadian and American airspace. And, if it 
were extended to other countries in the Americas, it could be put to 
greater use in their struggle against the drug trade.
<P>
	Moreover, the new NORAD agreement should answer the Bloc 
Quebecois' legitimate concerns with regard to anti-missile 
defence. If, for instance, either party to the NORAD agreement 
wanted to develop and use new anti-missile defence technology, 
the other party should not only be consulted but also be in 
agreement.
<P>
	By so doing, Canada would avoid finding itself in a situation 
where, even though consulted, it would be subject to American 
decisions in this area, which, let us not forget, is at the heart of 
today's nuclear deterrence strategy. A new NORAD agreement 
should also include clauses providing for environmental protection 
with respect to Northern military facilities. Furthermore, since the 
Canadian and American governments appointed negotiators, in 
February 1995, to deal with this issue, we would hope that by now a 
solution to this problem has been found and that it is reflected in 
the present NORAD agreement.
<P>
	However, in the what we would consider regretable event that 
the Canadian government was unable to reach an agreement with 
our neighbours to the south, the Bloc Quebecois would urge it to 
engage in continuing negotiations without delay; eventually, such 
negotiations would be held on a regular basis. My party believes 
that the U.S. must pay its fair share of the costs to clean up these 
sites.
<P>
	Lastly, Canada should make it very clear it is committed to 
promoting the demilitarization of Canada's North and to 
negotiating with Russia granting this region the same demilitarized 
zone status as Antarctica.
<P>
	To conclude, I would say that, for the reasons I just mentioned, 
the Bloc Quebecois will support renewing the NORAD agreement. 
However, we believe it essential to make a number of changes and, 
in this respect, we ask the government to consider the official 
opposition's legitimate claims with an open mind.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the people of 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt to speak in this take note 
debate on the motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House take note of the importance of the North American 
Aerospace Defence Command (NORAD) in the security and defence of North 
America, and of the government's intention to renew the NORAD agreement 
with the United States for a further five years.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1145 )</B>
<P>
	This is the second take note debate in two weeks. Although I 
appreciate the spirit in which it is offered, there is a feeling in the 
House that these debates are nothing more than smoke and mirrors 
and that already a decision has been made by cabinet on this. The 
minister is shaking his head no but my mother told me that 
perception is everything. If that is not the case, then it is the 
minister's responsibility to make sure that the perception is 
changed. I leave the minister with that challenge. It is sometimes 
felt by opposition members and other members in the House that 
these debates are just an illusion and a charade and that the decision 
has already been made.
<P>
	Our bilateral defence ties with the United States have been the 
single most important linchpin in Canada's defence network since 
World War II. NORAD is the most enduring symbol of these 
bilateral defence ties. Since the beginning of the cold war and the 
advent of the Soviet nuclear arsenal, it became readily apparent 
that North America was a single entity that could only be defended 
with co-operation between Canada and the United States.
<P>
	In 1951 Canada permitted the United States strategic air 
command to place bases on Canadian soil. In addition Canada 
independently and in co-operation with the United States 
constructed the pinetree line of radar installations for North 
American surveillance. It was followed by the mid-Canada line and 
of course the DEW line.
<P>
	In 1957 NORAD was formally established in an agreement that 
has been reviewed and renewed every five years since 1967. Due to 
the significant benefits Canada derives from NORAD, the Reform 
Party supports in principle the renewal of the NORAD agreement. 
NORAD was designed to simplify combined operations between 
the air forces of the United States and Canada during times of crisis 
or conflict. The primary objective of NORAD continues to be to 
use aerospace surveillance and air defences to assist each nation in 
safeguarding the sovereignty of its air space.
<P>
	To those in the House and other Canadians who would ask why 
Canada should continue in NORAD in this post cold war era, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="502"> 502 </A></B>
<P>
answer is very simple: sovereignty. Sovereignty is a country's 
responsibility. We must ensure  that no one violates our air space. 
This is the primary focus of NORAD, one that is independent of the 
demise of the Soviet Union.
<P>
	Air sovereignty is defined as a nation's inherent right to exercise 
absolute control over air space above its territory. NORAD assists 
Canada and the U.S. in this undertaking through surveillance and 
control, the ability to detect, identify and if necessary to intercept 
unknown aircraft approaching North American air space. That is 
the reason Canada should renew this agreement.
<P>
	In his remarks the Minister of Foreign Affairs made mention of 
the fact that most of the threats are gone in this post cold war era. I 
caution the minister to reassess his statements in that regard. With 
the end of the cold war the threats did not just disappear; they are 
still there. The minister called them residual stockpiles. By the end 
of the year 2000 up to 25 nations will have developed weapons of 
mass destruction. Some will have the technology to reach North 
America. We in the House must support sovereignty.
<P>
	The greatest benefit the Canadian and U.S. governments derive 
from NORAD is the ability to share not only the responsibilities 
but the resources and the costs for continental security. It would be 
militarily impractical as well as inefficient for each nation to 
unilaterally perform NORAD's current missions and functions.
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	In Canada's case although air sovereignty control may be 
possible, the mission of air defence in depth would be difficult due 
to the country's large land mass and its small and, it seems every 
year, shrinking defence force. Other benefits to both nations 
include shared intelligence and technology, joint strategic planning 
for defence and the long tradition of binational co-operation and 
friendship. In short, Canada cannot go it alone. With our modest 
population and expansive territory, we must maintain our defence 
ties with the United States.
<P>
	As a sovereign nation with NORAD, Canada must play its part 
and contribute combat capable forces for our mutual benefit. This 
is where the Liberal government has failed. The Liberal 
government is letting Canadians and our allies down. The Liberal 
government has again hit the defence budget with significant cuts. 
Defence spending will be reduced a further $800 million. Where 
does the government intend to make cuts in the defence budget? 
The answer is capital equipment, the very thing that our armed 
forces need to maintain our Canadian sovereignty.
<P>
	The Liberal government has not been forthcoming enough to tell 
us what equipment it plans to eliminate. It could be more of our 
CF-18s. Maybe they will move from their current warm storage 
into cold storage or maybe will be mothballed completely. Those 
CF-18s are needed to intercept intruders or for a variety of other 
NORAD  related systems. Regardless of what equipment goes, the 
end result will be less combat capability and less ability for Canada 
to protect its sovereignty.
<P>
	Defence, deterrence and sovereignty are concepts that require 
combat capable forces if they are to be realized. Allies and 
potential aggressors alike must view our combat capabilities with 
respect. The $800 million in cuts to the defence budget will reduce 
not only our combat capabilities but the international respect 
Canada has fostered since World War II.
<P>
	As a member from British Columbia, I will give a recent 
example which the Minister of Foreign Affairs also alluded to. 
Even our closest ally, the United States is losing respect for our 
sovereignty. I refer to a letter dated March 6 written by the hon. 
member for Skeena to the Prime Minister which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Dear Mr. Prime Minister,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I write to you on a matter of utmost urgency, which has serious implications 
to our national interest and our Pacific salmon fishery.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I refer to the passage of Congressional Amendments to the American 
Fisheries Protective Act in November of 1995. By this action, the U.S. Congress 
is seeking to prevent Canada from exercising unfettered jurisdiction over 
Canadian internal waters. This is a direct challenge to Canadian sovereignty and 
cannot be allowed to stand.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As I am sure you are aware, the American Congress has made a unilateral 
declaration of free passage for U.S. ships travelling through B.C.'s inside 
passage. This is preposterous and totally unacceptable.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Alaskan commercial fishermen continue to harvest Canadian salmon at levels 
which violate both the letter and spirit of the Pacific Salmon Treaty (1985). This 
is at the core of the American declaration for ``free passage''. It is a bully tactic, 
designed to both intimidate and remove any leverage Canada has in seeking a 
resolution to the Pacific salmon dispute, by imposing economic costs to 
American commercial vessels.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The actions of the American government do not call for diplomacy, but with a 
resolute declaration by you, as Prime Minister, that Canada will not in any way 
tolerate a challenge to its sovereignty over its internal waters. You must be 
prepared to back this declaration with a visible demonstration of our Nation's 
resolve. I strongly urge you to take the following actions:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1. Immediately declare that this American legislation constitutes a direct 
threat to Canada's sovereignty and that it will not be tolerated.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>2. Declare Canada's position that any attempt by the U.S. Coastguard, or any 
other military force to enter Canadian internal waters to enforce their 
legislation, to be an act of invasion.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>3. Declare that any act of invasion will be treated as such and appropriate 
measures taken to counter it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>4. Establish a Canadian naval presence in the Canadian territorial waters 
along B.C.'s coast, to deter any American breach of Canada's internal waters, 
unless authorized by Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="503"> 503 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>5. In the absence of a fishing plan under the Pacific Salmon Treaty for 1996, 
announce passage fees for American fishing vessels at the same rate, or higher, 
than those levied over two years ago.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Prime Minister, it is vital to the interests of both B.C. and Canada that you 
act in a decisive and responsible manner. The American people have long been 
our good friends and neighbours. I am confident that this irresponsible act, on 
the part of a handful of politicians bowing to the American commercial fishing 
lobby, would never carry the judgment of the vast majority of American 
citizens. I am also confident that it will not carry the judgment of the 
international community. This is the act of bullies who would use intimidation 
and the veiled threat of force to get their way.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This is not a partisan issue. Strong leadership by you and your government is 
crucial at this time. If you take the actions listed above, or ones very similar, all 
of Canada will be behind you. If you do not, Canadian sovereignty will be 
diminished, our standing in the international community diminished and 
Canadian citizens demoralized.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I look forward to your actions on behalf of my constituents and all Canadians.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	It seems odd at this very time when we are talking about 
protecting sovereignty around the world for North America that the 
only ones who are invading our sovereignty are the people with 
whom we hope to sign an agreement in a few short hours or days.
<P>
	The Reform Party is pleased to support in principal, and I stress 
in principal, the extension of the NORAD agreement for another 
five years. With Canada's shrinking defence budget, it is 
imperative that we continue this agreement. NORAD is value 
added for the Canadian taxpayer. We benefit greatly from the 
agreement. This capability benefits peacekeeping forces around the 
world. It plays a vital role in drug interdiction and could also 
contribute to monitoring arms control and treaty compliance.
<P>
	We are not pleased at the proposed massive cuts to the defence 
budget which will further undermine our armed forces, their 
combat capability and ultimately Canadian sovereignty. The 
government should be ashamed of the additional cuts to the 
defence budget. These cuts are not the result of deficit reduction 
but rather the result of the government's failure to balance the 
budget. This failure to balance the budget is not only undermining 
our social programs but Canada's national security and sovereignty 
as well.
<P>
	The Liberals are sending a strong signal to our allies that 
Canadians are freeloaders and not prepared to contribute to our 
mutual defence. This is the wrong signal to be sending. It is one 
that will call into question our position as a middle power and a 
reliable partner.
<P>
	I suggest to the Liberal government that unless we maintain our 
military capability which can adequately defend our sovereignty, 
we will have more incidents such as we see in B.C. with the U.S. 
declaring B.C.'s inside  passage to be an international waterway. 
We ask that the Liberal government express to the United States 
our concern and determination to maintain Canadian sovereignty 
over the B.C. inside passage.
<P>
	We would hope that in the tradition of shared resources with the 
United States and the friendship and co-operation which has been 
expressed over the years that those qualities can be maintained with 
the settlement of this most recent irritant and that Canada will 
continue to support the common interests of sovereignty with the 
United States and not work against them. We hope that can be 
accomplished with respect to the signing of the NORAD 
agreement.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
take part in the debate for the NORAD renewal. I am pleased that 
both the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party have given their 
general support to the renewal of the agreement, although I am 
perplexed at the convoluted logic of the last speaker, the critic for 
the Reform Party.
<P>
	In one breath he is supporting the NORAD renewal but in 
another he is issuing a virtual declaration of war against the United 
States for incursions the Americans are allegedly making on the 
west coast militarily. That will bring some smiles, if not in 
Washington certainly in the parliamentary press gallery.
<P>
	Another point raised is that the debate is somehow irrelevant. 
That could not be further from the truth. Cabinet has not looked at 
this issue. There has been no debate and therefore it is totally 
wrong to say that what is being said here today will have no 
influence on ministers when they look at the agreement.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I urge the House to support the renewal of the North American 
Aerospace Defence Command or NORAD agreement. The reason I 
want this agreement, which served the interests of this country and 
this continent well, to be renewed is because I am confident that, in 
this regard, the government is supported by most Canadians and by 
the vast majority of members. Incidentally, my colleagues and 
myself are very grateful for this support.
<P>
	Throughout the cold war, this Canada-U.S. partnership for the 
aerospace defence of North America faced the greatest threats that 
defence technology could devise. NORAD waited and watched, 
always ready to sound the alarm and intervene. This task, however 
mundane, was necessary and if it went largely unnoticed, it is 
precisely because it was so successful.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Today the cold war is over and there is no immediate threat to 
Canada. Hon. members are correct to assert that. However, it would 
be a mistake to conclude that  Canada can go without defences. 
Although the challenges facing us have changed and laudable 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="504"> 504 </A></B>
<P>
progress has been achieved in arms control, not all dangers have 
been eliminated. Dangers continue to be posed by the huge 
remaining stockpiles of nuclear weapons, by the proliferation of 
advanced military technology, by the transfer of technologies to 
rogue regimes and by the growing importance of space in military 
operations.
<P>
	That is why the House of Commons and Senate special joint 
committee on defence drew attention to the instability in the world 
when it brought forward its recommendations in the fall 1994. 
These instabilities were reflected in the white paper the 
government issued in December of that year.
<P>
	None of the dangers we have been talking about is of an 
immediate threat to North America, but in a world characterized by 
turbulence and uncertainty all of the dangers are real. Despite the 
emergence of a new international order, prudence dictates we must 
maintain an adequate aerospace defence capability for the longer 
term.
<P>
	NORAD's basic missions, early warning and the preservation of 
air sovereignty, are and must remain unchanged. That said, the 
NORAD agreement we placed before the House today has been 
substantially revised to meet today's specific conditions and to 
anticipate future requirements.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	NORAD has adapted to the new geopolitical and financial 
realities, in that the agreement was substantially rationalized to 
make it much more affordable. Since the agreement was last 
renewed in 1991, spending has been greatly reduced and other 
savings are contemplated.
<P>
	The agreement remains vital to Canada's defence and economic 
interests, to the establishment of close and harmonious relations 
between Canada and the U.S., as well as to international peace and 
stability.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	The NORAD agreement is the most important and most visible 
bilateral agreement on security and defence that Canada has 
entered into with the United States. It was originally signed on May 
12, 1958, and it has since been renewed, extended seven times, the 
latest renewal dating back to 1991 and carrying us over to May 12, 
1996.
<P>
	Canada-U.S. co-operation for the defence of North America was 
already well established long before 1958; after the French were 
defeated in 1940, Canada and the U.S. established a permanent 
joint board to oversee defence planning and commitments.
<P>
	A point of particular relevance to this discussion should also be 
mentioned. During the years immediately following the second 
world war, the U.S. air force and the Royal Canadian Air Force 
began working together to  ward off the launching of an attack on 
the continental air space.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This co-operation was inevitable. General Charles Foulkes, the 
chair of the Canadian joint chiefs of staff from 1951 to 1960, once 
wrote: ``There were no boundaries upstairs and the most direct air 
routes to the United States' major targets were through Canada. 
Therefore air defence was to be a joint effort from the start''.
<P>
	The original NORAD agreement put in place a binational 
command structure for fighter defence against long range Soviet 
bombers. In the mid-1960's the emphasis shifted from air defence 
to attack warning and characterization of attack in response to the 
emergence of nuclear tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles, 
ICBMs, as the primary threat to the North American continent.
<P>
	The 1975 renewal of the agreement redefined NORAD's 
mandate in the following way. First, it was to assist Canada and the 
U.S. in safeguarding sovereign air space. Second, it was to 
contribute to deterrence by providing attack warning and 
assessment of aerospace attack. Third, it was to ensure an 
appropriate response against air attack if required. NORAD has 
retained these missions in all subsequent renewals.
<P>
	Since 1975 there have been only two major modifications to the 
NORAD agreement. In 1981 NORAD changed its name from the 
North American air defence command to the North American 
aerospace defence command in keeping with the new emphasis on 
warning against ballistic missiles.
<P>
	In 1991 the definition of air sovereignty was expanded to include 
detection and monitoring of aircraft suspected of drug trafficking. 
Canada's contribution to NORAD includes aircraft surveillance 
assets, infrastructure and personnel, which represent almost 10 per 
cent of NORAD's total cost.
<P>
	Our annual expenditures include the cost of some 790 personnel 
working at NORAD headquarters at Cheyenne mountain operation 
centres on airborne early warning aircraft, at a variety of sensor 
sites and in NORAD air defence operations. Canada's four 
operational CF-18 squadrons have NORAD responsibilities on a 
rotating basis with two squadrons, one in the east and one in the 
west, out of Cold Lake and out of Bagotville, on designated state 
alert at any one time.
<P>
	In recent years the reduced threat of air attack against North 
America has necessitated the alert state's being reduced 
significantly. Should there be a crisis or war that threatens North 
America, two squadrons of CF-18s would be assigned to NORAD 
for the joint defence of Canada and the U.S. Additional resources 
could be assigned to the defence of the continent if required.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="505"> 505 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. Reform critic said the recent budget cuts in national 
defence could somehow impair our commitment to NORAD. We 
would not be bringing this agreement for renewal if we did not 
think we had the capability, notwithstanding the defence budget 
cuts, to deliver on our capability. The hon. member should be 
assured that we do have the capability and will retain the 
capability in that regard.
<P>
	In addition to the availability of the CF-18s, the Canadian 
NORAD region headquarters at North Bay operates the Canadian 
portion of the North warning system, four coastal radars and four 
forward operating locations to support fighter operations in 
Canada's north.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Like previous governments, the current Canadian government 
agrees that our country's aerospace defence needs may be very 
effectively and efficiently satisfied through NORAD. Early in 
1994, the external affairs minister and myself instructed our 
officials to undertake preliminary discussions with their American 
counterparts regarding a possible extension of the NORAD 
agreement beyond 1996.
<P>
	We were in complete support of the goals and principles of the 
existing NORAD agreement, but we had come to the conclusion 
that it had to be adjusted to meet present and future defence needs. 
From the very start, we were determined to have substantial 
changes made to ensure that the agreement is streamlined and 
brought up to date in preparation for the next century.
<P>
	Our first and most fundamental concern was the wording of the 
agreement. We felt it should more closely reflect the real world. 
The gist of it has not changed since 1981, in spite of the fact that 
the nature of North American aerospace defence has changed 
drastically. A new strategic framework has emerged since the cold 
war between east and west. In this framework, while the threat is 
greatly reduced, new challenges require a new approach and 
greater flexibility than before, when our present and future needs 
were set strictly by the cold war.
<P>
	The government also wanted to make sure that NORAD's 
mandate would be clearly set out. It also was of the opinion that a 
consultation process be established that would allow Canada to 
state its views to the United States in a more formal setting. Thus, 
the missions would be discussed on a regular basis and, if 
necessary, they would evolve very naturally.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	While these Canadian-American exploratory talks were 
underway the parliamentary committees independently reviewing 
Canada's foreign defence policies fully endorsed the renewal of 
NORAD. They did so in the context of the threat being diminished 
to North American airspace but not eliminated.
<P>
	The government followed the reports with strong statements of 
its own in favour of NORAD in two documents, ``Canada and the 
World'', the foreign policy white paper, and the 1994 defence white 
paper. In that document we spelled out in explicit terms the 
fundamental role that collective defence plays in our security, 
indeed in our sense of ourselves as a people and as responsible 
citizens of the world. The white paper pointed out we are bound to 
our allies in Europe and the United States by political values, 
interests and traditions we wish to support and foster.
<P>
	It is for that reason that Canada has participated in the 
implementation force under NATO in Bosnia. I was pleased last 
weekend to be with the Canadian men and women serving in that 
theatre who are doing a remarkable job in a short period of time to 
help bring peace and stability to Bosnia. This is a historic mission 
because it is the first time NATO has actually taken on an 
operational assignment in its 50-year history. It has shown that the 
command and control, the lessons of preparation of the last 50 
years have stood the organization in good stead for its operational 
effectiveness which I saw last weekend.
<P>
	There are practical benefits to collective defence such as 
standardized equipment and procedures and the accumulated 
experience of joint and combined operations. I certainly saw that 
last weekend. These practical benefits are valuable in our 
continuing efforts in support of collective security.
<P>
	Alliances dismantled in peacetime may be difficult to revive 
when a crisis occurs. That is why we have to keep our involvement 
in multilateral organizations such as NATO and why we must 
renew the NORAD agreement.
<P>
	It seems obvious enough but somehow this lesson was forgotten 
twice in this century when political leaders not only in Canada but 
among our allies allowed the defence establishment to run down to 
such a level that it was ill prepared when crisis came.
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	Despite the compressions in the defence budget, we are 
absolutely determined to keep a combat capable force with new 
equipment, a lean and efficient military that will serve our interests 
and will be the effective cadre, together with a revitalized reserve 
force, for mobilization should we be called on to go into a major 
conflict.
<P>
	In the 1994 report of the special joint committee on Canada's 
defence policy there was an articulation of our wider international 
responsibilities as a country:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If we believe that Canada stands for values that are worth promoting in a 
larger world, we must be prepared to invest resources and commit Canadian 
troops in defence of those values. If we are not prepared to do so then what do 
we stand for as a country?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	When President Clinton visited Ottawa in February of last year, 
he and the Prime Minister reaffirmed the intention of both
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="506"> 506 </A></B>
<P>
countries to renew the NORAD agreement. In the same month, I 
visited NORAD headquarters and toured the operation centre at 
Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado in the company of my colleague, 
the Secretary of Defence, William Perry.
<P>
	During that tour, I was really impressed by the continuing 
necessity of a co-operative, high level aerospace defence function 
for our two countries and by the competence and dedication of the 
Canadian and American personnel serving there. These people 
work side by side in an integrated command structure for the 
security of our continent. They truly reflect the special relationship 
that Canada and the United States has developed over 39 years of 
close co-operation.
<P>
	Therefore, as the men and women of Canada work, sleep and 
enjoy their lives, a group of men and women are still, in this age of 
diminished threat, constantly on watch for any threat against North 
American air space.
<P>
	Canadian and American officials continued to meet on NORAD 
renewal dossiers throughout most of last year. This has resulted in 
the agreement that we hope to sign. I hope MPs will be pleased by 
the extent to which the final draft reflects Canada's negotiating 
aims. I know the critics for the Reform and the Bloc Quebecois 
have been brought up to speed on the agreement. Briefly I want to 
touch on a couple of points before I sit down.
<P>
	The agreement transforms NORAD from a cold war defence 
arrangement to an international accord for the 1990s and beyond. 
The agreement's definition of the strategic environment as it 
affects North America is entirely new. It stresses the revolutionary 
change brought about by the end of the cold war and the progress 
that has been made in nuclear arms control.
<P>
	However, at the same time, it notes that the world has not 
become suddenly safe.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As I have already said, the threat posed by ballistic missiles may 
no longer be an imminent one. Nonetheless, we must take into 
consideration the fact that there are still large stockpiles of such 
weapons. We must also take into account current and future 
strategic developments that could impact on the security of North 
America's airspace. For example, I am thinking of the proliferation 
of mass destruction weapons and their delivery vehicles, not to 
mention the increasing use of space for military purposes.
<P>
	The new text of the agreement also provides that Canada and the 
United States must work together to monitor and control 
non-military air traffic in North-American skies. This joint effort is 
necessary to deal with the increase in legitimate air traffic, and also 
with air access to North America for illegal purposes such as drug 
trafficking.
<P>
	To ensure government transparency as well as clarity in terms of 
its goal and its policy, the agreement provides, as regards NORAD 
missions, the most detailed definition ever included in a public 
document.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	These missions are twofold. The first is aerospace warning, 
including identification of aircraft or missile threat with the 
potential of striking North America and the monitoring of 
man-made objects in space and the detection, validation and 
forewarning of attack, whether by aircraft, missiles or space 
vehicles, using mutual support arrangements with other 
commands.
<P>
	Second, aerospace control, which includes providing effective 
surveillance and control of North American air space from routine 
peacetime surveillance through a defence attack from aircraft or 
cruise missiles.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	Before I conclude, I am pleased to announce a heightened level 
of agreed consultation between the two governments and on a 
formal mechanism for the consultation on developments with 
implications for aerospace.
<P>
	As my colleague, the Minister of Foreign Affairs has said, any of 
those disagreements or clarifications will be sent to the permanent 
joint board on defence. I am pleased to note that the chairman of 
the board has been re-appointed for another term and is a member 
of the House, the hon. member for Parkdale-High Park, who has 
done a terrific job over the last year, ensuring Canada's interests.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to put a question to the defence minister about the demilitarization 
of the Arctic. I am familiar with the situation in the Antarctic, to 
the south of Chile and Argentina, which the international 
community agreed to recognize as a demilitarized zone. Everything 
went very well; every state with some territories in the Antarctic, as 
well as all of the international community I think, agreed to 
co-operate.
<P>
	What is the position of the Canadian government on the 
demilitarization of the Arctic? Is the government ready to open 
discussions with Russia on this issue? I would like to see the Arctic 
demilitarized in the years to come.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collenette:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member talks of his 
earlier life in Chile and of the demilitarization of the Antarctic 
region. This was possible because the same degree of international 
threat was not prevalent.
<P>
	The Canadian Arctic and the Arctic generally was for 50 years 
the potential battleground between the Soviet Union and the United 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="507"> 507 </A></B>
<P>
States, Canada and its allies.  Therefore, strategically the Arctic has 
historically occupied a different place in geopolitics.
<P>
	The goal was for demilitarization in general. In a perfect world 
we would not need armies, air forces or navies. We would all be 
peaceful people and get along with each other. However it is 
somewhat naive to believe that we are even close to that state in the 
world. In fact, as we are debating, we see potential hostile acts 
occurring off the coast of China with respect to exercises by that 
government. That shows the level of threat is everywhere, not just 
in the Arctic but around the world.
<P>
	With respect to the Arctic, we have to be prudent. We have to 
realize that our security has to be protected and we must recognize 
that means a military presence through warning systems and 
communication devices in the Arctic until such time as the threat 
over the Arctic is diminished.
<P>
	This is not particularly my field, but I am sure the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs would say that even while we still look forward to 
maintaining our defence over the Arctic, we can still work with 
countries such as Russia and others who have an interest in the 
Arctic to make sure that pollution is controlled and environmental 
concerns generally are respected.
<P>
	Moving forward with this agreement does not preclude 
movement on those fronts.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened carefully to the minister. At the beginning of his speech, he 
referred to comments some hon. members from this side of the 
House have made so far, including me, about how this debate will 
really influence the decision the government is about to make or 
will make in the next few days concerning the renewal of the 
NORAD agreement.
<P>
	I was pleased to hear the minister say, and I am ready to believe 
him, that this debate is relevant and that the government intends to 
take into consideration what is said in today's debate when the time 
comes to make a decision.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	However, I cannot help but be a little sceptical. In his speech, the 
minister described the process which will ultimately lead to the 
renewal of the NORAD agreement. He described the whole 
process. So, I am a little bewildered, since the negotiations with our 
American partners are over and, from what I hear, the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs is expected to travel to Washington to sign the 
agreement very shortly, on the 13th or 14th of this month.
<P>
	Therefore, following today's debate, can the government really 
take into consideration all the information and the suggestions we 
have for them? I put the same question to the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs  earlier, but, unfortunately, his speech was not followed by a 
question and comment period, so he could not answer. Maybe the 
Minister of National Defence will provide the House with an 
answer.
<P>
	Technically, is it possible for the government, following this 
debate, to reopen the negotiations with our American partners in 
order to include a number of recommendations made by members 
from Quebec and elsewhere in Canada, including the ones I made 
about the demilitarization of the Arctic and the integration of new 
member states in the NORAD agreement? Is it possible to reopen 
the negotiations on some of these issues before the agreement is to 
be signed? Or is this only an exercise in futility, where we debate 
the NORAD agreement, knowing full well that, in the end, not a lot 
can be changed before the agreement is ratified?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collenette:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am somewhat distressed at the 
cynicism the hon. member displays in his question.
<P>
	The debate today is the conclusion of a two-year process in this 
Parliament of discussing NORAD renewal. His colleague, the hon. 
member for Charlesbourg, the critic for the Bloc Quebecois, was on 
the special joint committee on defence and NORAD was discussed. 
In fact, committee members may have even visited Colorado 
Springs and certainly got full briefings on North American air 
defence.
<P>
	We have had other discussions of NORAD at the parliamentary 
committee during the estimates when the chief of staff, other 
military officials and public servants have been present. Today is a 
full day's debate on the discussions that we have had with the U.S. 
on the draft agreement. The critics of the other parties have been 
fully briefed.
<P>
	The hon. member talks of being inspired, and if indeed there are 
inspiring insights that are revealed today in the debate, yes, they 
will be taken into account by the government. We can still go back 
to our American colleagues and say that we had a debate in the 
House of Commons and an interesting point was raised on this 
particular item which we feel should be taken into account before 
the agreement is signed.
<P>
	Knowing the co-operative nature of discussions that have gone 
on between the Americans and the Canadians, I am sure we would 
be able to reflect those concerns in the final document.
<P>
	Perhaps the hon. member lives in a somewhat cynical world. I 
live in a much more idealistic world which says that when the 
government comes to the House of Commons and says it really and 
sincerely wants to hear from hon. members, the transcript will be 
looked at. Officials are listening to the debate, watching television, 
and all those comments will be taken into account before the 
agreement goes to cabinet and is signed.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on the government motion to renew the NORAD 
agreement. As my colleague from Verchères has already pointed 
out, along with the ministers of foreign affairs and defence, this is a 
longstanding agreement due to be renewed in May 1996.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	All speakers have agreed on the agreement's beneficial effects in 
a variety of areas, as well as on its role in advanced observation, 
detection and surveillance of air space.
<P>
	I am sure all members are aware that, without the NORAD 
agreement and the U.S. financial contribution, Canada could never 
have afforded such a sophisticated and effective facility in the 
north. Clearly, as my colleague has already pointed out, the Bloc 
Quebecois totally supports renewal of the NORAD agreement.
<P>
	As I have already stated, this agreement has provided Canada 
with heightened surveillance potential at an affordable cost, as well 
as a wealth of information. For instance, I have in mind satellite 
surveillance. Canada made no financial contribution to it, but 
access under the NORAD agreement, and receives information of 
undeniable usefulness to a variety of fields.
<P>
	I think what has been said indicates clearly, however, that there 
is unanimous agreement that NORAD itself is a child of the cold 
war, dating back to a time when there was a threat of Russian 
invasion of North America, with bombers or medium to long range 
ballistic missiles. I will spare you the various names attached to the 
metre per second performance or the range of each missile 
according to their classification. This was the threat that gave rise 
to the NORAD agreement during the cold war.
<P>
	Later, agreements between the U.S. and Russia were signed at 
the end of the cold war, which put an end to missile detection and 
altered NORAD's role to some extent. I think this year's renewal 
will bring a new shift. Clearly as the minister or even my colleague 
for Verchères has said, we cannot simply drop this agreement.
<P>
	Obviously, if the government decided to abolish the radar 
installations in the north on the grounds that, with the NORAD 
agreement, satellite detection would be sufficient, we would no 
longer need these infrastructures. It is nevertheless a facility paid 
for, as I said earlier, in part by Canada and in part by the United 
States, which therefore has meant the latest high efficiency 
equipment and which should continue to operate in order to provide 
air surveillance.
<P>
	Although the Soviet threat disappeared following the end of the 
cold war, air space surveillance remains a priority, to my mind, but 
not perhaps because of the potential threat of invasion. I was 
listening to the  minister earlier, who said that Canada will retain 
full military capability in order to defend its sovereignty.
<P>
	I always chuckle a bit when I hear that, because experts, even 
those from the Department of National Defence, have often said 
that, with our long coastline and our huge air space over both 
Canadian and Quebec territory, we have neither the resources nor 
the funds needed to go at it alone and defend our sovereignty.
<P>
	It is a bit unrealistic to think that we alone can defend our 
immense territory despite budget cuts, which could have in fact 
been even somewhat more substantial than those the minister 
announced this year. Even if the budget were increased, we would 
never have what it takes to defend our immense air space and 
coastline on our own. We need only look at NORAD.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	I believe that, under this kind of arrangement, Canada has done 
what it could, agreeing that the Americans would provide 
technology and funds in exchange for using the Canadian territory 
to monitor the North American air space.
<P>
	The reopening of this agreement between two countries 
negotiating according to their resources reminds me of what we 
mentioned in our dissenting report on the defence policy review, 
that is that Canada should conclude alliances or agreements and 
supply only what it is able to supply, given its financial resources.
<P>
	As I said before, those who believe that we can defend our 
territory with the limited resources we have right now are 
dreaming, especially in today's economic climate. Through its 
reputation, its participation in peacekeeping missions and 
diplomatic negotiations, Canada is offering its partners, its allies 
all it can financially.
<P>
	I believe that Canada cannot afford to withdraw from NORAD, 
which has been very profitable for both Canada and the United 
States, especially in financial terms.
<P>
	At this point, I would like to add that, unfortunately, when we 
reviewed the defence policy, we touched only briefly on the 
NORAD agreement. We met with Defence representatives who 
explained the 1991 agreement and the changes made since then.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois said on several occasions both on the 
foreign affairs committee and the committee in charge of reviewing 
defence policy that the NORAD agreement should be expanded in 
terms of its role, its mission and its partners.
<P>
	I believe that the minister has redefined its role very well; its role 
is to provide early warning and to monitor air space, which in 
Canada includes searching for civilian aircraft that might be 
involved in drug trafficking. I believe that in this respect the United 
States has been slower to act than Canada. During talks on this new 
agreement and at the time of signing, I think Canada  should 
suggest an increase in membership, their involvement being in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="509"> 509 </A></B>
<P>
accordance with their military or financial potential, and also some 
changes in the role of NORAD.
<P>
	It is often said in military circles that some agreements should 
not be abandoned in time of peace, that we should not demilitarize 
in peace time; we should not lose our combat capability, because 
should a conflict arise we would have problems restoring the 
severed links or the cancelled agreements.
<P>
	I recognize that we could call this being wary of any potential 
conflict. However, I think we should remember that North America 
itself never had any wars, but always participated with its allies in 
the search for solutions to various conflicts. I believe the role of 
Canada, Quebec and the United States is to continue in that 
direction.
<P>
	However, I would like to say, because it was mentioned by the 
Bloc Quebecois in its minority report, that there is currently a war 
which, in my opinion, might be more deadly, more real and more 
obvious that any hypothetical cataclysm or conflict which could 
bring about loss of human lives, and I am thinking about the drug 
problem, the problem of drug trafficking, mainly in the U.S., but 
also in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	We know that the detection systems of NORAD could be applied 
to the fight against drug traffickers with great effectiveness. 
According to information coming from the Department of National 
Defence we are about to acquire a new coastal system which would 
allow detection as far as 250 miles from shore, and this would be 
useful to monitor both fishing activities and drug smuggling.
<P>
	Unfortunately, neither the Americans nor the Canadians seem 
willing to acknowledge the financial and human problems, the 
society problems, created by drugs coming into the country in 
scores of places, because of the vastness of the North American 
territory. I find it hard to understand how we can contemplate 
spending money on things like equipment, weapons, antitank 
missiles, radars, perhaps even helicopters and antisubmarine 
equipment, when the social fabric in large metropolitan areas, 
especially in the U.S. and Canada, is disintegrating before our very 
eyes-because of the mafia's growing influence, among other 
things-when we could make very effective use of NORAD's 
monitoring capabilities, including satellite and AWACS 
surveillance, the DEW line and even coastal radars, to detect any 
small boat or aircraft that could then be intercepted very easily.
<P>
	Instead, we see the potential for invasion. It is in this regard that 
I question the real evolution of NORAD. Canada has very 
often-even more often than the U.S.-taken part in missions in 
various parts of Europe, Africa and Asia. Although North America 
is not experiencing any conflict like that in Europe, there is still  a 
kind of plague that, in the last 30 years, has killed in my opinion as 
many if not more people than all the conflicts elsewhere on this 
planet, and yet we do nothing about it.
<P>
	I find it somewhat puzzling that we are not using our defence 
capabilities to address a very serious social problem as well as 
negotiating and refining agreements with other countries to address 
this problem.
<P>
	In closing, like my colleague for Verchères, I would like to tell 
the minister-who told us that, for all practical purposes, 
negotiations had been completed but that we could still make 
suggestions-that I hope he will take into consideration the Bloc 
Quebecois' suggestions, which I feel are very important. First, 
allow more countries to join NORAD, broaden NORAD's role and 
mission without focusing on potential star wars or invaders, but 
continue to use this defence technology infrastructure. I would also 
suggest some civilian or parliamentary monitoring of these defence 
partnerships which, I think, could be very useful to American 
society.

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it was a pleasure to hear the hon. member for 
Charlesbourg make positive comments about the NORAD 
agreement and the possibility of its enlargement.
<P>
	Of even more pleasure to my ears was to hear the hon. member 
for Charlesbourg talk about support of the integrity of Canadian 
sovereignty. I emphasize the words he used on Canadian 
sovereignty and the membership in this by all sovereignists 
together in a united Canada. I do not know if he meant it, but that is 
the way it came across to me. I thank him for that support. We are 
all working toward it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jacob:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that the hon. member 
took what said that way, because that is not at all what I meant. I 
even stated in my speech that Canada should not consider 
preserving its sovereignty, or so-called territorial integrity, all by 
itself. I had no such thing in mind. What the parliamentary 
secretary was suggesting is that, deep down in my speech, one 
could read that I stood for Canadian unity. Far be it from me to 
address constitutional issues while dealing with the NORAD 
agreement. I was speaking as a citizen of Quebec, of Canada and of 
North America.
<P>
	I regret that, in a discussion of capital importance in my view, 
elements of a political game are introduced that do not have their 
place in considering an international agreement like this one. I 
would suggest that the parliamentary secretary keep his digs for our 
upcoming discussions at the defence committee.

	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I perused the opposition member's statement on sovereignty.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate on the 
renewal of the North American aerospace defence command, or 
NORAD agreement. NORAD has been one of the pillars of the 
Canadian-American defence relationship for nearly 40 years. It 
symbolizes the long tradition of friendship and co-operation which 
exists between Canada and the United States.
<P>
	Throughout the cold war NORAD provided our countries with 
effective means of defending the North American continent against 
possible air attack. It also proved to be a highly flexible agreement 
adapting to meet new threats. I will take this opportunity to trace 
the evolution of NORAD and in particular to discuss the ways it 
evolved to meet today's challenges.
<P>
	With this new agreement the government will equip NORAD to 
deal with new domestic and international circumstances while at 
the same time preserving the benefits of our longstanding 
co-operation with the United States in the aerospace defence field.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	After the second world war, the cold war gave rise to a new 
threat, that of an intercontinental bomber force capable of 
launching a nuclear attack on North America.
<P>
	That is what prompted Canada and the United States to deploy 
forces to counter this threat. However, the level of co-operation 
between the our two countries in terms of continental air defence 
remained limited for some years.
<P>
	Things changed in 1958, with the signing of the NORAD 
agreement, which integrated Canadian and American air defence 
resources.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	Our governments had come to recognize that it was much more 
efficient and effective to work together to ensure air defence. And 
they still think so.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Over the years the original mission of NORAD which was to 
control entry into sovereign air space, to provide a warning of 
attack and to respond to the attack if necessary, has been modified 
to keep pace with the changing weapons technologies. From 1958 
to 1962 NORAD focused on defending against bombers. NORAD 
employed American and Canadian interceptor  aircraft, American 
air defence artillery and Canadian based surface to air missiles. Our 
collective radar resources at the time consisted of the Canadian 
based distance early warning, mid-Canada and pinetree lines as 
well as some United States based radar systems.
<P>
	In 1962 as the superpowers kicked their ballistic missile 
programs into high gear, NORAD adjusted its operational posture 
to that of deterrence. Although NORAD still had to contend with 
the bomber threat, its main focus shifted to missile warning, space 
intelligence and target identification. The mid-Canada line was 
dismantled and the pinetree line and the United States radar 
systems were reduced. As well, the number of American and 
Canadian interceptor aircraft were reduced from 1,600 to 500.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In the 1980s, the development of cruise missiles that could be 
launched from aircraft or submarines once again changed the 
nature of the threat hanging over North America. At the operational 
level, NORAD continued to put the emphasis on the same 
elements, but it made some changes regarding the deployment of 
its forces.
<P>
	For example, forward operating locations in Canada's north were 
organized so that NORAD's airplanes could intercept cruise 
missile carrying aircraft before they could launch their missiles.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It was also during this period in 1981 that NORAD changed its 
name from North American Air Defence Command to the North 
American Aerospace Defence Command, reflecting the new 
emphasis on the space based satellites to warn against missiles.
<P>
	At the end of the cold war NORAD has entered yet another stage 
in its development. The end of the superpower rivalry lifted the 
shadow of a nuclear Armageddon and for now eliminated the threat 
of attack against the North American continent. But the new 
strategic environment remains far from stable. Weapons of mass 
destruction and their means of delivery still exist and their 
proliferation especially among rogue states could in time pose a 
major threat to North America. Facing an uncertain future, we 
cannot afford to let down our guard completely. NORAD therefore 
still has a role to play in preserving our security.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Under the new agreement, giving the alert in case of an 
aerospace attack against North America will continue to be 
NORAD's main mission, along with the surveillance and control of 
North America's air space, including legal and illegal air traffic. 
NORAD must also continue to evolve, and the new agreement will 
ensure that it is the case.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="511"> 511 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canada and the United States have already decided to reduce 
operating levels for air defence and ground based radar 
surveillance for our northern approaches. However we will 
maintain the capability to conduct the appropriate levels of 
operations at full readiness should the need arise.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Should a strategic threat to the continent arise in the future, we 
will have enough equipment, infrastructure and expertise to build 
up our NORAD forces again. Canada currently contributes 720 
personnel to NORAD as well as a number of CF-18 aircraft on 
continuous air sovereignty alert.
<P>
	NORAD will remain a flexible arrangement that can take on new 
roles as circumstances dictate. The new agreement will stress the 
importance of close consultation between our two governments as 
NORAD moves into the 21st century.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	NORAD remains a pillar of North America's security system. It 
also remains a highly effective and economical defence agreement.
<P>
	NORAD was set up almost 40 years ago. Canadian and U.S. 
governments still feel that it makes more sense to accomplish 
together the missions and the duties of that command.
<P>
	Since Canada's territory is very wide and since our armed forces 
are relatively limited in numbers, it would very difficult for us to 
conduct aerospace defence operations alone.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Although control of our air sovereignty would be possible, air 
defence would be difficult. Canada also depends entirely on the 
assistance of the United States to provide warning of ballistic 
missile attack both at home and in other theatres where Canadians 
could be threatened. For example, during the gulf war, Canadians 
in the Persian Gulf donned protective gear and gathered in shelters 
after receiving warnings based on NORAD assessments of 
impending scud missile attacks.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member's time has expired. 
Questions or comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is: 
Would the member please conclude his remarks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richardson:</B> Mr. Speaker, Canada also benefits greatly 
from American intelligence, technology and expertise, all of which 
help us maintain essential military capabilities. We must not forget 
that NORAD is a cost effective exercise for Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our annual contribution to NORAD is only 10 per cent of total 
costs. Should it decide to assume alone its aerospace defence, the 
costs to Canada would be prohibitive.
<P>
	Moreover, only 12 per cent of NORAD's total operation costs are 
related to headquarters. The rest is directly related to NORAD's 
operational activities. In other words, NORAD uses its resources 
efficiently.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In conclusion, shared values and interests have made Canada and 
the United States trusted friends and allies. Our defence partnership 
stands out in this respect. Our defence relations have been close 
and always successful. NORAD is a case in point. The challenge of 
co-ordinating activities of two air forces against a wide range of 
threats has never been easy but NORAD has proven equal to the 
task.
<P>
	NORAD's success can be traced above all to its flexibility. 
Although its basic objectives have endured over the years, NORAD 
has responded to an evolving strategic assessment. Canadian forces 
personnel associated with NORAD have performed an essential 
national service over the years with skill and dedication. This new 
agreement gives them the opportunity to continue this service.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):</B> 
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for this opportunity to take part in this 
debate on the importance of NORAD. I want to share a few salient 
points about NORAD with my distinguished parliamentary 
colleagues.
<P>
	NORAD was set up about 39 years ago to provide for common 
air defence of North America. The first NORAD agreement was 
concluded in 1958, that is in the year following the creation of the 
command.
<P>
	At first, NORAD was organized in such a way as to counter the 
threat posed by Soviet bombers, but it evolved over the years in 
response to the transformation of the strategic context.
<P>
	In the early sixties, NORAD had to develop warning capabilities 
against intercontinental ballistic missiles, to add to the capabilities 
against long range aircraft that were already in place. Those were 
the main threats during the sixties and the seventies. However, the 
introduction of sophisticated cruise missiles in the Soviet military 
arsenal led to other adjustments in the defence capabilities of 
NORAD in the eighties.
<P>
	As NORAD adapted to the changing threat, its facilities and its 
infrastructure were changed. Thus the old radar facilities were 
replaced or closed down,  operations centres were regrouped and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="512"> 512 </A></B>
<P>
the number of aircraft available to NORAD was considerably 
reduced.
<P>
	Thanks to such adjustments, NORAD has been able to retain its 
operational and financial efficiency and effectiveness, because the 
command continually adjusted to new developments.
<P>
	NORAD is well known for its flexibility, efficiency, and 
effectiveness, and it still serves the security interests of both 
countries very well. Without NORAD, it would be difficult if not 
impossible to protect these interests. These elements still have an 
important role to play, as was evident in discussions on the renewal 
of the agreement in 1996.
<P>
	The command and control structure of NORAD has also 
developed over the years into the integrated structure we now have. 
Representatives of both countries are found at all levels of that 
structure. This means that Canadians and Americans work in close 
co-operation at all levels of the NORAD organization in both 
countries.
<P>
	NORAD headquarters are located in Colorado Springs, 
Colorado. The commander-in-chief is an American general, and 
the deputy commander-in-chief is a lieutenant-general of the 
Canadian forces.
<P>
	There are also three regional headquarters. One is in the Alaska 
region of NORAD, at Elmendorf air force base, near Anchorage, 
Alaska. The headquarters of the Canadian region are located at the 
base of the 22nd wing in North Bay. Finally, the headquarters for 
continental U.S.A. are at Tyndall air force base, Florida.
<P>
	Regional headquarters in the United States are under the 
command of American major-generals. Canadian 
brigadier-generals act as deputy commanding officers: the 
Canadian sector is commanded by a Canadian major-general and 
an American brigadier-general acts as deputy.
<P>
	Although the NORAD agreement has been renewed every five 
years, the text of the agreement has not been revised since 1981. 
The objectives mentioned in the 1981 agreement were taken from 
the 1975 renewed agreement. This means that these objectives are 
now more than 20 years old.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	The objectives are to help each country protect the sovereignty 
of its airspace, including the fight against drug trafficking; to 
prevent attacks against North America by maintaining our 
capabilities in aerospace surveillance, early warning, 
characterization of aerospace attacks and defense against air 
attacks.
<P>
	The special joint committees on the defence policy and the 
foreign policy of Canada both examined the issue of future 
Canadian participation in NORAD. It was recommended that 
Canada continue to participate in NORAD, in consultations on the 
renewal of the NORAD agreement and in policy analyses. It is not 
surprising that  the 1994 white paper on defence also reflected this 
point of view.
<P>
	Even though most Canadians take NORAD for granted, it is 
worth pointing out all the benefits Canada derives from its role in 
the command. NORAD is first and foremost the principal 
institution protecting Canada's air sovereignty. If it were not a 
member of NORAD, Canada would have to spend considerable 
sums of money on command and control resources, satellites and 
aircraft for protection similar to the one provided by this 
organization.
<P>
	Canada assumes approximately 10 per cent of total operating 
costs of NORAD, and it would be quite difficult to find a more cost 
effective arrangement. NORAD also offers other benefits besides 
protection of our air space. NORAD could very well have become 
the principal symbol of Canada-US co-operation in defence 
matters.
<P>
	NORAD contributes greatly to dialogue and co-operation and 
often enables Canada to exercise, in security matters, more 
influence than it would be able to otherwise. Besides being 
conducive to goodwill, NORAD provides Canada with practical 
and measurable benefits.
<P>
	The sharing of information is one of the most important practical 
benefits. Canada enjoys a special relationship with the United 
States. As its ally, it is first among its equals. Because of this, 
Canada has access to invaluable strategic information from space 
based resources that it does not have and does not have the means 
to acquire.
<P>
	Access to advanced technology is another benefit of NORAD. 
For example, we took part with the United States in research and 
development projects on radars in space. As Canada acquired some 
knowledge in the field, it was invited to participate fully in a 
United States-United Kingdom technology exchange program on 
space based surveillance systems. Generally speaking, our 
co-operation with the United States in NORAD allows us to keep 
abreast of the latest developments in aerospace.
<P>
	On the operational level, the Canadian Armed Forces get 
significant benefits from their participation in NORAD. Canadian 
Forces can really work together with American forces in complex 
military situations thanks to the many years of practical experience 
they got in joint planning and in NORAD operations.
<P>
	The professional training the aircrews, air weapons technicians 
and air traffic controllers get by participating in NORAD is almost 
irreplaceable and it does not compare with the training the 
Canadian forces could give on their own. Since our fiscal situation 
will remain tight in the near future, the operational benefits we 
derive from NORAD will be essential to the maintenance of our 
army's skills in aerospace defence.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="513"> 513 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	The NORAD agreement is undoubtedly the most significant 
defence agreement concluded between Canada and the United 
States. It has given us many benefits for nearly 40 years et should 
continue to do so well after the year 2000, given the changes we 
have agreed to make.
<P>
	Through renewal of the agreement, NORAD will remain a key 
component of Canada's defence position. Consequently, it will 
allow our country to continue to defend its interests.
<P>
	Canada's participation in NORAD is clearly beneficial, both in 
terms of operations and of economics. Without NORAD, it would 
be absolutely impossible for Canada to ensure its aerospace 
defence as effectively, even if it continued to devote the same 
amount of money to this task.
<P>
	In brief, NORAD is a good deal for Canada and I support it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this is yet another Liberal pretence of parliamentary consultation 
on an important defence issue. There is to be no vote and the 
outcome is a foregone conclusion because all parties are on record 
as approving the continuation of Canada's participation in the 
NORAD agreement.
<P>
	At the risk of dating myself, I first became involved in NORAD 
in 1958, shortly after it came into force. That was an employment 
in Quebec at place called Mont Apica and following that to Ontario 
and to Vancouver. Over the intervening years I continued a 
sporadic involvement in NORAD matters until my final tour in 
NORAD at McCord air force base, 25th air division headquarters, 
Tacoma, Washington.
<P>
	I have since been involved in studying NORAD through my 
membership on the special joint committee on Canada's defence 
policy. In that capacity we looked at NORAD in detail and visited 
NORAD headquarters at Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado Springs.
<P>
	The primary objective of NORAD, of course, is to protect 
Canadian and U.S. air space. By maintaining a known and capable 
aerospace surveillance we expect and hope to deter attack. If that 
deterrent should fail it is the responsibility of NORAD to identify 
the threat, to characterize the type of air attack and respond 
appropriately by the effective deployment of either Canadian or 
American aeroplanes or both.
<P>
	Obviously with the end of the cold war the situation in NORAD 
has changed and there have been ongoing consultations to 
incorporate appropriate new postures. Starting in 1994 there have 
been studies by various agencies including the Department of 
National Defence, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the 
Department of International Trade, the American Department of  
Defence, the State Department and, as I mentioned a few moments 
ago, the special joint committee on Canada's defence policy. It has 
also been discussed in the Standing Committee on National 
Defence and Veterans Affairs and with the Department of Foreign 
Affairs and the Department of National Defence.
<P>
	This had led to a unanimous endorsement of Canada's continued 
participation in NORAD. This agreement is soon to be approved 
for a further five years and Reform is and has been on record as 
supporting NORAD.
<P>
	This is a good deal. Canada's share of the expense in NORAD is 
10 per cent of the total cost, about $320 million. It promotes 
goodwill between our countries and provides benefits such as 
intelligence sharing from which we acquire knowledge.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	It gives us access to leading edge technology, not only with the 
United States but also with other countries such as the U.K. We 
also share research and development activities. This assures 
Canada's aerospace sovereignty and provides untold benefits to us. 
I say again NORAD is a good deal for Canada.
<P>
	Speaking of good deals and Canadian sovereignty, what about 
the four British Upholder submarines? They are modern. They are 
almost new. I understand that two of them have barely been used. 
They are capable. Unlike the description that some people give to 
them, they are not hunter-killer, they are patrol submarines.
<P>
	Canada has developed and maintained an expertise that took 
years to acquire. Continuing our submarine practice would enable 
us to pay our NATO dues to an extent by providing submarines as 
targets not only for Canadian but for all NATO forces. Being a 
member of the submarine club provides intelligence information 
that is of great benefit to Canada. People do not want submarines 
running into each other under water, so they advise each other 
where their submarines are located.
<P>
	This acquisition would provide Canada with the ability to patrol 
both coasts, which is something we cannot do full time at the 
present time. With the advent of air independent propulsion or AIP, 
these submarines would provide an under ice capability which 
would answer a lot of critics who look at the northern waters and 
say Canada can do nothing about them. This is not a nuclear 
capability. It is in the vicinity 14 days submerged but it would 
provide the ability for Canadian submarines to transit the 
Northwest Passage and certainly to seek out anyone who is there 
without permission.
<P>
	Submarines are cost effective. They have relatively small crews, 
about 45 in the Upholder, and they can be sent off for a long time 
without having to be replenished.
<P>
	Submarines are surreptitious and thus they are very effective 
against, for instance, ships jettisoning garbage; tankers or 
freighters who choose to pump their oily bilge in Canadian waters;
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="514"> 514 </A></B>
<P>
foreign fishers in restricted waters; drug smugglers; and illegal 
immigrants. In a lot of ways, they are similar to what NORAD 
assists Canada in doing.
<P>
	Furthermore, submarines are effective because when people 
know you have them but do not know where they are, they have to 
take this into account when they operate. There are well over 600 
submarines in use in the world today and more under construction. 
Forty-four different countries operate them, countries like Iran or 
Libya. They were a factor in the former Yugoslavia. They had five 
submarines in that area and we had to take note of them. Most 
people are aware that there is an active submarine building 
program under way in China.
<P>
	Because of its effectiveness and economy, the submarine is 
really becoming a weapon of choice for a lot of countries. If I might 
give one example of the effect it can have, if we go back to the 
Falklands, one British submarine tied up the entire Argentinian 
fleet by being on patrol outside the harbour. They have an effect 
and ability to influence operations far beyond their normal 
capacity.
<P>
	Submarines have been recommended by the special joint 
committee on Canada's defence policy and they were included in 
the white paper. What we have is a government which lacks 
resolution. It has reduced the defence budget by some $800 million 
over the following three years but it is prepared to give away $24 
million to put a UN force in Haiti rather than recoup the funds from 
the UN.
<P>
	The government is procrastinating unnecessarily and perhaps it 
is going to forgo this possessed and needed expertise and 
capability. I refer to a statement by the Minister of National 
Defence previously when he pointed out that NORAD, an 
agreement signed and conducted in peacetime, if it were not 
renewed might be difficult to reacquire were we to go to war. I say 
the same thing with regard to our submarine expertise. It is 
something that has taken many years to acquire and surely we 
should not forgo it lightly.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	The same questionable judgment is involved in delaying the 
maritime helicopter buy. This is a deliberate gamble which will 
endanger maritime helicopter crews by extending the time they 
have to fly the antiquated Sea King.
<P>
	It brings the question to mind, is the government deliberately 
reducing Canada's military capability to the point where it 
becomes ineffective? We know that former Prime Minister Trudeau 
was heading that way until he discovered the ill effects it would 
have on Canada's trade relations in Europe. Is it a coincidence that 
our present Prime Minister was a member of Mr. Trudeau's cabinet 
and presumably supported his thrust?
<P>
	The submarine decision apparently has been left in the hands of 
the Prime Minister. I wish I could but I do not have much 
confidence in the fair, practical consideration that submarine 
acquisition will be given.
<P>
	We know that one of the Prime Minister's closest advisers, the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, thinks the Canadian forces should 
become simply peacekeepers, this despite all the evidence which 
confirms that the best peacekeeper is a combat capable sailor, 
soldier or air crew.
<P>
	What should happen here is that the good, the needs of Canada 
should prevail over politically correct positioning. Despite the 
recommendations of the special joint committee on Canada's 
defence policy that 66,700 was the absolute minimum to which the 
Canadian forces could be reduced without giving up capability, this 
government is headed for 60,000, several thousand under the 
recommended minimum. It is my position that the recommended 
figure was already marginal or too low. Look at what the Liberals 
propose to do to the reserves.
<P>
	Is there a threat to justify NORAD'S continuation? There are 
still a great number of ballistic missiles armed with nuclear 
warheads that can reach North America. There is a proliferation of 
ballistic missile technology and we need to continue to improve 
methods of missile event protection, assessment and warning.
<P>
	Furthermore, the role of space is becoming more important. We 
must remember there are still more than 20,000 nuclear weapons in 
the world. At present there are about 170 to 200 missile events each 
year, half of which are space launches. In comparison, missile 
events peaked in the late-1980s at 1,400, but this is still a 
substantial number and the technology is improving.
<P>
	By 2001, which will be the next NORAD renewal, space will 
assume an even greater role in aerospace defence. Also, the new 
cruise missile technology may lead to a North American threat. 
These missiles are becoming smaller and more accurate. They can 
be deployed from any number of vehicles, a freighter, a small 
aeroplane, a submarine and so on.
<P>
	Examples of countries that are proceeding with this type of 
equipment are North Korea and China, both of whom have a 
missile capability to strike Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. We 
have seen the flexing of China's muscle recently in the run up to the 
Taiwan election.
<P>
	Peace and global stability are achieved from a position of 
strength, deterrence and a balance of power, not through the vain 
hope that reasonable positions or responsible actions are likely to 
prevail. Any such hope is an illusion.
<P>
	There has been and still is considerable concern and mistrust 
among Central American, South American and Caribbean 
countries when it comes to co-operative ventures with the United 
States. They have a perception that U.S. interests will overpower 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="515"> 515 </A></B>
<P>
partnership,  resulting in the concerns of smaller states being 
ignored or overruled.
<P>
	However, NORAD, by clearly demonstrating that an effective, 
considerate and balanced partnership can exist between the only 
remaining superpower and a relatively small-at least in 
population-neighbour is an example that a security organization 
like NATO has become in Europe could be possible within the 
Americas. Thus NORAD could be the basis from which an 
Americas defence security organization emerges.
<P>
	OAS, the Organization of American States, would seem to be the 
logical genesis for such an organization. However, my admittedly 
limited exposure to the OAS has revealed that the apprehension I 
referred to earlier is embedded in that body. Whether there is or 
will be a perceived need for an Americas defence security 
organization, I do not know. However, I do know that if an example 
of balanced and co-operative partnership between the U.S. and a 
smaller, much less powerful state is required, NORAD provides 
that example.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	In conclusion, NORAD has been and is a success story in which 
it is in Canada's best interests to continue participation.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to make a 
couple of remarks about the speech that was made by my friend 
from Saanich-Gulf Islands.
<P>
	First, since it has occurred twice now in the debate with respect 
to America's defences, not just North America but South America, 
I should tell the hon. member that Mr. Perry, my counterpart in the 
United States, convened a meeting of all defence ministers of the 
Americas for the first time in Williamsburg last October. A second 
meeting will be held later this year. We are starting to develop links 
with those countries through trade. Therefore, it is natural that 
security questions should be discussed also.
<P>
	Second, I want to take note of the hon. member's criticism of my 
colleague, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, whom he alleges has 
said that the defence forces of Canada exist solely for 
peacekeeping. That was not what the minister said and the hon. 
member knows that is not true.
<P>
	The fact is that peacekeeping is the most visible portion of our 
defence effort because we have been involved in so many 
peacekeeping efforts. The participation in IFOR in the last couple 
of months, the first NATO force to which I alluded earlier, shows 
that there are other bilateral arrangements and engagements in 
which we take part.
<P>
	It is true that many in Canada believe that Canadian defence 
forces should be relegated solely to peacekeeping. Those people 
are wrong. Canada has armed forces for: first, domestic assistance 
to the civil authority; second, in defence of sovereignty, which is 
what we are talking about today with NORAD; and third, the 
involvement in multilateral assignments, most of which have been 
the UN but it is not exclusively so.
<P>
	Last, I would just like to comment on the hon. member's 
continual reference to expenditure cuts in the defence budget which 
he is tying into the NORAD debate. I find it somewhat odd that 
Reform Party members, who have campaigned for the last few 
years on slashing the deficit and have chastised the Minister of 
Finance for not going fast enough, are being somewhat selective. 
When they do not like expenditure cuts in certain areas they then 
have some other justification for their position. We saw this in their 
defence of social programs when we know the Reform Party is out 
to demolish social programs. There is a bit of incoherence here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Frazer:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. minister for his 
intervention.
<P>
	I am delighted to hear there has been some ongoing consultation 
with American defence ministers with regard to the establishment 
of a defence/security mechanism for the Americas. I hope that my 
reference to the NORAD example as being a workable indication 
that this will suit people will be taken forward.
<P>
	With regard to the comments about Reform's budget cutting 
policies, what we say is that if a capacity is required then it should 
be provided. If it cannot be provided as an adequate capacity then it 
is not worthwhile supporting. The money should go where it is 
needed and there should be sufficient funds to make it work 
properly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Otherwise, why do it?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Frazer:</B> When the minister referred to the Reform position 
on social policies, he is forgetting what was said during the 
campaign. We said that the biggest single threat to social policies in 
Canada is the interest payments on the debt. That is exactly where 
we are right now. Since this government came into power, $10 
billion extra is being paid out in interest on the debt which will hit 
over $600 billion this year. That is what is endangering our social 
policies and that is all.
<P>
	Reform would again examine them and would focus its support 
on the people who really need it. That is not slashing, that is not 
demolishing, that is being sensible and forthright.
<P>
<B>(1330 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Collenette</B> Mr. Speaker, he had an eloquent defence of his 
party's policy, but he talks about the interest on the debt. Obviously 
the interest on the debt is something that concerns us on this side of 
the House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="516"> 516 </A></B>
<P>
	How does he plan to deal with that problem if he is advocating 
that we do not make expenditure cuts in operations? Defence is 
one of the largest operating departments.
<P>
	If we had not cut defence by the amount that was in the budget 
last week, can he tell us where the Reform Party would have got the 
money to deal with this problem?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Frazer:</B> Mr. Speaker, if the hon. minister would take the 
time to read the taxpayers' budget, he would find out where those 
cuts were. He would also be aware that this time next year we 
would be debating what to do with the small surplus that would be 
forthcoming as a result of implementing that budget, not looking at 
another $24 billion down the drain including interest charges and 
cutting into social programs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I will be sharing my time with another member.
<P>
	I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak about the 
importance of NORAD and to share some perspective with my hon. 
colleagues on the value derived from NORAD's agreement, 
naturally on behalf of the people of Victoria-Haliburton.
<P>
	A 1994 review by the auditor general showed the Department of 
Defence was the largest body in government with 33,000 civilians, 
77,000 regular personnel and 30,000 reserves. They have been 
faced since that time with CAP growth and yet have participated in 
unusually high levels of military operations; recently in the gulf 
war and engagements in the former Yugoslavia, Somalia and even 
the Oka crisis. We have every reason to be very proud of our 
military personnel.
<P>
	Since the end of the cold war the North American Aerospace 
Defence Command, NORAD, and the Canadian NORAD region, 
CANR, have undergone numerous changes to respond 
appropriately to the changing threat to North America.
<P>
	Although change has been part of NORAD's evolution since its 
inception in 1957, recent political developments have been 
especially dramatic and significant. The response by NORAD 
demonstrates its commitment to providing effective and efficient 
aerospace defence for both Canada and the United States.
<P>
	The foundation for NORAD was laid prior to the cold war when 
Canada and the United States joined forced to defeat the Axis 
powers of Europe and Japan. The August 1940 Ogdensburg 
Declaration formally articulated for the first time the concept of 
joint Canadian and American defence.
<P>
	Following the second world war in February 1947 both Ottawa 
and Washington announced the principles for future military 
co-operation including air defence.
<P>
	In 1954 the Royal Canadian Air Force chief of staff, Air 
Marshall C. Roy Slemon, held formal discussions with the 
commander of the United States air defence command, General 
Earle E. Partridge. They concluded that air defence for both 
countries could be best provided by a single organization with one 
command.
<P>
	On August 1, 1957 the Canadian minister of national defence 
and the American secretary of defence announced the binational 
agreement for an integrated air defence command based in 
Colorado Springs, Colorado. NORAD was inaugurated as a 
command on September 12, 1957.
<P>
	The first NORAD agreement was signed by the two countries on 
May 12, 1958 and has been renewed or extended seven times since. 
The current agreement will expire in May 1996. Today NORAD 
continues to assist each nation to safeguard the sovereignty of its 
air space, to contribute to deterrents by providing an aerospace 
surveillance capacity, to ensure threat evaluation and attack 
warning and to plan for an appropriate response to attack should 
deterrence fail.
<P>
	Though each of these missions was born in the cold war, 
NORAD's mission emphasis has shifted significantly to adjust to 
changes in the strategic situation.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	The air sovereignty mission has expanded to include south 
oriented surveillance and counter-drug operations. The attack 
warning mission has changed as well to focus on more accurate 
detection of single launches. The air defence postures have relaxed 
but the capacity to regenerate forces in a timely manner remains a 
priority.
<P>
	Today's focus is clearly on air sovereignty, defined simply as 
each nation's right and responsibility to control the air space above 
its territory. Although air sovereignty is a national and not 
exclusively a military undertaking NORAD, provides Canada with 
an effective and efficient mechanism to monitor and control air 
space.
<P>
	Surveillance systems detect, identify and track unknown aircraft 
approaching and/or entering Canadian air space. From January 
1992 until October 1994 there were 1,624 unknown aircraft 
detected throughout NORAD. Historically Canadian NORAD 
regions account for 19 per cent of all NORAD's unknowns, 10 per 
cent in eastern Canada and 9 per cent in western Canada. When 
necessary, armed fighters are scrambled to intercept, identify and 
escort these unknown aircraft.
<P>
	Counter-drug operations are a classic example of the air 
sovereignty mission. Although a small component of the entire air 
sovereignty mission, they are vital to the security interests of both 
countries and illustrate how well NORAD and Canadian NORAD 
regions have adjusted to emerging threats and changing national 
priorities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="517"> 517 </A></B>
<P>
	The May 1991 renewal of the NORAD agreement included 
surveillance and monitoring of aircraft suspected of smuggling 
drugs as part of NORAD's mission. NORAD's goal is to end 
undetected and unchallenged air trafficking of illegal drugs into 
North America. To achieve this goal NORAD and Canadian 
NORAD regions have surveillance and alert forced capable of 
responding to aerial trafficking. They also have improved 
communication and co-ordination procedures with drug law 
enforcement agencies.
<P>
	Canadian NORAD's regional forces have been drastically 
reduced and restructured to meet today's threat. The emergence of 
a new threat in the form of air launched and sea launched cruise 
missiles in the 1980s lead to sweeping changes in NORAD's 
surveillance systems.
<P>
	An agreement authorizing extensive upgrading and 
modernization of air defence systems was reached by the Canadian 
and American governments in March 1985. The result was the 
North American air defence modernization project. This project 
replaced the antiquated distant early warning line and the north 
warning system comprising 54 modern radar sights stretching from 
the west coast of Alaska across Canada's Arctic mainland, and then 
along the east coast through Labrador.
<P>
	Eleven sights located in Canada have long range radars and 36 
short range radars fill gaps and provide improved small target 
detection. Additionally, four Canadian coastal radars provide long 
range coverage on Canada's east and west coasts.
<P>
	Another part of NORAD's improvements to its surveillance 
capability is the ballistic missile early warning system. This system 
includes sights located in Flyingdales, United Kingdom, Thule, 
Greenland and Clear, Alaska. The Thule system in Greenland was 
upgraded in 1987. The Flyingdales site was upgraded to provide 
360 degree coverage for all of Europe and North Africa in 1992.
<P>
	Canadian fighter forces have also been adjusted to match today's 
situation. At the end of the cold war in 1989 Canada had seven 
operational squadrons. These squadrons were available for 
immediate deployment and ready to fight on arrival. Today there 
are four squadrons and training levels have been reduced to the 
extent that it would require several days of training, depending on 
the tasking, before any of the squadrons could deploy and be 
combat ready in a specific theatre.
<P>
	The benefits and membership of NORAD are outstanding. 
Standardizing equipment among members is probably one of the 
leading ones. Having a structure in place during peace time is a 
lesson we should take from our immediate histories. Situations like 
the gulf war and desert storm must keep us on alert and in readiness 
mode for our own protection.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	Leading edge technology and space based technology are also 
another large part of the advantages of NORAD. It is the single 
most important agreement between Canada and the United States. 
Another part is environmental protection; radar sites for the 
protection of our lands and the animals that populate the areas in 
question.
<P>
	Last year the president of the United States and the Prime 
Minister of Canada renewed their commitment to NORAD.
<P>
	We have every reason to take a hard look at the defence budgets 
and adjust them to the times we are in. As I stated, in a 1994 review 
by the auditor general, our defence indicated 33,000 civilians, 
77,000 regular personnel and 30,000 reserves; this with a capped 
growth, and yet they have participated in unusually high numbers 
of engagements with success have served our country proud.
<P>
	We have every reason to be proud of our military personnel and 
the role they play in NORAD.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
ask my colleague whether in his opinion NORAD is a good deal for 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. O'Reilly:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the parliamentary secretary 
for the question. I indicated the benefits to Canada for a DND 
budget of $320 million as probably one of the least expensive 
agreements any nation could have with the United States.
<P>
	Though there is a crisis in Cuba right now and that Canada is 
having some differences there, I still think that 99 per cent of the 
agreements Canada has with the United States, the giant to the 
south, are excellent agreements and this is one of them. Although 
minuscule problems do occur, they can be solved with this type of 
agreement in place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure for me to participate in the debate today. It is a double 
pleasure because the Prime Minister, the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs and the Minister of National Defence gave me the honour 
of chairman of the Canadian section of the Permanent Joint Board 
on Defence between Canada and the United States.
<P>
	This Permanent Joint Board on Defence was formed through a 
meeting of Prime Minister Mackenzie King and President 
Roosevelt at Ogdensburg, New York on August 18, 1940. They 
came out with a joint statement issuing the announcement of this 
permanent joint board. That board has been meeting since 1940, 
sometimes more than twice a year. Now it is twice a year with one 
meeting in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="518"> 518 </A></B>
<P>
Canada and one in the United States. The last meeting of the 
Permanent Joint Board on Defence was in Kingston on October 10 
to 12, 1995. The 197th meeting  will be held in the first week of 
April in the United States. I am the Canadian chair and Dwight 
Mason is the chairman of the U.S. section. He reports to President 
Clinton and I report to the Prime Minister of Canada.
<P>
	It is at those meetings that we did discuss the renewal of the 
NORAD agreement. Is it okay as it is? Is there something lacking 
in the agreement that we should build in? We talked about the 
inclusion of something about protecting the environment. I am 
pleased the Minister of Foreign Affairs already mentioned that if 
there is any environmental dispute, it would be referred to the 
Permanent Joint Board on Defence between Canada and the United 
States.
<P>
	The NORAD treaty is reflective of the positive and co-operative 
relationship that Canada and the United States have in so many 
areas. Our two countries are linked by defence, a dense web of 
common interest in a wide variety of areas. NORAD represents a 
highly valuable element of the defence web.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	Since both ministers and other speakers before me have already 
given the content of the NORAD agreement, I would like to take 
this time to show how our two countries co-operate in other areas 
for the defence and security of our two countries, for example in 
the environment, energy and transportation.
<P>
	Our two countries are stewards of much of the North American 
environment. Our mutual care of this environment is a model for 
the world. Our bilateral environmental relations are marked by a 
high degree of co-operation. Geography has made joint action and 
sensitivity to the rights and needs of each other a matter of both 
necessity and common sense.
<P>
	Canada and the United States share a border close to 9,000 
kilometres along over 300 rivers and lakes. Wildlife migrates back 
and forth across this border and air currents flow in both directions. 
To a significant degree, each country depends on the other to ensure 
that the great wealth of natural resources each possesses is 
managed in a sustainable fashion and that a high level of 
environmental quality is provided to its citizens.
<P>
	Over the years a dynamic and multifaceted legal institutional 
framework for managing our shared environmental resources has 
evolved. This framework consists of both formal and informal 
arrangements.
<P>
	At the formal level the oldest mechanism is the boundary waters 
treaty negotiated way back in 1909 between the United States and 
Great Britain on behalf of Canada. This treaty established the legal 
framework for the use and management of transboundary waters by 
the two countries. It created the International Joint Commission to 
prevent and resolve disputes. The commission has earned an 
international reputation for its handling of transboundary 
environmental issues in an independent, objective and collegial 
manner.
<P>
	The treaty is a remarkable document which, to the credit of those 
who drafted it, has withstood the test of time. Among its notable 
provisions are those giving each country equal rights to the use of 
boundary waters and prohibiting the pollution of these waters by 
either country.
<P>
	The 1991 air quality agreement provides a forward looking 
framework for addressing transboundary air quality issues and for 
establishing new commitments to control other transboundary air 
pollution problems in the future.
<P>
	Other important agreements include the 1916 migratory birds 
convention, which is one of the oldest and most effective 
conservation treaties in North America, and the 1986 North 
American waterfowl management plan, which aims to restore 
continental migratory waterfowl populations.
<P>
	In addition there is the 1978 Great Lakes water quality 
agreement. This agreement is perhaps the best example of 
constructive Canada-U.S. co-operation on environmental issues. 
First signed in 1972, the agreement provides a framework for 
cleaning up our most significant shared resource. Although more 
work needs to be done particularly in eliminating the input of 
persistent toxic substances, great strides have been made in 
restoring the lakes to an acceptable level of quality for the benefit 
of citizens on both sides of the border.
<P>
	In addition to formal arrangements, there is a network of 
informal ad hoc linkages between various levels and departments 
of our two governments. Co-operative arrangements have also been 
forged between our provinces and the state governments in the 
U.S.A. The provinces are of special importance in the 
environmental area due to the significant responsibilities they have 
for natural resources and environmental management. Just as 
Canada and the United States must work together on environmental 
issues, so too must the federal and provincial governments.
<P>
	An additional and valuable component of the Canada-United 
States environmental relationship is the many linkages that have 
been developed between environmental interest groups and 
between business and industry in both countries.
<P>
	What this myriad of formal and informal linkages have in 
common is the recognition that air, water and wildlife do not stop at 
national borders. A case in point is the situation of the Porcupine 
caribou herd which is crucial to the life and livelihood of Canadian 
aboriginal communities. In a 1987 agreement Canada and the 
United States recognized that this herd is a shared resource. As a 
result, both governments are concerned about any plans that would 
cause harm to the herd's main calving grounds in Alaska.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="519"> 519 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	It is important to note in this debate on the NORAD renewal that 
the new NORAD agreement will include a clause that provides for 
Canada-U.S. discussions of the environmental implications of 
NORAD operations. This underscores that sound environmental 
relations between Canada and the United States have become an 
important dimension in all areas of the bilateral relationship. It also 
underscores the recognition of the need to address in a consistent 
manner north and south of the border the environmental 
implications of joint defence activities. As I mentioned, the 
minister already mentioned in his remarks what happens if there is 
an environmental dispute when we are co-operating in NORAD 
exercises and activities.
<P>
	Moving to the energy sector, Canada and the United States have 
a co-operative relationship which has benefited both countries for 
many years. Our energy relationship is governed by the principles 
of deregulation and non-discrimination within the framework of 
NAFTA and the World Trade Organization. That is why I do not 
think we should get too uptight when Jesse Helms tries to pass 
legislation in the United States which affects Canadian businesses. 
We do have the NAFTA rules to go to and we have the World Trade 
Organization rules to refer to.
<P>
	The success of Canada's oil and gas export industry in the United 
States is impressive by any standard. Canada is one of the United 
States' leading oil suppliers. Our current oil exports of one million 
barrels per day could increase as new developments such as the 
Hibernia field come on stream. Canadian natural gas now 
represents some 12 per cent of the U.S. market. Opportunities 
should grow as Canada's dynamic petroleum producing and 
pipeline companies continue to work closely with their U.S. 
partners.
<P>
	Canada and the U.S. have a long history of electricity trade 
dating back to the first export of Niagara Falls power in 1901. We 
co-operate very closely on power issues within the context of the 
Niagara River treaty and the Columbia River treaty. Today 
Canadian provincial utilities export well over $1 billion in 
electricity to the U.S.A. However, we face important challenges in 
the coming years and I will briefly refer to some of them.
<P>
	The U.S. electricity industry is now undergoing deregulation and 
restructuring. Current U.S. proposals may require Canadian 
electricity exporters to offer open access transmission in Canada if 
they wish to receive similar access in the U.S. The Canadian 
electricity industry and the Canadian government generally 
welcome new U.S. market opportunities offered by deregulation. 
However, the structure of the Canadian industry is different from 
that of the United States, with a small number of very large 
publicly owned utilities and provincial jurisdiction over electricity 
generation and distribution.
<P>
	Canada too is moving toward electricity deregulation, but the 
pace of change in Canada may be different. We will work with the 
U.S. to ensure its co-operation in continuing our strong bilateral 
relationship during the transition. Together, Canada and the United 
States are putting in place advanced efficient energy systems that 
facilitate economic growth in both countries.
<P>
	In the bilateral transportation area, NAFTA and open skies have 
expanded Canada-U.S. commerce and tourism tremendously. For 
example, Canada and the U.S. now trade $1 billion Canadian per 
day and open skies has helped Canadian Airlines International 
increase its transborder passenger traffic by 84 per cent. Air 
Canada traffic grew by 24 per cent. Last year more than one million 
people crossed the Canada-U.S. border.
<P>
	These accomplishments put new stresses on the border however 
at a time of decreasing government resources for staff and 
infrastructure on both sides of the border. In response to the new 
realities of border management, Canada and the U.S.A. announced 
the accord on our shared border during President Clinton's 
February 1995 visit to Ottawa. This is a significant achievement.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	The border accord is an agreement between the Canadian and 
U.S. border inspection agencies to jointly modernize and improve 
border management. The border accord functions as an umbrella 
agreement for various individual initiatives.
<P>
	For individual travellers the CANPASS/INSPASS programs at 
airports and CANPASS/PORTPASS on highways allow frequent 
travellers to cross the border via special lanes. Rather than face a 
customs or immigration officer, travellers pass through an 
automated gate that is activated by a personal identifier such as a 
fingerprint or hand geometry. Duties can be paid by credit card. 
CANPASS is now available when entering Canada at the two 
highway crossings in B.C. and at the Vancouver airport. It is 
expected at all of the Pearson terminals, Dorval and Mirabel by the 
fall of 1996.
<P>
	For commercial traffic, the NAFTA prototype will harmonize 
border documents and procedures in all NAFTA countries. 
Documentation will be shared electronically. New transponder 
technology will read electronic signals from properly documented 
trucks and allow them to cross the border without stopping. A 
prototype of this system is expected to be on line at Buffalo-Fort 
Erie this year.
<P>
	Canada and the U.S.A. also co-operate on preclearance services. 
For example, since the 1950s air preclearance in Canadian airports 
has allowed U.S. customs and immigration officers to preclear U.S. 
bound passengers into the U.S.A. before crossing the border giving 
Canada based travellers direct access to the huge U.S. air network.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="520"> 520 </A></B>
<P>
	In the autumn of 1995 Canada and the U.S.A. agreed to extend 
preclearance services to the Ottawa airport. The U.S.A. is 
considering establishing preclearance services at Halifax. Other 
U.S. preclearance services are provided for the Vancouver-Seattle 
train service and for ferries travelling between B.C., Washington 
and Alaska.
<P>
	When we look at the NORAD renewal we should not only be 
looking at that one agreement between our two countries. We 
should look at the whole mass of treaties and agreements we have 
to demonstrate to the world how our two countries live together in 
peace and harmony. We live together taking into account that air 
currents and water currents do not stop at a border; they travel back 
and forth. And so with our defence and with our security we must 
also look at the defence and security of North America.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I believe that terminates the member's time for 
the debate.

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise in the House to salute the members of the South Alberta Light 
Horse Reserve Regiment and the contributions they have made to 
the community of Medicine Hat and indeed their country.
<P>
	This proud regiment and its predecessors have participated in the 
Northwest Canada Rebellion of 1885, the first and second world 
wars, the Korean conflict and  many of Canada's peacekeeping 
obligations around the world. Members serving in the regiment 
have been awarded numerous and impressive medals and 
decorations for their dedicated and selfless contribution to 
Canada's military campaigns.
<P>
	The government's attempt to cut the defence budget on the backs 
of cost effective reserve units will sever the link between the 
Canadian Armed Forces and local communities and undermine the 
glorious contributions of reservists across the country. Instead, the 
reserves should be bolstered by directing savings from the bloated 
civilian and military bureaucracies to combat personnel and 
equipment.
<P>
	The South Alberta Light Horse Reserve has an outstanding 
history. Our nation has benefited from the service and sacrifice of 
these men and women who have served Canada well. The 
government should preserve, not obliterate their presence.

	<B>Mr. Derek Wells (South Shore, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on Friday 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans responded to 
recommendations coming from recent meetings between 
representatives of Scotia-Fundy fisheries organizations and senior 
DFO officials in Dartmouth. As a result, I am happy to report that 
all offices in southwest Nova Scotia have now been vacated.
<P>
	I would like to commend the minister for endorsing the 
consensus recommendations and his commitment to seeking 
resolution where agreement was not reached.
<P>
	The minister has shown that he is willing to listen to the 
concerns of fishermen and to continue to work toward resolution on 
the more contentious issues.
<P>
	Because of concerns expressed to me by fishermen, I have been 
recommending for months that the core criteria be revised to 
include fishermen who have 75 per cent of their earned income 
from fishing which will include many small handline fishermen. 
The minister's commitment to this change is very important.
<P>
	While not all of the issues were resolved, I am pleased by the 
amount of consensus coming from the meetings. It shows that a 
free flow of dialogue between the fishermen and the department 
can lead to new agreements and a better working relationship. I 
commend all who were involved for their patience and flexibility.

is strongly suggesting that Quebec summer festivals receiving 
grants from the federal government increase its visibility on their

<P>
	How many additional millions is this going to cost Quebec 
taxpayers, when the federal government already spent at least $16 
million to promote the Canadian identity during the 1995 Quebec 
referendum campaign?

125 employees at Radio Canada International were served notice 
that RCI was to be terminated 20 days from today, on March 31.
<P>
	No specific provision for public funding of RCI is contained in 
the government spending estimates tabled last Thursday. The 
heritage minister is making noises about continuing RCI but has 
given no indication that she is prepared to look at alternative 
funding through commercialization.
<P>
	The minister is seeking out Canadian business financial support 
for her flag program. Why can the minister not use these contacts 
to seek support for RCI? She should give the employees a chance to 
prove that RCI is a viable  enterprise that can sustain itself on 
corporate advertising. If the government is so confident in the 
private sector's ability to create jobs, let us see it happen.
<P>
	I challenge the heritage minister to announce today that she is 
seeking advice and corporate support for the privatization of RCI 
rather than the traditional tax and spend Liberal approach that has 
driven the country to its knees.

	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the recent 
budget of the finance minister has proven very simply and 
effectively that the Canadian government is listening and is 
responsive to the provinces' needs. We all remember that, last year, 
when our government announced the creation of the Canada health 
and social transfer, several provinces, including Quebec, worried 
about a possible decrease in funding.
<P>
	In reply to that legitimate concern and in order to reassure people 
on the future of health, post-secondary education and welfare 
programs, our government promised to maintain the level of 
funding of that program for five years. This is further evidence of 
this government's commitment towards the development of a true 
partnership with all the provinces.

	<B>Mrs. Georgette Sheridan (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last week's budget brought welcome changes to the 
taxation of child support. The finance minister, working in 
conjunction with his counterparts in justice, human resources 
development, the status of women and internal revenue, announced 
a comprehensive plan which will result in fairer tax treatment of 
child support payments, more equitable and consistent child 
support awards, and improved enforcement mechanisms.
<P>
	At the heart of these initiatives are the needs of the child. While 
it took government action to bring about the legal changes, it was 
as a result of the parents, generally mothers raising their children 
alone, who pushed this issue forward, Suzanne Thibaudeau's court 
challenge to a law she felt treated her unfairly; my colleague, the 
member for Nepean whose private member's bill focused  attention 
on this topic; and the member for Westmount whose leadership 
articulated the needs of many witnesses who appeared before us.

	The lack of Liberal leadership could tarnish Canada's hard

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="JOBCREATION">JOB CREATION</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government's budget strikes hard at the financing 
capabilities of the 19 venture capital firms of Canadian workers. 
The Minister of Finance is thus attacking job creation directly, 
because employee funds have assets of nearly $3 billion. More than 
$800 million has been invested in Canada's economy and has 
helped create and keep some 38,000 jobs in Quebec alone.
<P>
	Since the government is doing so little to create jobs, how can it 
justify going on to attack a tool as effective in creating and 
maintaining jobs as the labour-sponsored venture capital funds, 
because they invest all their money in Canada's economic 
development?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
there is no doubt as to the importance of these funds in creating 
jobs and there is no doubt as to the management capability of these 
funds.
<P>
	That said, I have to point out that there is enough money in the 
funds for the next three years, that is, they have grown 
considerably, and the measures we have taken will not affect them. 
There is money available.
<P>
	It was also agreed from the start that major incentives were 
needed to get these funds off the ground. Now that they are 
established, we think it important to lower the incentives in order to 
free the money for use elsewhere, specifically to create jobs for 
young people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would correct the minister and remind him that the fund 
set up by the CSN, for example, is a new one and has not had time 
to capitalize and really get off the ground. The blow dealt it by the 
Minister of Finance is extremely hard for such a fund to absorb; it 
could well cut it off in mid flight.
<P>
	I would ask the minister how he explains his attack on the 
labour-sponsored venture capital funds, when he has not withdrawn 
the authorization given RRSPs-regular registered retirement 
savings plans-in January 1994 to invest 20 per cent of their funds 
abroad, promoting job creation, but abroad?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
am satisfied the new CSN fund, which we, the government helped 
develop, will grow hugely.
<P>
	Furthermore, as regards the RRSPs and foreign investment, it 
must be said that the aim of RRSPs is not only investment in 
Canada but also the protection and expansion of pension funds to 
protect Canadians' pension plans.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	In addition, Canada, and the province of Quebec, I must add, are 
dependent on foreign capital. It is therefore not in our interest to 
limit Canadians' ability to invest abroad, on one level, because we 
want to encourage foreigners to come and invest here at the same 
time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is important that we understand each other well, the 
Minister of Finance and I. Therefore, I ask him the following: How 
can his government-the government that is doing so little for job 
creation, I would remind him-how can it justify giving tax 
exemptions to people investing in RRSPs, who, through these 
RRSPs, are permitted to invest 20 per cent of their capital outside 
the country, who thus keep or create jobs outside the country, when 
this 20 per cent can go as high as 36 per cent through an investment 
in trust companies?
<P>
	How does the Minister of Finance justify the hard blow to the 
labour-sponsored venture capital funds, which invest and ask only 
to invest all their money in keeping and creating jobs at home? 
They are trying to save and maintain our businesses. Is this not 
reason for him to change his mind?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
when we look the investments these funds make, we see that a 
fairly significant percentage is in debentures and has not gone 
directly to job creation, for the pure and simple reason-and they 
will tell you so-that there is a shortage of investments and it takes 
a bit of time. That is why I said there was enough at least for three 
years. There is nothing there to slow growth or job creation.
<P>
	On the other hand, the measures we took with respect to these 
funds have been very well received throughout Canada, including 
in Quebec, because we recognize that these funds were established 
to help them get started, and, now that they are established, things 
are going quite well. I should add, as far as the 20 per cent is 
concerned, I have said in this House that it was not this 
government's intention to permit more than 20 per cent. But, it 
must be said that pension funds in Canada invest in companies that 
create jobs abroad.
<P>
	I am sure the Leader of the Opposition would not want the Caisse 
de dépôt to stop investing in Canadian companies creating jobs 
abroad.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in making his budget public last week, the Minister of 
Finance announced his intention to establish a technical committee 
of outside experts on the business tax system. Some of its members 
are representatives of accounting firms that have affiliates in

<B><A NAME="525"> 525 </A></B>

to avoid paying Canadian taxes.
<P>
	My question is to the Minister of Finance. How can he believe 
that the public will have confidence in a committee whose 
membership includes people whose own firms take advantage of 
tax havens, and whose very business consists precisely in advising 
clients on how to reduce or eliminate completely taxes payable to 
Revenue Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>First of all, Mr. 
Speaker, when the same question was asked of me last week by the 
same member, I told him that three committee members, including 
the chair, are academics with no connections with any corporations, 
or major multinationals.
<P>
	Having said this, I am convinced that the hon. member will 
realize that, if what we want is to look at how to close up tax 
loopholes or the ways companies wrongly get around job creation 
or foreign investment requirements, it is worthwhile to consult 
precisely those who are knowledgeable about such loopholes, not 
people who know absolutely nothing about them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, how can the minister believe for even a minute that those 
committee members would agree to chop off the very branch they 
are sitting on? Not likely. It is anything but logical.
<P>
	What I am asking the Minister of Finance under the 
circumstances is this: Is he not in the process of providing a first 
class funeral for business tax reform? If that is what he is up to, let 
him admit it.

are experts in social policy. If one wants to examine environmental 
policy, one will ask those people who are experts in environmental 
policy. If one wants to close tax loopholes, who better to ask than 
those who know how to create them?

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 
budget last week the finance minister said the government was 
working very hard to replace the federal sales tax. The federal sales 
tax is the government's new synonym for the GST and replace is 
the new word for abolish, kill or scrap.
<P>
	Creative writing is one thing but people in Canada thought they 
were voting in a government, not a thesaurus. Words have to mean 
the same thing. Replace means replace. Scrap means scrap, kill or 
abolish.
<P>
	These people across the way have clearly broken their election 
promise time after time. Why will the finance minister not simply 
admit the government has no intention of scrapping, killing or 
abolishing the GST?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
quote from the red book once again: ``A Liberal government will 
replace the GST with a system that promotes federal-provincial 
fiscal co-operation and harmonization''. Harmonization means 
harmonization means harmonization.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, rest 
assured there will be no harmony with this harmonization, 
especially in the province of Alberta with no provincial sales tax.
<P>
	The truth is the government has simply broken its promise to 
Canadians. What is worse, it plans to replace the GST with a new 
super tax that will increase the cost of textbooks, heating oil and 
funerals, to name a few.
<P>
	In Ontario alone the Liberal super tax would amount to a tax 
increase of $3 billion a year. That is why residents of Toronto will 
be gathering in front of the Sheraton tonight at seven o'clock to 
protest this Liberal plan.
<P>
	How much will this new Liberal super tax, the twin of the GST, 
add to the yearly tax bill of Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
would not add to the tax bill of Canadians. If a number of the 
provinces were to harmonize, it could well lead to a reduction in 
taxes. It would certainly lead to a reduction in the cost of 
administration which would be passed on to consumers.
<P>
	The Reform Party is so desperate to seek issues. Nobody ever 
said that in the province of Alberta it would be imposed on 
Albertans. We now have virtual harmonization in Alberta because 
there is no tax.
<P>
	For the hon. member for Beaver River to consistently raise straw 
people and say here is a problem when none exists, surely to 
heaven she can put her attention to the problems and the 
opportunities of the country rather than the figments of her own 
imagination.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, you 
will be surprised to learn that several straw people will be outside 
the Sheraton in Toronto tonight because taxes are taxes and people 
feel that very strongly.
<P>
	The minister talks about fairer taxes. How fairer will this new 
super tax be? First, it increases the tax bill for consumers. No 
matter what he says he simply will not convince Canadians who are 
already paying too much in taxes. Second, it kills jobs. A recent 
study done by the University of Toronto estimates that the Liberal  
government's new super tax will kill 74,000 jobs in Ontario alone.

That is not a straw person saying that. It will also reduce real 
income substantially. That is not a straw person. It will also slow 
economic growth for real people, not straw people.
<P>
	How will this new super tax be fair to anyone, especially Liberal 
members seeking re-election?
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker 
this tax has been recommended by the Canadian Tax Foundation. 
Tax simplification is vitally important to small and medium size 
business.
<P>
	Can the hon. member tell me why the Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business recommends this tax? I will tell her. It wants 
to create jobs among its membership. Why does the Chamber of 
Commerce recommend this tax? It knows how good it will be for 
Canadians.
<P>

refuses to accept that Canadians want tax simplification and lower 
costs? Why does the Reform Party not wake up and smell the

question is for the Minister of Human Resources.
<P>
	Yesterday, more than 2,000 people demonstrated for the 
withdrawal of the unemployment insurance reform bill, which now 
goes by the number C-12. That group was made up of Quebecers 
from a number of different regions, New Brunswickers, Micmac, 
people from the Gaspé, Acadians, anglophones, all coming 
together to demand that bill C-12 be withdrawn. They have had 
enough of the government's dumping on the disadvantaged and the 
middle class to control the deficit.
<P>
	Will the minister acknowledge that what people are demanding, 
people who need a real unemployment insurance scheme, is not 
minor amendments but withdrawal of this bill?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that again 
yesterday people were expressing their concerns about the 
proposed bill, which was first known as C-111. I trust that my hon. 
colleague, as well as those voicing their concerns yesterday, will 
wait for the reaction of MPs, such as my hon. colleague, who sit on 
the Committee on Human Resources Development.
<P>
	That committee is now charged with examining Bill C-12, which 
is an exact reproduction of the former bill, as required by 
parliamentary procedure. There will, however, be changes, 
amendments and it is somewhat  surprising to hear that the hon. 
member has already decided these would be minor.
<P>
	I have confidence in the committee and I am confident that the 
proposals from members interested in improving the situation will 
be serious and extensive.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have 
read the budget, and if there had been any signal of an in-depth 
reform, we would have seen it.

	Is the minister aware that, as long as the Minister of Finance 
continues to take $5 billion each year from unemployment 
insurance premiums, the best that can be done is cuts and 
mini-reforms, which will be disastrous both economically and 
socially?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I should point out that the 
Minister of Finance has not taken any $5 billion from the 
unemployment insurance fund. The hon. member who is the Bloc 
finance critic can, I am sure, explain to his colleague that the 
surplus is, moreover, extremely small at this time.
<P>
	That surplus is expected to increase, but I must remind the hon. 
member that, at this very time last year, we were in a deficit 
situation with the unemployment insurance fund. What is very 
important to realize is that we must not interfere with a surplus, 
even one that has actually existed until recently only in the mind of

<P>
	That would be good news if it were true, but it is not. The

<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern

address is how to deal with taxation of aboriginal people. We did it 
in what we thought was a humane and progressive way by saying: 
``We will work with you toward profitability and self-sufficiency 
and at a certain time you have a responsibility to pay taxes''.
<P>
	It is through that type of sensitivity and philosophy that a deal 
was reached with the Nisga'a. I would think the Reform Party, 
which has been calling for a system of  taxation, would hail such a

system where aboriginal people are now saying: ``We will agree to 
that. We will pay taxes like everybody else. Just give us a hand to 
get there''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister is continuing to perpetuate a myth that is not 
true in this agreement. This leads to constitutional entrenchment of 
tax exemption. This is unfair. It is that simple. Disguising it under 
the terms of a land deal makes it no less unjust. Other businesses in 
the area will not be able to compete with tax exempt businesses run 
by the Nisga'a central government.
<P>
	If the Indian affairs minister is serious about fairness, will he 
commit to restoring real fairness by levying the same tax on the 
Nisga'a that all other Canadians will have to pay?

<P>
	According to this government's third budget, in the future, 
pension benefits for senior women with spouses will be determined 
on the basis of family income, thus reducing their benefit level and 
their degree of financial independence. Questioned on this subject 
in this House last Thursday, the Minister answered, and I quote: 
``-nine women out of ten will get more money because of our 
reform''.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance finally recognize in this House that 
this decision to make pension benefits dependent on family income 
is a direct attack on the  independence achieved by women as a 
result of 50 years of continued efforts?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Not at all, Mr. 
Speaker. As I have already stated in this House: nine women out of 
ten will benefit from this reform.
<P>
	Take the poverty level for example; one absolutely aberrant 
consequence of the poverty that exists in certain parts of our 
country is the high percentage of women who are affected. That is 
why one of the goals of our reform was precisely to benefit these 
women. In fact, I think we have done a great job of ensuring that

his facts, this must mean that he directed his officials in the 
department to conduct some studies. My question to the minister is 
very straightforward. Tell him, Mr. Speaker, that it is very 
straightforward. How many women with spouses will see their 
pension cheques cut or taken away as a result of the bad decision 
announced in the minister's budget?
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 75 
per cent of all Canadians will benefit from this reform. Seventy 
five per cent of all Canadian men and women, and women are the 
majority. In fact, women represent not only the majority of the 
population, but also the majority of seniors. Quite clearly, the vast 
majority of women with spouses will benefit from this program.

	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Union of National Defence Employees at 5 Wing Goose Bay 
are concerned about government plans to privatize or contract out 
some base functions. They accept the need to increase cost 
effectiveness but are not being told what is going on and thus 
cannot prepare for their future. The union's president was this 
morning again denied details of the proposal and it would seem 
they will not be released until after the Labrador byelection.
<P>
	Will the Minister of National defence stop playing politics with 
these worried employees and sit down and tell them which base 
areas and personnel are to be affected by privatization?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, alternative 
service delivery is one means by which we are cutting costs at

<B><A NAME="528"> 528 </A></B>
<P>
national defence. In the budget last week we mentioned a number 
of locations that would be eligible candidates for such alternative 
service delivery.
<P>
	Alternative service delivery does not necessarily mean 
privatizing in its pure sense. It could also mean an arrangement 
whereby the current employees are involved. All these matters are 
to be discussed with our employees and the unions.
<P>
	As for the specific question, there is no proposal on the table. We 
have just announced that this particular base may be a candidate 
and we have to look at it over the coming months.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the employees have been informed that the plan has already left the 
base. These employees are not only being kept in the dark about 
their future, they are even being denied the right to bid on these 
contracted out functions. They are also worried that a local Liberal 
supporter has an inside track in seeking this contract.
<P>
	Will the minister assure this House that all legitimate bids for 
contracting out will be considered and that we will not see yet 
another example of political payoff and patronage at 5 Wing Goose 
Bay?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member accused me of playing politics. It seems that this particular 
member who has never uttered one question on anything pertaining 
to defence arrangements in Newfoundland before, now rises at this 
point in time with this specific question. The reason he is so 
concerned about undue Liberal influence in that riding is that just 
about everybody votes Liberal in the elections and they will do so 
on March 25.

	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The minister proposes to establish a health services research 
fund, on which he will spend $65 million over five years, and 
whose mandate is to identify, and I quote: ``what works best in our 
medical system'' and ``what does not''.
<P>
	How can the minister, on the one hand, threaten the quality of 
health care by cutting transfer payments to the provinces and, on 
the other hand, spend $65 million on a committee to find out what 
does not work in the system?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I have to take issue with the thesis of the hon. member's question.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has given exactly what provincial 
ministers of health have wanted for quite some time. He has given 
them consistency. He has given them a cash floor as it relates to the 
CHST and he has given longevity in terms of the amount of money 
that will be provided in terms of the transfers.
<P>
	With regard to the second part of her question in terms of the 
health services research fund, this is a very creative tool which the 
Minister of Finance has agreed to. It will help to lever money from 
other provincial governments, the private sector and non-profit 
organizations in order to look at research which will have an 
immediate impact on cutting the cost in terms of the health care 
system. It is not a form of duplication anywhere in the country. We 
want to work co-operatively and consult with the provinces on the 
best way in which to utilize the fund, provided of course that they 
wish to be a part of it.
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government has already spent $12 million on the national forum on 
health. And it is now setting aside $65 million for a research fund.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that he could have used this $77 
million in public funds in a different way, if only the federal 
government agreed to withdraw from this area, which comes under 
the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces and in which it is 
interfering through its spending powers?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
maybe at some other time we will have an opportunity to debate the 
hon. member's assertion that this is exclusively a provincial matter.
<P>
	The research fund which is being put in place by the Minister of 
Finance is a very creative tool. Provincial governments that deliver 
health care in this country would then have the ability to utilize that 
kind of money on research which is needed. It will be conducted by 
the Medical Research Council. It will be done at arm's length to the 
minister involved. It will provide paybacks to the health care 
system not only for the first year but indeed in the years to come.

	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for the 
Minister of Transport.
<P>
	Two hundred and eighty-seven kilometres of the Trans-Canada 
Highway in Saskatchewan have not yet been twinned in spite of the 
provincial government's readiness to proceed under a 
federal-provincial cost sharing agreement.
<P>
	The government here seems to have a bottomless purse to 
finance hockey rinks, swimming pools and useless projects like 
gun control but no real infrastructure. When will the government 
honour its cost sharing obligations, complete this important project 
and end the carnage on this death trap?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, with the leader of the Reform Party promising hundreds of 
millions of dollars of highways in Labrador, I am surprised the hon. 
member did not follow up his leader's approach.
<P>
	We have number of agreements in place with the provinces but 
of course we have limited funds. At the present time Transport 
Canada is putting out some hundreds of millions of dollars on joint 
programs that have been agreed to with the provinces to improve 
the road systems. We will obviously be looking at Saskatchewan 
along with the other requests that come in.
<P>
	I must point out again to the hon. member and his party that 
funds are limited. The Minister of Finance is a  hard taskmaster and 
we do not have the opportunity of spending money on roads right, 
left and centre as that party seems to believe we should.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the only time the 
hon. minister looks at Saskatchewan is when he flies over it.
<P>
<B>(1450 )</B>
<P>
	I am glad the minister mentioned Labrador because the section 
of the Trans-Labrador Highway from Churchill Falls to Goose Bay 
is a national disgrace. It is very strange that when there is a 90-10 
sharing agreement available for the Trans-Canada Highway, the 
best the government has been able to come up with for Labrador is 
50-50. Our annual foreign aid to China would pay for that section 
of highway many times over. Where are the government's 
priorities?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before this government took office the previous 
government did a study of the Trans-Labrador Highway. There 
were two aspects involved. The cost to bring it up to a paved two 
lane highway with .8 meter paved shoulders and a design speed of 
100 kilometres was $625 million. It went up from there to the 
second phase to between $700 million and $1.125 billion.
<P>
	That is the type of approach of the party opposite: endorsing for 
short term byelection purposes extravagant road building projects 
in Labrador. I would like to think that party would adopt a more 
responsible approach, particularly in light of the responsible 
budget we heard in the House only a week ago.

	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance. In its budget, the federal 
government claims that it will increase by $60 million the moneys 
allocated for summer employment. However, since 1994, the 
government has cut $26 million from these programs. Moreover, 
cuts affecting transfer payments will deprive Quebec students of 
$150 million this year and $300 million next year.
<P>
	How can the government pretend to help young people when, in 
fact, it reduces funding for education by hundreds of millions, in 
return for a few temporary jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, young people in CEGEPs, 
community colleges and universities certainly do not have the 
same understanding of the program as does the hon. member. They 
know full well that the only jobs that make sense for people who 
are still studying at a post-secondary level are temporary ones. This 
is what  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="530"> 530 </A></B>
<P>
happens when one attends university; these students do not expect 
permanent jobs this summer.
<P>
	I can tell you that the young people whom we met were really 
appreciative of the fact that, in our budget, and in spite of all the 
restrictions imposed by every province as well as by the federal 
government, we still managed to double the moneys available to 
create jobs for Canadian students this summer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
obviously do not meet the same people. The students I know are not 
very pleased by the fact that they are being deprived of $500 
million in return for $60 million. They do not see this as a helpful 
measure.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that, by making cuts in social transfers 
and, consequently, in the funding of post-secondary education, he 
deprives young people of a decent education, accessible to all, and 
of true access to the job market?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of the problems with Bloc 
Quebecois members is that they are totally disconnected from 
reality.
<P>
	If anybody in the Bloc Quebecois has a list of students they do 
not want to have helped by the summer student job creation 
program, send it over. Across the country and in Quebec young 
men and women are looking for work and they are extremely 
pleased that the government in these circumstances has found the 
way to double the amount of money available for summer student 
employment.

that again he plays politics on the backs of young people while 
pretending to support them.

<P>
	The red book promised a $900 million increase in research and 
development yet these are the facts: Last year the Liberals cut 
heavily into basic research and eliminated capital gains 
exemptions. Why did the government break its promise to increase 
R and D funding by $900 million? Better yet, why did the 
government not create tax incentives for research and development 
rather than subsidies?

increased tax breaks and increased spending, but we will take that 
under advisement.
<P>
	I am very happy the member raised the question of research and 
development. Today not only was the government able to release 
its science and technology strategy ``Science and Technology for 
the 21st Century'' but it also introduced the new program 
Technology Partnerships Canada. It will provide funding of $150 
million next year, $200 million the following year and $250 million 
the year after, not in subsidies but in assistance to research and 
development. It is money for projects including environmental 
technologies and defence conversion. Again, these are red book 
check offs: defence conversion, environmental technologies, new 
funding for research and development. We are fulfilling our 
promises.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Minister of Industry is giving us the next chapter in the Liberal 
program of do as we say, not as we do.
<P>
	Canadians were hoping for a forward looking science and 
technology strategy to create good long term jobs. Indeed they 
were hoping for some form of tax relief to spur investment growth 
in the emerging technologies. Instead, last year the Liberals killed 
the Tory defence industry productivity program, DIPP, and now 
they present a $250 million business subsidy dressed up as a 
non-subsidy. Call it son of DIPP.
<P>
	Can the minister tell us how giving people back their own money 
and calling it not a subsidy is better than lowering taxes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the member has read the science and technology review 
he has a remarkable ability to read quickly because it is quite a 
thick document and was just made available to him this morning. I 
commend it to his reading. He may be surprised at what he finds 
there.
<P>
	I ask myself who it is he has been talking to. Who is it out there 
who wants more tax loopholes when the Canadian Chamber of 
Commerce, the Canadian Advanced Technology Association, the 
Business Council on National Issues and the business organizations 
have all recognized that the kind of program we have designed is 
not a subsidy program. It is an investment program with repayable 
contributions to give Canadian firms the ability to compete on a 
level playing field with firms from across the world. This is where 
we are going to create jobs for the next century. This is where we 
are going to give Canadians the advantage they need.

	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is an honour for me to address the House of Commons 
to celebrate, as we do every year on March 2, Canada's strong 
commitment to the Commonwealth, its values and its principles.
<P>
	More important, it is an occasion for me to underline Canada's 
strong partnership in the Commonwealth. Partnership is a word 
that is often used these days. In  some ways it is almost in danger of 
becoming meaningless by the fact that it is so often used in so 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="533"> 533 </A></B>
<P>
many contexts, unless we give it meaning with real substance, real 
force and real action.
<P>
	In my previous portfolio of human resources development we 
worked very actively in partnerships with the business community, 
local communities, charitable communities. We learned that the 
most effective partnerships were those where everybody had a 
voice in the process, where the objectives of the partnership were 
clear and where action was taken collectively to achieve our ends.
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	Often the most complex and seemingly difficult problems could 
be cracked wide open when the right people were brought together 
to collaborate, work and make sure their energies were used in a 
new synergy.
<P>
	I believe that the Commonwealth can provide the active dynamic 
partnership to find solutions to many of the very complex, difficult 
problems affecting people around the globe.
<P>
	We have proven before that developing solutions and bringing 
collective pressures to bear can produce important results, such as 
the change in the apartheid regime in South Africa which is one of 
the notable accomplishments of the Commonwealth over the past 
decade.
<P>
	With 53 countries and 1.5 billion people represented, we have at 
our fingertips in the Commonwealth a potentially enormous force 
for wisdom, power and influence. The leaders of the 
Commonwealth can use that force to bring about important 
objectives to which we all aspire.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Our collective commitment to promoting democracy, good 
governance and greater respect for human rights is a high priority 
item of our Commonwealth program. This commitment was 
reaffirmed by the Harare declaration and during the summit of 
Commonwealth heads of government. We must act according to 
the old saying ``Charity begins at home''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Obviously we are saying that we must begin at home.
<P>
	In my recent speech to the non-governmental organizations in 
preparation for the 52nd UN Commission on Human Rights 
meetings, I stated the first principle of Canada's human rights 
policy must be a commitment to continue working on domestic 
agendas with particular regard to aboriginal people.
<P>
	Such individual action by countries must be complemented by a 
collective action, if you like, a new partnership. By adopting the 
Millbrook action program, heads of government in Auckland this 
past year  responded to a personal initiative by the Prime Minister 
to provide the Commonwealth with a much more expanded and 
explicit mandate to work for democracy and to respond in a 
preventive way to problems before they arise.
<P>
	The creation of a Commonwealth ministerial action group as a 
part of this initiative is an ideal and important vehicle for carrying 
out that statement.
<P>
	Currently this meeting of action groups of ministers is facing an 
enormous challenge in the form of the brutal regime in Nigeria. 
The execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other political 
prisoners during the last Commonwealth meeting was a call to 
action to which none of us can afford to be in any way indifferent.
<P>
	The Commonwealth is at the forefront of condemning those 
killings. We must now take the lead in trying to bring about timely 
changes in Nigeria and not to be overtaken by events.
<P>
	It is our partnership with all the forces described above which 
can advance to the next Commonwealth ministerial meeting in 
London in the next month, give real impetus for driving changes 
and creating a more open society in Nigeria. Like any successful 
partnership, we must have a clear objective and the means by 
which that objective can be achieved.
<P>
	It is something to which the government is dedicated and we 
hope we can call on the support of all members of Parliament as we 
work within the Commonwealth to bring about major evolution and 
devolution of practices in Nigeria, to open up the system and to 
protect human rights.
<P>
	In addition to the official Commonwealth that brings 
governments together, the Commonwealth is also a growing 
association of ordinary people having thousands of transactions 
across many borders every day of the year. Thousands of Canadians 
are active in international voluntary, professional, development 
and service organizations which are based on the Commonwealth.
<P>
	Direct contacts between Canadians and individuals from this 
broad array of countries to these organizations are an important 
force in building international understanding and ensuring that 
Canada's position and reputation in the world can be enhanced.
<P>
	I would like to conclude by reaffirming my personal 
commitment and that of the Government of Canada to the 
Commonwealth and the partnership it represents between peoples 
of different languages, different races, and different faiths around 
the globe.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We must join our efforts and work relentlessly to create a 
tolerant and stable world.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise this afternoon on behalf of my colleagues from the 
Bloc Quebecois to mark Commonwealth Day on this second 
Monday in March.
<P>
	This is the third time the Bloc Quebecois has the opportunity to 
celebrate this event in the House of Commons. As my predecessors 
did on previous occasions, I would like to stress how important 
Canada's membership in the Commonwealth is. It dates back to the 
very beginning of the organization, in 1931.
<P>
	I cannot help but insist on the need for this government to finally 
give its true meaning to its Commonwealth membership. We will 
never say it often enough, the Commonwealth is the ultimate forum 
to debate the major issue of respect and promotion of human rights 
and democracy.
<P>
	The last Commonwealth government heads meeting, which took 
place in New Zealand last November, was no exception. This last 
summit ended with Nigeria being suspended from the organization 
on account of the unusually harsh nature of its present government, 
which executed several political opponents, including Mr. 
Saro-Wiwa.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois welcomes the three main objectives set at 
the Auckland summit, namely, to go beyond rhetoric, to put 
principles into effect, and to show determination to stick to them.
<P>
	These new objectives, set out at the Auckland summit, show how 
Canadian policy, in terms of these three goals-the promotion of 
human rights and democracy, foreign aid and international 
trade-is inconsistent. I would like to take this opportunity to point 
out to the government that it is really unfortunate that it has opted 
for not going beyond the rhetoric and not making its actions 
conform to a consistent and transparent policy.
<P>
	The government chose not to actively promote human rights and 
democracy in order to be able to focus only on its commercial 
interests.
<P>
	In a different connection, I would like to remind the House, and 
in particular our English speaking fellow citizens in Quebec, that a 
sovereign Quebec would wish to remain part of the 
Commonwealth. This commitment is quite natural, since it reflects 
the value of our British heritage and traditions. The English 
speaking community in Quebec must be reassured in this regard. 
Need I remind them again that the nationalists have many times 
undertaken to ensure that a sovereign Quebec would fulfil its 
responsibilities towards the English speaking minority in Quebec?
<P>
	English speaking Quebecers, as we have said repeatedly, will 
continue to enjoy all the collective rights they already have. I hope 
that this is no longer an issue for English speaking Quebecers. The 
English culture is as  vibrant as ever in Quebec and we are very 
proud of it. It is part of the rich collective heritage we want to 
preserve. Historically, English speaking Quebecers have played a 
great role in the growth and evolution of Quebec society and their 
contribution is greatly appreciated by all of us.
<P>
	The fact that Canada, and indirectly Quebec, is a member of the 
Commonwealth reminds us that English is not the preserve of 
English speaking Quebecers. The majority of French speaking 
Quebecers use it too. That is a firm guarantee that English will 
survive and prosper in Quebec. Needless to say, English is a great 
cultural language, and there is no reason to believe it is threatened 
in any way.
<P>
	Sovereignists have expressed a desire to remain part of the 
Commonwealth. This is not only a sign of respect for the 
contribution the English speaking community has made to the 
development of Quebec, but it is also the best demonstration of our 
will to live all together in our modern and outward looking society.
<P>
	Why would it not be possible to extend that concept to include a 
larger partnership which would be in the best mutual interests of 
the rest of Canada and Quebec? This would be an opportunity to 
give a real meaning to the word partnership.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am happy to have the 
opportunity to rise on the occasion of Commonwealth Day. Canada 
has been a proud member of Commonwealth since its inception in 
1931. The first secretary-general of the Commonwealth, Arnold 
Smith, was a Canadian who helped shape the spirit of international 
co-operation which remains the foundation on which the 
Commonwealth stands.
<P>
	Over the years Canada has established a leadership role in the 
Commonwealth and provided an example for other countries to 
follow. Today Canada is the second largest financial contributor in 
the Commonwealth. That, coupled with our lack of a colonial past, 
should ensure that Canada maintains a guidance role in the 
organization for the future.
<P>
	The Commonwealth in the mid-1990s has seen some dramatic 
changes. First, it was the readmittance of South Africa in 1984 and 
then the suspension of Nigeria in 1995. I hope that in view of the 
continuing intransigence of the Nigerian regime the 
Commonwealth will extend its suspension of Nigeria to outright 
expulsion.
<P>
	Canada's current work within the Commonwealth in the fields of 
democracy, good governance and human rights is a worthwhile 
attempt to give the Commonwealth the identity it needs, an identity 
that will serve it into the next millennium.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="535"> 535 </A></B>
<P>
	As Canadians and our governments are attempting to do more 
with less, it is fitting on Commonwealth Day to examine the value 
Canada receives from its membership. I call on the minister to 
provide leadership in the ongoing renewal and review of Canada's 
membership not only in the Commonwealth but in all multilateral 
organizations in which we participate.
<P>
	Canadians as well as the citizens of all Commonwealth member 
states would be well served by the Minister of Foreign Affairs were 
he to encourage the organization to examine its financing, goals 
and practices to ensure all member countries are receiving the 
greatest possible value for dollar from its activities.
<P>
	However, this is a day to celebrate the accomplishments of the 
Commonwealth and look forward to the future. I join with my 
colleagues in their observance of Commonwealth Day.

has been renewed seven times.
<P>
	We all agree that the international situation is very different now, 
and that NORAD should adjust to the new reality. Let us first look 
at the political aspect. It is important to ensure that Canada is 
represented effectively. To that end, it is absolutely necessary that 
the Canadian government come up with a new defence policy that 
is sound, detailed and practical, given our international 
commitments as well as the state of Canadian public finances.
<P>
	The government must assume its responsibilities by clearly 
stating its position in that regard, while also reiterating its 
commitment to NORAD. From a strategic point of view, the 
geopolitical context is changing at an accelerated pace. That 
evolution must not necessarily be viewed as the portent of a new 
era of peace in the world, quite the contrary.
<P>
	The bloody conflicts that occur everywhere on the planet should 
make us aware of the need for this type of co-operation and for the 
development of new military alliances that are better integrated.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	It would be illogical to think that, because of the disappearance 
of the bipolar world that came into existence after the second world 
war, we must stop playing a role in strategic alliances. On the 
contrary, we must develop such alliances, for they have served us 
well so far. It is through them that Canada, a middle power, has 
achieved a measure of credibility around the world.
<P>
	Through our membership in NATO and our partnership with the 
U.S. as part of NORAD, we have developed a multilateral approach 
to the defence and security of North America.
<P>
	We are working with our partners and allies to promote peace 
and stability because we know that we cannot do much on our own.
<P>
	This, however, does not prevent us from reviewing our role in 
current alliances and redefining our mission within these alliances, 
in light of the changes dictated by today's realities and in 
anticipation of the new data that may affect us later.
<P>
	I would now like to make a few points. Contrary to what many 
Canadians and Quebecers may think, NORAD is not an agreement 
for the integrated defence  of North America but a bilateral defence 
agreement to develop a joint Canada-U.S air defence based on a 
unified command structure.
<P>
	Earlier this week, we met with defence and foreign affairs 
officials, who told us that NORAD is costing Canada around $300 
million a year. We pay about 10 per cent of the costs, which puts 
the total for both Canada and the U.S. at a little less than $3 billion.
<P>
	Canada allocates 700 person-years to NORAD, while the U.S. 
assigns some 12,000 troops.
<P>
	For the Canadian government, NORAD has always been the 
cheapest way to monitor and defend Canada's vast air space since 
implementation costs are shared.
<P>
	Yet, since the early 1980s, the purpose and content of the 
NORAD agreements have changed in ways that have broadened the 
geographical area over which facilities are scattered and especially 
the nature of the equipment's surveillance and interception 
mission. It must be understood that times have changed, 
technology has evolved and NORAD has had to adapt.
<P>
	The review process put in place when the agreement was last 
renewed, in 1991, concluded that NORAD ``was not obsolete'' in 
the unstable context of a world ``still equipped with nuclear 
weapons posing enough of a threat to justify maintaining collective 
air and space surveillance''.
<P>
	The 1994 white paper on defence goes along the same lines. That 
is why the government undertook to take ``a close look at areas that 
may require updating in view of new challenges to continental 
security''.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is pleased with the government's decision to 
allow a debate to be held on the renewal of the NORAD agreement. 
This perfectly meets the expectations we has expressed in our 
dissenting report on the review of Canada's defence policy.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	It must be understood that this House of the Canadian Parliament 
is the only elected House in Canada. It is therefore important that 
this kind of matter, that accords or agreements like this one, 
between Canada and the U.S. first be submitted to this House, and 
not the opposite, where we would be consulted after a decision was 
made. That is what I call phoney consultations, and that is 
unacceptable.
<P>
	However, I think that, contrary to the way things were done in 
1991, this time, as part of the renewal process, the new role of 
NORAD in the context of the post-cold war era should be examined 
much more openly.
<P>
	The government could take this opportunity to redefine the 
primary role of NORAD, as promised in its 1994 white paper. On 
this subject, I would like to ask a few basic questions to this House 
and to the minister.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="539"> 539 </A></B>
<P>
	Today, in 1996, against whom does NORAD protect us? Does 
NORAD's initial role reflect the new dynamics of the post-cold 
war era? Why should we continue spending billions of dollars on 
defence if Canada is no longer threatened by any direct military 
threat? In all parts of Quebec and Canada, our constituents all ask 
the same think: What is the use of defence?
<P>
	If the concept of security has really changed, would it not be 
wiser and more positive to put our limited resources to use for new 
purposes, within new structures and more appropriate alliances?
<P>
	Given that NORAD was set up during the cold war, it goes 
without saying that the agreement served a different purpose then 
than it does now. In my opinion, NORAD no longer concerns 
exclusively Soviet military power.
<P>
	This is what brings me to discuss the need to redefine NORAD's 
mandate and to make a proposal to the minister, namely that 
NORAD's new mandate should promote a pan-American 
integrated alliance. That alliance would essentially set up a joint 
detection and surveillance network to monitor the skies, lands and 
waters of the whole continent.
<P>
	NORAD's mandate could be extended so as to include other 
partners from the American continent. The agreement could be a 
precious tool to link our economic and commercial interests to 
military alliances that can ensure some continuity to the political 
stability that is emerging in some Central and South American 
states.
<P>
	In short, the time has come to develop a defence policy that is 
responsible, turned to the future and, above all, that reflects 
Canadian democratic values. I do not claim to know the future any 
more than you, Mr. Speaker, the minister, or any other member of 
this House. Only time will tell whether Russia pursues its journey 
toward democracy and a market economy, or whether it opts for a 
more menacing type of regime.
<P>
	I did not even attempt to speculate on the impact that a military 
conflict could have in regions that have been enjoying relative 
stability in recent years, including China and the Indian 
sub-continent.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	I will only say that the relative peace that has been ours for over 
40 years is a blessing for all. Developed countries must absolutely 
not take peace for granted, mainly because of the tensions caused 
by the worldwide increase in population and pollution.
<P>
	One thing is for sure: should a major threat hang over the 
North-American continent, Canada will always be asked to take 
part in an alliance such as NORAD, and its citizens will always 
expect concrete action from their government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canada and the United States had to share the most 
intimate secrets in the context of the NORAD  agreement. Of 
course, Mexico was not included. Does my Bloc Quebecois 
colleague believe that the United States would like to share a 
highly confidential agreement such as NORAD with a third 
country, like a separate Quebec?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
the question. If Quebec were to become a sovereign state it would 
be most interested in being part of NORAD because NORAD is 
part of North America and we are part of North America.
<P>
	The world is changing tremendously. I hope the member agrees 
that the Americans are one part of the world we must organize 
today. It could be the new mission of NORAD to organize this part 
of the world.
<P>
	When there is a conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina some people say 
that Europeans should take care of it, should deal with it. If there is 
ever to be regional conflicts in the Americas of which Quebec is 
part, the Americans should be asked to send blue berets to that part 
of the world to take care of them in a very specific way.
<P>
	I said in my speech that we no longer have the money to go 
around the world on these missions. I believe it would be wise for 
Canadians, Quebecers, Americans, and perhaps Mexicans and 
others, to have a regional organization of the Americas in which we 
could take care of them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Like I said, it seems important to me to review the role of 
NORAD. This agreement will be renewed in 1996, but it will have 
to be reviewed again later on. I think now is the time to start 
thinking about that and about the kind of arrangement we could 
have. The organization of NORAD is important. It has changed 
over the years, and I think its future role could be to defend the 
Americas. That is the point I am trying to make.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I compliment the member on his presentation. I thought it 
was enthusiastically put forward and I understand his commitment.
<P>
	Does the member have any specific points which would enhance 
the present negotiations and would make the treaty more current 
and relevant than he suggested earlier?
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, in its minority report on 
the defence committee, the Bloc Quebecois made suggestions to 
improve NORAD's performance, if I may use the term.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="540"> 540 </A></B>
<P>
	We feel that regional defence structures require a new 
framework for our continental defence agreements. As you know, 
NORAD is a military organization. The decisions are made by 
members of the military. I think that, in a changing world, it would 
be interesting to also have a civilian NORAD organization that 
could participate in the decision making process.
<P>
	As I said earlier in the other language, the beautiful language of 
Shakespeare, I think that NORAD should be the ultimate 
organization for the Americas. In order to achieve this goal, we will 
have to develop our relations.
<P>
	Later, one of my colleagues will talk about the economic and 
trade implications, etc. He could elaborate on this. The Bloc 
Quebecois also feels that the Canadian government should do an 
in-depth analysis of the consequences of all its defence agreements 
with the U.S.
<P>
	As you know, there are over 800 defence agreements in effect 
between Canada and the U.S. There are also 149 working 
committees and subcommittees. I think what matters is to have a 
consistent, affordable defence policy, which is what Canadians and 
Quebecers expect from us.
<P>
	We are currently enjoying a climate of relative peace and I think 
we must never forget that every dollar we spend comes from the 
pockets of Canadians and Quebecers. We must always think of why 
we spend this money: to ensure the best possible protection and 
security for our taxpayers.
<P>
	We support the NORAD agreement because it is not costing us a 
lot of money. We receive a great deal in return for paying about 10 
per cent of the costs. I think that $300 million is a reasonable 
amount to pay to enjoy safer air space. I think it is quite reasonable.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Halifax, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
splitting my time this afternoon with the hon. Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	It is a delight to be participating in today's debate on the renewal 
of NORAD. As many members are aware, Canada and the United 
States have a long history of friendship. Our political, economic, 
social and cultural ties are the most extensive of any bilateral 
relationship existing in the world today.
<P>
	Our defence ties are far reaching. Although we have always had 
and will continue to pursue an independent foreign defence policy, 
our geography, our history, our trust and our shared beliefs have 
made the Americans our close partners in the defence of our 
common continent. They have also made us natural allies in the 
pursuit of international peace and security.
<P>
	NORAD is one of the pillars of this defence relationship but our 
co-operation does not end there. Members should be aware of the 
extent and importance of our military partnership. As it evolves to 
meet new  demands and challenges this partnership will continue to 
play a major role in ensuring Canadian security and in enhancing 
international stability.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canada and the United States have maintained a close security 
relationship since the end of the 1930s, when President Roosevelt 
and Prime Minister Mackenzie King united our two countries in a 
continental defence partnership for the first time.
<P>
	During the second world war, our defence relationships 
expanded and deepened. That is how, under the Ogdensburg accord 
of 1940, the permanent joint board on defence was established.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	As for the Hyde Park declaration of 1941, it united the Canadian 
and U.S. economies to counter aggression.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	After the war as the east-west confrontation took root, the 
relationship continued to develop. As years passed, new bilateral 
agreements and arrangements, NORAD being the most famous, 
were added to the list. Today this list is very long. Our military 
partnership now includes 60 formal bilateral defence agreements, 
200 memoranda of understanding and numerous service to service 
understandings. These agreements and arrangements cover 
virtually the entire sphere of military activity: joint planning and 
operations, combined exercises, defence production, logistics, 
communications, research and development, and intelligence. In 
all, there about 600 Canadian military personnel serving south of 
the border.
<P>
	Canada and the U.S. consult in roughly 150 bilateral forums that 
require regular consultation, discussion and meetings. In addition 
to NORAD, this includes the permanent joint board on defence. 
The PJBD is the senior advisory body on continental security. It 
meets twice a year providing an opportunity for diplomats and 
military officials from both countries to discuss important and 
sensitive bilateral and international defence matters. There is also 
the military co-operation committee established in 1945. This 
forum allows our respective military staffs to meet and carry out 
combined military planning for the defence of North America.
<P>
	Canada-American defence co-operation also includes an 
extensive network of defence production research and development 
arrangements which provide the framework for our close economic 
ties in this sphere.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The defence production sharing agreement signed in 1956 sets 
out the terms of bilateral trade in defence material. It allowed 
Canadian companies to compete with American companies on the 
American market.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="541"> 541 </A></B>
<P>
	The defence development sharing agreement signed in 1963 
helps Canadian companies develop products for use by the U.S. 
armed forces and promotes research and development in Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Trade in defence goods between the two countries amounts to 
almost $2 billion Canadian every year. Our longstanding industrial 
co-operation has resulted in a highly integrated defence industrial 
base.
<P>
	We also have the Canada-U.S. test and evaluation program, 
allowing our countries to test important weapons systems at each 
other's military facility. This cost effective and flexible 
arrangement has become an integral component of our defence 
relationship.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	And, naturally, Canada and the United States are tied by their 
membership in a variety of multinational organizations, including 
the UN, NATO, the organization responsible for security and 
co-operation in Europe as well as the Organization of American 
States.
<P>
	Recently, we participated in a number of multilateral operations, 
such as the United Nations mission in Haiti and the activities 
conducted under NATO in Bosnia by the peace plan 
implementation task force, or IFOR.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Closer to home, Canadian and American military personnel have 
a long tradition of working closely with each other in operations 
and training exercises. At sea, Canada-U.S. co-operation involves 
the surveillance and control of vast ocean areas on both coasts and 
in the Arctic. We exchange information in support of search and 
rescue and any narcotic operations, co-operate in humanitarian 
emergencies and hold regular bilateral exercises at sea.
<P>
	Canada-U.S. defence co-operation, having lasted through more 
than 50 years of evolving challenges, continues to thrive. The 
Canadian government believes that this co-operation still serves 
the fundamental interests of Canada. Although the world has 
changed dramatically in recent years, we must always be ready to 
co-operate with our American allies in the defence of North 
America. There may be no direct military threat to our continent at 
the moment but there are no guarantees for the future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The government would like the Canadian Forces to be able to 
continue to work closely with the U.S. armed forces under various 
circumstances. We must bear in mind that there are other 
immediate benefits to maintaining a close relationship with the 
U.S. for defence purposes.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For example, extensive training and operational experience are 
gained by Canadians. We retain a useful degree of influence in 
critical areas of United States defence policy that directly affect us. 
We gain access to important defence related information. Canadian 
companies benefit from access to important technologies and the 
large U.S. defence market.
<P>
	If the Canadian government remains firmly committed to its 
defence relationship with the U.S., we also understand this 
relationship must continue to evolve. Although Canada and the 
U.S. are cutting back on some continental defence activities, we are 
also looking into ways to preserve the Canadian-American defence 
relationship. NORAD is a perfect example.
<P>
	Given the current international environment and urgent domestic 
priorities, it might be tempting for us to turn our backs on a 
longstanding co-operative agreement, but the lessons of history 
teach us that this would be shortsighted. While still conducting an 
independent foreign and defence policy, we must continue to work 
with the U.S. to meet the challenges of the coming century and to 
preserve our relationship as a source of stability in a turbulent 
world. The benefits of our defence partnership far outweigh the 
costs, all the more so since activities have been scaled back to deal 
with today's realities.
<P>
	The Canadian and American governments must also show vision 
and imagination in ensuring this partnership has the capability to 
meet future demands. This new NORAD agreement being debated 
today offers clear proof we are following a wise path. That is what 
this government does best: it follows wise paths and gives good 
government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Francis G. LeBlanc (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure 
for me to take part in this debate on the renewal of the NORAD 
agreement between Canada and the United States.
<P>
	Earlier today, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, on behalf of the 
Canadian government, clearly indicated the government's 
preference and its intention to renew the NORAD agreement, 
knowing that it could contain significant changes to its objectives 
in order to reflect new geopolitical realities in North America and 
throughout the world.
<P>
	I am happy to see that both opposition parties agree with the 
government on this issue and support the renewal of the NORAD 
agreement. I am also happy to see that opposition parties, 
particularly our friends in the official opposition, recognize the 
importance of the relationship between Canada and the United 
States as  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="542"> 542 </A></B>
<P>
shown by this agreement. I will even say, if I may, that it shows 
how important it is that Canada be a united country that has the 
respect not only of the United States, but of the entire world. That 
is why we were able to build with our partners to the south such a 
close and strategically sound relationship as the NORAD 
agreement.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In the course of their day to day lives, Canadians carry out their 
affairs blissfully unaware of the existence of the NORAD 
agreement between Canada and the United States. That speaks well 
of the smooth way in which the agreement has worked between our 
two countries for the last 37 years since it was first instituted in 
1958.
<P>
	As others have said today, NORAD is a good deal for Canada. 
Canada contributes about 10 per cent of NORAD's total annual 
operating costs, or $320 million a year. That is a bargain because 
every country with the ability to detect and intercept unknown 
aircraft does so. No country that can prevent it lets unknown 
aircraft overfly.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	If there were no NORAD, Canada would have to monitor and be 
prepared to defend the world's second largest land mass on its own. 
This would be an onerous task for our country with its relatively 
small military resources. In order to monitor and defend our own 
air space with only our own resources we would need an air force 
several times larger than the one we have. We would need more 
radar installations and the manpower to run them and interpret the 
data. By the way, if we had no agreements with the United States in 
other defence spheres, this would also require an army and a navy 
much larger than the ones we now operate.
<P>
	There would be two alternatives in a situation without NORAD: 
let the Americans do it, or do not do anything. After all, things are 
relatively peaceful in this part of the world and who would want to 
hurt us? The Americans are our friends, so why not let them do 
what they think is necessary to defend North American air space?
<P>
	If we abdicated our responsibility in that way, we would have no 
say in the policy governing our own defence. We would have no 
say if there were plans afoot to intercept aircrafts which were 
carrying nuclear weapons or missiles over our territory. We would 
have no say about what foreign ships and aircraft were doing in our 
country. We would have no agreements governing the routes used 
by U.S. nuclear powered vessels travelling in our waters. We would 
become a passive client state. This would represent a steep descent 
from the heights we reached on the scale of pride and independence 
50 years ago.
<P>
	In World War II our efforts to defend freedom were far out of 
proportion to our population. We had the world's fourth largest 
navy at the end of the war. During  the war our military personnel 
died in combat at a rate per population that was 1.5 times greater 
than that of the United States military. We have always been proud 
of the sacrifices we made for freedom. We paid a high price to win 
World War II.
<P>
	If on the other hand we chose to let foreigners' aircraft fly where 
they wished and we depended on their good intentions and 
responsibility to conform with Canadian law, including 
environmental law, we would lack one of the prime indicators of a 
modern nation state. These are unthinkable alternatives as I am 
sure everyone in this House would agree. Therefore in the domain 
of aerospace surveillance and warning we have the North American 
aerospace defence command. This brief look at the continent 
without NORAD would have made clear for all of us that we need 
this organization to protect our sovereignty.
<P>
	The system begins with the world's most modern technology 
centred at the Cheyenne Mountains installation. There are regional 
NORAD centres that contribute to our security in Alaska, in North 
Bay and in Florida. Members will have heard in the budget speech 
that some NORAD functions in Canada will now be centred in 
Winnipeg, close to the centre of the country. In addition to the 
installations I have mentioned there are radar stations throughout 
the north and on both coasts feeding information into the NORAD 
networks.
<P>
	The north warning system consists of 15 long range radars, 11 in 
Canada, 39 unattended short range radars and nine associated 
satellite communications systems. The north warning system is 
deployed across the Alaskan north slope, northern Canada and the 
Labrador coast and provides surveillance of the northern 
approaches to North America. Data gathered by the system is sent 
by satellite communications to the appropriate regional centre at 
Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska or North Bay where tracking, 
identification and interceptor control are handled.
<P>
	The Canadian portion of the system is operated and maintained 
by civilian radar contractors under contracts managed by DND. 
With the end of the cold war system costs have been reduced 
resulting in a lower level of operations and fewer staff at the radar 
locations.
<P>
	In NORAD we have a system that uses the most advanced 
technology to defend Canada against terrorism and surprise attack 
by nuclear, chemical or biological weapons carried by missiles or 
aircraft. In addition, it detects drug smugglers and terrorists. This is 
a multi-purpose system and its effectiveness is tested frequently. 
Canadian NORAD pilots fly some 800 training missions a year. I 
find this reassuring.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	The NORAD agreement that I have just described is only one of 
many agreements and arrangements that Canada has with the 
United States. We have some 239  bilateral agreements covering 
everything from water quality of the Great Lakes to trade. Between 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="543"> 543 </A></B>
<P>
Canada and the United States there is one of the most extensive, 
broad ranging links between any two countries in the world.
<P>
	The trade between Canada and the United States is greater than 
between virtually any other two countries in the world. The range 
of bilateral arrangements and co-operations on multilateral fora is 
as extensive as that between any other two countries.
<P>
	By taking advantage of the NORAD renewal in this area of 
strategic aerospace defence we are building on the strong 
relationship we have shared with our neighbour to the south and 
from which we in Canada have benefited. There will be disputes. 
We have disputes with the United States at the present time on a 
number of issues but that should not obscure the important 
friendship and ties that we share and wish to maintain as a united 
country on the North American continent with the most powerful 
country in the world.
<P>
	I appreciate the opportunity of speaking on this matter. Once 
again I am pleased to see the degree of agreement the government's 
proposals have this afternoon. We also look forward to constructive 
suggestions opposition members may have for the government as it 
prepares to continue this very important agreement with the United 
States.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak in the debate on the North 
American Aerospace Defence Command.
<P>
	The question before us is whether as a country Canada should 
contribute to NORAD for the next five years. I believe that Canada 
should. NORAD has served our country and North American 
security extremely well.
<P>
	The first thing we must realize is that the post cold war era is not 
safer than times past. In fact the world is more unstable and fragile 
than what has gone before. The duel between two superpowers, the 
former U.S.S.R. and America, has unshackled a number of 
countries which were in conflict and has given rise to rabid 
nationalism that is a major and potent destabilizing factor in the 
world.
<P>
	I might add that we have been ill-equipped, ill-advised, 
ill-prepared and unable to deal with the major security threats that 
are now occurring. An example is the rise of ethnic nationalism 
along the lines of Mr. Zhirinovsky, a very dangerous creature in the 
former U.S.S.R.
<P>
	Many former Soviet Union countries are very unstable. One 
need not look any further than Chechnya or Tadzikhistan to see the 
conflicts that are brewing there. I need not remind the House that 
many of these former Soviet Union countries are nuclear capable.
<P>
	There has been a proliferation of countries with ballistic missile 
technology. Despite our best efforts to  control nuclear technology 
and biological weapons, a number of countries, some of which are 
renegades in some aspects of their foreign policy, may already have 
nuclear capability or are pursuing this capability. As has been seen 
in recent times this capability can be utterly devastating. We need 
look no further than at what happened in Japan last year. If we 
expand on that there is no reason why that cannot land on our 
doorstep one day.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	There is a myth that the United States is the only superpower in 
the world. That is simply not true. One need not look any further 
than the China-Taiwan conflict that is occurring today to see that 
there is another superpower, China.
<P>
	Fueled by a superheated economy, China has gone on a spending 
spree, the likes of which has not been seen or taken into full 
account in recent memory. It has purchased a lot of very powerful 
aircraft, intercontinental ballistic missiles and weaponry, including 
nuclear powered and nuclear capable submarines and ships. In 
other words, it has built up perhaps the second most powerful 
military force in the world.
<P>
	China also has a very different political ideology from us. That 
political ideology is very dangerous. We need not look any further 
than the China-Taiwan conflict to see the extent to which China is 
willing to pursue its goals. Fuelled by its ability to get Hong Kong 
and Macao under its wing, it now sees Taiwan as another 
possibility that it can bring into the fold. However, it is doing this 
in a way that flies in the face of the norms of international 
co-operation and international agreements.
<P>
	It is up to the international community to deal with this in a way 
that will be productive. NORAD has given us this capability.
<P>
	I bring up the Taiwan-China situation to show that here is a 
situation very close to our borders where nuclear weapons can 
potentially be used. Therefore, NORAD needs to continue and it 
needs to continue with our co-operation.
<P>
	Another aspect not heard much about in terms of NORAD is that 
apart from continuing on as it is today, it can be made an even 
better system. Part of what could considered is a global warning 
system.
<P>
	What I propose is something that has been talked about before in 
some circles. NORAD could be integrated into a global warning 
system with other allies in the north. Their warning systems could 
be integrated with NORAD to have a surveillance system, an early 
warning system and also a system which can be acted on should 
possible dangers be faced. Not only will it be good for the 
furtherance of NORAD, but it will also be good for international 
co-operation among our allies, a level of co-operation that we are 
going to need in the future.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="544"> 544 </A></B>
<P>
	As I have said before in the House, Canada's security is 
intimately entwined with the security of every other country in 
the world. Therefore, Canada has to pursue a course of action that 
lends itself to international involvement, co-operation and 
endeavours that are going to make our collective security stronger. 
To do it alone is impossible. For Canada to do it alone is absolutely 
ludicrous because we simply do not have the money and the power 
to monitor a land mass the size we have been given.
<P>
	On a related topic, I might add that the $800 million that has 
been taken from the defence portfolio, while it is welcomed, I 
would warn the minister of defence that removing it from 
procurement is wrong.
<P>
	The situation at present is that we have a Minister of Foreign 
Affairs and the Minister of National Defence who appear to be 
pursuing courses that is not in sync. Canada has, correctly so, 
pursued a course of peacekeeping and peacemaking in our foreign 
policy. It is something that we can do very well and one that we 
ought to continue. If the men and women in our armed forces are to 
be obligated to do this, then they have to be provided with the tools. 
To send them out in the field in peacekeeping and peacemaking 
without the proper tools is putting their lives in potential danger 
and that is unforgivable. The men and women in the armed forces 
must have the tools to do the job properly.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	Peacemaking and peacekeeping is not a benign endeavour, it is 
combat pure and simple, and they must be armed for combat if they 
are going to do the job well and if they are going to protect 
themselves from possible danger. Anything less would be putting 
our people in danger and this House cannot under any 
circumstances let that occur. We have that obligation to them.
<P>
	There are a couple of other aspects of the China-Taiwan situation 
that I would like to talk about. I was thankful to see that the 
Americans took the initiative by taking a battle force into the 
Straits of Taiwan. The larger resolution of this problem and others 
like it are going to need international co-operation.
<P>
	Apart from the China-Taiwan conflict there is the potentially 
volatile India-Pakistan conflict, two nuclear powers glaring at each 
other across the Himalayas. This has been going on for a long time. 
It is heating up and one day this can prove to be a very problematic 
and devastating geopolitical event. It is one that is as preventable as 
is the one between China and Taiwan.
<P>
	How is this going to be done? It will not be one country that does 
this but it will require international co-operation. I believe, and 
many of my colleagues here in the House that I have spoken with 
also agree, that Canada has a unique opportunity and a unique 
responsibility in the international family. We are one of the few 
countries that has the ability and the reputation  to take a leadership 
role in revamping the international security organizations to 
become more effective.
<P>
	Foreign policy in this world has taken on a reactive tone. We do 
not deal truly with peacekeeping or should I say conflict 
prevention. We deal with conflict management. That is what 
peacekeeping and peacemaking is all about.
<P>
	Instead of incurring the terrible costs that conflicts occur, not 
only in terms of human costs but also the devastation wracked upon 
a country that descends into civil war, we must address our 
endeavours into preventing those conflicts from occurring. To do 
this we have to identify the precursors to conflict and co-ordinate 
international efforts.
<P>
	Who is going to do that? It will not be the United States because 
that country, for better or for worse, is mistrusted in many spheres. 
Few countries can do this. Canada is one of those along with 
probably a half a dozen other Nordic countries, Australia and New 
Zealand.
<P>
	I am happy the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs said that he would be very happy to hear 
suggestions from the House. I would suggest that the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs convene a meeting with other like-minded nations 
to develop a common foreign policy to revamp international 
organizations such as the United Nations and international 
financial institution.
<P>
	Through a concerted effort we can make change. The way to do 
this is to speak in terms of self-interest. When a country blows up, 
when a country descends into civil war such as what happened in 
Bosnia, the international community is left spending billions and 
billions of dollars to try to reconstruct the economy and the 
infrastructure in these countries. It also has to try to push down the 
ethnic discontent and hatred that has descended in these countries. 
We need to look at it far before this occurs. We need to look at it 
before the killing starts because once the killing begins the seeds of 
ethnic discontent are there for the future. It is very difficult to 
produce long term peace if that occurs.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	All we need do is look at Bosnia today and see the fracturing 
occurring in the Bosnian federation, a situation I believe will 
fracture. We hope it will be done in a peaceful way at the 
negotiating table and not at the end of an assault rifle.
<P>
	Canada must involve itself with the Nordic nations to do a 
number of things. It must revamp the United Nations. The security 
council must be revamped and expanded. We need to get rid of the 
security council veto for any country. Any endeavours by the 
security council ought to be made on a two-thirds majority vote.
<P>
	Another aspect is the revamping of international financial 
institutions. The IFIs can be a potent, non-military lever to 
addressing the precursors to conflict. The precursors to impending 
conflict, such as with Nigeria and Bosnia, are often brought 
forward by individuals trying to manipulate ethnic hatreds for their 
own end, usually for power. The IFIs can bring down on them a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="545"> 545 </A></B>
<P>
number of non-military restrictions such as not renegotiating loans, 
withholding foreign aid or giving them foreign aid if they are 
prepared to enter into diplomatic solutions to their problems. It is 
low cost and effective.
<P>
	You need money to drive a war. Without the money you will not 
have war. The countries that will potentially explode in the future 
are some of the most impoverished in the world, often relying 
heavily on international financial institutions for their money. As a 
country we can work with other countries to revamp the IFIs to 
make them a more effective tool for preventing conflict.
<P>
	Another aspect we can use along with our involvement in 
NORAD is the pursuit of a stronger international arms registry. An 
arms registry will add a measure of transparency to the very murky 
world of arms sales. If we can find where arms are being built up 
through sales we can use that as a potential indicator of a precursor 
to a conflict about to happen. It will send out warning signs.
<P>
	The other thing we need to do is revamp the UN crisis centre to 
make it an effective conduit of information to the UN security 
council. By doing that we and our neighbours can have a better idea 
of potential conflicts on the horizon.
<P>
	These are some of the endeavours that we can pursue. I think it is 
incumbent upon us to do that. Our past reactive foreign policy is 
costly, myopic and leads to much human suffering that is entirely 
unnecessary in our world. Not only do we have the likes of China 
and Taiwan, Indian and Pakistan to deal with, but also other 
countries such as Tadzikhistan, Chechnya, Rwanda, Burundi, 
Nigeria and many others that are potentially explosive.
<P>
	Why deal with them after? Why not deal with them now before 
the conflict? Our approach historically has been weak. It has been 
the policy of appeasement, waiting to see what happens. Time has 
shown this to be ineffective and inhumane.
<P>
	One of the fallacies of foreign policy has been that we tend to 
negotiate with the leaders of certain countries who do not 
necessarily have the best interests of their people at heart. 
Generally speaking, wherever we are the average civilian wants to 
live in peace and harmony and have a good life.
<P>
	Politicians in certain countries are willing to sacrifice that for 
their own end. It is very important for us to realize that when we are 
negotiating with these individuals.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	I have an aside on the topic of Bosnia. If we believe the 
implementation force is to be the be all and end all of Bosnia, we 
are sadly mistaken. The different groups within Bosnia, the 
Bosnian Serbs, Muslims and Croats, are starting to polarize. The 
leadership in the Bosnian Serb camp is starting to once again stir 
the ethnic discontent and hatred that started this problem in part in 
the first place. We must head this off. We must head off the 
misinformation taking place there now.
<P>
	Furthermore, the implementation force does not buy us peace. 
The implementation force merely buys us a window of opportunity 
so peace can occur. First, along with providing a safe haven within 
which civilians can live temporarily, the international community 
must get together with the European Union to rebuild the economic 
infrastructure within Bosnia. If a country's civilian population is 
without an economy, if there is a desperate and a poor population 
which already has the seeds of ethnic hatred, there are all the 
precursors of a conflict. Bosnia will descend into conflict again 
unless we recognize that.
<P>
	We need to keep abreast of the fact these groups are splintering. 
Let us make sure they splinter at a negotiating table in a peaceful 
way and not at the end of an assault rifle.
<P>
	Our policy on Cuba has been perfectly correct. The Americans 
are wrong. It is a parsimonious policy driven by the rich Cuban 
expatriate community in the United States that is manipulating 
politicians in America to do what it wants. If we do not help Cuba 
in terms of bilateral trade and bilateral economic activity, we will 
be left with a desperate population in Cuba. When Mr. Castro dies 
there will be a power vacuum that will lead to conflict. Then we 
will have Haiti II in the Caribbean. That is what will occur.
<P>
	I strongly encourage the foreign minister to speak to Mr. Clinton 
and to tell him to support our policy of active engagement with 
Cuba. When we do that, when we build up the economy for the 
people of Cuba, we build up a middle class, we build up a political 
power structure that will one day take over from Mr. Castro in a 
peaceful way. We would not be left with a potential second Haiti in 
our midst. That would not only be unfair to the people there but 
would create a political and geopolitical problem in our area.
<P>
	We support the NORAD involvement into the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Kitchener, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome 
the comments of the hon. member which were enlightened and 
sensible. Not surprisingly, I agreed with much of what he said.
<P>
	He made several excellent suggestions such as co-operation 
among the polar nations, expansion of NORAD in some respects to 
work with other polar nations in terms of surveillance. He made 
some  important suggestions in terms of UN reform. He said 
Canada's security is intertwined with the security of every other 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="546"> 546 </A></B>
<P>
country in the world and that Canadians must take a leading role in 
establishing the precursors to peacekeeping.
<P>
	I agree with these sentiments. They are wise sentiments. 
However, we are talking today about NORAD and the advantage is 
surely that it does save Canada a great deal of money. We work 
with the United States in activities such as surveillance. We have 
based our defence policy on co-operation.
<P>
	Many of the hon. member's suggestions would cause Canada's 
defence budget, indeed its foreign affairs budget, to rise 
dramatically. Does the hon. member believe his party, his 
constituents, his province and Canadians in general would support 
the kind of increase in the defence budget and foreign affairs 
budget that such policies would seem to suggest as necessary?
<P>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my hon. friend for the very important question. There is no way we 
in this party would support an increase in spending in foreign 
affairs and in defence.
<P>
	I do not accept the hon. member's premise that it will cost us 
more to do the things I mentioned. They do not all have to be done 
at the same time but can be worked into our foreign policy and our 
defence policy over time.
<P>
	The cost of inaction today is far greater than the cost of 
preventing a situation. If we had been involved in the Rwanda 
situation with other countries earlier it would not have cost us the 
hundreds of millions of dollars it has today. Similarly it would not 
have cost us the billions of dollars in the former Yugoslavia if we 
had gone into the situation earlier and prevented those conflicts.
<P>
	The key is prevention. We might spend a dollar today but we will 
save much more in the future. These costs are involved in a number 
of different areas. When a conflict occurs we have the migration of 
populations to our shores. This costs us in terms of immigration 
claimants, in terms of foreign aid, in terms of our defence and 
foreign affairs budgets if we do not address these problems in a 
preventive fashion. As we all know, the costs of getting involved in 
a conflict are far greater than the cost of preventing those conflicts.
<P>
	My hon. friend has made many interesting and wise suggestions 
in the House. I am sure we will get together sometime in the near 
future to discuss this further. The bottom line is prevention is better 
than waiting for a conflict to occur and action after that. 
Furthermore, our involvement in prevention is predicated on the 
fact that other countries will involve themselves in prevention as 
well.
<P>
	I reiterate that these involvements are in a multinational fashion, 
done with other countries and therefore will be much less 
expensive than in reacting to conflicts in the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John English (Kitchener, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with the member for Nipissing.
<P>
	I welcome this opportunity to participate in the debate on 
NORAD renewal. As the House has heard, NORAD was originally 
formed 39 years ago to provide for the common air defence of 
North America, and the first NORAD agreement was signed in 
1958.
<P>
	The original purpose of NORAD was to counter the Soviet 
bomber threat of the 1950s, but soon after its establishment we 
faced an additional challenge, Soviet intercontinental ballistic 
missiles. While these remained the principal threats of the 1960s 
and 1970s, the introduction of sophisticated cruise missiles into the 
Soviet inventory meant further adjustments to NORAD in the 
1980s.
<P>
	With all these changes NORAD evolved to meet changing 
threats and it also adjusted its facilities and infrastructure. For 
example, outdated radar facilities were replaced or closed, 
operation centres were consolidated and the number of aircraft 
available to NORAD was significantly reduced.
<P>
	Adjustments such as these ensured that NORAD remained 
efficient and effective in both an operational and financial sense as 
the command matured and adapted to changing circumstances. For 
NORAD flexibility, effectiveness and efficiency are established 
traits which continue to serve the national security interests of both 
Canada and the United States in ways which would be difficult, if 
not impossible, to achieve unilaterally. As we have seen in the 1996 
renewal negotiations, these traits continue to be a critical feature of 
NORAD.
<P>
	The command and control structure of NORAD has also evolved 
over the years into the integrated structure that it is today with 
binational representation throughout. This means that at NORAD 
bases in both nations Canadian and American military personnel 
work side by side at all levels of organization.
<P>
	The headquarters of NORAD is located at Colorado Springs. The 
commander in chief is an American four star general while the 
deputy commander in chief is a Canadian forces lieutenant general. 
This is an excellent example of co-operation between our two 
nations.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	There are also three regional headquarters: the Alaska NORAD 
region at Elmendorf Air Force Base outside Anchorage; the 
Canadian NORAD region at 22 Wing North Bay, which will move 
to Winnipeg as announced in the recent federal budget; and the 
continental United States region at Tyndall Air Force Base in 
Florida. The regional headquarters in the United States are  
commanded by American air force major generals with Canadian 
brigadier generals as deputies, while the Canadian region is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="547"> 547 </A></B>
<P>
commanded by a Canadian major general with an American air 
force brigadier general as deputy.
<P>
	This is a remarkable achievement and there is no other bilateral 
command in the world that is so fully integrated as NORAD. To the 
men and women who serve within NORAD, the national insignia 
on the uniform is immaterial in their day to day activities providing 
for the aerospace defence of North America. Yet despite this 
integration, NORAD today enhances rather than diminishes our 
sovereignty.
<P>
	Air sovereignty and air defence operations have been enduring 
missions for NORAD since its genesis. Last year NORAD 
monitored over 400,000 flights entering North American air space. 
More than 400 of these flights could not be correlated with known 
flight plans and required further investigation, including in some 
instances the launch of fighter interceptors.
<P>
	Approximately 200 fighter launches take place each year to 
investigate unknown contacts. About one-third of these result in 
interception. Generally the remaining two-thirds are identified by 
other means prior to interception. Although the bulk of these 
interceptions are innocent in nature, in the past a small number 
involved either Russian aircraft or suspected drug smugglers.
<P>
	Assisting law enforcement agencies and countering suspected 
drug smugglers has been a NORAD responsibility since 1991. As I 
mentioned earlier, in addition to air sovereignty, since the 1960s 
NORAD has been responsible for missile warning for North 
America. While the end of the cold war has certainly reduced the 
risk of missile attack in North America, we must remember there 
are approximately 20,000 nuclear weapons in existence around the 
world.
<P>
	As the defence white paper noted, the proliferation of weapons 
of mass destruction and the technology for delivering them over 
long ranges is an issue of growing concern. Accordingly the missile 
warning capability of NORAD remains an important part of North 
American defence.
<P>
	NORAD has specific responsibility to provide warnings of an 
intercontinental ballistic missile, submarine launch ballistic 
missile or cruise missile attack on North America. Global missile 
events are detected by American satellites. Currently there are 
some 100 launches into space each year, most having to do with the 
launch of military and civilian satellites. In the late 1980s annual 
launches numbered approximately 300. NORAD monitors all areas 
of strategic interest seven days a week, 24 hours a day.
<P>
	The greatest benefit the Canadian and American governments 
derive from NORAD is the ability to share not only the 
responsibilities but also the resources for  continental security. It 
would be militarily impractical and economically impossible for 
Canada or the United States to perform NORAD's current missions 
or function unilaterally.
<P>
	As I said earlier, NORAD was signed in 1958 and it built upon 
post war defence arrangements and of course on wartime 
co-operation. Prior to the war there were defence discussions 
between Canada and the United States in the 1930s which built up 
the precedent for the permanent joint board of defence that a 
member earlier mentioned.
<P>
	It is worth remembering that prior to 1930, Canada's defence 
planning was developed with the view of countering attacks from 
the United States or even in some wild moments thinking of small 
Canadian invasions of the United States. It seems ludicrous to us 
today that Canada should have the United States in its defence plan 
as a possible enemy, but within the last 60 years that had been the 
case. What changed the situation was Canadian and American 
leaders working together recognizing that greater threats were 
outside this continent than within. Working together they achieved 
the kind of co-operation that marks Canadian and American 
relationships today.
<P>
	Paradoxically, through co-operation we have shown that we can 
preserve our sovereignty better than through conflict. In the case of 
NORAD the existence of NORAD made our voice louder in 
Washington rather than softer when we objected to American 
policy on the ABM treaty. It made our voice louder in Washington 
when we objected to aspects of the so-called star wars policy of the 
Reagan administration in the 1980s.
<P>
	In summary, the NORAD agreement transcends defence 
co-operation between two nations. Its most visible manifestation is 
the broad based co-operation between two countries. It is a model 
for other countries in the world that face conflict and believe that 
such conflict cannot be transcended.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	NORAD remains well postured to assist both nations in 
responding to current and future aerospace security challenges.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before the resumption of 
debate, it is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the 
House that the question to be raised tonight at the time of 
adjournment is as follows: the hon. member for 
Frontenac-Agri-food sector.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Wood (Nipissing, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
opportunity to address an issue which is of great importance to my 
riding of Nipissing and that is the renewal of the North American 
aerospace defence command agreement. I know my colleagues will 
agree that NORAD is the most visible and important feature of the 
bilateral partnership that exists between Canada and the United 
States. The Canadian NORAD region is headquartered in my 
riding.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="548"> 548 </A></B>
<P>
	Although the NORAD agreement has been renewed at least 
every five years since its first signing back in 1958, the text of 
the agreement has not been revised since 1981. Moreover, 
NORAD's present objectives date back to 1975. These objectives 
are: to assist each nation in safeguarding the sovereignty of its 
air space, and this also includes counter-drug operations; to 
contribute to the deterrence of attack on North America by 
providing capabilities for aerospace surveillance, warning and 
characterization of aerospace attack, as well as defence against air 
attack; and, should deterrence fail, to ensure an appropriate 
response against attack by providing for the effective use of our 
respective forces available for air defence. With these objectives 
in mind, I will summarize the results of the NORAD renewal 
negotiations.
<P>
	Early in 1994 the Minister of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade and the Minister of National Defence directed their officials 
to consult with the United States on the future of NORAD. These 
consultations took place between April 6 and October 18, 1994 
under the auspices of a bilateral group consisting of four agencies: 
from Canada, the Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade and the Department of National Defence; and from the 
United States, the Department of State and the Department of 
Defence.
<P>
	Out of these consultations emerged the report ``Options for 
Canada-U.S. Co-operation in Aerospace Defence'' signed by both 
countries on October 18, 1994. This report established the broad 
framework for the subsequent renewal negotiations.
<P>
	While a working group was conducting its analysis and 
preparing its report, the special joint committees of Canada's 
defence and foreign policies were also examining Canada's future 
participation in NORAD, albeit within a larger context. The 
NORAD renewal consultations and the parliamentary reviews all 
recommended Canada's continued participation in NORAD. Not 
surprisingly, this view was also reflected in the 1994 defence white 
paper.
<P>
	Early in 1995 the Minister of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade and the Minister of National Defence approved Canada's 
renewal objectives. At the end of July last year, Canada and the 
United States together agreed on the general objectives for 
renewal. Canada then crafted the first draft and exchange of notes 
between our countries, which formed the basis for negotiations 
within the United States. Negotiations of the final text of the 
exchange of notes took place from August to November 1995. The 
text was then presented for national approval.
<P>
	In Canada the review and approval process for NORAD renewal 
includes today's parliamentary debate followed by cabinet 
consideration. In addition, the Standing Committee on National 
Defence and Veterans Affairs also examined the technical aspects 
of NORAD's renewal last October.
<P>
	I will now spend a couple of moments on Canadian negotiating 
objectives for NORAD renewal and discuss the degree of success 
we have achieved so far. I should mention here that Canada's 
objectives took full account of the excellent work of the special 
joint committees on Canada's defence and foreign policies as well 
as the NORAD renewal working group. Needless to say, the 
government's 1994 defence white paper provided critical direction.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, the NORAD agreement was last 
rewritten in 1981 and at that time it kept the objectives set out in 
1975. As the agreement is now written, it does not reflect current 
strategic circumstances. Canada's first negotiating objective 
therefore was to update the language of the NORAD agreement to 
reflect current and projected geostrategic circumstances. This first 
negotiating objective has been fully achieved. The new draft 
agreement explicitly recognizes the changed security environment 
of the post cold war era and its effect on North American aerospace 
defence.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	Specifically, the new agreement acknowledged that there is a 
significant decreased threat from manned bombers; that there is the 
potential for deep cuts in nuclear arsenals as a result of arms 
control measures; that nuclear weapons capable of striking North 
America remain in place; that the role of space will take on greater 
significance in the future; and that a proliferation of sophisticated 
cruise missile technologies could pose a threat to North America in 
the future. In short, the new agreement places traditional threats in 
their proper post cold war context while making a prudent 
assessment of future challenges.
<P>
	Given the tremendous changes in the world since 1975 and the 
potential challenges facing us in the years ahead, Canada's second 
renewal objective was to articulate clearly NORAD's current and 
future roles. I am happy to report that this objective has been 
achieved.
<P>
	In the revised NORAD agreement, NORAD's missions are 
specified as aerospace warning and aerospace control. An example 
of aerospace warning is the detection and assessment of missile 
launches such as the well publicized scud missile launches that 
occurred during the gulf war. An example of aerospace control is 
the use of ground based radars to detect, track and assist in the 
identification of unknown aircraft in or approaching Canada's air 
space.
<P>
	Canada also wanted to ensure that the NORAD agreement allows 
for bilateral examination of potential areas of mutual interest 
between our two countries. Therefore, Canada's third negotiating 
objective was to ensure that the NORAD agreement facilitates the 
examination of new or enhanced mission areas and does not close 
off any options that may be in the interests of Canada and the 
United States.
<P>

<P>
	The third negotiating objective has also been fully achieved. 
Nothing in the new agreement would commit Canada or the United 
States to any specific programs in this context, but it would 
provide the flexibility to explore areas of mutual interest in the 
future. It is important to understand that changes to NORAD 
activities can only take place with the agreement of both countries 
at the appropriate levels.
<P>
	It is critical that Canada is able to exert some influence on 
developments in aerospace defence that affect Canadian security 
interests. Canada's fourth negotiating objective therefore was to 
include a consultative mechanism to ensure that any future 
developments affecting the aerospace defence of North America 
would be the subject of prior consultations. Once again, this 
objective has been achieved. Wording has been incorporated into 
the new agreement that will provide for this consultation. 
Moreover, this consultation will serve to underscore the central 
role of NORAD in North American aerospace defence.
<P>
	During the negotiations, Canada also argued that a clause on the 
environment should be included in the revised agreement to protect 
the environmental interests of both countries. This was not a stated 
Canadian objective but the government did attach importance to it. 
The new agreement stresses the importance of protecting the 
environment and commits both parties to reveal the environmental 
dimension of NORAD operations to the permanent joint board of 
defence. The procedures for this environmental review will likely 
be the subject of a separate agenda item at the next meeting of the 
PJBD in April this year. This additional negotiating objective has 
been fully met as Canada and the United States will consult at a 
higher level on NORAD's role in protecting the environment.
<P>
	In closing, we are on track for a highly successful renewal of the 
NORAD agreement this spring. All of Canada's negotiating 
objectives have been achieved. The renewal of NORAD this year 
will represent the most significant revision of the agreement since 
1981.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am very pleased to take part in this debate on the renewal of the 
North American Aerospace Defense Command agreement, 
commonly known as the NORAD agreement.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	It is important to remember that Canada signed this agreement 
for the first time in 1958. Canada and the United States have 
renewed the agreement seven times and are expected to renew it 
again this year, which explains the debate we are having today in 
this House.
<P>
	First of all, allow me to review the historical background to the 
NORAD agreement, and then to propose to extend the NORAD 
agreement in order to  include our economic partners from the rest 
of the Americas.
<P>
	To properly understand how such an important organization got 
its start, I would like to quote from a document prepared in the back 
rooms of National Defence, which summarizes NORAD's main 
objectives.
<P>
	According to this document, NORAD's groundwork was laid out 
before the cold war, when Canada and the United States joined 
together to triumph over Europe-Japan axis powers. The concept of 
joint defence activities between Canada and the United States was 
officially mentioned for this first time in the 1940 Ogdensburg 
Declaration. In February 1947, after the second world war, both 
Ottawa and Washington announced the principles for future 
military co-operation, including air defence.
<P>
	In 1954, the Chief of Staff of the Royal Canadian Air Force and 
the commander of the United States Air Forces Air Defence 
Command held formal discussions. They concluded that air 
defence for both countries could be best provided by a single 
organization under one command. In 1957, the Canadian Minister 
of National Defence and the U.S. Defence Secretary announced the 
signing of a binational agreement to establish an integrated air 
command based at Colorado Springs, U.S.A.
<P>
	Since May 12, 1958, the two countries have been renewing this 
agreement every five years.
<P>
	This brief introduction or historical overview shows the 
importance of this agreement as far as the air defence of North 
American, more specifically of Canadian, air space is concerned. 
But there are also economic reasons, in addition to the historical 
ones.
<P>
	I shall stop for an aside here, reminding you that Canada pays for 
only approximately 10 per cent of the costs of defending North 
American air space, and the Bloc Quebecois is in favour of 
renewing the NORAD agreement. At the same time, however, it 
does propose major changes.
<P>
	The Bloc believes that, unlike the situation in 1991, renewal of 
the agreement now ought to trigger debate and a far more 
transparent evaluation of the role of NORAD in a post cold war 
context. The threat of the U.S.S.R. no longer hangs over Canada 
and the U.S. The traditional threat of nuclear conflict is, to all 
intents and purposes, no longer present. There are still other 
threats, however, such as the emergence of regional powers with 
nuclear weapons, and the rise in terrorism. Both of these could 
have been discussed in a far more transparent fashion here today in 
the House.
<P>
	North America's air defence role can, and must, change to keep 
pace with international geostrategic fluctuations. The Bloc Quebe-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="550"> 550 </A></B>
<P>
cois is convinced that decisions on renewal could have been shaped 
by such  considerations, but here again everything points toa done deal.
<P>
	According to February 24's <I>Le Devoir</I>, the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs has apparently already endorsed the final version of the new 
NORAD agreement. The Minister is supposedly going to sign it on 
March 13 or 14 with his American counterpart, according to this 
report.
<P>
	What disrespect on the minister's part. Disrespect for the 
members of his own party, who get up and speak while knowing 
full well their minister has already negotiated the clauses of the 
agreement with the U.S. behind the scenes. Disrespect for the 
House as well, scoffing at the importance of the debate that has 
been going on here and the opinion of the members of all parties. I 
trust that the Minister of Foreign Affairs will not get into the habit 
of throwing such roadblocks in the way of the workings of this 
House, for his credibility will suffer if he does.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	The Bloc also regrets the fact that the government did not use the 
occasion of the renewal of the agreement to redefine the primary 
mission, as it said it would in its 1994 white paper on defence. The 
proposed changes to the new agreement are relatively minor. 
Another promise by the wayside, but we are used to that.
<P>
	There is one basic point we would have wanted raised in the 
negotiations for NORAD's renewal. It has to do with opportunities 
to expand the agreement to include new economic partners in the 
Americas. The Free Trade Agreement has become the North 
American Free Trade Agreement. Three countries have interests in 
this huge continental market, and Chile is waiting in the wings. All 
of the Americas have agreed to open borders within a specific time 
frame. Given this opening up of commercial markets and the 
countless economic networks, a complete redefinition of NORAD 
seems inevitable and must take this new pan-American reality into 
account.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois feels that a renewed NORAD should be the 
basic means of linking our economic and commercial interests to 
military alliances, which may ensure the longevity of the incipient 
political stability in Central and South American countries.
<P>
	On many occasions, we have seen how a country's political 
stability depends on its economic prosperity. I think it would be 
beneficial to all the Americas to have this stability apply to the 
entire continent, north and south.
<P>
	The proposal to expand NORAD should first be made to Mexico, 
which is already a NAFTA partner. It would then be appropriate to 
invite other countries in the OAS to take part in a joint continental 
defence project.
<P>
	The dispute between Cuba and the United States provides a 
patent example of the complexities in the relationships among the
<P>
countries of the three Americas.  The Bloc Quebecois, like the 
government, condemns the action of the Cuban air force, but leaves 
it up to the ICAO to investigate and reach its conclusions. 
However, the Helms-Burton bill, through its extraterritoriality, 
violates international law and impinges on Canadian sovereignty in 
the area of foreign relations. This conflict also reveals the close 
weave of political, economic and commercial ties among the 
various trading partners on the continent.
<P>
	The question we are asking on this side of the House is whether 
such a tragic event should lead us to wonder about the continent as 
a whole given the links between the countries which make it up. Do 
economic interests stay separate from political interests for long? 
This is a issue that highlights NORAD's importance within the 
context of the global market.
<P>
	Cohesion is essential in this era of interdependency and, in my 
opinion, seems to be a priority in the renewal of this key agreement 
between two players faced with a increasingly changing 
chess-board.
<P>
	To remain up to date, a new NORAD could allow for an extended 
partnership, as we have seen with NATO, which would serve as a 
support to co-operation for peacekeeping as well as for democracy 
or the respect of human rights.
<P>
	We are under the impression that with the assistance that the 
United States and Canada give to Haiti, to give only one example, a 
preventive air mission could be conducted under the auspices of 
NORAD. Many countries in South America are working toward 
democracy or trying to protect human rights. These countries could 
also benefit from such assistance.
<P>
	We firmly believe that, with some sort of regional alliance, 
issues such as the Haitian problem or the trafficking of drugs from 
Colombia would be substantially different. By making overtures to 
these countries which are not part of the western bloc, an expanded 
NORAD could develop linkages with the south, bringing us to 
more open-mindedness and creating new opportunities for Latin 
American countries.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	With regard to technology, NORAD offers several alternatives 
through co-operation, which would narrow the gap between north 
and south and could result in the export of specialized jobs to the 
south. Technological transfers would revitalize the economy in the 
countries involved. Chili, where Canadian exporters are investing 
millions of dollars, is a case in point. Several other countries in 
South America are interested in technology making quick inroads 
into their markets.
<P>
	On an American continent open for business, it would to the 
benefit of every one to have partners with a healthy economy and a 
healthy political life. Human rights, respect for democracy and 
open trade are in North America major values, which are becoming 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="551"> 551 </A></B>
<P>
increasingly  present in the south. These are several elements 
which would warrant a closer monitoring of the continent.
<P>
	Nobody likes to trade at the expense of human rights. It is up to 
us to uphold these fundamental values. Moreover, by increasing the 
number of its military partners in the Americas, Canada would no 
longer be alone to protect its sovereignty against the United States. 
Multilateral agreements would result in American decisions with 
regard to air defense having somewhat less weight.
<P>
	One must realize that, with around 10 per cent of the budget and 
an even lesser percentage of forces, Canada is far from having the 
last say within NORAD. By increasing the number of participants 
and decision makers, and by involving emerging democracies in 
the decision making process, Canada will improve its reputation in 
this part of the world, which is becoming increasingly familiar to 
us.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would say that we are convinced that NORAD's 
mission should be broadened in order to include our economic 
partners in the rest of the Americas. This would provide a new 
direction for NORAD more in tune with the major economic, social 
and political challenges of the next century.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I have a question for the member for Terrebonne. 
In his speech-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
-the description of NORAD was well defined in the early part of 
the hon. member's speech. The preamble to that led me to believe 
that he was looking at this as a collective security agreement, 
which it is.
<P>
	Then it got into something like it was the United Nations with all 
kinds of different aspects to it that were not under the umbrella of 
the existing mandate for NORAD. As a consequence it was sucked 
into the Organization of American States and other areas of 
co-operation, like NAFTA.
<P>
	The reality is a aérospatial collective agreement. It is nothing 
else but that. It is two countries coming together for collective 
security to bring some stability and peace of mind in case there is 
the need to activate it in full force again.
<P>
	What does the member see in the defensive aspects of the-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	-North American Aerospace Defence Command as being 
positive?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sauvageau:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for his 
question, which gives me the opportunity to explain some elements 
of my speech he thinks were not perfectly clear. Please excuse me 
for that, dear colleague.
<P>
	The only thing I was trying to say is that Canada and the United 
States signed, in 1958, an agreement on the defence of North 
American air space mainly because they were the two major 
economic and political partners in America and in North America 
for that matter.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	Given the opening up of markets, given the ties being created 
between Mexico and Chile, given also the conclusions of the last 
trip the Prime Minister made to South America where he said to the 
Organization of American States that we wanted a common market 
25 years from now, I believe defence of the air space should be 
extended not only to Canada and the United States, but to all of the 
Americas.
<P>
	The basis for NORAD, that is defence against the eastern bloc 
during the cold war, because NORAD came a short while before the 
cold war but was mainly established during the cold war, has 
evolved and changed over the years. Should the NORAD bases now 
be reoriented according to the geostrategic realities of the 
Americas? I believe so.
<P>
	As my colleagues have said previously, we support the renewal 
of the NORAD agreement, like our Reform and Liberal friends. On 
that no one disagrees, everybody agrees: NORAD is profitable for 
Canada. Nobody disagrees, everybody agrees.
<P>
	However, in their 1994 defence white paper, the Liberals said 
that what was needed was a thorough redefinition of NORAD 
orientations; but in the renewal agreement such as it is proposed, 
we can see that its principles have not been redefined at all. The 
only thing I want to say to my hon. colleague is the following: yes, 
NORAD is good, but NORAD needs to evolve with the course of 
events, economy and trade trends and all ties that bind all countries 
of the Americas together.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak during this 
debate. I may be able to add something to it. Everyone in the House 
was given a briefing book from national defence on NORAD and I 
would like quote one sentence from that document: ``Following the 
second world war in February 1947, both Ottawa and Washington 
announced the principles for future military co-operation, 
including air defence''. I will comment on that February 1947 
agreement because it involved much more than settling the 
principles we needed for a collective air defence.
<P>
	Canada shared with Britain and the United States the most 
intimate military secrets. At the end of the war they knew about 
radar, they had done the most intimate experiments in chemical and 
biological warfare research and they shared communications 
intelligence. Canada was directly linked with the United States and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="552"> 552 </A></B>
<P>
Britain in  intercepting radio signals and decrypting them, as well 
as decrypting diplomatic signals.
<P>
	Canada also ended the war as the second nuclear power in the 
world. Nearby in Chalk River the second nuclear reactor outside of 
the United States started up in 1945, precisely at the same time that 
Igor Gouzenko, the famous Soviet cypher clerk, defected to Canada 
and actually launched the cold war. It was Gouzenko who warned 
the British and the Americans that the Russians were not allies at 
all but were planning world domination. That led very directly to 
the secret accord of February 1947.
<P>
	The details of that agreement are still unavailable in the archives 
of Canada and the United States although various historians have 
been able to piece together what it consisted of. It dealt in the 
sharing of communications intelligence and signals intelligence. It 
included the sharing of biological and chemical warfare research. 
Canadians undertook on behalf of the allies to do most of the 
chemical warfare testing at Suffield near Medicine Hat.
<P>
	The agreement also included the setting up various intelligence 
organizations in Canada which did not exist before. These included 
the joint intelligence committee which was the clearing house of 
secret intelligence, and the joint intelligence bureau which 
examined topographical intelligence, geography and that kind of 
thing.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
	Once the threat had been appreciated, that Stalin was a dictator 
much along the lines of Hitler, it was realized that the United States 
was the next likely target. The Americans decided that the attack 
was likely to come over the Arctic. Therefore, Canada in a very real 
sense had no choice but to co-operate with the United States in 
setting up some sort of air defence plan in the Arctic.
<P>
	I have actually seen a document in which the former prime 
minister, Mackenzie King, advised his deputy minister of foreign 
affairs that Canada had to come to an agreement with the United 
States because American planes were already mapping Canada's 
Arctic and if Canada did not come to a military agreement on the 
defence of North America with the United States it would be a 
serious erosion of our sovereignty.
<P>
	However, the agreement for the defence of North America, 
which finally took place in 1957, was not that hard to come by in 
the sense that Canada, the United States and Britain were already 
intimate allies in terms of secret intelligence. We shared then, as I 
hope we still do now, the most intimate military secrets without 
question. I can give you an example of that actually, Madam 
Speaker, and I will in a moment.
<P>
	When the North America air defence system was set up it 
consisted primarily of three lines: the DEW line, the distant early 
warning line which was a series of radar  stations in the high Arctic 
that looked over into the Soviet Union as far as they could go. The 
idea was to spot the masses of Soviet bombers as they approached 
Canadian territory. Then there was the mid-Canada line which was 
a series of automatic radar stations that would indicate which 
direction these masses of bombers were flying, whether they were 
going to Chicago, New York or wherever. This was followed by the 
pine tree line with one station up near Barrie, not very far north of 
Toronto. That line was designed to zero in on the interceptors. We 
had aircraft stationed at North Bay that were designed to shoot it 
out with the incoming Russian bombers. That was the situation 
toward the end of the 1950s.
<P>
	It was apparent that this was a very expensive thing to put 
together. What I have to stress again is that this required the most 
intimate co-operation between the Americans and the Canadians. 
By 1960 it became apparent that it was going to be very difficult to 
shoot down the masses of bombers. It was at about that time, in the 
early 1960s, that the Canadian government under Diefenbaker 
decided to abandon the famous Avro project which was the fighter 
bomber that the Canadians had developed which was a superb 
aircraft, no doubt about it, in favour of Bomarc missiles. Canada, at 
the pine tree line level, became armed with Bomarc missiles. These 
were the most modern missiles of their time.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I am going to tell you something that you do 
not know. These Bomarc missiles which were stationed in various 
places in Canada were equipped with nuclear warheads. At the 
time, the government denied that there were nuclear warheads on 
Canadian territory but in fact the archives just down the street will 
show that Canada actually did have nuclear warheads on the 
Bomarc missiles. The reason for this was that if the bombers came 
down in waves then a small nuclear warhead could shoot down 30 
or 40 bombers rather than trying to bring them down individually.
<P>
	I mention this to illustrate how absolute was the exchange of 
secret intelligence between the United States and Canada at that 
time and how absolute was the confidence that the Americans had 
in Canada because it actually permitted another foreign country to 
have missiles on their soil which were capable not just of shooting 
down Russian bombers, but also capable of attacking the United 
States. Given the American isolationist or independence mentality, 
to have that much trust in another country is quite remarkable.
<P>
	That leads me to why I am glad to have the opportunity to rise 
during this debate because now we come to the present. The threat 
has changed and it is a different threat. It is not the Soviet Union 
perhaps but there are cruise missiles, biological warfare weapons, 
nuclear weapons going around the world who knows where. The 
threat still exists so there is good reason to want to renew this 
NORAD agreement with the Americans.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="553"> 553 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	Earlier in this debate several of my colleagues from the Bloc 
spoke very strongly for the agreement and felt it could be extended 
to the rest of North America. It cannot be extended. The history of 
secret intelligence in Canada has been an exchange of information 
between the United States and actually less so with Britain.
<P>
	Those who would argue that we can separate this country and not 
lose some essential things are wrong. I can suggest the one thing 
that we would lose, certainly a separate Quebec would lose, is the 
ability to be a partner in the secret intelligence arrangements that 
have existed for 50 years between the United States and Britain. I 
suggest that type of isolation would not only be unfortunate for a 
separate Quebec, it would be very dangerous.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak in the debate on the renewal of the North American 
Aerospace Defence Command, commonly known as NORAD. 
Canadians are frequently reminded that we have differences with 
the United States and indeed we do.
<P>
	The media tells us of the disputes with the U.S. over the inside 
passage between the Canadian mainland and Vancouver Island. 
They tell us that we differ over the export of grain, eggs, pork 
products and softwood lumber under our trade agreements and we 
differ over how we should deal with Cuba. We differ as friends and 
participation in NORAD has done much to foster this friendship.
<P>
	The list of things that Canadians and Americans have in common 
is much longer and this list begins with NORAD. Created in 1958 
the first agreement covered 10 years and has been renewed seven 
times since. Each time the Parliament of Canada has fulfilled its 
responsibility in debating the merits of a further extension. Indeed 
with the debate today we are once again exercising these 
responsibilities.
<P>
	NORAD has evolved over the years from its original purposes 
for a binational command structure for fighter defence against long 
range Soviet bombers to attack warning in the mid-sixties in 
response to intercontinental ballistic missiles. In the mid-1970s the 
current objectives of NORAD were defined which included 
assistance in safeguarding sovereignty of airspace which now 
includes counter drug initiatives, contributing to deterrence of 
attack by surveillance and warning and if deterrence fail to ensure 
an appropriate response to attack.
<P>
	These agreements have never been static. They changed to meet 
the changing needs of Canada. The House will note that the first 
NORAD agreement was for 10 years. This was too long between 
reviews. We needed to look over the forms of our continental 
defence effort in the context of changing times and times changed  
rapidly in the sixties, seventies and eighties and even faster in the 
nineties.
<P>
	Each renewal has taken place in an atmosphere created by the 
times. During the Vietnam war some Canadians believed that we 
should not renew NORAD at all. Overall our differences have stood 
the fact of our common North American home, the fact of our 
shared history and the rock bottom inescapable fact of our 
generally similar values.
<P>
	Our overriding interest since 1958 has been in preserving our 
heritage from attack by a system with which we shared little. 
However, with the end of the Russian empire we have discovered 
that we have more in common than we knew with the peoples of 
that region. We have discovered that we do have some things in 
common with the Russian people. With the disappearance of their 
repressive and expansionist system of government times have 
changed.
<P>
	This time consideration of NORAD renewal takes place in an 
atmosphere underlined by a greater degree of international calm 
than at any time in the past. At a time when vicious little wars and 
the mass murder of prisoners and civilians have brought terrible 
suffering to the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda we in Canada face 
our own insecurities. We are safer now from attack from abroad 
than at any time since the second world war. This security is 
founded to a large extent on NORAD. Developments only this 
decade are helping to foster greater confidence that the world will 
not end in a nuclear holocaust.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	This system is led by the UN and includes some important 
regional groupings such as the Organization for Security and 
Co-operation in Europe, the Organization of African Unity, the 
Organization of American States and many others.
<P>
	The system that defends North America, European security and 
defence interests is that led by the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization, NATO. On this side of the Atlantic the two NATO 
partners, Canada and the United States, are allied bilaterally under 
NORAD. NORAD defends the aerospace of the North American 
region of NATO. Canada is co-operating with a military and 
economic superpower in the defence of this continent.
<P>
	It would be foolish to pretend we bring equal resources to this 
task. The U.S. is the senior partner. This is reflected by the fact that 
the NORAD commander in chief is always an American and a 
four-star U.S. air force general. His deputy is always a Canadian, a 
three-star general.
<P>
	The U.S. is the one remaining military super power. As I 
indicated earlier, despite our differences of view on some important 
matters we have relatively few important differences on the 
defence of this continent.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="554"> 554 </A></B>
<P>
	We all know the cold war is over but we should remember there 
are still thousands of nuclear weapons in the world and thousands 
more people who would like to detonate them in this part of the 
world.
<P>
	There is also a need to remain vigilant against terrorists and drug 
smugglers. NORAD continues to do this. We must continue to 
protect this continent from threats. There is no question that 
Canadians and Americans share the view that drug smuggling and 
terrorism are threats serious enough to warrant the use of 
NORAD's resources.
<P>
	NORAD continues to symbolize the things Canada and the 
United States share. Consideration of NORAD renewal in 1996 
takes place in circumstances quite different from previous 
renewals. This time there is a residual threat from nuclear weapons 
in addition to drug smuggling and terrorism, and there is a nuclear, 
biological and chemical threat combined with terrorism that flows 
from the existence of states that inhabit a place outside the 
intercourse of the civilized world.
<P>
	These are the countries that work to gain control of nuclear, 
chemical and biological weapons and at the same time striving to 
increase the capabilities of their rockets. Some of these weapons 
can now reach parts of North America.
<P>
	Let us not forget China's continued testing of nuclear weapons 
and its present bellicose activities mere kilometres off the coast of 
Taiwan. These are countries that show no sign of changing their 
outlaw ways and there will continue to be a threat from them. 
NORAD will continue to scan North American aerospace as a 
defence against attack from this kind of threat.
<P>
	Canada has benefited from its participation in NORAD and will 
continue to do so. There are practical benefits to be considered. In 
intelligence sharing with the United States, the leading nation of 
the free world, we are the first among equals when linked with this 
nation. We also have shared access to leading edge technology 
which alone we cannot even dream of being able to afford.
<P>
	The operational value of Canadian forces interacting with U.S. 
forces in complex situations is most beneficial for our military. 
NORAD is simply a good deal for Canada when one realizes the 
cost to our country is a mere 10 per cent of the total budget while 
we receive a shared 100 per cent of the benefits attributable to this 
agreement. It is good value for our Canadian dollar.
<P>
	NORAD also provides Canada an opportunity to develop space 
power. The exploitation of space for military purposes is 
inevitable. There is a new objective in the proposed agreement, one 
that is most welcome, enhanced environmental protection. 
NORAD activities will now be undertaken with the protection of 
environmental interests of both nations.
<P>
	We have learned from the difficulties of the clean-up of the 
environmental harms done by the DEW line, whose clean-up will
<P>
be started this year. This is a step forward, as the previous 
agreement did not address the issue of environmental protection.
<P>
	All these things serve to remind us of how much we have in 
common with the United States. There are times to celebrate 
differences and times to recognize shared values. It is a time to 
renew NORAD and to acknowledge our good fortune in having 
good neighbours.
<P>
	Since 1958 NORAD has served the citizens of Canada and the 
United States as the first line of defence against an aerospace attack 
on our homeland. It has provided through its warning capabilities a 
clear deterrent to any aggressor. Through outstanding co-operation 
and cohesiveness this organization has proven itself in 
strengthening the security and sovereignty of Canada and the 
United States through its role of watching, warning and 
responding.
<P>
	By adapting to a changing world and positioning itself to 
anticipate future challenges NORAD will continue to play a critical 
role in the defence of Canada and the United States. I urge all 
members of the House to support continued participation in 
NORAD.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richardson:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
There being no further speakers, I seek the unanimous consent of 
the House to call it 6.43 p.m., which I believe is the scheduled time 
of adjournment, and that we then move directly to the adjournment 
debate if members are present and ready.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Is there 
unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am glad to be revisiting something that I consider essential and that 
is denying Canada the right to impose tariff equivalents to replace 
import quotas on milk, poultry and eggs products. At the present 
time, the United States are arguing their case before a special panel 
set up under chapter 20 of NAFTA. The five national organizations 
dealing with supply management in agriculture as well as the 
Government of Canada are abiding by the agreements signed under 
the WTO.
<P>

<P>
	This major trade dispute should be settled come springtime. Is 
the Minister of Agriculture aware that  Canada has a lot to lose in 
this dispute, more than 138,000 jobs? Should Canada lose before 
this NAFTA panel, 138,000 ``jobs, jobs, jobs'' will be in jeopardy.
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister aware that he is digging his own grave? 
One hundred and thirty eight thousand jobs, that is enormous. 
Consequently, what measures is the Minister of Agriculture going 
to take to win his case before the panel? Could he guarantee this 
House that he will defend this case as if his life depended on it?
<P>
	The uncertainty in the agricultural industry in Canada is the 
reason why so many of our farmers are worried; and considering 
what the Minister of Agriculture is doing, how can they not to be 
worried? The government is burying its head in the sand. Is the 
Canadian government convinced that it will win this fight?
<P>
	We must not fool ourselves. We must face reality and not hide 
from it. Above all, we must not hide from the consequences of a 
potential defeat that would undoubtedly drive many of our farmers 
to bankruptcy.
<P>
	I wonder if the minister of agriculture intends, for example, to 
compensate farmers for the financial losses related to the value of 
their production quotas. Will the minister of agriculture and his 
government again go so far as to agree to make concessions to the 
powerful Americans a few months before the presidential election, 
as they did with softwood lumber, durum wheat and sugar, for 
example?
<P>
	Let us not forget that Canada agreed to make concessions such as 
setting export quotas and increasing stumpage fees to make our 
American neighbours happy.
<P>
	In the conflict between Cuba and the U.S., the timid behaviour of 
the Prime Minister and his Minister for International Trade puzzles 
farmers. Is this what awaits us? One does not play with 138,000 
jobs. The government's casual handling of this matter is 
unacceptable, and the Bloc Quebecois formally notifies this 
government that it will never forgive carelessness or a moment of 
weakness in this matter of import tariffs on supply-managed 
agricultural products.
<P>
	In closing, the Canadian government has the greatest cause in its 
hands. Everyone agrees that the Americans will be defeated, so we 
must not make any concession. Do not blink.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Secretary of State (Agriculture 
and Agri-Food, Fisheries and Oceans), Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
want to reassure the hon. member for Frontenac and say that 
Canada will not give up anything. Throughout the panel's 
proceedings, Canada will strongly defend its right to impose 
customs duties on dairy products, poultry and other American 
commodities.
<P>
	The government worked in close co-operation with industry and 
provincial officials to prepare Canada's case, before it is heard by 
NAFTA's dispute settlement panel.
<P>
	Canada and the United States have now submitted their briefs to 
the panel. In its document, the United States claims that Canada did 
not comply with its commitment, under NAFTA, not to increase its 
customs duties, adding that under the same agreement Canada must 
eliminate all such duties by 1998.
<P>
	That position does not take into account-and I say it loud and 
clear-the fact that both the FTA and NAFTA clearly state that 
Canada retains the rights granted to it under GATT regarding 
agricultural commodities subject to a supply management system, 
including the right to apply WTO's tariff provisions to agricultural 
commodities of American origin.
<P>
	In its brief to the panel, Canada insists that the tariff system it 
uses regarding these commodities is in full compliance with its 
international trade obligations under NAFTA and the WTO. When 
Canada agreed to have tariff provisions apply to Article XI, in 
support of products subject to the supply management system, it 
had obtained legal opinions expressly confirming the validity of its 
right, under GATT, the WTO and NAFTA, to impose resulting tariff 
equivalents to US imports.
<P>
	We are convinced that our legal opinions are valid and we will 
vigorously defend the rights of Canadian producers before 
NAFTA's panel. We will not concede anything.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The motion to 
adjourn the House is now deemed adopted. Accordingly, this 
House stands adjourned until 10 a.m. tomorrow, pursuant to 
Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 5.43 p.m.)
<P>
