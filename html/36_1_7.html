</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.)</B>  moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-219, an act to amend the Criminal Code (using or 
operating a stolen motor vehicle in the commission of an 
offence). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to introduce this private 
member's bill.  This enactment amends the Criminal Code and 
provides that a person is guilty of an indictable offence and 
must be sentenced to one year imprisonment if the person operates 
or uses a motor vehicle that the person has stolen or knows has 
been stolen while committing or attempting to commit an offence 
or during flight after committing or attempting to commit an 
offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sentence imposed on a person for such an offence shall be 
served consecutively to any other punishment that is imposed on 
the person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police expressed the need 
for this bill in light of the epidemic of car thefts used to 
commit a crime.  In some cases this has proven to be fatal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Vancouver alone there have been three deaths where 
individuals have stolen cars and killed people.  This has also 
been the case with many young offenders joy riding after stealing 
a car and encountering police pursuits.  This bill is needed as a 
deterrent to those considering these types of actions.  I am 
pleased to introduce this bill today.

selling or authorizing the story of a crime.  If a person is 
convicted of an indictable offence under the Criminal Code any 
moneys he or she may have made or may make in the future from the 
creation of a work based on the crime would be deemed proceeds of 
crime, subject to seizure by the crown.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.)</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-221, an act to amend the Canada Business 
Corporations Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to introduce my 
private member's bill, an act to amend the Canada Business 
Corporations Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill if passed will allow members of the boards of 
directors of Canadian corporations the defence of due diligence 
in the conduct and performance of their duties and 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too often very competent individuals decide not to become 
members of the boards of corporations because they fear they 
could be held liable for their conduct, even if they carry out 
their duties and responsibilities in a conscientious and 
reasonable way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, a number of months ago we heard about the case of 
Canadian Airlines International and its board of directors which 
resigned at a time when one could argue easily that it was needed 
most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill provides directors with the defence of due diligence 
and brings the Canada Business Corporations Act into line with 
most provincial statutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to introduce this bill and I look forward to the 
support of my colleagues in the House on this important piece of 
legislation.

percentage of the total cost that the grant represents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to introduce by private 
member's bill in the House today. This bill would require the 
recipients of grants of public funds for cultural projects to 
acknowledge that a grant has been made.  It would also require 
recipients to specify the percentage the total cost of the grant 
represents at the time the program is announced or advertised and 
open to the public. Non-compliance may result in the recipient's 
having to repay the grant.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK37">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the government for 
making their 50/50 election promise on any future surpluses 
without adequate public debate as to the optimal size of 
government, taxes, and debt, thus threatening to repeat 
Canada's 27 year old history of irresponsible spending, 
creating high debt, financed by high taxes, causing high 
unemployment. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, just so people get the point, let me 
re-read the motion.  The motion is: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the government for making their 50/50 
election promise on any future surpluses without adequate public 
debate as to the optimal size of government, taxes, and debt, 
thus threatening to repeat Canada's 27 year old history of 
irresponsible spending, creating high debt, financed by high 
taxes, causing high unemployment. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As somebody very wise once said—who is very well known to you, 
Mr. Speaker—this is the public's money.  That is the point we 
are trying to make.  I want to underline it by pointing out that 
the government has not consulted with Canadians on this whole 
issue, probably the most important economic decision that it will 
make during its mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we know so far?  This flows from the government's 
election promise and from its throne speech of last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the government reaffirmed its commitment to spend 
50 percent of any surpluses, when they occur, on new spending. We know 
that.  It was in part of the election package and it was also in 
the throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I raise the question of whose money is this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we know that there was absolutely no acknowledgement in 
the throne speech that Canada has a debt of $600 billion.  That 
is a staggering amount of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was absolutely no acknowledgement in the throne speech 
that we have the highest taxes of all of our trading partners, 
the highest personal income taxes in the G-7 by a tremendous 
amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no acknowledgement in the throne speech that in the 
past the government has been routinely chided, not only by 
watchdogs like the Reform Party and the Canadian Taxpayers 
Federation, but even by the auditor general on many occasions for 
irresponsible spending.  There was no acknowledgement of that in 
the throne speech.  I will say more about that in a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No criteria has been laid down by the government for determining 
how any of this surplus should be spent, whether on new programs 
or on the side of taxes and debt reduction.  Of course there was 
one measly lone reference in the throne speech to reducing taxes 
and paying down debt. 
Absolutely no criteria have been established on how those 
decisions are going to be made.  The government has not talked 
about what the optimal size of debt, taxes and the level of 
government would be.  There has been no definition anywhere about 
what constitutes, for instance, a tax break.  What is tax relief 
as opposed to a social benefit that is delivered through the 
taxation system?  That is a very important point.  It would not 
be nearly as important if people knew that the government could 
be counted on to be up front and give them what most people 
believe would be a tax break.  However, it appears the government 
may be intent on playing some games with what constitutes a tax 
break.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, there is no indication whether the spending announced in 
the throne speech will be applied toward the government's 50 percent 
spending promise.  It is not mentioned anywhere.  Therefore, we 
really cannot hold the government accountable to its promise 
unless we know that for a fact. I think there are many reasons to 
be concerned about what we know so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know, based on a recent poll published in the weekend 
<I>Financial Post</I>, that Canadians want tax relief. For 
instance, the poll states that 28 percent of Canadians would like to see 
a personal income tax cut, 3 percent want to see a business tax cut, and 
another 20 percent want to see both personal income taxes and corporate 
taxes reduced.  That is a plurality of people who want to see tax 
relief, at least 51 percent.  The people who want to see personal income 
tax cuts compared to the people who want to see taxes rise are 
outnumbered by a margin of 28:1.  Those are the things that we 
know based on what has gone on before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyone who is just a little bit logical has to conclude that 
what the government is proposing, in the face of the poll that I 
have just mentioned and after 27 years of fiscal 
irresponsibility, is the return to chequebook politics.  We are 
returning to the 1970s and the sorts of supposed solutions that 
the government at that time brought forward.  Rather obviously, 
those solutions failed miserably at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question raised in many people's minds is why are we 
repeating the same mistakes that we made in the past?  As 
somebody once pointed out, if one does not pay careful attention 
to history one is bound to repeat all of the mistakes.  I seems 
that is what the government is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked a little bit about some of the things that the 
government did not acknowledge.  I talked about the debt, taxes 
and irresponsible spending.  I want to say a little bit more 
about that in a bit more detail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, the Reform Party has done a tremendous amount 
of work on raising these issues not only with the government but 
also with the public.  We think it is important that the public 
be invited to consult on these sorts of issues. As a responsible 
party we do our part to ensure, to the degree that we can, that 
we provide some background information so that when people give 
us feedback on these issues it is informed and that people really 
understand all the things that have happened in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make that point by talking about some of the things 
that are in our document, Beyond a Balanced Budget.  We are going 
to be consulting with Canadians over the next three months to 
gather their input.  By the way, if people want a copy of 
this—and I say to my hon. friends that they can certainly come 
and get one from me—it is on the Internet at www.reform.ca/babb 
so that if people want to pull that down they can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to address specifically the issue of debt.  In the throne 
speech the government made one reference to the whole problem of 
debt.  It seems blind to the fact that the debt in this country 
is $600 billion.  It consumes about 74 percent of the gross domestic 
product in the country which is almost without parallel among any 
of our trading partners.  It is an absolutely astronomical 
figure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I often point out to high school students when I talk to them 
that if they stacked up one hundred dollar bills about this high 
that would be a million dollars and if they stacked up our debt 
in one hundred dollar bills it would be about 1,200 kilometres 
high.  It is a tremendous amount of money.

</I></B></P><P align=left>But that in itself really is not the problem.  The problem with 
a debt that big is it has to be serviced. Interest payments on 
the debt have grown exponentially.  They now consume about $47 
billion a year.  A third of every tax dollar that Canadians send 
to the treasury each year goes toward paying the interest on the 
debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We point out in our paper, Beyond a Balanced Budget, that since 
1993 debt service charges have increased by $7.5 billion a year. 
That is only since the government came to power.  At the same 
time health transfers have fallen by about $7 billion a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has had a profound impact on the ability of the government to 
fund the programs that are the most important to Canadians.  That 
is why the issue of the debt deserves more than one lonely 
mention in the government's throne speech.  We condemn the 
government for not paying more attention to this important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps this will help bring the issue home for people who have 
trouble dealing with an astronomical number like $600 billion or 
even $47 billion in interest.  The annual interest bill is enough 
to run the governments of Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, 
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, 
with enough left over to repay the entire public debts of 
Newfoundland, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. It is a 
tremendous amount of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The annual interest bill is enough to pay the annual federal 
transfers to the provinces for health, education, welfare, 
equalization and old age security.  It is by far the single 
biggest payment the government makes each and every year.  It is 
money that could be used for good things but because of the 
profligacy of previous governments, the government is paying out 
this tremendous amount of money, in many cases to foreign 
lenders, and this imperils the future of the country. The country 
is that much more vulnerable when the debt is $600 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We argue in our paper that the government must pay attention to 
the debt.  If government members talked to their constituents 
they would discover that people are very concerned about this 
massive debt.  They are probably disappointed that the government 
has not paid more attention to it in the throne speech, which 
allegedly is the vision that the government lays out for the next 
few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just the issue of the debt that we are concerned 
about.  We are concerned about the government's poor commitment 
to the issue of reducing taxes.  There is one single mention in 
the throne speech.  A moment ago I spoke about our personal 
income tax burden.  I do not know if members realize that 
compared to our G-7 trading partners, the personal income tax 
burden is 52 percent higher as a per cent of the total economy than in 
the U.S., Japan, U.K, France and Italy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously when you have a tax on production, which is what 
income tax is, that is that much higher than our trading 
partners, it will have a profound impact on our ability to 
compete.  In the <I>Financial Post</I> poll on the weekend 
business leaders such as Peggy Whip from the Royal Oak Mines 
stated that the reason the company moved its operation to the 
United States was it could not attract people to Canada because 
the personal income tax burden is so high they refused to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not an academic exercise.  It has a profound impact on 
jobs.  People in the business community have said so.  We also 
have the situation, and many members across the way are familiar 
with this, were we lose some of our brightest and best doctors to 
the United States.  We produce computer programmers at the 
University of Western Ontario and they are lured away to other 
countries, primarily the U.S., because of its lower income tax 
burden.  This is after we have paid for their education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not an academic debate.  The tax measures that the 
government has put in place over the period of many years has 
driven many Canadians out of the country.  It has driven many 
Canadians out of business.  The government has presided over 
record bankruptcies.  1995 had record bankruptcies.  That was not 
good enough.  Bankruptcies went up by another 20 percent in 1996 under 
this government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that in some part it is due to the fact that we 
have tremendously high taxes in this country.  It makes it very 
difficult for businesses to compete.  It is not only personal 
income tax.  We have all kinds of direct taxes, payroll taxes for 
instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when we have a surplus in the EI account of about $13 
billion, we have this government refusing to give Canadians tax 
relief.  These payroll taxes have a very serious effect on the 
ability of businesses to compete because they are not sensitive 
to whether or not a business is making a profit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If businesses are in a loss situation, they have to continue to 
make those payments on EI premiums, and at the same time the 
government is talking about raising CPP premiums by 73 percent.  We 
already have legislation introduced into the House that will make 
that a reality starting on January 1.  They will start to go up 
more and more and more.  Payroll taxes will claim more and more 
and more victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a horribly serious situation, but what did it merit in the 
throne speech?  But one mention, one mention, as though all of 
these problems do not exist in the country.  It is as though the 
government has stuck its head in the sand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members across the way know this and in a private moment I 
think would admit that Canadians out there really do want tax 
relief.  I do not hear a hue and cry across the country for more 
spending.  When I go to my riding, people do not say “Come on, 
let's spend more”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from Alberta.  In that province when people had a chance 
to have input into what they wanted to do with any surpluses, 
they said they wanted to pay down the debt. We have made 
tremendous progress in Alberta toward paying down the debt, but I 
think the key point is that the Government of Alberta recognizes 
that that money belongs to the Alberta taxpayer. Instead of 
arrogantly deciding that the government knew best how to spend 
that money, it consulted with the people to whom the money 
belonged.  I think that is a message that this government should 
learn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to touch on the issue of irresponsible spending.  Over 
the years, I do not know in how many auditor general's reports, 
how many reports from interested academics, how many reports from 
people who were watch dogs of the government on issues, how many 
times the whole issue of irresponsible spending has been brought 
up to the government.  Why is it that things never seem to 
improve? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general pointed out that the lack of inventory 
control at national defence cost the government $1.7 billion. Why 
do they repeatedly point out the terrible waste and even 
corruption that goes on in Indian affairs and nothing ever seems 
to change? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We point out some of the ridiculous grants that are given not 
only to special interest groups, arts funding and things that are 
beyond the pale, but also to business groups.  How many times do 
we have to have the chamber of commerce come before the finance 
committee and say  “We do not want grants for business any 
more”.  Here is the voice of business saying “We do not want 
grants for business”, but what does the government do? It 
ignores them and says “We are going to continue to take money 
from profitable businesses in the form of taxes and give it to 
unprofitable businesses so they can then turn around and compete 
against those self-same profitable businesses”.  That is 
ridiculous. It makes no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see this government, for reasons that I will never 
comprehend, continuing to do this.  All the while it is 
undermining businesses that are trying to create jobs in this 
country.  If there is one thing on which I think all parties 
agree, it is that we want to have more jobs in this country.  So 
let us recognize what the government is doing here. It is putting 
short term political considerations ahead of what is right for 
the country and that should not be tolerated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that the government has done a very poor job in 
terms of getting its spending priorities in place.  Let me touch 
on that a little bit more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk to people around the country, and I am talking of 
all members in the House, I think that there is probably a 
consensus that the federal government should direct its spending 
toward issues that are important to Canadians, issues like health 
care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the government's record is on health care. 
The government has cut spending by $6.8 billion, reduced the 
transfers by 35 percent.  But at the same time—and this speaks to its 
priorities—the government has cut departmental spending 
marginally. That is despite what the finance minister himself 
said on a number of occasions. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1035"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact we have a quote in our document “Beyond a Balanced 
Budget” from a speech the finance minister gave to a Federal 
Reserve board meeting in Kansas City, United States in 1995.  He 
said “We will cut our own departmental spending a lot more than 
we will cut the transfers to the provinces”. Sadly that has not 
been borne out in what the government has done.  We argue it is 
time for the government to match its own words with its deeds. We 
argue very vigorously that that simply has not happened, and 
government members are not paying attention to the priorities of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party wants to change that.  We want to gather input 
from Canadians and that is what we intend on doing.  We have sent 
out our “Beyond a Balanced Budget” document to hundreds of 
people around the country.  We have posted it on the Internet. We 
are going to be talking to thousands and thousands of people over 
the next several months to gather their input.  We are going to 
do the government's job for the government members because for 
reasons that I do not understand they think they have all the 
answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe this money belongs to the Canadian taxpayers and we 
are going to acknowledge that by going and talking to them.  We 
argue that the real answer to creating jobs is not in subsidies 
and is not even necessarily training. We argue that it is demand. 
We believe that we need to start to lower taxes, we need to 
start to pay down debt so that we can get the economy going, so 
that we can start to create jobs that Canadians in all parts of 
the country need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I will simply say that we cannot solve the 
problems of the 1990s with the solutions of the 1970s.  I just 
want to urge the government to pay attention to that simple 
message and to start to hear what Canadians are saying and 
acknowledge that perhaps the government does not have all the 
answers and that it is time to hear some of the answers that come 
forth from the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before we get into 
questions and comments hon. members, I would ask that the 
questions and the responses be kept relatively brief.  This will 
allow us to have more debate and more interchange. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is amazing how we get this warm fuzzy feeling when we 
hear the Reform members talk about their plan for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear the name Peggy Witte of Royal Oak Mines in Yellowknife 
and here he is using her as an example of a proud business person 
in Canada.  Must I remind him that she and she alone was the one 
who caused the great mine strike and eventually the death of 
those nine miners who were in there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was her labour actions and it was her attitude toward the 
workforce, those workers in Yellowknife, that caused all this. 
What she wants—and this is for the member of the Reform Party to 
understand—is for workers to work as low as possible with fewer 
health standards and lower working standards than anywhere else 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is amazing to hear him talk of the Reform Party and taxation. 
Every time I go by a Bingo hall in my riding I think of Preston 
Manning and the Stornoway club.  If he wants to set an example, 
he should lead by example. The leader of the Reform Party was the 
one who indicated that if he moved into Stornoway he would put a 
Bingo sign on it. He would put a for sale sign on the car and 
would refuse the $49,000 stipend that he receives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does he do?  Not more than two days afterward, he said he 
consulted with the members and Canadians.  He never consulted 
with us.  He should be leading by example if they want to stand 
up here and talk about taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well he said the government should not assist small business 
in any way.  How does he expect a company in the northern 
outreaches of Newfoundland or in the outskirts of Nova Scotia to 
compete with those companies in central Canada when their markets 
are so far away? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the hon. gentleman from the Reform Party is what 
is he going to do to help us in Atlantic Canada because of the 
fact that Atlantic Canadians did not even allow them in the door 
during this election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think most of that 
tirade scarcely merits an answer.  I am going to assume that the 
member did not really mean to say that the president of Royal Oak 
Mines actually caused the death of those miners.  We will give 
him the benefit of the doubt.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say to my hon. friend that rather obviously he has not 
paid very close attention to what happened in the last election 
campaign.  Not only did the Reform Party dramatically increase 
its support, but I would also point out that the whole issue of 
taxation and cutting taxes resonated from Canadians coast to 
coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the Reform Party plan would put a billion dollars back 
into the pockets of Atlantic Canadians through tax relief.  We 
argue that is a new solution that has been untried. I would also 
argue that if subsidies and grants work so extraordinarily well, 
then why is it that we have staggeringly high unemployment levels 
in Atlantic Canada?  We have been doing this since the 1970s when 
we started to change UI benefits to make them regionally 
sensitive. What has happened since then?  We have seen 
unemployment ratchet up and up and up and up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When is the hon. member and his party going to learn from the 
mistakes of the past?  How many people have to be unemployed and 
living in poverty before the hon. member and his party get it? Do 
they not understand that the solutions of the 1970s are not going 
to fix the problems of the 1990s?  When is he going to get it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The Chair would 
gently remind hon. members to address other hon. members through 
the Chair. Before the next member commences, I would remind hon. 
members that they must be at their seats to be recognized by the 
Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would just like to ask 
the member this one question again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is he saying that the film industry of Nova Scotia should not 
get any assistance?  Is he saying that 40,000 seasonal workers in 
Atlantic Canada should not get any assistance?  Is he encouraging 
them all to move to Alberta?  That is not the agenda of Atlantic 
Canadians, sir. They would like to live and work in their own 
communities and they would like to work with governments at all 
levels to assist them and their families to stay where they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>   Mr. Speaker, of course the Reform 
Party believes that we need to do whatever we can to help 
citizens across the country. That is why we believe very strongly 
in a program to start to improve the infrastructure in Atlantic 
Canada so that we can renew some of the traditional trade ties 
that Atlantic Canada had when it came into Confederation which at 
that point made it the strongest part of the country. In fact 
back when there were a strong set of trade ties with New England 
when most of Atlantic Canada came into Confederation, it was by 
far the wealthiest part of the country.  It did extraordinarily 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to go back to that and renew infrastructure to make it 
happen.  In some cases it means providing some training for 
people.  In other cases it may mean that we will have to lower 
taxes.  We need to do the sorts of things to make Atlantic Canada 
competitive in a modern day environment and in an environment of 
globalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think we can continue to rely on the solutions of the 
past.  I hope that the member will come around to that way of 
thinking. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Reform Party member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe what is happening is that some people do not understand 
what is going on in Atlantic Canada. The federal government even has 
trouble recognizing that the Atlantic fisheries are in crisis. How many 
times did we hear people say that Atlantic Canadians are lazy and do not 
want to work? Even the Prime Minister said he was going to get them out 
of their house and prevent them from going to the pub. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This image of the Atlantic provinces is totally unacceptable. It is 
not the fault of Atlantic Canadians if the fisheries are in a state of 
crisis. 
It is not their fault if a moratorium was declared on cod. It is not 
their fault if quotas for crab fell from 20,000 to 12,000 metric tons. 
It is not their fault if lobster catches are down. It is not their fault 
if herring quotas are down. 
It is nature's fault. It is because of what is happening in our region.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that, at one time, our region of New Brunswick was a 
nice, prosperous place, where people could find work. Then, as a result 
of Confederation and other changes, everything went to central and 
western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell you one thing: if we want a united Canada, if we want 
to remain a united country, westerners will have to support easterners. 
If westerners support easterners, understand them and help them set up 
companies and get into secondary processing in the fishery and forestry 
sectors, if they allocate money for mining, then Atlantic Canadians will 
have work and will not have to move out west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, is the Reform Party member saying that the government should 
prevent Atlantic Canadians from getting employment insurance and let 
them starve? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I take issue with one of 
the premises raised by the member, that it is nature's fault the 
fish are gone.  It is the federal government's fault to a large 
degree because it is the one that encouraged people to keep 
fishing when everyone knew fish stocks were dwindling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Central Canada was largely strengthened when tariff barriers 
went up and the regions paid a huge price.  That was the fault of 
the government of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The things that are working well now in Atlantic Canada come 
from the private sector.  The private sector is creating a 
tremendous amount of jobs at Voisey's Bay.  That should be the 
model.  There is not a nickel deposit every few miles but we have 
to understand that is where the solutions are for Atlantic 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In some cases people do become dependent on unemployment 
insurance.  To ignore that or to say it is not true is to put 
one's head in the sand.  Two successive premiers of Newfoundland 
have said that people become dependent on unemployment insurance. 
We must start to be aware of that in the types of programs we 
design.  That is what the government needs to start doing and 
that is certainly what the Reform Party would do. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial 
Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a great pleasure for me to 
address the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning this motion by the official opposition, it strikes 
me as a little bit hypocritical. We are being accused of not having 
consulted Canadians adequately before announcing our program to 
share the expenditures for programs, tax cuts and debt reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, the hon. member for Medicine Hat tells us 
that they plan to cut taxes. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They say we have not consulted, but without consulting they have 
presented tax cuts which they feel are so important.  They have 
called for monstrous tax cuts in personal income tax, in business 
income tax, and in terms of getting rid of the increase in Canada 
pension plan premiums.  They cannot have it both ways.  Either 
they are to go out and consult in some undefined process which 
they have not outlined before us, or they are to allow us to set 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No party in the history of Canada has consulted more extensively 
with Canadians.  Perhaps the greatest process of consultation in 
a democratic nation is putting a platform before the electorate. 
This is exactly what we did before the last election when 
Canadians spoke strongly and decisively.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the Reform Party wants some type of electoral reform so 
that election results do not really count, so that the expressed 
will of Canadians during a federal election is not what really 
matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only did we go through a federal election where this was a 
key part of our platform, but it is this House that opened up the 
budget making process.  It will begin this fall with an economic 
statement by the Minister of Finance laying out where we are and 
some of the available options.  It will then be a task of the 
finance committee, of which the member for Medicine Hat was a 
very distinguished member and will be again I trust.  The 
committee will go right across the country and will consult with 
Canadians from every sector and every walk of life on their 
budget priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This process of consultation could not be one of which I am more 
proud because it is open.  It has taken the budget making process 
out of the back rooms and into the public fora and into 
Parliament and has put it into the hands of members of 
Parliament.  Surely he does not condemn that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has set forth his priorities without consultation as 
he seems to say we have done.  He wants to get rid of business 
subsidies.  No program has been cut more than our subsidies to 
business.  It was because— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Bombardier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B>  Bombardier.  The fund to help Canada's 
aerospace industry to continue its ascent into the top ranks 
among nations in the world is not a giveaway program.  It is 
refundable and repayable to the federal government.  This was a 
result of consultations which our federal finance committee 
undertook and suggested and the Minister of Industry adapted.  I 
am very proud of this program.  It means the success of our 
aerospace industry goes back to the credit of Canadian taxpayers 
through repayments to the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member saying that he is against what we have done to 
protect and secure a dignified and secure retirement for seniors 
through our agreement with the provinces on the Canada pension 
plan? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He wants to renounce a deal made with the provinces including 
the province of Alberta, fine.  He can go on record and say that 
he would renounce that deal.  That is not the way we operate 
because we are prepared to operate in consultation and 
co-operation with our provincial counterparts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member prepared to renounce the type of co-operative 
arrangement we have worked out with the provinces in terms of the 
Canada child tax benefit where the federal government and the 
provinces will concentrate on children who are members of working 
families in the poorest income bracket?  Is this what the member 
is talking about? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe this is a priority.  These children living in the 
lowest income brackets need assistance.  We are directing it to 
them in co-operation with the provinces to break down the welfare 
wall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member condemn our efforts and our tax cuts to help 
students by making more of their fees deductible and by giving 
greater tax breaks to parents who invest in registered 
educational savings plans?  Does he condemn the fact that we want 
to provide scholarships to help make post-secondary education 
accessible to more and more Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of our expenditure announcements in the throne speech which 
he condemns and which I am happy to stand beside is funding the 
Canada Council, giving it more funds to provide for arts and 
culture.  I am very proud of our commitment to enhance Canada 
Council funding.  I stand by it completely as do all members on 
this side of the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he condemn our program to help provide entry level jobs for 
young Canadians through our public sector internship program?  We 
are giving work experience to young Canadians who might not 
otherwise have access to the workforce.  It is a very valuable 
entry into the workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the priorities we have set out.  They have 
been the subject of consultation through the election.  They will 
be the subject of ongoing consultation through debates in the 
House and through the finance committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have talked about what we have done for young Canadians, what 
we are doing for our seniors, and what we are doing for health 
care in terms of increasing our funding by over $6 billion in 
five years to the provinces to help sustain the principles of the 
Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he condemn what we have done in terms of innovation?  We 
have given tax breaks for research and development in Canada.  We 
created the innovation foundation to help restore the research 
infrastructure of our hospitals and our universities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he condemn SchoolNet?  We have helped classrooms to connect 
with all libraries and with everyone throughout the country. 
Canada will be the most connected nation in the world.  It will 
have access to expertise and knowledge throughout the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to talk about our priorities for students, for young 
Canadians whose parents are among the working poor and who need a 
break.  I am happy to talk about our steadfast protection of the 
Canada Health Act in the face of threats by the Reform Party in 
the last parliament which said we needed a two tier medical 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not give in to their priorities.  We will continue to be 
a most open government that consults with Canadians when setting 
our priorities.  We will work to address the true needs of future 
Canadians.  That does not rule out tax cuts.  That does not rule 
out paying down the debt.  These are priorities we have stated 
clearly and strongly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech said that we would continue to be the 
government of fiscal responsibility.  We are the government that 
brought the deficit down from $42 billion ahead of the schedule 
fixed by the Reform Party which called for a balanced budget by 
the year 2000.  We will achieve that long before its target. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not take a lesson in fiscal responsibility from anyone, 
including the official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I did not quite catch 
what the member said.  Did he say consult Canadians or insult 
Canadians?  I cannot remember. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member raised a lot of different issues.  It will be 
difficult to touch on them all.  I will try to be brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think everyone would agree the member is very naive if he is 
suggesting that Canadians voted with one voice on the 
government's fiscal platform in the last election campaign. 
Surely he acknowledges that people voted on many issues including 
primarily, I would argue, national unity.  That was a huge issue 
in the election campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's majority was diminished.  What does that say of 
the support it has for its programs?  It has the barest of 
majorities right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of simply having an election on their economic approach, 
many provinces such as Alberta have consulted their citizens 
directly.  It is time to go to the people on a fundamental 
decision such as that and ask them directly.  We should not be 
doing it by a committee that travels around once in a while to 
ask people what should be in this year's budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The optimal size of government, the optimal level of taxes and 
the optimal level of debt are extraordinarily important issues. I 
am going to ignore most of the rhetoric from my hon. friend and 
make that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would conclude by asking— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Willowdale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I welcome the member's

</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the optimal size of debt and what is the optimal level 
of taxes?  You have obviously prejudged it.  You have called for 
major cuts in payroll taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> The hon. member is a 
practised and experienced parliamentarian and certainly does not 
mean to leave the Chair out of the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, you are quite right. I 
thank you for first of all for reminding me and second, for your 
excellent presiding over this Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Medicine Hat is quite at liberty to suggest 
that debate is needed on what is the optimal size of government 
debt.  We are looking forward to hearing his contribution to this 
very important debate.  We know that, with a federal debt of $600 
billion which is 74% of Canada's entire yearly economic output, 
we are way beyond where we should be.  One-third of every tax 
dollar has to go to pay the interest on the debt.  That is money 
that cannot be spent on tax relief, on debt reduction or new 
spending programs to help Canadians.  This is why—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to ask my honourable Liberal colleague, who is also 
the minister responsible for financial institutions and who had a 
tear in his eye just now for the poor and the sick, which of these 
is the right answer: by the end of its mandate, the Liberal 
government will have cut either $42 billion from social programs, 
or $42 billion from social programs, or $42 billion from social 
programs? Which of these three is the right answer? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson:</B> Mr. Speaker, we had to cut spending. In 
1993-94, our program expenditures amounted to $120 billion. In 
subsequent years, these fell by 13 percent to $105 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While cutting spending, we kept the cuts in transfers to the 
provinces to a minimum. They were in the order of 8 percent and we 
retained equalization, which was really necessary for our vision of 
the future of Canada, a Canada in which we can share problems and 
opportunities with Canadians regardless of what part of the country 
they live in. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak to the motion introduced this morning by the 
Reform Party, for reasons that have to do with what we have just 
heard from the other side of the House, namely that the government 
acted to improve public finances, with all sorts of figures being 
bandied about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell you that this government has fed us nothing but 
twisted information since the start of its first mandate.  They 
have misled us about the actual state of public finances and the 
route it took to reach a zero deficit, a surplus even, this year, 
if we are to believe the results of the past three months 
announcing unprecedented budget surpluses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will support the motion of the Reform Party, not because we 
share their philosophy or their approach to improving public 
finances, but because this motion calls for a debate on the problem 
as a whole.  A public debate is now very important because, for the 
past four years, they have been feeding us a line.  We have been 
told that the deficit will exceed $17 billion, $24 billion, and so 
on, when they know very well on the other side of the House with 
their panoply of specialists and their good judgment, if they have 
any, that the budget and deficit figures are very different from 
what is being touted.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last February, you may recall, the Bloc Quebecois made public a 
document analyzing the government's budgetary situation, as well as the 
deficit.  Starting in February, we were forecasting that the deficit for 
the year ending March 31, 1997 would not exceed $10 billion and that, by 
1997-98, the deficit would be zero.  What did the Minister of Finance 
tell us back then?  He said that we were talking nonsense, that we did 
not know how to count, that what we thought did not matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result was that, as of last March—the figures will soon be 
out—the federal government's deficit will not exceed $10 billion, and 
next year it will drop to zero. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what did the Minister of Finance do?  He fed us a line.  Why? 
Because he did not want the public to know that the federal government's 
finances were in better shape than he was letting on, and this was how 
he justified cutting assistance to the most disadvantaged, to the 
elderly, the ill, students and those on welfare.  This is why a public 
debate is so important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second reason a public debate is necessary is because we are 
not in agreement with the way in which the federal government went about 
getting its fiscal house in order.  For four years now, the Bloc 
Quebecois has been showing that there are other ways to arrive at the 
same result, a zero deficit, balanced budgets, without making the most 
disadvantaged members of society suffer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There needs to be debate.  If the government is to continue its 
efforts to put its fiscal house in order, and we agree it should, there 
has to be debate, since the past four years have shown us only too 
clearly how completely lacking in compassion this government is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has gone about reducing the deficit in four ways.  First of all, 
each year the Minister of Finance has brought in a budget cutting 
funding for provincially run social programs by $4.5 billion, including 
a $1.3 billion annual reduction in funding to the Government of Quebec 
for social assistance, postsecondary education and health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers must realize that 93 cents out of every dollar cut in health 
care in Quebec results from cuts made by the federal government, not by 
the Quebec government; that is right, 93 cents out of every dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, this government has used taxation in an utterly unfair 
fashion. After solemnly saying income tax had to be reduced, they turned 
around and increased taxes four years in a row. By not indexing tax 
tables among other things, they took $23 billion out of taxpayers' 
pockets, while talking about reducing taxes. With this $23 billion, the 
federal government is making taxpayers pay for its deficit reduction 
efforts in a sneaky, underhand, roundabout way. That is why there should 
be a public debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another important source of income. The Minister of 
Finance has dipped into the unemployment insurance fund surplus. 
Here again there should be a debate because the federal government has 
not been putting a cent into this fund for years, yet merrily helps 
itself to premiums paid by employers and employees, hence the need for 
a real public debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other ways to continue putting our fiscal house in order. 
At the moment, it is going so well in terms of objectives being met and 
deficit reduction targets surpassed that, if it really wants to fight 
poverty and underemployment, the federal government should meet our 
demands. It should give back what it has stolen from the provinces. It 
should immediately stop implementing its planned budget cuts, as set out 
in the 1996 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should give back to the provinces the $4.5 billion it has taken 
from them every year. That is the first thing it ought to do. Second, it 
must stop using the unemployment insurance fund surplus. 
It is important. UI premiums are job killers. Any payroll tax is a job 
killer. If the Minister of Finance is really committed to job creation, 
he must heed another suggestion made by the Bloc Quebecois and lower the 
rates of contribution to the unemployment insurance fund by 35 cents on every 
$100 of insurable earnings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another 35 cents should be used to pay back the benefits stolen from the 
unemployed, last January, through the employment insurance reform.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he really cares about fighting child poverty, he should increase 
the child tax credit from $850 million to $2 billion, as suggested by 
the Bloc Quebecois, that is if he cares about it, but he does not seem 
to. There does not seem to be any government member across the way who 
cares. What they care about is the Canadian flag, federalist propaganda. 
To these people, that is more important than making sure children eat 
every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the federal government should pay up the $2 billion owed to 
Quebec for harmonizing the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surpluses will still be generated by the end of next year, since 
the forecast is better than anticipated as far as reducing the deficit 
and running budget surpluses is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other ways to put our fiscal house in order. We are among 
those who want the effort to be pursued. Last year, we suggested three 
possible approaches. As you may recall, we released two papers: one on 
corporate tax reform and the other on personal income tax reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it took its responsibilities seriously, the federal government 
might reform personal income tax to make it more equitable. There are 
individuals who pay very high taxes, while other do not pay any because 
of all the loopholes in our tax system, which has not undergone a 
complete overhaul in 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same thing with corporate tax. The government should stop 
favouring millionaires and billionaires, and turn instead to small and 
medium businesses, which are the ones creating jobs. That is the road 
proposed by the Bloc Quebecois to continue putting our fiscal house in 
order as well as to help create jobs through targeted reductions in 
corporate tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Minister of Finance agreed to hold a real debate on the way 
ahead, looking at future means of putting our fiscal house in order and 
the ruthless ones he has taken these past four years and plans to keep 
using during this mandate, I think that would take care of a real 
concern people have: they want to be told the truth, where we are headed 
and who will pay. 
<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, if I may, I 
would like to congratulate my colleague on his speech.  It was far 
more detailed and more balanced than the one we heard a few minutes 
ago from the representative of the Reform Party, which expressed 
almost universal radicalism. In fact, they engage in radicalism on 
the constitutional level, by attempting to provoke all regions of 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel obliged to remind them that all of us here are 
representatives of different regions of the country, co-owners of 
all that we have. With all that we have at stake, we are going to 
proceed cautiously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is exactly the same thing on the economic level, totally 
unacceptable radicalism.  There is absolutely no compassion for the 
most disadvantaged. Our colleague has just referred to the great 
difficulties now faced by the near-majority of Canadian families, 
whose children go to school without breakfast. 
My colleague is absolutely right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things the present government voted against was 
adoption of the GST legislation.  The ultimate purpose of the 
GST—and I take advantage of the occasion to ask the question of 
my colleague—was to arrive at an effective fiscal reform as far 
as income and other taxes are concerned.  Such was the purpose of 
the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is right as well in his reference to the ruse of this 
government in using the battle against the deficit to its 
advantage, when we know very well it was the result of free trade 
and the revenues from the GST.  As well, they are forgetting that, 
over the same ten year period, 1974 to 1984, they increased the 
national debt tenfold, while we doubled it during our time in 
office, because our structural measures such as free trade and the 
GST had not yet been adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am therefore pleased to congratulate my colleague and I 
would like to hear what he has to say on these questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Chicoutimi for praising the Bloc Quebecois. It is not often that we get 
praise from Conservative members and political opponents, so I am 
accepting it on behalf of my party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague was right when he spoke about improving the 
effectiveness of our tax system. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1115"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, if the Conservative Party deserves praise—but let us 
not forget that criticism may follow quickly—it is for implementing 
at least a major part of the tax reform, as the member pointed out, by 
introducing the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, and this is another point raised by the hon. member, 
those provinces interested in implementing the GST were told to 
harmonize their provincial sales tax at their own expense, but that they 
would benefit from a much greater efficiency in the five or ten years 
that would follow, thanks to a more modern and fairer tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, the Quebec government, which was the only one to 
harmonize its tax with the federal GST, was not told that, a few years 
later, the federal government would give $1 billion to the maritime 
provinces to harmonize their provincial sales tax with the GST. It is 
totally unfair to treat Quebec like this and the federal government owes 
us $2 billion. The hon. member was absolutely right when he raised this 
issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I want to 
congratulate my dear friend and colleague from Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot on 
his election. Three days before the federal election, we had a lively 
debate, and I feel I am once again at the Taverne Magnan. Those who are 
from Quebec will know that, in Montreal, the Taverne Magnan is almost 
like the agora, except that alcoholic beverages are served. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever someone speaks on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, it feels 
like I am listening over and over to the same cassette. The only thing 
different is the name of the person speaking. Otherwise, it is always 
the same baloney. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am impressed to see that many outraged members across the floor. 
We hear them whine, if I can put it that way, and it is terrible to see 
them continually say the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we took over, our country was going bankrupt. 
We inherited a deficit from the Conservatives. But we made the right 
decisions and now the deficit has almost been eliminated. The member 
spoke about health programs. We are giving $1.5 billion back to the 
provinces for these programs. By harmonizing its sales tax with the GST, 
Quebec made money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the member for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot make such statements 
when he knows full well that the facts do not match the content of his 
cassette and cliches? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, on the subject of cassettes, I 
wouldn't go on about that too much, because they have one that is 
pretty long and rather out of date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in Quebec are not the only ones who think that the federal 
government stole $2 billion from us.  The Canadian premiers 
unanimously supported Quebec's request at St. Andrews, because they 
considered it unfair to Quebec that it got no similar compensation 
when $1 billion was given to the maritimes to harmonize the GST 
with the provincial sales taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my colleague from Bourassa were more concerned about the 
interests of Quebec, he would encourage the Minister of Finance to 
give Quebec its due and would stop saying just any old thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I recall correctly, I was reprimanded last week for having 
used the word “steal”.  Earlier, my colleague in the Bloc Quebecois 
used the word twice.  He has just used it a third or fourth time. 
I therefore ask, Mr. Speaker, whether there are two sets of rules 
in the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  With the greatest 
respect, hon. members, it is not just the word, it is the context 
of the word and whether the word is directed to an individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Resuming debate, the hon. member for Qu'Appelle.

<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
great honour to once again rise in this House and say a few 
words.  I was not here for the last four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to first thank the voters of Qu'Appelle for electing me 
as their member of Parliament.  Despite the fact that I was an MP 
for 25 years for Yorkton—Melville, this is the first chance I 
have had to represent my hometown of Wynyard in the House of 
Commons.  I am really pleased to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to take a half a moment to pay tribute to my two 
predecessors in what is now the Qu'Appelle riding.  Simon de Jong 
was a member of Parliament from 1979 to 1997 in the old riding of 
Regina—Qu'Appelle, and Vic Althouse was the member of Parliament 
from 1980 to 1997 in the old riding of Mackenzie.  They both 
served their constituents and their country well and I think 
deserve the applause and the commendation of all members of 
Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In rising to say a few words in this debate today, I would first 
like to agree with the Reform Party that we obviously do need a 
public debate on the direction this country should go in terms of 
its public finances and spending.  However, I disagree profoundly 
with the emphasis it places on where we should go.  It condemns 
the 27 years of spending by the federal government in the past. 
It condemns the size of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party, and this is why I will not support the motion, 
is really a throwback to the past.  Its members are the Fred 
Flintstones of Canadian politics.  It is a party that is 
basically anti-government.  It is a party that does not really 
believe that the government's role in this country is to help 
create the equality of conditions for our citizens.  It wants to 
go back to the past.  It is a very right wing conservative party. 
For that reason we cannot support this motion before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is spreading all kinds of myths, for example 
that government programs are the cause of large deficits in this 
country.  It is spreading some mistruths in this country, that 
social programs are a big problem in terms of deficit and debt 
and unemployment.  These things just are not true.  It is about 
time the Reform Party was taken on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in 1992 Statistics Canada issued a report which stated that 
the debt in this country, some 50 percent, was created by high interest 
rates; 44 percent of the debt from tax breaks and only 6 percent by government 
programs.  Of that 6 percent only half of that is from social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet we have the Reform Party saying that the government has 
spent too much, there are too many social programs, we need to be 
cut back and that is the cause of high taxes and high 
unemployment.  That is not true.  Statistics Canada said that the 
biggest cause of debt in this country was high interest rates. 
Who brought in high interest rates?  Right wing conservatives 
like the Reform Party.  Its friends like Brian Mulroney brought 
in high interest rates in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw the exact same thing in Saskatchewan with Grant Devine 
and the Conservatives there.  Again, this is the right wing 
politics of the Reform Party.  That is the biggest cause in this 
country of the debt and deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other cause is tax breaks primarily to wealthy people and 
large corporations.  Again, those are the kinds of breaks that 
are defended by the Reform Party in Canada.  For those reasons we 
cannot support today's motion of non-confidence in the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need in this country are decent social programs and a 
tax system that is fair for each and every ordinary Canadian.  We 
do not need to go back to the past like the Reform Party that 
would have us privatize a lot of our social programs, have us set 
up two tier medical care in this country where we would have one 
system for the rich and one for the poor, where we only have tax 
breaks for the wealthy, where we get rid of the public pension 
plans like the Canada pension plan and turn everything into 
private pensions or RRSPs that favour wealthy people because they 
believe they can look after their own future better than anybody 
else.  That is back to the past, the Archie Bunkers of Canada. 
That is the direction we should not be going in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, let us take a look once again at the Reform 
Party.  Where does it want to do some cutbacks?  It wants to cut 
back, for example, corporate income tax.  It wants cutbacks in 
payroll taxes.  When we look at the different options we have, 
one thing we have to weigh when we do have government expenditure 
is how many jobs are created because we have a major unemployment 
problem all across Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have here some figures about the different options if we had a 
government expenditure of $1 billion.  First of all, the 
multiplier the formula applied here affects the expenditures in a 
different way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we spend $1 billion in direct hiring, it creates 56,000 jobs. 
Spending $1 billion on goods and services creates about 28,000 
jobs.  Spending $1 billion on infrastructure creates some 26,000 
jobs. That is one factor taken into consideration when we talk 
about how we spend government money in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most effective way to create jobs, if we want to cut taxes, 
is to start cutting back on the GST.  In the campaign of the New 
Democratic Party we advocated the elimination of the GST on books 
and magazines.  We advocated the elimination of the GST on 
children's clothing, which is exempt in most of the provinces now 
from provincial sales tax, certainly in my province of 
Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also advocated the increase in the GST tax credit for adults 
and children by 30 percent.  It would cost $1.2 billion for those three 
items and create 20,400 jobs in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, if we were to have a $1 billion cutback in 
the GST, we would create some 17,000 jobs. But if there were a $1 
billion cutback in corporate taxes, there would only be 14,000 
jobs created.  If there were a $1 billion cutback on personal 
income tax across the board, there would be 12,000 jobs created. 
If there was a $1 billion cutback in the payroll tax, there would 
be about 9,000 jobs created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have choices.  The question is where do we spend taxpayer 
money.  What are the programs that have the most impact and the 
most effect in terms of job creation in this country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think what we have to do in terms of expending money on behalf 
of the Canadian taxpayers is to invest more in health and in 
education, those areas that need more spending, bringing people 
up to a greater standard of equality of condition.  Those are 
also areas that would create jobs at the same time as investing 
money in education and health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to cut taxes, the place to start is with the 
GST.  I think that would help stimulate the economy more than 
cutting taxes in other areas, and the statistics tend to bear 
that out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a debate in this country over where we are going to go 
in terms of the direction of Canada. On one hand there is the 
Reform Party, basically anti-government and anti-public 
institution, a party that wants to privatize and deregulate and 
scale back and get rid of government in almost every respect and 
aspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what it stands for.  It is a stroll back to the past. 
It misleads the people of this country.  It propagates myths 
around Canada.  A big problem we have is government spending. 
Another problem we have is spending on social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics Canada showed us in 1992 that 6 percent of the debt is 
caused by government spending in Canada and only half of that is 
spending on social programs.  Fifty per cent of the debt is 
caused by the high interest rates that we saw during the Brian 
Mulroney years, another version of a very conservative party in 
Canada.  Another 44 percent of the debt is caused by tax expenditures, 
tax loopholes and tax giveaways to the large corporations that 
are the friends of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those reasons we cannot support this motion before the House 
today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK46"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
found the speech by the hon. member to have some very creative 
accounting.  It was quite interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If government spending created jobs, if it created all these 
wonderful jobs, the government has overspent $600 billion at the 
federal level in the past 25 to 30 years.  If we add the 
overspending of the provinces to that, in total it overspent 
maybe $1 trillion.  If throwing government money at problems 
could fix them, how come this $1 trillion that has been spent has 
not bought three jobs for everyone of us throughout the country? 
That is the first question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talks about the medical care system and 
how he would like to see jobs created in medical care. 
I would like to ask him whether he realizes that about $2 billion 
crosses the border into the United States every year with wealthy 
Canadians who buy medical services in the United States.  Would 
it not be a good idea since he supports jobs in the medical care 
system to try to bring that money back into Canada in some way, 
to provide an alternative choice for those people who are already 
spending $2 billion across the border? Let them spend it here and 
certainly put rules in place so that doctors cannot run into that 
special new program.  Let people spend it here so that new jobs 
will be created in the medical care system.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member would look at examples in other countries which 
have done this, such as Britain, Sweden and New Zealand, he would 
see that the medical services jobs almost doubled as a result of 
introducing such plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first I would like to say 
that I appreciate the frankness of the member of the Reform Party 
in advocating two tier medical care in the country.  I certainly 
do not support what he is saying. He is advocating one system of 
medical care for the rich and one for the rest of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe he does not know what ordinary people are like.  Come to 
my riding in the inner city of Regina.  How many of those people 
can afford a medical care system when they have to pay extra for 
it?  They are very poor people and are living hand to mouth. The 
Reform Party is advocating two tier medicare which we have fought 
against in this country for many, many years and which the NDP 
will continue to fight against. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of jobs, if the member of the Reform Party would unplug 
his ears and listen, he would find out that the greatest 
expenditure in the country has been on the interest on the 
national debt, approximately 35 cents out of every dollar. Another 
great expenditure in the country are the tax giveaways to 
multinational corporations, to the wealthy in Canada.  If the 
member wants to look at an example of fiscal responsibility, look 
at the Government of Saskatchewan with a balanced budget and the 
lowest unemployment anywhere in the country at 5.6 percent.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood—Assiniboine, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I welcome your appointment to the Chair.  I am sure you 
will do fine work on behalf of all of us in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the remarks of the hon. member for Qu'Appelle.  We all 
know that he is anything but a new member.  He spent about 25 
distinguished years in the House and I am delighted that the 
voters in Qu'Appelle have decided to send him back to the House. 
I think he has made an enormous contribution to the debate that 
is taking place.  I look forward to more interventions from him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that we have five official parties in the House, this 
Parliament will work better and all regions of Canada will be 
better represented in the 36th Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say that I too welcome the debate on what the government 
is going to do with greater revenues as a result of a growing 
economy.  I welcome the suggestions made by the member for 
Qu'Appelle.  However let me say that I think Canadians are a 
balanced people, are pragmatic and believe in balanced 
approaches.  This is the reason why the government and the 
Liberal Party said in the election campaign in May that we 
propose to spend half of any surplus or extra revenues on tax 
reduction and debt reduction and the other half on the 
development of social and economic programs.  I believe that is a 
balanced approach and something that Canadians support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear the member for Qu'Appelle comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I believe there should be 
a division between new programs, enhancing existing programs and 
tax cuts and paying down the national debt.  The debate will be 
what new programs we will look at and what enhanced spending 
there should be.  I believe it should be in the fields of health 
and education.  When we get the tax cuts the debate will be over 
where they should take place.  I believe we should start with the 
GST, reduce it. That is the fairest way to go about doing it. It 
is also the way to create jobs in this country. 
That is the real debate:  what kinds of tax cuts, what kinds of 
expenditures and what kinds of enhancement to existing programs.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, may 
I first thank the people of Madawaska—Restigouche who expressed 
their confidence in me on June 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its speech from the throne, the government repeated its 
promise to apply any budget surplus equally to new program spending 
and to reducing the debt and taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This promise left me very sceptical, naturally.  In the 
Atlantic region, we are used to fine promises from the Liberals. 
That is probably why so we elected so few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was all the more sceptical of the Reform Party's wanting to 
talk about financial management.  Until very recently, they were still 
loath to set specific figures and objectives for their financial 
management plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that, if this government can point to a balanced 
budget today, it is because it has made deep cuts to social programs and 
abandoned its responsibilities to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the government is peering into its crystal ball and talking 
about better days ahead.  This is small comfort to those who have paid 
the price for its lack of planning and vision over the past four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own riding, close to 50 percent of the population is unemployed or 
receiving income support.  The changes to employment insurance brought 
in by the Liberal government have had a devastating impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is so bad that it is a rare day in my riding office 
that I do not hear tales of despair from my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You may think I am trying to be melodramatic in this august place, 
but this is the sad reality our constituents live with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be the first to admit that there are no easy solutions, but 
I will also be the first to say that solutions there are.  They can work 
if the government takes the trouble to listen to people, to think, to 
give some thought to the long term, and to show some compassion, while 
behaving in a financially responsible manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not lose sight of the fact that the smaller deficit is 
largely the result of an increase in revenue, low interest rates and 
reduced payments to other levels of government.  During their first term 
of office, the Liberals preferred to shift the burden of the deficit to 
others, rather than cut back on their own spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has forgotten that it is the average Canadian who is 
footing the bill for its decision;  not the provincial, federal or 
municipal levels of government.  In Canada, there is only one taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And despite the recent propaganda about good financial management, 
Canadian workers and those on small incomes will always be stuck with 
the bill.  As proof, I point to <I>The Fiscal Monitor</I>, a Department of 
Finance publication.  In July, the minister was boasting about a $1.4 
billion surplus in May 1997.  This was due in part to an increase in 
employment insurance premium revenues (up $0.3 billion) attributable to 
the acceleration of monthly payments. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have often pleaded with the government to reduce employment 
insurance premiums.  To use what was once designed as an 
insurance to provide temporary income as a deficit cutting 
measure is unacceptable.  This government has no mandate to 
impose an outright payroll tax.  It is just plain wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have argued that reducing employment insurance premiums by 70 
cents 
per $100 of income would create hundreds of thousands of jobs. It 
would stimulate the economy and give Canadians the much needed 
tax relief they deserve.  But then again, why would the king of 
Bay Street listen to me, a young Conservative MP from rural New 
Brunswick? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance may not want to listen to me or my 
colleagues, but maybe he will listen to the Canadian Chamber of 
Commerce, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business and 
other organizations which agree that reducing employment 
insurance premiums by 60 cents for example would create 170,000 new 
jobs. 
Those are the kinds of measures Canadians need, not just empty 
words and promises.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this motion, the Reform Party wants to convince us that 
it has the monopoly on reason where proper financial management is 
concerned.  In fact, the exact opposite is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform motion clearly demonstrates their lack of concrete 
ideas on the question.  They are very much like the Liberals in 
this, full of vague promises and no set objectives.  Why does the 
Reform party want to waste its time debating something that is so 
simple?  Taxes are quite simply too high.  The problem must be 
addressed, now or never.  Why wait for the near, or more distant, 
future?  The Reform solution is to reduce taxes only when a budget 
surplus has been attained. 
That means that Canadians will notice no difference from the 
Liberals, where their pocket books are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party is the only party willing 
to act today.  We are the only ones who want to give Canadians a 
reduction in their tax burden starting right now.  The budget 
surplus we are about to have is built on the sacrifices of all 
Canadians, and they all deserve to reap the consequences. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though we speak of tax cuts for Canadians, our approach to 
managing the fiscal dividend is responsible.  The leader of our 
party, the hon. member for Sherbrooke, has warned that the tax 
and cut government of the Liberals' first term has been replaced 
by the tax and spend government in the second. Unfortunately I 
think he may be right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are pleased there is a balanced budget on the horizon but the 
Liberals must be held accountable.  This short term performance 
is not a permit to open the floodgates of government spending. If 
this government truly believes in its performance, it will have 
no problem committing publicly to it.  Specific benchmarks must 
be established now. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that, first of all, we must have legislation 
calling for a balanced budget; second, objectives must be set for 
reducing the debt, based on a specific debt to GDP ratio; and 
third, there must be specific stipulation of the amount to be put 
into reducing the debt.  Employment insurance premiums are far too 
high and constitute a direct tax on jobs.  The government must, 
with no further ado, reduce employment insurance to $2.20 per $100 
of insurable earnings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are some concrete proposals aimed at putting more money 
back into Canadians' pockets and at putting this country's affairs 
in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am setting the Liberal government the challenge to listen to 
reason and to implement our proposals, for the sake of our 
country's future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, just a couple of comments on members who have already 
spoken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Willowdale who spoke on behalf of the 
Liberal Party stated that one of the things he was proud of was 
Canada Council grants provided by the Liberal government. I would 
have liked to have asked him had the opportunity existed, and 
perhaps the hon. member who just spoke can comment on it, if he 
is really proud of the latest expenditure by the Canada Council. 
It is a $42,000 study, $42,000 of Canadian taxpayers' money being 
used to study the social origins of medieval Latin lyrical song. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also would have liked to have asked the hon. member for 
Qu'Appelle when he speaks so eloquently of how proud he is of the 
Saskatchewan government with regard to all the things it does in 
particular with medicare, whether or not he is proud that it had 
to shut 50 hospitals and whether or not the $2 billion that is 
spent across the line might be better spent trying to keep some 
of those open. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I would like to ask this of the hon. member who just 
spoke.  We know from past experience that the Conservative 
government tried to balance the budget and in fact started to 
bring the deficit down and suddenly it turned around and became 
one of the biggest deficits we ever had.  Does the hon. member 
have any special points that he might like to offer to the 
Liberals so that they do not end up doing the same thing? They 
have followed them so many other times in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first of all our party has 
priorities.  Our priority is to create jobs. 
We will continue to do so and we will tell the House how we will 
do it.  I cannot comment because it is not a priority for our 
party and I do not think it is a priority for the House.

I listened with considerable interest to the new member for 
Madawaska—Restigouche who, I might say, speaks an exemplary 
French. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in his speech, he mentioned our government's 
accumulated deficits, and I would like to give him a little 
background quickly.  Prior to 1970, the federal government had 
little deficit but, year in year out, the deficit accumulated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the arrival of the philosopher Pierre Elliott Trudeau at 
the helm of the government, the deficit began to grow. 
However, on his arrival, Brian, the hon. member's spiritual leader, 
whom he obviously dare not name, threw himself into lavish spending 
so that, in its final year in government, the Conservative Party 
had a deficit of $44 billion and an accumulated debt of $600 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously shameful.  However, the word also applies to the 
party currently forming the government if not more than to the 
preceding government, when it draws an annual surplus of between $6 
billion and $9 billion out of the pockets of the impoverished 
workers by unduly increasing the employment insurance premium, 
while cutting benefits, shortening the period of eligibility for 
employment insurance and tightening the requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this point, I support my colleague from 
Madawaska—Restigouche, but when he talks about the spending of 
the current federal government, I suggest he look in his own back 
yard to see what the Conservative Party did during its nine years 
in government.  It spent extravagantly too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé: </B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague very much 
concerning my ability to speak French. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague talks a lot about the deficit. Yes, I did look in my 
own back yard, and in fact we are now reaping what we had sown by the 
previous Conservative government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party inherited a debt of more than $200 billion 
with an interest rate of more than 21 percent. We implemented free trade. Our 
friends opposite voted against the GST. We implemented it. They were 
supposed to scrap it. They did not scrap it, it is still there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our measures that put the country back on track. I can tell 
you, I guarantee it. It is certainly not what the Liberals did, because 
they did not do anything concrete, absolutely nothing at all. 
We will be able to say thanks to the previous Conservative government, 
I guarantee it.

will be splitting my time with the member for

</I></B></P><P align=left>It gives me great pleasure to speak to the motion of the member 
for Medicine Hat which bears repeating: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the government for making their 50/50 
election promise on any future surpluses without adequate public 
debate as to the optimal size of government, taxes, and debt, 
thus threatening to repeat Canada's 27 year old history of 
irresponsible spending, creating high debt, financed by high 
taxes, causing high unemployment. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an important motion because it goes to the heart of what 
caused our debt in the first place.  It is not surprising to hear 
the NDP say that it is opposed to our motion today, considering 
that it was part of the coalition that started this whole spiral 
back in the late sixties to begin with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The country needs a good debate about what should be the size of 
the federal government.  It is all about priorities. 
How big of a government do we really want?  Are we willing to pay 
the taxes it takes to run a government of that size?  Can we not, 
with a smaller government and lower taxes, create a far greater 
prosperity for our citizens?  This is the debate the country 
needs.  It is the debate that is currently taking place in 
Alberta which has two surplus budgets.

that they have put their faith in me.  I would also like to

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am especially pleased to have been reappointed international 
trade critic because it is critical to Canada.  It is also 
critical to my riding of Peace River and its economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our export industries are oil, natural gas, agriculture and 
forestry.  Nationally one out of every three jobs is related to 
exports.  In my riding almost everything we produce in a basic 
industry line is exported and is vitally important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I am always concerned about giving our Canadian 
businesses the best opportunities to take part in the global 
economy.  Trade and investment deals open a lot of doors, but 
what happens if our companies cannot take advantage of these 
deals and conditions at home do not allow them to survive and 
grow?  I am keenly aware that trade starts at home with sound 
domestic policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member for York West on becoming the Minister 
of International Trade.  His ministry has an important role to 
play in securing Canada's place as we move into the 21st century. 
His job will not always be easy as there will be voices trying to 
hold Canada back.  These voices will urge him to protect our 
industries from the cut and thrust of foreign competition.  At 
the same time his department will urge him to resist these pleas 
for protectionism.  I wish him vision and resolve to stay the 
course of trade liberalization which has meant so much to Canada 
in the last 10 years.  I want to serve notice that I will be 
watching. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard the Speech from the Throne on last Tuesday.  It touched 
briefly on the importance of trade to the Canadian economy.  One 
in every three Canadian jobs now depends on trade.  These jobs 
were not created as a result of team Canada trade missions.  I 
admit that many business people make important contacts on these 
trade missions.  I would even admit that there are some countries 
where high level government presence is critical.  However, these 
multimillion dollar trade deals do not happen just because the 
prime minister touched down in a jet with his entourage in tow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the contrary, while it opened some initial doors, it is 
interesting to find that our trade, especially our exports to 
countries like China, Hong Kong, India, Pakistan, Chile, 
Argentina and Uruguay just to mention a few, went down in 
subsequent years after the initial trade missions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot of bragging on the other side about the 
importance of the prime minister opening these doors.  I suggest 
he has to do some work at home to look after some problems that 
restrict the ability of Canadian businesses to take advantage of 
the trade deals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of these stunning failures I wonder whether the 
government will continue pinning all its trade hopes on a five 
day dog and pony show. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all the government's talk of trade successes it just so 
happens that most Canadian companies do not export.  In fact 80 percent 
of our trade is done by 100 companies.  Literally thousands of 
companies have never sent a representative outside our borders or 
even sold a single widget or service to a customer in a province 
west or east of them.  Is this because they lack the imagination 
or lack the courage to leave their own backyard?  No, certainly 
not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many cases borders between our provinces have been more 
daunting than the Himalaya mountains.  After being in power for 
three and a half years the last time and being in power a long 
time before that, it is outrageous the Liberal government has 
done nothing to dismantle hundreds of trade barriers that exist 
between our provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the subcommittee on the special import measures act last year 
members heard that in many cases it was easier to export from the 
American states to our provinces than it is from provinces like 
Ontario. This is absolutely absurd.  We even heard from a 
Canadian company that actually left Ontario in disgust to move to 
Michigan. The company could not do business in Canada from 
Ontario, but once they located in Michigan they could trade into 
Canadian provinces.  We have an absolutely ludicrous situation 
that has to be corrected.  They are not showing the vision on the 
other side to resolve the problem.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem of internal trade barriers is one that will take 
imagination and courage to overcome.  I submit the government has 
neither the imagination nor courage.  Otherwise it would have 
tackled it long ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has the power to demolish these internal 
trade barriers.  Doing so will do more to create jobs and exports 
in the country than hundreds of team Canada trade missions.  In 
fact it has been suggested that internal trade barriers may be 
costing Canadians up to $8 billion per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne also mentions making Canada the 
location of choice for global investment.  It is a worthy 
objective. Canada is a wonderful location, but I wonder sometimes 
if the government has actually examined some of the existing 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has it examined payroll taxes?  They are a killer and they are 
going up, not down.  Canadian pension plan premiums are going up 
by 77 percent over 1996 levels.  On top of that, the employment 
insurance fund will run a surplus of almost $13 billion by the 
end of the year.  What is this for?  It is obviously to help the 
finance minister bring down his deficit, but it will be done on 
the backs of workers and employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the government honestly believe foreign investors will come 
to Canada to have their pockets picked?  Why on earth would high 
level executives want to direct foreign investment from their 
country into Canada after examining our personal income tax 
levels?  These are over 50 percent higher than income taxes paid by our 
six G-7 partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now blue skies and nice folks are important, but I suggest they 
are not the only reason that companies invest in Canada.  They 
look at business dollars as savvy executives.  Good business 
conditions is what they are looking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We desperately need to dismantle our internal trade barriers and 
lower payroll and other taxes.  We also need to remove some of 
the red tape on regulation that keeps our business people from 
concentrating on the product or the service they are selling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, trade and investment start at home.  If the 
conditions are right foreign investments and exports will follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding of Peace River in Alberta is located in the lowest 
taxed province in the country.  It is not surprising that our 
exports flow directly south where many of our trade barriers have 
already been dismantled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government should take a major initiative.  Instead 
of taking a team Canada trade mission to Latin America this year, 
perhaps it should concentrate right at home and correct some of 
the problems it has the power to look after.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to pick up on the last 
point the hon. member put forward with respect to internal trade 
barriers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should acknowledge that the government 
introduced a measure to eliminate internal trade barriers.  I had 
the opportunity of sitting with one of his colleagues who 
contributed to that discussion quite effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member wants to have an impact on internal trade barriers 
I encourage him to continue his dialogue.  At the same time he 
should make sure he speaks to the provinces that are standing in 
the way of eliminating trade barriers that contribute to $6 
billion or $7 billion of GDP.  This is very important for the 
country and the jobs that need to be created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is not standing in the way of internal 
trade barriers.  I encourage the member to be very clear when he 
communicates with the constituents of his riding and other 
Canadians across the country.  I am sure he supports the 
initiative, as do I and other members of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I want to make the point that the provinces are standing 
in the way.  I certainly welcome any support he could provide in 
that instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Penson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
Stoney Creek for his comment and question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly agree with him that initiatives are being made. 
There is an effort to try to dismantle interprovincial trade 
barriers.  That initiative has been going nowhere.  There are 
provinces, especially those led by NDP governments, that are 
resisting very vigorously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Failing being able to resolve this issue by consultation, 
section 93 of the Canadian Constitution clearly states that there 
shall be no restrictions or barriers to trade across 
interprovincial borders.  Clearly the federal government has the 
authority to make the change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While a Reform government would devolve many powers to the 
provinces where they can be administered better by either the 
provinces or the municipalities, this is one area in which the 
federal government has to show strong leadership, and it is not 
currently doing so.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To show how ludicrous some of these interprovincial trade 
barriers are, a constituent of mine in the Peace River riding had 
a contract to do some gravel work using some of his trucks up in 
an area seven miles from the British Columbia border in Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the day was done and they had finished their work, they 
wanted to drive those same trucks into Dawson Creek, which was 
the nearest community, to stay in the hotels there overnight and 
eat in the restaurants.  But they were restricted from doing so 
because the axle spacing on their trucks does not meet B.C. 
requirements.  It would have cost them thousands of dollars to 
meet that specification.  Those are the kind of silly rules we 
have in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have more barriers to trade within our provincial borders 
than all of the European Community members combined. It is 
ridiculous. Seventeen 17 countries in Europe have been able to 
come up with standards so that trucks can roll across the 
borders, do not have to present papers and do not have special 
restrictions based on country of origin.  Canada has negotiated 
better trade agreements outside our country than it has been able 
to negotiate inside Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that when the member says that we need consultation 
and to put pressure on, the government clearly has the authority 
to make the changes and bring Canada into the 21st century. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, congratulations on your appointment. The job looks good 
on you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the voters of Battlefords—Lloydminster 
for their support.  I speak today on their behalf in support of 
the motion to condemn the government for its empty promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My riding is a large rural riding with a very active and diverse 
agricultural sector and a thriving resource industry.  I would 
like to say that my constituents were very disappointed when 
there was no mention of their issues and concerns in last week's 
throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, we are obviously not alone if we judge by 
the comments that came out of British Columbia last week. To my 
knowledge no one in Saskatchewan is entertaining the notion of 
separation, but we can certainly sympathize with the frustration 
that is contained in that expression. Even if much of that 
frustration is based on perception rather than reality, it still 
grows as Canadians beyond this central region see their concerns 
ignored and in some cases brushed off as insignificant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the prairies today grain piles up in the elevators, trains 
sit idle on their sidings and government monopolies continue to 
tell farmers what to do with the products of their labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back in Ottawa the government announces new spending initiatives 
to satisfy a few narrow interests as it claims a balanced budget 
will soon arrive and perhaps then it will take a look at letting 
Canadians keep more of their own money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the government ever really asked what is the number one 
concern of all Canadians?  If it did, the answer from the left 
and from the right of the political spectrum would be jobs, long 
term sustainable jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When an individual has a secure job, all the other facets of 
their life fall into place. They can make plans, develop skills, 
raise families and put their wages into the marketplace to the 
benefit of their fellow citizens. When people feel secure they 
can more easily turn their attention to the wider concerns of a 
regional or national scale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers believe that Canadians are generous and compassionate 
and given the chance will make decisions with their money that 
will benefit their fellow citizens everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that if governments create the conditions that offer 
opportunity and security in the economy, then prosperity will 
alleviate many of the social concerns we are struggling to deal 
with here in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, if the government would create the conditions that 
encourage business people to hire workers, then the benefits to 
everyone would be obvious.  If someone is lifted from a social 
program, becomes a taxpayer and is given the opportunity to make 
decisions, it will help their fellow Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is where we run into trouble. Some people still believe in 
the grand schemes that call for massive amounts of tax dollars 
and assume that a handful of bureaucrats making decisions in 
central offices are somehow superior to the choices made by 
ordinary Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers and people with different perspectives from many 
countries have shown over and over that this philosophy is both 
wasteful and ineffective.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxpayers do not need more grand schemes.  We need to let 
Canadians, including Canadians who choose to invest in their 
future, create businesses and hire their neighbours, to make 
their own choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not going to stand here and say that average Canadians have 
all the answers.  When we consider the risks involved, the 
headaches and the aggravation of owning a small or medium size 
business, we have to wonder if wise choices are being made out 
there. There was a joke going around a few years ago which asked: 
How do you make $1 million in Canadian business?  First you 
start with $2 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we consider the number of obstacles which stand in the way 
of a Canadian entrepreneur, the regulations and red tape, taxes, 
fees, licences at three levels of government, including all the 
agencies and commissions, the regulations and fees of the banks, 
the suppliers and the competition, it obviously takes a special 
breed of people to want to have their own business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be fair, we are not unique in the world for this.  There are 
just as many regulations meant to protect as there are to 
interfere.  However, when we consider that there are nearly one 
million businesses with paid employees in Canada, of which 97 percent 
have less than 50 workers, and 1.1 million Canadians who describe 
themselves as self-employed, surely there are a few basic things 
that can be done to encourage those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consider that 75 percent of all businesses in Canada have less than 
five employees.  By convincing even half of these employers to 
hire one more worker on average, we would see 360,000 jobs 
created in a relatively short period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question becomes:  What would it take to convince someone to 
hire that new worker? Quite simply, companies will hire only if 
it is in the interest of their profitability to do so.  It is 
naive to think otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We often hear in the House that the measure of a country is how 
it treats its most vulnerable citizens.  Where the debate goes 
off track is when some of our colleagues assume that the only 
measure of how we treat these citizens is how much money the 
government spends to deal with them. We forget entirely that 
citizens can help each other and that the choices of our fellow 
citizens must be part of this measurement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments can better increase the profitability of businesses 
by reducing their costs, rather than by subsidizing certain 
activities.  Labour is one of these costs and government can have 
a negative influence on this by, for example, keeping employment 
insurance rates higher than are necessary or by jacking up 
premiums on pension plans to compensate for 30 years of 
mismanagement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxes of all kinds can also have a negative impact.  Nobody has 
yet found a way to run a country without them, but it is the 
rates established in Canada that need serious adjustment.  Taxing 
capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income ignores the 
element of risk that an investor or entrepreneur brings to 
business, without which our economy would be stagnant.  Taxes 
drive up the cost of nearly everything, and by so doing suppress 
purchasing and pass the costs on to the people least able to 
afford them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see that potential entrepreneurs in this country are hit 
with a triple whammy.  Government raises the cost of supplies and 
products without consultation, thereby affecting sales. If they 
succeed they are then hit with premiums, levies and taxes on the 
employees they try to hire to help them produce more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, if the struggling businesses manage to overcome all of 
this and show a profit, the government again comes looking for a 
share.  There is of course the small business tax deduction, but 
it has not been adjusted since it was introduced in 1982. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments have compensated for inflation by increasing their 
tax take, but have done nothing to protect the people who 
generate those taxes. I do not wish to be dramatic.  Clearly 
Canadians are creating businesses and, though not very often, are 
even pocketing some money and prospering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question that we have before us is this.  How can we make 
more people more prosperous? The Reform Party discussion paper 
Beyond a Balanced Budget provides a great deal of statistical 
information and arguments on why we must address the issues of 
tax burdens and entrepreneurship in Canada.  We invite informed 
discussion from all Canadians on the future direction of this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We stand at a threshold, as we did in 1970 when the government 
last had a surplus budget.  What we decide to do in this House 
will not only affect ourselves and our children, it will affect 
Canadians for generations to come.  I trust we can be much more 
prudent and thoughtful than our predecessors.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin—Peel—Wellington—Grey, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened with a great deal of interest 
to the member's maiden speech. I would advise him to do a little 
better research.  He should look at what has been done with the 
Canadian Business Development Bank, for instance.  Its mandate 
has been expanded and it is certainly helping tourism in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He should also take a look at the Farm Credit Corporation 
because its mandate has been expanded.  Not only does it deal 
with farmers, but it is now dealing with value added product 
which is helping the agriculture industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked in his speech about things that he had not heard the 
government say.  One of the things I noticed was that he did not 
talk about health care.  I would like to get his opinion on 
health care and what it should be into the third millennium. 
One-third of Canada's population, 9.8 million people, are now 
turning 50.  There will be 500,000 a year turning 50 each year 
for the next 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health care system is going to be used at a very high rate 
as this segment of the population ages.  I would like to hear 
what his opinion would be on how we pro-actively answer that 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
questions.  He mentioned the Canadian Business Development Bank 
and Farm Credit Corporation. Certainly we welcome any positive 
conditions that they will introduce to further business in 
Canada.  However, the one thing that usually flies in the face of 
anything that happens through developments like this is that they 
never really consult the people that they purport to serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know in my instance, the Farm Credit Corporation having just 
gone through a major shake-up and a major reorganization in my 
area, has not really seen any dramatic growth or have I heard 
people saying “You are doing a much better job”.  We just do 
not see that out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding health care in my province of Saskatchewan, we have 
seen hospitals closed at a record rate.  The line-ups are 
definitely longer.  People are waiting longer and longer for less 
health care.  It is unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course I do not have all the options and answers. We are here 
in this House to discuss them.  I think of some of the things 
that we are going to have to do.  We need a much more preventive 
medicine situation out there.  We are going to have to allow some 
alternative treatments and so on like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to assure that people have the right to basic health 
care and make sure that we can sustain that into the next 
millennium.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened very intently to the comments of the hon. 
member.  As the Reform is prone to do, he has addressed in his 
comments specifically the financial end of his impression of the 
throne speech pointing out the inadequacies, making thoughtful 
suggestions on where improvements could be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My observations of Reform and the comments of its members seem 
to indicate that they are very regionally based and focused.  In 
the Conservative Party six provinces are represented, including a 
great proportion from Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the hon. member is specifically, what does the 
Reform have in mind.  What is its approach to addressing some of 
the difficulties that Atlantic Canadians are facing, keeping in 
mind that those problems are national problems as well? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have yet to hear anything too insightful or thoughtful on the 
part of the Reform on how to address the problems of Atlantic 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I welcome the comments from 
my esteemed colleague.  He talked specifically of help to 
Atlantic Canada.  In our election platform and again here in the 
House we talk about equality of opportunity for everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Medicine Hat earlier today stated that cutting 
taxes helps people at all ends of the country.  It creates jobs, 
lets small business become the small engine of the economy that 
we know it to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subsidies and grants have proven not effective over the last 
number of years.  There are too few dollars for too many people. 
We would also like to see a review of the infrastructure system 
in Atlantic Canada to help it facilitate the worldwide market 
that we are finding more and more out there. 
Those types of things will have to be addressed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a fisheries crisis in Atlantic Canada.  He talked about 
us being regional.  We have an agriculture crisis in the 
prairies.  We are not alone in coming to this House with regional 
viewpoints.  That is much of the reason for the make-up of the 
House as it is.  People are sending us here to address issues 
that are common to them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this past June nearly 13 million 
Canadians voted in the federal election which established this 
36th Parliament and our government, and that is a fact.  It is 
one of those facts that today's opposition motion strangely 
ignores. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that election our government looked to the day when, thanks 
to the foundation we put in place with four years of consistent 
effort and tough decisions, the federal government will no longer 
need deficit financing.  That will be the day when we do not have 
to borrow to cover the cost of federal spending and debt charges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prospect of that tremendous turnaround raised an obvious 
issue.  What should the federal government do when tax revenues 
begin to exceed our costs?  As the prime minister said, and he 
proposed a very clear and concrete answer, one-half of the 
surplus should go to a combination of reducing taxes and national 
debt.  He proposed that the other half be invested in addressing 
the social and economic needs of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That proposal was made in the first week of the campaign.  It 
allowed for weeks of debate and discussion by candidates and by 
commentators.  Mr. Speaker, I am sure that you and other members 
of this House were out there debating at local debates in your 
constituencies.  Most important, this issue was debated by 
Canadians themselves.  The single largest group of Canadians said 
that is the approach they want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet today the hon. member for Medicine Hat seeks to condemn this 
government for making that 50:50 pledge without adequate debate. 
Did he not engage in that debate during the campaign? Where was 
he during that debate in his campaign?  I am sure the issue came 
up.  I am sure he debated with other candidates who were seeking 
election.  I am at a loss to explain why he now seeks to condemn 
the government for this proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps he did not read our platform.  Maybe that was it, I am 
not sure.  Perhaps he just did not want to debate it.  Maybe that 
is it.  Perhaps he only has ears for his own rhetoric, but I have 
a higher regard for Canadian voters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government has been addressing these issues, the size of 
government, taxes, debt, from the first day that we came to 
office.  That is why we have cut the size of government and 
federal program spending by more than any other government in 50 
years.  That is in absolute terms, real bottom line dollars. That 
is why we have not increased tax rates in three consecutive 
budgets, because we know the tax burden Canadians carry is too 
high. That is also why we have lowered employment insurance 
contributions in each of our four budgets, and that is why we 
have introduced selective tax measures for those most in need, to 
help disadvantaged children and to assist charities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And then there is the debt, a topic that has not escaped the 
notice of this House and our government no matter what the 
opposition would like Canadians to believe.  We have made clear 
in budget after budget that deficit elimination is not the end of 
our fiscal journey.  We also have to bring down Canada's debt as 
a share of our economy.  We had to deal with the deficit.  We 
have dealt with the deficit as we have said we would.  We will be 
balancing the budget in 1998-99.  The debt is still much too 
large as a percentage of GDP and we will continue to bring down 
Canada's debt as a share of our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These actions and positions are a matter of record, just the 
fiscal turnaround we have worked so hard to put in place.  They 
have been analysed, debated and critiqued for four years.  After 
all that, Canadian voters decided last June that this record of 
achievement and commitment deserved a new mandate, the mandate 
they gave to this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion should fool no one.  It is not about adequate 
debate.  It is not about how the 50:50 pledge should be applied. 
It is not even about irresponsible spending.  Instead it is 
really an attack on a concept of balanced government.  It is an 
attack on the idea that government does have a role to play in 
investing in a stronger, more innovative economy, and it is an 
attack on the belief that government does have an obligation to 
help those in need and at risk.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that market forces alone will not do the job.  There was 
reference earlier by previous speakers about the fact that 
Alberta is now out there consulting with Albertans on what to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party should also acknowledge that for the first time 
Premier Klein is actually saying that there is a role for 
government and that government needs to invest in the future of 
Albertans, in his particular case.  We as a government have 
always believed and will continue to believe that we need to 
invest in the future of Canadians and ensure that the investments 
pay dividends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have made clear that our government will reduce taxes when it 
is affordable, when a fiscal surplus is certain and secure, 
because we will never jeopardize the progress that we have made 
on the deficit.  We will not jeopardize the rewards that this 
progress is delivering and the achievements that we have made 
over the last number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of those benefits is the low interest rates, the lowest 
rates in 30 years.  It is as a result of the fact that this 
government has been successful in reducing the deficit and 
gaining a handle on the fiscal management of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly that is not good enough for the opposition.  The motion 
obviously implies that any new spending is bad spending. It 
raises the spectre of the return to surging deficits, a 
staggering debt and renewed taxation.  Let me say that this 
reform motion is wrong and it is misguided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition may worship at the altar of 
laissez-faire, but we and the majority of Canadians know that 
laissez-faire economics can too often become the let them suffer 
public policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not prepared to nor do we accept that proposition by the 
opposition.  That is why we have set out in the last budget, 
during the election and in last week's Speech from the Throne 
concrete priorities where a share of the fiscal dividend should 
go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of the opposition say that is why we have such a big 
problem in this country.  Members of the opposition can continue 
along that track and can continue to keep their heads buried in 
the sand and talk about the way it was.  We are talking about the 
way it is going to be.  The progress that we have made, the 
benefits that progress is bringing to this country and how we are 
going to bring this country into the next millennium, that is the 
discussion we will have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is ample opportunity for discussion in this House and 
there will be ample opportunity for continued discussion outside 
of this House, as every member of the government will be out in 
their constituencies consulting with their constituents, 
consulting with Canadians about the priorities and whether we 
have these priorities right and what we should be doing with our 
fiscal dividend when that dividend appears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We established concrete priorities in the throne speech last 
week to children through further increasing the child tax 
benefit.  Our goal here is working with the provinces to allow 
low income families to get off the welfare trap that creates a 
disincentive for work and that punishes children most of all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On investing in quality health care and good health, our health 
care system has become a vital part of our national fabric, 
providing the security that represents both a social and an 
economic benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We pledged to invest in measures to help Canadians respond to 
the expanding need for home care and community care and to 
improve the quality and effectiveness of health services and 
delivery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have placed the priority on creating opportunities for young 
Canadians. 
We have placed the priority and are demonstrating that priority 
through investing in knowledge and creativity.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reflects the fundamental fact that in today's fast evolving, 
global economy there are initiatives that must be taken on a 
national scale.  It is incumbent on a national government to take 
on that role.  We cannot rely only on pockets of success in the 
face of tidal waves of international competition.  We have to 
mobilize on a Canada-wide basis, drawing on all the stakeholders, 
the private sector, governments and community groups.  We need to 
engage and we are engaging Canadians at all levels in ensuring 
we mobilize together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An example of that is the Canada foundation for innovation.  It 
is an $800 million investment that has been applauded right 
across this country.  We have been able to make that investment 
because of the fiscal progress that we have made in this country. 
It is about having a vision.  It is about investing in Canadians 
in ensuring that the future of Canadians is bright.  That is the 
role of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More recently the prime minister has pledged the scholarship 
initiative, an even greater investment in what is the ultimate 
natural resource in this country, our young people.  This is just 
one initiative, the scholarship fund, but there are many others 
that we have engaged in through the ministers of human resources 
and finance who have put forward a youth strategy to assist the 
youth of this country.  It is not just members of the government. 
It is members across the floor as well.  Youth are an issue that 
is important to every Canadian and every member of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By working with members across, with Canadians, with the private 
sector and with all levels of government, we are beginning to 
deal with the issue.  It has not been solved.  It is still an 
issue.  Unemployment for young people in this country is still 
too high.  Canadians have said that to members across and to 
members of government.  We know that but we are making progress 
and are taking initiatives to deal with the youth unemployment 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to do that and as the government continues to 
improve and balance the budget and as funds become available for 
strategic investments, one of the priorities we have set forth is 
youth and we will continue to deal with that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go back to today's opposition motion.  It essentially implies 
that such investments in youth and in the Canada foundation for 
innovation will be a threat to our nation's fiscal future and 
long term economic prosperity.  I disagree.  The Canada 
foundation for innovation will add to the long term economic 
prosperity for this country.  Investment in youth strategy and 
youth initiatives will add to the long term economic prosperity 
of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think we will find Canadians anywhere who will disagree 
with investing in youth, investing in innovation and ensuring we 
are equipped to move into the next millennium, ensuring this 
country is equipped and able to compete with companies and other 
countries around the world.  I am confident that the majority of 
Canadians will see them as vital investments in our national 
growth and security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have worked hard for four years to bring Canada's finances to 
the point where we can begin to plan new initiatives.  We will 
never jeopardize that achievement and the benefits that it has 
brought, low interest rates, impressive economic growth, hundreds 
of thousands of new jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the throne speech stated, we will continue to be vigilant and 
responsible about keeping the financial affairs of the country in 
order.  We will implement tax reductions and lower the debt. 
However we have never lost sight of the companion obligation to 
use the resources that we do have in intelligent and effective 
ways to strengthen our society and advance our economy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It reflects what Canadians across the country continue to 
support.  I submit that a balanced approach is the best approach. 
It is the approach that Canadians have consistently said they 
support and will continue to support. That is why the House must 
reject this motion and the philosophy that it represents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the remaining moments I have, it would be incumbent on me to 
address some of the points that were made earlier today by the 
member for Medicine Hat.  He stated that the government is 
playing games.  Let us talk about the games the government is 
playing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have announced that we will balance the budget in 1998-99. 
The debt is on a downward track.  We are committed to reducing 
the debt to GDP ratio. The economy is growing and we are leading 
the G-7.  I submit that we are winning this game.  To use the 
words of the hon. member for Medicine Hat that the government is 
playing games, we are winning the game.  The member should read 
again what we accomplished in our past mandate and what we intend 
to do in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The core issue which is raised continually is that there is no 
consultation with Canadians.  Let me also say that Reform has no 
monopoly on consultation.  For Reform to make that statement and 
think that other members of the House are not speaking with 
Canadians I submit is unfair.  We all speak with our constituents 
and consult with Canadians.  I do not understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We began prebudget consultations back in 1993.  And we are not 
speaking to Canadians?  Was he in the same place he was during 
the election campaign?  Did he miss out on what was going on or 
is this just an opportunity to put something forward without any 
real thought? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about irresponsible spending.  What about our 
priorities on health care, education, youth and children?  This 
is not irresponsible spending. These are the priorities of 
Canadians.  They want to see a strong national government making 
investments in priorities. However, the Reform Party apparently 
disagrees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform members disagree with the fact that there has been $1.5 
billion put back into the Canada health and social transfers. 
They disagree with that reinvestment in the health care system 
and with investments in scholarships for young Canadians.  I am 
at a loss. They apparently disagree with the concept of youth 
internship and lifelong learning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me close by saying that as the fiscal situation has allowed, 
the government has pursued new spending initiatives in priority 
areas, health initiatives, R and D support, tourism.  It is the 
essence of good management. The bottom line is that Canada is now 
on a track toward eliminating the deficit with a smaller and 
better government. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Thank you, Mr. 
Speaker, for recognizing me immediately after my distinguished Liberal 
colleague from the beautiful riding of Stoney Creek finished his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his 20 minute speech, he raised a few points which may be worth 
looking at again. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1235"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT32"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT32"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1235
<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, he said interest rates are currently the lowest this country 
had ever seen. I would submit to him that, conversely, I experienced the 
highest rates at a time when I had a substantial mortgage. As it 
happens, his leader was sitting in the finance minister's seat, or very 
close to him, at the time. I have paid rates as high as 22 percent at a time 
when this same Liberal Party was running the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debt is now $620 billion, or thereabouts. I will remind my 
distinguished colleague that the Liberal Party, which ran the country 
from 1970 to 1984, except for the nine months of Joe Clark's government, 
managed to make the accumulated deficit grow to $250 billion. 
The Conservatives made it grow twofold from 1984 to 1993. Since 1993, 
the Liberals have been at it again and, as a result, it has now reached 
$620 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The GST. His leader had promised to kill it. The ruse he found to 
lull some Atlantic provinces was the harmonization that Quebec had 
already carried out in 1991-92 and that should bring in to Quebec about 
as much as was offered to the three provinces that agreed to harmonize 
their taxes. He therefore owes the people of Quebec some $2 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about jobs. I find it shameful for a government to take 
between $6 billion and $9 billion a year out of the employment insurance 
surplus to finance the deficit reduction effort. I fin it shameful for 
the government to come and boast in this House about working for the 
unemployed, for youth, for our students who are looking for work and 
training in their field. 
It is shameful and I am convinced that his constituents are not proud of 
the speech their member has just delivered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge my hon. colleague, whom I had the pleasure to meet more 
often when we were sitting together on the environment committee, to try 
to raise awareness in cabinet and in the party to which he belongs, to 
make them more responsive to the demands of the working class. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the one point I would like 
to make is a point which I made during my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an opportunity in the House to debate where we are going 
in this country based on the mandate we were given in June by 
Canadians.  The hon. member however seems to want to continue to 
live in the past with the highest interest rates in history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have the lowest interest rates in 30 years.  Canadians 
are benefiting because of lower interest rates.  The economy is 
benefiting because of low interest rates.  The debt is on a 
downward track and the government has made a commitment to reduce 
the debt as a ratio to the GDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to start talking about the past, the member is 
certainly able to do that.  However I would like to continue to 
demonstrate that this government has made commitments, has 
established priorities and will continue to meet those 
priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the harmonization of the GST, Quebec has 
benefited from that.  There has been no reduction in revenue to 
the provincial government as a result of harmonization of the 
GST.  The member knows that yet he continues to stand in the 
House claiming that the government owes Quebeckers a payment.  I 
disagree. The member should clarify his remarks.  I look forward 
to the continuing debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for Stoney Creek 
for his speech.  I have appreciated working with him in 
committee. 
He has an ability to put the best possible face on a sorry 
situation and I want to congratulate him for that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that he talks about the benefit of lower 
interest rates as though the Liberal government has brought them 
down on its own when in fact the government is capitalizing and 
taking advantage of the interest rates on a worldwide basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talks about an attitude of let them suffer.  This is an 
attitude which I have a great deal of difficulty with as I travel 
throughout my constituency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of an elderly woman whose husband died last year. She 
has a total combined income of about $13,000 a year.  Now with 
the clawbacks of her old age pension she is having a great deal 
of difficulty and is finding it impossible to pay the taxes on 
the house that she owns.  She is desperate to know what to do in 
light of these government policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the small business people who have been established 
for years and are floundering under the weight of the regulations 
and rules of three levels of government and finding it impossible 
to pay for having to prove daily that they are keeping these 
rules. Comments about the new Canada pension plan startle me 
because they say that many of them are not going to be able to 
continue to operate and to pay these taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it interesting that the member talks about the $1 billion 
scholarship fund when the students themselves are scoffing at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask this member if he believes that the Canadian 
people are demanding higher and higher taxes for the level of 
service they are receiving which is putting them in such jeopardy 
in their established day to day lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would also like to thank 
the member for his comments and for the time I was able to spend 
in working with the member on the industry committee.  There was 
a lot of good work that we were able to put forward through that 
committee. It was through the interventions of the hon. member 
that some of that work was possible.  I am thankful for that 
experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the comments that the hon. member has made, we 
said before and continue to say that certainly the retirement 
income system of this country is an issue which we are very 
committed to improving. We know that through the new seniors 
benefit, when that proposal comes to the House, nine out of ten 
elderly women will be better off.  The hon. member made reference 
to an elderly lady in his constituency. We know lower income 
Canadians will be better off through the proposed seniors 
benefit.  Therefore there is commitment by this government to 
deal with the retirement income system.  I am sure that the hon. 
member will be able to participate in that debate and add very 
articulately to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to small business, there are many members on this 
side of the House who are certainly very committed to the small 
business sector and believe that the small business sector is the 
engine of growth in the Canadian economy. I myself have had the 
opportunity to work on a number of task forces supporting members 
of the small business community and ensuring that their voice is 
heard with respect to ministers responsible for that portfolio. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding higher taxes, there is no question, and the Minister 
of Finance has said it before, that this government will deal 
with the burden of taxes for low and middle income Canadians. We 
have said it before and we will continue to say it.  We stand 
behind that commitment.  As I said in my speech, Canadians want a 
balanced approach.  That approach means dealing with the debt, 
dealing with taxes, dealing with opportunities to invest in the 
future of Canadians. That is the approach we are going to take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to letting them suffer, that was a reference to the 
laissez-faire approach the Reform Party seems to be adhering to. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is my intention to share my time with my colleague 
from Langley—Abbotsford. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1245"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT34"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT34"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1245

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure to stand in the House today and to speak to the 
motion put forward by my colleague from Medicine Hat, that this 
House condemn the government for making its 50:50 election 
promise on future surpluses without adequate public debate as to 
the optimal size of government, taxes and debt, thus threatening 
to repeat Canada's 27 year old history of deficit spending, 
creating high debt, financed by high taxes, causing high 
unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I proceed, Mr. Speaker, I congratulate you on your 
appointment. I look forward to the deliberations under your care 
and control. I would also like to thank the members of my 
constituency of Cariboo—Chilcotin for participating in the 
democratic process of the June election, in particular those who 
worked to support my candidacy and my election.  I am honoured to 
represent the views of Cariboo—Chilcotin and it is my intention 
to represent my constituents to the best of my ability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Cariboo—Chilcotin voted for Reform during the 
last election because, like many Canadians, they wanted three 
things. First, they want equality to be the guiding principle in 
the national unity debate.  Second, they want accountability from 
the government, its department and agencies.  This has been 
diluted more and more over the past years.  Accountability has 
been taken from the House of Commons and put in the hands of the 
cabinet, with order in council administration, and in the hands 
of bureaucrats. This should be restored to the House of Commons. 
Third, they want fiscal responsibility to be the watch word of 
the government and every future government which holds power in 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the third point on fiscal responsibility which I will 
focus on.  Specifically, I will do two things.  First, I will 
outline where massive government over spending has led our 
country.  Second, I will describe a plan that will save us from 
forever following that destructive and empty path. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Political pundits and financial analysts say that Canada is at a 
critical moment in its financial history.  I am sure that we can 
all agree with this.  Over the past 30 years we have seen 
successive Liberal and Conservative politicians repeat the same 
destructive pattern in government, irresponsible spending which 
has caused chronic deficits and spiralling debt financed by 
escalating taxes.  Thanks largely to tax increases there is a 
huge and growing surplus in the employment insurance fund, 
subdued growth in public debt charges and cuts in provincial 
transfers for health, education and welfare.  Also because of 
pressure from the Reform Party, the public and the financial 
markets, we are on the brink of resolving the second of the four 
problems, deficit spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following our present course, Canada is at most two years away 
from a balanced budget and this is good news for all Canadians. 
This brings us to a critical point in our history. Reformers have 
circulated a discussion paper, “Beyond a Balanced Budget”, to 
seek the will of the Canadian people.  This paper is not a policy 
paper, it is a discussion paper.  It is a discussion paper 
seeking Canadian opinion.  We will find this discussion not only 
in homes and offices but also on the Internet and in town hall 
meetings and we will find Reformers listening carefully to what 
Canadians are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a real need for this national discourse.  The last time 
the federal government was in a similar situation was in 1969-70 
when Canada recorded a $139 million surplus.  After that time, 
the road the government chose was one of massive overspending and 
mortgaging our future to borrow the money.  It chose to run 
deficits year after year.  Where did this course take us as a 
country?  How can we ever avoid going that way again? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1250"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT35"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT35"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1250

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result of consistent overspending and borrowing over the last 
30 years gave Canada a debt that grew from $20 billion in 1970 to 
approximately $600 billion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to outline the magnitude of this debt.  Our $600 
billion debt works out to over $19,600 for every man, woman and 
child in Canada.  For a family of four that comes to almost 
$80,000.  I calculate it as $78,400.  Canada's $600 billion debt 
is one of the highest debt burdens among industrialized 
countries.  It is 74 percent of gross domestic product.  As a percentage 
of GDP our net foreign debt is the worst of any of the world's 
major economies.  Canada owes 25.3 percent of its debt to foreigners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent study by the Fraser Institute puts total Canadian debt, 
all of our Canadian liabilities, at closer to three and a half 
trillion dollars after accounting for federal, provincial, local 
marketable debt, government business enterprise debt and debt 
guarantees, QPP, CPP, unfounded liabilities, hospital sector debt 
and total unfunded liabilities of the medicare system.  Three and 
a half trillion dollars we are in hock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To describe the size of our debt more graphically, a financial 
analyst in the 1995 <I>Grant's Interest Rate Observer</I> said 
that 8 percent of Canada's land mass is covered in water while the other 
92 percent is covered in debt.  That is how one financial analyst 
started to tell investors around the world about Canada.  If the 
net public debt were converted to $5 bills and laid end to end it 
would circle the earth 1,448 times.  I did not make that 
calculation, I only report it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just described the legacy of 30 years of chronic 
overspending by successive Liberal and Tory governments.  This is 
what federal government after federal government gave our country 
again and again to serve their own short term political ends at 
the cost of nearly bankrupting our nation.  We could say so what, 
and many people do say that.  So what if our debt is one of the 
biggest in the world?  So what if government keeps borrowing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as we cannot rack up personal debt and expect there to be 
no consequences, neither can the country.  Let me outline for the 
House the major consequences of massive government debt that 
haunt and will continue to haunt future generations of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, interest charges.  The federal government spends $46 
billion a year to service the debt.  That is about 33 cents of 
interest charges for every dollar in revenue raised by 
government. It is Ottawa's largest single expenditure, more than 
twice the size of the next expenditures on seniors and transfers 
to provinces. These interest charges mount by $5.3 million an 
hour and chew up $1 in every $3 in budgetary revenues.  Think 
about that.  We pay bankers $46 billion a year.  We pay Bay 
Street, Wall Street, Hong Kong, bond bankers for money borrowed 
to finance yesterday's programs.  We owe $46 billion to buy 
virtually nothing of value for Canadian citizens today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The annual interest bill would be enough to run each and every 
hospital in Canada for two years. The interest for one year would 
pay tuition for four million Canadian youths to finish a four 
year degree at university. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a means of handling this situation.  What should a 
balanced budget look like?  What would we do?  There should be 
legislation to prevent a government from increasing the deficit. 
Over a three year period a government should be required to 
balance its books or call an election.  The first three year 
period would commence three years from the passage of the measure 
except for certain crises such as recession, severe flood, 
earthquake or war. 
They must be dealt with as they arise.  These would be a release 
valve.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to be back in the House, my second 
time, for this 36th Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to start off by thanking those people in Langley 
and Abbotsford who re-elected me with a fairly sizeable margin, I 
am happy to say, over my opponents in the Liberal Party.  For all 
those people in my riding, whether they voted Reform or whatever 
party, they may be absolutely certain that we will be looking out 
for their affairs as equal individuals participating in our 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I represent communities such as Langley, Abbotsford and 
Aldergrove in British Columbia.  They are communities with strong 
commitments to justice and very strong commitments to family and 
community values.  They are also communities with great concerns 
about government, the size of government, the expenditures 
governments have and about their taxes and how they affect their 
disposable incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to spend a good deal of time on this.  The motion the 
Reform Party put to this House today, I believe, speaks well for 
the concerns of the individuals who live in my riding.  For a 
government today to be talking about a potential surplus and to 
be fast off the mark suggesting that if we get that real fast it 
should find a way to spend it, I think it is quite appalling that 
we are back into that kind of spending mentality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to relate some of the expenditures of the past Liberal 
government and why those kinds of spending habits are of concern 
to the average Canadian.  I always use a litmus test.  I always 
say that if somebody comes to my door and asks for money to spend 
on some government project, if it comes out of my pocket would I 
allow it. I guess that is the same as the government asking for 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some of the expenditures coming from the pails of 
the tax trough, which I used in the last Parliament as well.  I 
think it emphasizes the problems most people have today with the 
kind of mentality this government has.  For instance, $33,800 was 
granted to examine major league baseball in Detroit.  I can think 
of a lot of people in my community who would say that is nice, 
but do we really want our disposable income reduced by that kind 
of expenditure.  Is it really the prerogative of government to 
make that kind of decision?  If you come to my home and to my 
family and ask me for some money to examine major league baseball 
in Detroit, I would not give it to you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and a lot of people across this country are asking if I 
would not give it to you why does the government. Does it not 
represent us in Ottawa?  Is that not the question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard some responses to this kind of critique of the 
government the other day during the throne speech.  I was really 
quite surprised that some of the hon. members across the way 
would say such things as they do not agree with all the 
expenditures, some slipped by.  They are not supposed to slip by 
this government or any government.  These are legitimate 
concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is really quite appalling when one can reach into 
virtually any document today and find this sort of thing. 
When the government says to the people of Canada that it may one 
day reach a surplus situation and that it is going to spend half 
of it, panic sets in.  If this is an example of how the 
government spends its money, we have reason to believe that the 
government is going to blow it out the door once again.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It spent $19,400 for a study for policing the boundaries of male 
sexuality from 1880 to 1930.  I suppose that may interest some in 
the country.  How does this improve our economy? How does this 
help the person with less disposable income in our communities 
today?  Are these people even going to get to read this sort of 
study?  Where is the value and where does government get off 
presuming that it is the wisest expenditure of our money? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government was really wise, it would make a suggestion 
that it will spend perhaps 50% of the savings made by cutting out 
these ridiculous expenditures.  There would likely be no critique 
from this side of the House on that.  Instead it basically says 
“We will ignore this kind of situation and we will spend more 
over and above that.” I ask the House, does that make any sense 
whatsoever?  I think not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well, let us blow $105,000 on career markers and personal 
performance strategy development of expert and novice symphony 
orchestra conductors and provincial ice hockey coaches.  Let me 
ask members, if someone came to my door and asked me for a 
portion of this $105,000 or any other hard working income earner 
in this country, would they get the money?  If not, why did the 
government presume to spend it on behalf of these people who 
would not give it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose we might as well blow another $49,249 on a cross 
cultural study of semiotic management and transformation of 
facial features in the makeup and masks of performers or $20,000 
to examine the ecclesiastical courts of 19th century England or 
$35,000 for a study on craft industries in post-medieval Iran. I 
could go on but the list kind of makes me just as sick as it does 
the folks at home watching this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message I am trying to get through to some of those who do 
not listen well on the other side is that this kind of stuff is 
not going to go away. For the next four years we are going to 
drill it and drill it and drill it again until the public finally 
gets enough and says that it is time the Liberals were put out of 
office.  It is time that they thought the 50:50 split on the 
surplus should have gone to something called taxes, to lower 
taxes.  I know it is difficult for members over there to 
understand.  It should go to lower debt payments which will lower 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not the only accountant in the House. This is economics 
101.  It is so basic, yet it is so hard to understand why the 
government in its throne speech can talk about spending more and 
not talk about trying to spend what it had a lot more wisely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a few notes here.  This is rather interesting. If the 
annual interest bill was converted to $100 bills and stacked the 
pile would be 118 kilometres high, a pile 214 times higher than 
the CN Tower.  That is a great stack for a government.  I know 
some of this was created by the previous government, but we 
cannot always blame it for everything. 
The fact is that this government overspent in the previous four 
years and added to the debt well over $100 billion.  These folks 
have borrowed one hundred thousand million dollars in the last 
four years.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is too bad that the message has not come through yet, but the 
Canadian public can look forward to us telling them over the next 
four years what a terrible job the government has done and what a 
terrible thing it is about to do, spending more money when it 
could be saving the dollars it has.  It is shameful. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Stoney Creek, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
listened with some interest to the comments made by the hon. 
member.  He talked about the performance of the government with 
respect to the debt.  It is important to again state very clearly 
for the record that it is because of the actions of the 
government that the debt is on a downward track.  The government 
is committed to reducing the debt to GDP ratio.  It will 
eliminate the deficit in 1998-99. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is speaking as if the government has just put the 
country into a big black hole.  We are moving out.  We are moving 
into the next century, but the member wants to continue to talk 
about the misspending of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to draw an analogy on which I invite the hon. member to 
comment. If a person pays off a mortgage but never fixes the 
plumbing or the roof, I am not sure that person will have a house 
to live in at the end of 25 years.  It is the same with a 
country. We need to reinvest in the priorities.  We have set what 
those priorities are and we will continue to adhere to our plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want the member to acknowledge that we are on a more 
prosperous track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Madam Speaker, I sense that the hon. 
member does not know a heck of a lot about what he is saying. The 
fact is that the deficit is on a downward track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to educate the hon. member on the difference 
between a debt and a deficit.  A deficit is the amount of money 
the government blows more of every year over and above the amount 
of money the government takes in.  That is a deficit. Debt, on 
the other hand, is something like a mortgage on which you have to 
pay interest.  That is a bit of education for some people who do 
not understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point is that it is a matter of the kind of house one 
builds in this country.  When a house is rather old and needs to 
have the plumbing replaced, perhaps it can be replaced with new 
plastic plumbing.  However, at the same time one does not put in 
stained glass windows or a brick driveway instead of a black-top 
driveway.  It is a matter of how one rebuilds one's house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message here is that if one wants to build one's house, do 
we build a castle or get a refurbished house?

discussion this afternoon. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition motion reads as follows, and I want to be 
absolutely sure to read it correctly. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>September 29, 1997—Mr. Solberg (Medicine Hat) moved that this 
House condemn the government for making their 50/50 election 
promise on any future surpluses without adequate public debate 
as to the optimal size of government, taxes and debt, thus 
threatening to repeat Canada's 27 year old history of 
irresponsible spending, creating high debt, financed by high 
taxes, causing high unemployment. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I read such a motion I have to ask the following questions: 
Did my colleague listen to the Speech from the Throne?  Did my 
colleague take the time to read it?  Did my colleague not hear 
what the journalists from television, radio and print had to say? 
Not some partisan petty little shot in order to score political 
points, but people who are out there to critique. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, my dear colleagues, those whose job it is to try to tell 
the truth as they see it, rather than the members of the 
opposition, who are here to try to embarrass the government and to 
try to do you know what.  I see a big grin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, you know what they do. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He did not listen to the speech.  He did not read the speech. He 
did not listen to what the journalists had to say on radio and 
television or in print.  If he had, he would not have made that 
motion.  Of all the motions he could have selected, of every 
single possibility, to show that they were indeed a responsible 
opposition, an opposition that saw the whole country, an 
opposition that was not prepared to play petty little politics at 
the beginning of the parliamentary session, of all the 
possibilities, he picked this one.  He did not see the key 
themes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me share with the House the key themes.  We will balance the 
budget no later than fiscal year 1998-99, the first time in three 
decades.  We will strive to split our budgetary surpluses on a 
50:50 basis over the course of our second mandate.  Half will go 
to a combination of tax reductions and debt repayment.  Half will 
go to strategic investments in our children, our youth, our 
health, our communities, our knowledge and our creativity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are some of the key points the hon. member who made the 
motion forgot to read.  He also forgot there are several others 
worth emphasizing:  investing in our children, investir de façon 
importante dans nos enfants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that investments in the well-being of today's 
children improve the long term health of the nation.  I wish that 
would have been acknowledged by my colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have important new initiatives.  We will establish centres of 
excellence to deepen our understanding of children's development. 
We will expand the aboriginal head start program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are those the kinds of programs that my colleague is condemning? 
If so, let him stand and say so.  Let him not hide behind some 
opposition motion brought forth to try to embarrass the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did he see the one on investing in quality care and good health? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my impression that my colleague did not see the part 
about investing in good health and quality care.  For some reason, 
he missed that.  He did not take the time to listen to or read it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be preserving and enhancing medicare.  Canadians want 
that.  We will be responding with expanded needs for home and 
community care and a national drug plan.  Is that what he wants 
us to eliminate? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is what he wants, let him stand up and declare it to 
everybody, including his constituents. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be promoting health and new initiatives to address 
tuberculosis and diabetes in aboriginal communities.  We will be 
renewing the national AIDS strategy.  Are those the programs he 
wants eliminated too? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are those the programs he wants eliminated, rejected and put 
aside?  Does he think there are no needs in these areas, that we 
should not be investing in children, in health? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he had read a bit more he would have seen that we want and 
are committed to building safer communities. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Building safer communities is one of the government's key 
objectives.  There is no magic solution, despite what the political 
background of my colleague who has just advanced this proposal 
claims.  It is hard work, it is complex.  Progress must be made a 
step at a time, with healthy programs.  That is what we intend to 
do. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue with our safe homes and safe streets agenda 
which has helped us make solid gains in enhancing public safety. 
I hope my colleague does not want that program eliminated as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about creating opportunities for young Canadians?  Was that 
one of the ones he would have liked simply thrown out? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Creating opportunities for young Canadians is, to my mind, a 
huge priority.  This has been referred to already several times 
since the start of the 36th Parliament.  Surely he does not want to 
do away with these programs for our young people, push them aside, 
put them out of existence?  That is surely not the case. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will secure the future of our young people.  We have 
important priorities to make sure the young generation makes a 
successful transition to the world of work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know how difficult it is in usual times, and these are 
unusual times.  It is particularly difficult to ensure that young 
people who want to continue to learn have access to education. 
That is a critical priority for the welfare of all.  It is 
difficult to be absolutely certain young people who found it 
difficult getting started in the workplace have a second chance 
when necessary. They often need that second chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that what my colleague pretends is foolish, inappropriate, 
insensitive, wasteful spending? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that what he intends? Another program he wants to see 
eliminated? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another theme that we have heard nothing about. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must invest in knowledge and creativity.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he not believe that investing in knowledge and creativity 
is important for the nation and the welfare of all citizens?  Is 
that what he wants eliminated?  Let him stand and say so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are increasingly an important part of a global village in a 
global economy.  In this new economy, knowledge, innovation and 
creativity are the keys to preserving and enhancing prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to continue partnerships between private and public 
sectors.  We want to devise targeted growth strategies that focus 
on knowledge intensive sectors.  We want to have small and medium 
size businesses develop and commercialize new technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because I have additional responsibilities in this area, I want 
to say a few words about science, innovation and technology.  We 
as a nation have a decision to make.  We will invest in a wise, 
sensitive, significant way in science, innovation and technology 
to continue to be leaders of nations, and if we do not we will 
follow.  We have made some important investments. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have made some very substantial investments and I will give you 
just a few examples. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the Canadian Foundation for Innovation to enhance the 
structure of our universities and our hospitals when research is 
conducted, $800 million over five years.  It has been applauded 
by most Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not heard one person say that was wasteful spending as 
the member and his party suggest.  Perhaps he is not speaking for 
his party.  Perhaps they will stand and denounce this kind of 
irresponsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have stabilized with funding to the centres d'excellence. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a great program to ensure that universities work with the 
private sector and that the best projects are funded, so that we are at 
the forefront, that we are the leaders. Perhaps the hon. member does not 
enjoy being first. Perhaps third, fourth or tenth is good enough for 
him. But not for us. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has he heard about the technology partnership programs where we 
assist businesses that want to be on the leading edge of the 
development of technology? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has he heard about IRAP which has several people out there 
advising and assisting people who want to develop new programs 
and projects?  Are these the kinds of programs that he thinks are 
wasteful and ought to be eliminated? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has he heard about the prime minister's advisory committee on 
science and technology, a group of particularly talented 
Canadians who advise wisely on science, innovation and technology 
so that we can make the very best decisions possible in terms of 
policy options and in terms of pursuing strategic initiatives and 
additional partnerships?  Does he want to cut that too?  Does he 
consider that wasteful?  Is that an insensitive way to spend 
money?  I am surprised he did not talk about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk a bit about another key theme that I suspect 
might have been discussed by the Reform Party:  expanding 
opportunities in aboriginal communities. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know we must improve opportunities for aboriginal communities. 
We all know that, in the vast majority of cases, their financial 
situation is extremely difficult. While Canadians may take 
infrastructures for granted, such infrastructures are non-existent on a 
number of reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, is this the type of programs the hon. member feels we should 
eliminate to further reduce the deficit and the debt? Is this what he

goals—

become stronger and healthier. 
We are working to further their progress toward achieving

what most Canadians want for their aboriginal brothers and

develop a long term comprehensive plan of action and partnership 
with aboriginal leaders and people throughout Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all realize opposition members are here to oppose, and I 
suppose some would say to criticize.  I hope it would be to 
critique insightfully and sensitively a document such as the 
Speech from the Throne and say “Here are the initiatives we 
think are pretty sound.  Here are other initiatives the 
government may want to consider.  Here is how to improve them”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, we do not hear a positive word from any one of them.  Why is 
that?  Why?  I hear from the opposition ranks that it is because 
they are the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my colleagues want to say some positive things about the 
Speech from the Throne, about the prime minister or about my 
colleagues on this side of the House, we will not ask them to sit 
down because they happen to be in the opposition.  I give them an 
iron clad guarantee.  I have not checked with my colleagues but I 
suspect I could get unanimous approval. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  We are here to oppose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:</B>   One colleagues has just said 
that they are here to oppose.  They are here to say whatever it 
is that comes to mind whether it makes any sense or not.  I 
suppose that is the basic assumption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another notion is that the government is there to protect no 
matter what.  Let us deal with what is being said about some of 
the things we have done.  I do not know if these people have any 
political affiliation.  Let me put on my glasses because I would 
not want to misquote and thereby cause some real serious 
disruption on the opposition side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the Speech from the Throne Tim Reid, president of the 
Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We applaud the achievement of getting to a balanced budget, but 
the risk is that we underplay the threat of the massive debt. The 
government really should be setting targets to reduce the debt to 
GDP ratio.

</I></B></P><P align=left>William Leggett, president of Queen's University, said the 
following on the scholarship fund: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an important initiative.  I hope that this leadership will 
be followed by the provinces. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not heard a whole lot about that.  It is a marvellous 
submission for the next millennium.  They should have stood and 
applauded, not congratulated the government if that made them 
feel a little queasy.   They could have congratulated one another 
for standing up unanimously in support of a program that will be 
good for young Canadians today, tomorrow and for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What were some of the headlines following the Speech from the 
Throne?  “Federal Liberals to create scholarship fund, a good 
initiative” was one in the <I>Globe and Mail</I>.  “A billion 
dollars for brains” was another in the Ottawa <I>Sun</I> on 
September 25, 1997. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the <I>Journal de Montréal </I>of September 25, one could read this: 
“Chrétien on the front line” and “Ottawa to create large scholarship 
fund”.  There are several such headlines because it is seen as quite a 
creative initiative. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“A $1 billion scholarship fund to help low income students” 
was in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>.  Again it is mentioned.  It has 
been mentioned time and time again, and there has not been one 
positive comment from members of the opposition.  I say shame on 
the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not all that has been said.  I go on to quote Tom 
Brzustowksi, president of the Natural Sciences and Engineering 
Research Council: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be doing all that we can to attract the best and the 
brightest of graduate studies in science and engineering, because 
the future prosperity and well-being of Canadians will depend to 
a very large extent on their efforts. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Bingo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:</B>   I heard somebody say “bingo”. 
I hope that person will jump up and include that as part of his 
speech.  Finally somebody over there is agreeing with a 
government initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go on very briefly.  I want to share another quote.  It is 
from Toronto <I>Star</I> columnist David Crane and reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will take more than government programs to build an innovation 
culture in Canada.  But government can provide strong leadership 
and encouragement by providing funding—and incentives—to 
stimulate and encourage the innovation process.

to say positive things about the government and what it has done.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the opposition do?  The first opportunity it gets to 
show that it could be comprehensive, sensitive and respond as a 
totally responsible opposition it tries to pretend that the 
government has been irresponsible.  It tries to pretend that the 
spending is not appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would love to send this over to my opposition colleagues.  It 
is a compilation of selected quotes on Liberal fiscal policy 
which I have collected:  “Martin has accomplished several 
important things.  He showed that the Liberals are able to 
balance a chequebook”.  They go on to discuss the budget. This 
is so good and I am terribly sorry I do not have the time to read 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other is a compilation of selected quotes on Reform's fiscal 
policies and this is even better.  “The package, fresh start, is 
infuriatingly vague on identifying specific spending cuts and 
their timing.  Like Bob Dole, Manning runs the risk of a 
credibility gap on the deficit”. I have several others and I am 
terribly sorry that I have to stop my remarks now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
congratulations to you on your appointment as Acting Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate my hon. opponent from across the 
way.  He is a great speaker.  He creates beautiful word pictures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is in this country a program called technology 
partnerships Canada.  Its predecessor was called DIPP.  This son 
of DIP took about $150 million of the money that had been 
allocated under DIPP, so the original purpose of TPC could not be 
met on those grounds alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder whether the hon. member could tell us how much of the 
moneys that were handed out under DIPP have been repaid, at what 
rate and what is the interest that has been repaid to the 
government.  One of the conditions under that program was that 
some of the money was to be returned. That is fiscal 
responsibility.  Could he tell us? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:</B>  Madam Speaker, if my colleague 
had given me notice of the question ahead of time, I could have 
been very specific.  I will get the information for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that a substantial portion has been repaid.  I know that 
there have been in some instances rather interesting interest 
rates. However, I will get the specific details for him. I hope 
that my colleague is not saying that if it was not all repaid 
that it was a total failure. What is my colleague saying? That is 
what I am trying to get at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know, Madam Speaker, that you and my other colleagues are very 
much interested in what is behind the question.  If the hon. 
member really wanted to know those interest rates and if he 
really wanted to know the exact portion—and he is a very clever 
colleague—he would have given that question to me in writing and 
he would have known that I would have had the answer for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My suspicion is that there is something behind it.  I think he 
is trying to say that the Reform Party does not agree that the 
government ought to have such a program; that the Reform Party 
does not believe we ought to be assisting high tech companies, 
small and medium size companies to go forth and produce products 
which can be sold in Canada and throughout the world.  That is 
what I think is happening. 
<P><A NAME="LINK65"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
congratulations on your appointment to the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was interested in the comments which the member made regarding 
aboriginal people.  I wonder if the member is aware of the 
situation which is taking place on the Stony reserve in my riding 
and the headlines that are being made regarding various bands 
throughout Alberta taking over administrative buildings and 
making a plea for help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have watched the people on this reserve for 30 years.  They 
have gone from a lucrative, active bunch of people to living in 
conditions today which are absolutely deplorable.  Yet we hear 
the member going on and on about the wonderful things his 
government has done for aboriginal people. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1335"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if he is aware of the deplorable conditions on this 
reserve in my riding. I wonder if he is aware of the fact that 
the average level of education for these people is about grade 
six.  I wonder if he is aware of the 70 percent to 90 percent unemployment.  Is 
he aware of the high alcohol and drug addiction problems?  Is he 
aware of any of these things as he continually stands in his 
place and brags about the wonderful things they have accomplished 
for the aboriginals as things steadily get worse?  These people 
are asking for help through demonstrations and other measures and 
they are getting no answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member aware of the fact that unless we make it possible 
for the aboriginal people to sustain themselves, we cannot talk 
about them being independent?  How can we talk about them being 
independent when we do not give them any opportunities?  When is 
this government going to explain to me how it can possibly spend 
$116,000 for a committee on seniors and sexuality and do nothing 
for these people?  What is he talking about? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will not make 
comment about seniors and sexuality because that could be 
particularly sensitive, but I will talk about what I said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said that one of the initiatives we mentioned in the Speech 
from the Throne is the expansion of opportunities in aboriginal 
communities.  The point I was making and which I found 
surprising, in spite of a number of comments from journalists in 
television, radio and print, not one of those things was 
mentioned by one of my colleagues in the opposition.  That is the 
point I was making. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course we recognize there are problems but unlike the Reform 
Party, we are not into magic or simple solutions that will go 
forth and resolve complex problems.  That is why I said that we 
want to see aboriginal communities become stronger and healthier. 
We are working to further their progress toward achieving 
self-government, well-being and economic independence. We are 
ready and willing to work with all interested parties to develop 
a long term comprehensive plan of action in partnership with 
aboriginal leaders and people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That member must not for one moment suggest that his party has 
even close to the amount of support and credibility that we have 
with the aboriginal people. It is not perfect but we have gone a 
long way.  I would hope that my colleague would join us in trying 
to help as opposed to trying to solely embarrass the government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to 
congratulate the member for Saint Boniface for exposing to this 
House the confusion that reigns on the other side.  I also want 
to thank him very much for coming to visit the school children in 
my riding in his capacity as secretary of state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the member to share with this House in his 
capacity as secretary of state what he feels are the major 
priorities for himself in that capacity and what he wants to do 
for the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I welcome the 
question.  I mentioned before and I will stress again that it is 
generally recognized that unless Canadians invest substantially 
in science, innovation and technology, we cannot continue to be 
leaders.  We will automatically become followers. It is also 
accepted that while there are a number of Canadians who are 
sympathetic, appreciative and understanding of what science, 
innovation and technology can do, there are many many others who 
do not. I will try to explain. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Science, innovation and technology can help improve the quality of 
life of Canadians everywhere in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Not everywhere in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:</B>  Yes, including Quebec.  We have a 
different vision.  For me, Canada is also Quebec, dear colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, what I would like to do, with help, I hope, from a few 
colleagues, even from my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois, is to talk 
frankly about what we can do together to ensure that science, innovation 
and technology can help us meet the great challenges facing our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, for example, we look at the challenges facing Canada today, we 
see no magic answers coming from science and technology, but we see some 
answers, whether with respect to poverty or improving the health care 
system. 
I would like us to be able to debate serious issues such as that one, 
and there are others.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing I would like to do, and this is in reply to my

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make sure that research, science and innovation get 
their fair share of the budget.  This is one of the soundest 
investments that we can make for job creation and for our young 
people who are graduating.  We have any number of programs that 
are there to ensure that young Canadians who graduate from any 
number of disciplines can have internships that will permit them 
to hold and refine the skills they have polished over the years. 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a great honour to address you in this House for the first 
time.  I have listened closely to the throne speech and the 
various statements from the members of this House.  My most 
recent experience was that of an average Canadian rather than 
that of a lifelong politician. I am encouraged by the process, 
the skill and the passion of members of this House in exercising 
their duties to their constituents and our fellow Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased to see in the throne speech that there was some 
recognition given to the impact which the technological 
revolution and the information age is having on our society and 
the world.  These pressures are pervasive in all walks of life. 
The impact of these new technologies is changing the way we 
relate to one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and distance restrictions to communication have been almost 
eliminated.  Information and entertainment choices are exploding. 
Ideas and opportunities fill the information highway and they are 
constantly increasing. This creativity is pushing the highway to 
new limits in a demand driven expansion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians understand that this is a global phenomenon.  It is a 
pervasive backdrop constantly present as we enter the 21st 
century.  No effective barrier can be erected to separate oneself 
from its impact, not on a personal level, not provincially and 
most certainly not nationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The information and communication explosion can only be embraced 
and allowed to shape itself in a manner which meets the needs of 
Canadians in order to realize the great potential that it offers. 
The shaping and application of these information technologies 
will best serve Canadians if we each have input into the process 
through an open, and to use an oft repeated word from the throne 
speech, and innovative marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A government attempting to package and overmanage how Canadians 
participate in a global information explosion will at best 
deliver very costly, mediocre results.  In the throne speech 
there seemed to be some recognition of the need to allow 
Canadians to participate more fully in a global information age. 
As the Leader of the Official Opposition might say, there seemed 
to be some bone there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately when I look at the actions of this government 
there appears to be a cancer in this particular bone.  It is the 
cancer of the heavily bureaucratic and excessive control tactics 
of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications 
Commission, the CRTC. Here is another government body whose 
actions have the exact opposite effect to the fine sounding words 
of the throne speech.  Say one thing, do another, that is what it 
looks like to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech calls for innovation and stimulation of the 
entrepreneurial spirit in Canada.  Meanwhile that commission, the 
CRTC, has an implied stated agenda to create large players and 
protect these large players from competition.  Those 
entrepreneurial innovators who have the intestinal fortitude to 
apply for a licence or approval will be forced to play in a game 
where the rules are frequently changed.  But you only find that 
out after you have lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The entrepreneurs the government says it wants to help have been 
required to spend up to $1 million to complete this regulatory 
marathon and submit literally thousands of pages demanded by the 
application process.  Then they are told “We do not think your 
ideas will work, so you will not get a chance to try them”. 
After being kicked in the stomach a few times like this, the 
smart players say “No more, thanks”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CRTC does this in pursuit of what it calls sustainable 
competition. 
The innovators dragged through this process have come to 
recognize that sustainable competition really means 
market control through government selection and restriction.

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what is meant by the new term creative partnerships. 
Those chosen as partners will be the blessed ones and the 
entrepreneurial interests of others will be left at a competitive 
disadvantage.  This does not serve the best interests of Canadian 
consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The approach of the CRTC scares away quality entrepreneurs and 
risk takers which this government states it wants to attract. The 
result of this approach is that government selected information 
networks and broadcasters appear to be chosen more because of 
lobby efforts and who you know instead of the energy and 
innovation they bring to the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech makes reference to the government's intention 
to promote trade in Canadian culture and support Canadian culture 
at home.  Again, it is difficult to believe this when due to the 
inaction of regulatory delays over the past years, 300,000 
Canadians who wanted direct to home satellite service chose to 
access the only service available at the time via the grey 
market.  Now it seems that the CRTC culture police want to treat 
them as criminals even before the courts have made a final 
ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government says it wants to support Canadian culture.  Its 
commission approves a <I>Playboy</I> channel and disallows a faith 
channel which was clearly desired by a number of Canadians.  All 
of this while publicly demanding Canadian content and diversity 
in programming.  It seems like more of the say one thing, do 
another approach of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think Canadians want the CRTC making these decisions 
for us based on the CRTC's own political and ideological biases. 
The cultural engineering approach of the CRTC selects winners and 
losers rather than allowing Canadian consumers to have the 
benefit of a truly competitive marketplace.  Such a marketplace 
would provide the information products Canadians want with the 
best service for the least cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as leisure suits and lava lamps have had their day, and I 
got rid of mine, their contemporary, the CRTC, must also be 
re-examined for its relevance and desirability.  It is now doing 
more harm than good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see that the actions of the CRTC and its cultural police 
conflict with the stated goals of this government to facilitate 
innovation and entrepreneurship.  We see that the costs to 
business, consumers and taxpayers are excessive and unnecessary. 
We see that under the guise of protecting Canadian culture, it is 
attempting to define and impose it.  In addition, it pours 
regulatory cold water on the information highway's 
entrepreneurial flame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see that with the reality of today, the current CRTC is 
obsolete.  It costs far too much and delivers far too little. The 
time is long overdue to move away from protectionist policies and 
toward those that allow Canadian products to compete in the 
global market.  We only protect what is weak.  That which is 
strong can be promoted.  In the right regulatory and business 
environment, Canadians have no need to fear global competition. 
Control and manipulation by government is what we should fear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the government to listen to industry and consumers and 
remove excessive bureaucracy and the regulatory quagmire within 
the communications industry so that Canadians can set the 
standard for the world during the communications century. 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is ironic that the hon. member for Medicine Hat is asking the 
House to condemn the government for an election promise when that 
is what it was and indeed the people of Canada saw fit to elect 
the government on that basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Canada have rewarded the Liberal record and have 
chosen to reaffirm their trust.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was very clearly stated in the platform.  We are moving 
toward the time when the budget will finally be balanced, the 
debt to GDP ratio will be declining and the government will have 
a fiscal surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we reach that time we will allocate every billion dollars 
of fiscal dividend so that one half will go to a combination of 
reducing taxes and reducing the national debt, and one half will 
address social and economic needs through program expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was very clear to me door to door, coffee party after coffee 
party and all-candidate meeting after all-candidate meeting that 
the specifics of the plan, a 50:50 division of any future 
surpluses, were hugely reassuring to Canadians, particularly those 
of us in Ontario where the savage government cuts and an 
unaffordable tax cut are negatively affecting people every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Canada have clearly demonstrated that they 
respected and trusted the commitments of the finance minister, 
continued prudent management and staying the course on restoring 
Canada's fiscal health. They were eloquently stated by the 
finance minister in the February budget and then reinforced again 
and again throughout the election campaign.  The people of Canada 
have been consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Canada spoke loudly on June 2 and now we as a 
government must get on and do what we said we would do.  The 
Liberal government has said that we would meet or exceed deficit 
targets, and we will.  We would impose no new taxes and no new 
spending cuts, and we will not. We promised that we would address 
economic and social priorities through selected tax cuts, and we 
will honour that promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thankfully, and with the support of Canadians, that is not all 
that is on our agenda, unlike the honourable opposition.  We 
promised to create conditions favourable for private sector job 
creation and to invest for immediate jobs in growth, in 
infrastructure, trade, youth employment, labour market training, 
payroll tax deduction, tourism, rural Canada and small business. 
We have already begun on a number of these. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are counting on us to continue our investment in 
higher education and skills development and to proceed with our 
investment in technological innovation through the proposed 
Canada foundation for innovation which John Polanyi endorsed 
totally in his remarks to the Nobel laureates on Sunday night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians understood that the tough decision had to be made in 
the first Liberal mandate in order to get our fiscal house back 
in order.  They understood that as long as interest payments were 
a significant amount in each budget, it was impossible for 
government to provide to the people of Canada value for their tax 
dollars.  We could not afford the deficit and the ballooning 
effect on the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After this Canadian miracle, as economists around the world 
refer to this unprecedented success, it is totally insulting and 
inexcusable that the member for Medicine Hat can pretend it never 
happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can he ignore the miraculous turnaround of an economy that 
had been called an economic basket case?  This is a great 
Canadian success story, the record and commitments to decrease 
the debt, decrease taxes and reduce unemployment.  I believe this 
Liberal government will honour those commitments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also clear that the people of Canada voted to reinvest in 
building a stronger society, an increased ability to look after 
those less fortunate.  That government can and should play a 
positive role in the lives of Canadians.  They voted for improved 
health care delivery, they voted for support for children's 
health programs, they voted to increase the child tax benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They voted for new and better support for the disabled and they 
voted for increasing support for charitable giving.  They voted 
and knew they were voting for 50 percent of every future surplus going 
back into strategic reinvestments and programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know there will be a need to seek more input.  I expect it 
and Canadians expect it.  This government is no stranger to 
consultation.  I need only point out the unprecedented work of 
the Minister of Finance and his department in the annual 
prebudget consultations.  They were wide ranging and inclusive 
and provided Canadians the opportunity to have input into the 
priorities of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to consult in the manner that Canadians have 
come to expect and appreciate from this Liberal government.  We 
will seek input on where targeted reinvestments should be and how 
to divide between tax relief and debt retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some suggestions may indeed be hard to assign.  For example, 
does a child tax credit go under the tax relief column or the 
children's program column?  This example also serves to point out 
the kind of narrow anti-government argument Reform members are 
prepared to engage in rather than the substantive of where should 
government be involved in bettering the lives and prospects of 
our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The optimal size of government cannot be arbitrarily determined. 
We must see what partnerships are possible and then see what we 
can do to be the catalyst to help get the job done.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian values are inherently those articulated by the Minister 
of Finance in his 1997 budget address.  Let us never come to 
believe there is such a thing as a tolerable level of child 
poverty or that the growing gap between the rich and the poor is 
ever acceptable.  Let us never forget the debt we owe to our 
seniors and that there be no stone unturned in the quest for 
jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe Canadians just want us to get on and do the right 
thing.  We are at an exciting time.  Corporations are learning 
that social marketing is good for business.  The third sector is 
coming on line to help better determine the gaps and duplications 
and become more accountable.  The unions are joining in projects 
and partnerships that are tremendous examples of what can be 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government has a vision shared by Canadians, when we 
are convinced that we have the right things to do, only then can 
we set the goals and then go about achieving them with innovation 
and partnerships to ensure they happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>SchoolNet is an excellent example.  We know it is imperative 
that all schools and Canadian school children be on line by the 
year 2000.  By setting this goal and enlisting the co-operation 
of the pioneers, those wonderful retired telephone workers who 
have already refurbished cast-off computers from government and 
the private sector, today we have placed over 40,000 computers 
into the classrooms of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's motion is just another rather transparent attempt to 
camouflage the meanspirited, survival of the fittest Reform 
ideology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know this type of consultation being sought by the Reform 
Party needs to meet only with the Canadian taxpayers federation 
and its leader in waiting, Stephen Harper, to be told that the 
total surplus should be put into arbitrary tax reductions with 
nothing being invested into Canada and into the types of programs 
Canadians want and deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no vision in the Reform Party's narrow agenda. Rhetoric 
about taxation levels without regard for the inclusion of the 
best health care system in the world is dishonest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians understand that Americans pay less tax but they also 
understand that 30 percent of Americans cannot afford to go to the 
doctor.  My patients, when they go to the United States, 
understand too when asked to write a cheque for $10,000 for their 
health care insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protection of our health care system is imperative for all 
Canadians.  Confidence in high quality health care is paramount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 2 Canadians chose the balanced Liberal approach.  They 
were offered an immediate tax cut and they declined.  They were 
offered two tier medicine and they declined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member in his remarks scolded the government for not 
taking responsibility for the debt.  I suggest that the people of 
Canada recognized and rewarded the Liberal plan of achieving a 
balanced budget before considering irresponsible tax cuts that 
could risk increasing the deficit and the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Voters preferred our more responsible approach and saw through 
the Reform Party's irresponsible tax cut promise before the 
budget was balanced.  It is totally irresponsible for a 
government to artificially determine optimal government size and 
taxation levels and then, in order to achieve it, drop the ball 
and allow those least able to fend for themselves to try and get 
by. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen those results in Ontario.  The arbitrary welfare 
cuts have Harris hookers on the streets.  Reckless cuts to 
hospitals are now being documented in the Ivy School of Business 
as a serious loss of quality, all to pay for their arbitrary 30 percent 
tax cut.  They have no vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As John Wright from Angus Reid has said, the tax cutter 
bus has ended up an express bus with no destination.  I believe 
the people of Canada expect from this government continued 
prudent fiscal management.  I believe they expect us to do 
what we said we would do, to put the GDP to debt ratio on a 
permanent downward trend—

<P><A NAME="LINK104"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, one of the disturbing things about the government's 
approach to national unity is that it always seems to be lagging 
rather than leading public opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to the last referendum the government seriously misread 
the discontent and the demand for change in Quebec.  Recently it 
demonstrated a dangerous misreading of public opinion in British 
Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the Prime Minister lagging rather than leading public 
opinion on the national unity issue? 
<P><A NAME="LINK105"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, national unity is a very important issue for Canada. 
Some people will always raise some regional frustrations that 
exists in parts of Canada, but it is important to look at the 
whole situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had some problems this summer, for example, with the treaty 
on fisheries.  I was frustrated too.  The President of the United 
States was very frustrated because he had to have the consent of 
35 people before he could agree to a deal.  This is a treaty that 
was signed when the party of Senator Carney was in power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course we are trying to find a solution but it is not easy. 
<P><A NAME="LINK106"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the prime minister missed the point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week Premier Bouchard dared the prime minister to consult 
Quebeckers on the Calgary declaration.  We urged the federal 
government to mail a letter containing that declaration to every 
Quebecker.  Again the prime minister dragged his feet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is so hard about mailing a letter?  You get the envelope, 
you get the letter and you put the letter together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the prime minister become proactive on the unity issue, 
starting with a firm commitment today to mail the Calgary 
declaration to every household in Quebec? 
<P><A NAME="LINK107"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I remember that in January 1996 we sent a statement to 
the people of Quebec explaining what had been done in the House 
of Commons.  The Reform Party complained that we were spending 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he wants us to send something we will consider it, but before 
sending it I would like to see exactly what is happening in the 
provinces as they consult before deciding. 
<P><A NAME="LINK108"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the prime minister is doing it again.  He is hedging, he 
is lagging, he is dragging his feet just like before the last 
referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Brian Mulroney damaged the national unity effort by his 
arrogance.  This prime minister hurts the cause by his apathy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is that hard to make a decision to mail a letter to 
Quebec, how can Canadians expect him to make the hard decisions 
required to unite this country?

the Speech from the Throne of 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We got out of mining.  We got out of forestry.  We got out of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Liberal 
government has known for months that Lucien Bouchard was going to 
France to get support for Quebec sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is always a step behind.  It refuses to be 
proactive.  Has the Prime Minister even talked to President 
Chirac in the last 24 hours?  If so, what did the president say? 
<P><A NAME="LINK111"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I looked at the statement made by the official spokesman 
of the Government of France.  The lady said that there was no 
intervention and no intention of intervening and that the 
question was purely hypothetical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today there was a statement by Prime Minister Jospin that was 
very clear.  I have discussed the problem many times with 
President Chirac.  He knows it is a Canadian problem that will be 
solved by the Canadian people and not by the French government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK112"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, that just 
proves the point we are trying to make.  The government is not 
prepared to deal with the Canadian unity battle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A foreign leader rolls out the red carpet and the government 
does nothing.  Why is the government always dropping the ball

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I made my views very clear.  I can cite for the hon. 
member what Prime Minister Jospin said today: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It depends on developments that may or may not occur and that 
are subject to the free decision of Quebeckers, their political 
authorities, and the appraisal of Canada, its political 
authorities, whether France will be asking this type of question. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They recognize that it is a Canadian problem and that they will 
have to respect the views of the Canadian government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs said that the 
Canadian government could have made the same remarks as France 
regarding Quebec's sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the Prime Minister tell us today whether he shares his 
minister's opinion, and are we to understand from this remark 
that the federal government would also respect a democratic vote 
by the Quebec people in favour of sovereignty? 
<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Quebeckers have already voted democratically on two occasions and 
decided to remain in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the Bloc Quebecois respect the voice of democracy, 
even in response to an unclear question?  What we want is a 
debate about a clear question, not a winning question, but a 
question that is truthful. When Quebeckers know that, by voting 
for sovereignty, they will be leaving Canada, they change their 
minds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we are asking is that the question be clear, and we will take 
steps to see that it is. 
<P><A NAME="LINK116"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to know whether the Prime Minister has just told us he 
intends to bypass the National Assembly, when there has been a unanimous 
and clear resolution by the National Assembly that the Quebec people 
should be able to decide on its own future itself?  And this resolution 
was supported not just by sovereignists, but also by the federalists in 
Quebec's Liberal Party, including the member for Bourassa, who is in the 
House today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK117"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday, when asked by a journalist: “Would France 
bypass the Canadian government and recognize Quebec as being 
independent?”, the premier replied:  “That is a detail”.  This 
detail is the key to the whole question.

<A HREF="#LINKT53"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And to this question, the French Prime Minister, yesterday and 
this morning, replied:  “France is not indifferent, but does not 
wish to interfere.  If Quebec is allowed freedom of expression, 
then Canada must also have the freedom to make up its mind. 
These questions must be asked in Quebec, and more broadly in 
Canada”. He even added:  “A simple majority is not a principle, 
but democracy is”. 
<P><A NAME="LINK118"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs is trying to play down the significance of the 
statements made by the President and the Prime Minister of France, who 
very clearly indicated they would respect whatever decision Quebecers 
made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. Are 
we to understand that he would expect France to sit back and act as if 
nothing had happened should the federal government arbitrarily reject 
the result of a democratic vote held in Quebec? 
<P><A NAME="LINK119"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the root of the problem is that a provincial government does not have 
the authority to proclaim itself the government of a sovereign state. 
That has never been done. States have always recognized that the 
government of the existing state had its say in the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I had more time, but I know you would interrupt me, I would give 
you a whole list of statements made by the French government in other 
circumstances involving other parts of the world. Here is one, for 
example, about Chechnya, which says: “This is an internal affair that 
concerns the Russian Federation, of which Chechnya is an integral part 
under international law”. Regarding the Comoros: “France strongly 
believes in respecting the territorial integrity of any and all African 
states”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And the list goes on. 
<P><A NAME="LINK120"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, are we to 
understand from what the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs has said 
that, as far as he is concerned, Ottawa is home to the international 
standard of democracy and, therefore, every country in the world should 
consider that democracy in Ottawa is better than democracy in Quebec? 
<P><A NAME="LINK121"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this is getting annoying. One cannot have a special set of rules for 
Canada that do not apply to other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is an independent state, recognized as such by the United 
Nations, and it has the same rights as other countries. I can quote, for 
instance, the Helsinki declaration, which states that “Participating 
states shall respect the principle of the equality in law of peoples and 
their right to self-determination, by acting at any given time in 
accordance with the goals and objectives of the Charter of the United 
Nations”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that the right to secede exists only in a colonial 
context. Secession is not a right within a democracy.

question is for the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tuition fees for students have skyrocketed and are now higher in 
Canada than in the U.S.A.  The average debt load for graduating 
students is predicted to be $25,000.  Students are graduating 
into poverty.  The government's new fund will not help 90 percent 
of the students who need financial assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the government sit down with students and others to 
find real solutions to lead us to an accessible post-secondary 
educational system? 
<P><A NAME="LINK124"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member's question is 
very important.  We as a government are very concerned with the 
situation of student tuition fees and debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are working with the provinces, students and lenders.  There 
were some measures in the finance minister's budget last year 
which provided for improvement to RRSPs and savings that parents 
could do for their children.  In the Speech from the Throne we 
have again committed the government to continuing to reduce the 
barriers to post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are doing it with the provinces and with the lenders as well 
as we can. 
<P><A NAME="LINK125"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
government clearly does not understand the depth of the problem. 
What is needed is a real solution to ensure that tuition fees no 
longer exclude students without deep pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the government commit to working with the provinces to make 
accessibility a new national standard for higher education?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is not up to me to 
determine the tuition fees in the provinces.  The government of 
Canada is already meeting about 60 percent to 65 percent of the 
cost of students in the universities and colleges through the 
transfer payments in this country.  We are already going a long 
way to do what we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the debt is concerned, we are working with the 
provinces and the lenders to find solutions that will be adequate 
as soon as possible to assist the students because we are very

<P><A NAME="LINK128"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
throne speech set out the government's agenda for this session of 
Parliament.  In it the government claims to be committed to 
“developing the brains and skills of our people to ensure that 
no Canadian is left behind as the country moves forward. 
Education and training are key to this new economy and job 
opportunities”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the minister of human resources.  How are 
Newfoundlanders expected to participate in this new economy when 
his department in Newfoundland is completely devoid of any funds 
for the rest of this fiscal year?  Will the minister find the 
additional funds required to make sure that Newfoundlanders have 
equal and fair access to training and that they will not be left 
behind? 
<P><A NAME="LINK129"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B>   Mr. Speaker, our government is very 
committed to all Canadians' having a fair opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not accept the claim that Newfoundland will be left behind 
by this government which has been standing very well for all 
regions of the country.  We are investing a lot more money in 
transitional job funds in Newfoundland than anything that was 
done before.  We are doing a lot more in Newfoundland through the 
transfer payments as well. We are the ones who are fighting very 
hard to maintain an equilibrium in this country in favour of 
Newfoundland and the other maritime provinces. 
<P><A NAME="LINK130"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the minister's answer is simply not good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Newfoundland we have the highest level of unemployment and 
therefore the highest requirement for training.  If the minister 
cannot find additional funds in his department, which he refused 
to answer, will he then access the $12.8 billion in workers funds 
in the EI surplus account?  Does the minister not find it 
embarrassing to have to tell so many citizens who have so much 
need that they cannot access training programs simply because of 
a shortage of money while he is sitting on $12.8 billion of their 
money. 
<P><A NAME="LINK131"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know very well that the 
Tories cannot understand that the EI account can have a surplus. 
It is something they never had and can not understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We managed the situation in this country quite differently and 
we are fiscally responsible and we corrected the mess their 
administration had made.  From the EI fund we are putting quite a 
lot of money into transitional job funding which is quite high in 
the regions where the levels of unemployment are higher. We 
invest more money in our youth programs as well.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, when 
Alberta moved into a surplus position the first thing it did was 
survey the public in Alberta to find out what it wanted to do. 
The people said pay down the debt. But not this government.  It 
will consult people about what to put on the $2 coin but not on 
how to spend the 75 billion $2 coins that taxpayers have to send 
in every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Alberta is not afraid of going to the people to find out what 
they want to do with the surplus, why is this government afraid 
to do that? 
<P><A NAME="LINK134"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
remind the hon. member that if he is a part of the finance 
committee then he will be going across the country consulting 
with the people on that very question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even more to the point, the government went to the people, who 
spoke in the last election. 
<P><A NAME="LINK135"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Government of Alberta consulted the people, got their message and 
then went to the people in an election and got a bigger mandate. 
This government actually had its mandate diminished.  I think the 
minister could find a stronger point to hang his argument on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One line in the throne speech on debt reduction and tax relief 
and 20 pages on spending increases and no consultation. Why will 
the minister not admit that the real reason he will not consult 
is that he is not sure he will get the answer he wants? 
<P><A NAME="LINK136"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the fact is we did consult during the election 
campaign. We actually think that an election campaign is when 
Canadians should be consulted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing is that there will be be extensive 
consultations by the finance committee and I hope the hon. member 
is part of it.  The prime minister and the government have set 
out the rules of thumb on how it thinks the surplus should be 
dealt with.

extraordinary work accomplished by hundreds of voluntary agencies

the support of Canada, in particular the Department of Human Resources 
Development. They are our partners and we are very proud of that.

<P><A NAME="LINK198"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise 
on a question of privilege in regard to a very grave matter 
relating to information that I sought from officials at the 
Department of Indian and Northern Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A certain official at the Department of Indian and Northern 
Affairs, Mr. Jobin, deliberately misled me and subsequently 
deliberately denied me information.  I will argue that the sum of 
these two deliberate acts constitute a contempt of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 16, 1980, a Speaker made a ruling in regard to 
information to which a member of Parliament was entitled.  The 
Speaker said:  “It would be bold to suggest that no circumstance 
could ever exist for a prima facie question of privilege to be 
made where there was a deliberate attempt to deny answers to an 
hon. member”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Speaker in 1978 ruled a matter to be prima facie case of 
contempt where the RCMP were alleged to have deliberately misled 
a minister of the crown and the member for Northumberland—Durham 
resulting in “an attempt to obstruct the House by offering 
misleading information”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 16, I was invited to a meeting with Mr. Jobin to 
receive a progress report on the Stony reserve in my riding.  I 
brought along with me to the meeting citizens of the Stony 
reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one point in the meeting I was asked to leave by Mr. Jobin 
because he claimed that I was not entitled to certain information 
that he offered to the citizens attending.  While there was 
unanimous written support for me to receive this information by 
the applicants in attendance, I was made to leave by Mr. Jobin.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The regulations from the department regarding information 
release, referred to by Mr. Jobin, state that information may be 
released if written consent is obtained from the applicant, which 
I had received. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The regulations also contain several circumstances where 
information can be released without consent. Point four on the 
form states one of those circumstances as “to a member of 
Parliament”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had both the authority as a member of Parliament and the 
written consent of the applicants to receive this information. 
Mr. Jobin deliberately misled and deliberately withheld the 
information from me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I requested this meeting to obtain information which is directly 
related to the preparation of a question which I need to ask the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development on behalf of 
the citizens of the Stony reserve.  I have given notice to the 
minister of my intention to ask such a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Joseph Maingot's <I>Parliamentary Privilege in Canada</I>, on 
page 71 states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the events necessarily incidental to petitions, questions, and 
notices of motions in Parliament—are all events which are part 
of the “proceedings of Parliament.” 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On page 72 there is a quote from the report of the Select 
Committee on the Official Secrets Act of 1939 which states that 
“a proceeding in Parliament covers both the asking of a question 
and the giving written notice of such a question”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, I have given the minister written notice 
of such a question and, unfortunately, I am afraid that I may not 
have the information necessary to follow through with this 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to address the issue of ministerial 
responsibility.  I draw your attention, Mr. Speaker, to a 
Speaker's ruling of November 9, 1978, at page 966 of <I>Hansard</I>. 
The then Speaker said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—I do not think there is procedural significance to the doctrine 
of ministerial responsibility, it appears that we are now 
embarking on a different course in having the House, through a 
question of privilege, reach around the minister and examine 
directly the conduct of an official—it seems to me are 
probably not procedural matters— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker did not consider ministerial responsibility a 
consideration when he determined there was a prima facie question 
of privilege in 1979.  There is no procedural significance in 
this case either, Mr. Speaker, and I ask that you consider my 
points accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I ask that you review these matters and if you find 
there is a prima facie question of privilege I am prepared to 
move the appropriate motion.  It is difficult and literally 
impossible when you do not get the co-operation of the 
departments to be able to assist the constituents of your own 
riding, in this case the residents of the Stony reserve. 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise in support of my colleague from Wild Rose. The official 
named, in my view, is in contempt of Parliament for his actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Erskine May's 21st edition describes contempt as: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—any act or omission which obstructs or impedes either House of 
Parliament in the performance of its functions, or which 
obstructs or impedes any Member or officer of such House in the 
discharge of his duty, or which has a tendency, directly or 
indirectly, to produce such results may be treated as contempt, 
even though there is no precedent for the offence. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members we do not always expect enthusiastic co-operation 
from ministers and those who serve them, but when an official 
deliberately misleads a member of Parliament with some bogus rule 
and as a result of that act deliberately withholds information, 
it is a clear contempt of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is imperative that members of Parliament have the confidence 
to perform their duties with accurate information which is not 
deliberately misleading or deliberately withheld from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I join with the hon. member for Wild Rose and ask that you 
consider this very serious matter.  I look forward to your 
ruling.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have listened to the facts 
which have been brought before the House by both hon. members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has no intention to participate in any way in an 
act which would constitute the contempt of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, my suggestion to you, respectfully, would be as 
follows.  Given that the minister is temporarily out of the 
House, I would suggest that she be able to examine what has been 
stated by the hon. member opposite and respond tomorrow in the 
House of Commons, or at a later time.  At that point perhaps you, 
Mr. Speaker, would want to rule then whether or not there has 
been an instance of contempt, as opposed to simply a 
misunderstanding by someone who may or who may not have committed 
a mistake.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This would not unduly delay anything, given the fact that the 
parliamentary committee on procedure, privilege and elections has 
barely been constituted for 24 hours.  I would suspect that it 
probably would not be able to hear the case for a few days and 
waiting until tomorrow would not unduly delay any proceeding or 
attempt to find out what is the truth.  All of us want that to 
eventually come out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps Mr. Speaker would want to accept this suggestion and, if 
so, render a ruling tomorrow or later.  At that time we will have 
had an opportunity to listen to information that could be brought 
to this House by the minister responsible for the department in 
question. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the intervention of the House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate also that the minister will get back to us 
promptly.  The way the House leader put it is a little 
open-ended, which is tomorrow or at some later date.  The first 
opportunity, I would assume, will be in the next day or so, not 
on the Order Paper for the foreseeable future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  As you can see I, too, have just been 
apprised of this matter.  You will note that the words “to 
deliberately mislead” were used quite a few times and that I did 
not intercede because I wanted to hear the whole reason for 
bringing this point up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to get a little more information.  If I could ask 
the indulgence of the hon. member for Wild Rose, I would like to 
hear something from the minister who is involved.  Maybe there is 
an explanation.  I do not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will reserve judgment until I hear from the minister, but as 
the hon. whip of the Reform Party mentioned, I would encourage 
the government House leader to see to it that the minister is 
here to respond at the earliest possible moment.  And that is 
precisely what I mean, the earliest possible moment.  I do not 
want this dragged out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will endeavour to do 
precisely that, to have the minister address this as soon as 
possible, hopefully within the next 24 hours or so. In any case, 
it will be as soon as possible, and there will not be a delay, I 
can assure you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  We now have an undertaking from the leader of 
the Government in the House.  I will reserve my decision until I 
and you hear what the minister would have to add to this 
particular case.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
on June 2 Canadians were consulted.  The voters clearly preferred

</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know and as we have experienced in Ontario, this leaves 
those less able to, to go and fend for themselves.  We feel this 
every day in Ontario:  a mission of tax cuts; smaller government; 
survival of the fittest; no positive role for government; knee 
jerk, simplistic approaches; black and white with no shades of 
grey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians expect us to do what we said we would do.  We will put 
the debt to GDP ratio on a permanent downward trend.  We will 
balance the budget by 1998-99.  They expect us to demonstrate 
vision and values.  They expect us to be innovative and to find 
and build partnerships.  They also expect us to reinvest in a 
stronger society.  We said we would and we will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As said in the Speech from the Throne, it is our responsibility 
to ensure that no Canadian is left behind as the country moves 
forward.  We can do this without financial risk.  We can do it in 
a balanced way set forth in the election platform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has made tremendous strides while continuing to 
adhere to five basic principles:  controlling government spending 
rather than increasing taxes, fairness so that no one is left 
behind, enhanced economic prospects and job growth, and frugality 
with a commitment to decrease waste in government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also made a promise to shift resources from lower 
priorities to higher priorities knowing there is no new money 
until the budget is balanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish we could do this without having to listen to inaccurate 
Reform rhetoric and truncated history lessons that leave out the 
four critical years of stunningly successful fiscal management. 
Members of the official opposition keep talking about shell 
games.  I dare them to go and pick up all the shells at once. 
They will be disappointed.  There is not a tax and spend Liberal 
to be found. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians will be consulted, but we will consult on how we 
deliver our promise and not whether.  We have committed 50 
percent of any surplus to reinvestments in building a stronger 
society. Canadians are counting on us, especially those less well 
off. The prime minister said “It is a nice problem to 
contemplate this surplus.  It is a proud moment for Canada, not a 
time for partisan jealously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion must be defeated and the government congratulated, 
not condemned, for its practical and doable election promise.

understands as a physician that it is very important not only to 
treat the symptom of a decease but the actual root of the

</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem we have with unemployment is that over the last many 
years we have devoted billions of dollars toward the problem of 
training people for employment and we still have abnormally high 
unemployment rates.  Will the member acknowledge that one of the 
keys to dealing with the problem is to lower taxes so we have a 
greater demand for all the people who have been trained? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Carolyn Bennett:</B>  Madam Speaker, there is no question 
one of the root causes of the ongoing demand for health care will 
be the determinants, jobs being one of them.

We actually have to realize that our ultimate success is a net 
cost.  There is some gain and some loss, and we know we are not 
there yet.  We would love to be able to put more efforts into 
training.  We are excited by the kinds of programs we see.

hon. member be prepared to meet with her Minister of Finance to 
explain to him that instead of keeping the contributions to the

which generates surpluses which will top $7 billion this year, 
reduction would in fact create employment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the hon. member prepared to take such a step, since 
employment appears to be something she considers important? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Carolyn Bennett:</B>  Madam Speaker, all of us in the 
Liberal caucus are consulted and are prepared to meet with 
ministers on everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We already have a tremendous example of consultation.  I know 
the people I spoke with during the election campaign, the people 
who have the risk of potentially being unemployed.  As much as we 
are creating jobs, there are other people being laid off.  We 
need to be able to promise people who may potentially be laid off 
through future downsizing that they will be secure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The underwriters feel the amount in the EI fund is appropriate. 
Similarly in my profession the medical protective association is 
being accused of having too big a surplus in its fund.  We have 
to deal with the experts.  We need to have appropriate and 
realistic reservoirs for the future.  We cannot put Canadians at 
risk, in particular those who may face losing their jobs.

It is a very good question for people of means.  It is not very 
good question for people who do not have means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we continue to compare our taxation rate to that of the 
United States, it is a comparison of apples and oranges when 30 
percent of people cannot afford to go to a doctor.  Some of my 
patients who go south of the border have to write a cheque for 
$10,000 for health insurance.  They do not see us as being 
particularly overtaxed.  Those who cannot afford the $10,000 for 
insurance are forced to take the American approach of being 
western gambler pioneers and run without any health insurance and 
then eventually lose their homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extraordinarily important to understand that two plus two 
does not make five.  As a group we can do much better for those 
who have less than they can do on their own.  Some 150 years ago 
we said we would try to look after one another.  We have to do 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want value for their tax money.  By decreasing the

they need them, particularly health care.

the next chapter for us to reinvest in medical research, science 
and technology.  The innovation fund is one of the most exciting 
things stated in the election platform and in the budget.  To 
hear John Polanyi on Sunday night talk about the reverence with 
which he holds that fund was truly heartening to me as a Liberal 
member of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Scientists understand that we will do the right thing.  I do not 
think tax cuts have any relevance.  In Ontario there is no 
evidence that tax cuts work.  We know that most companies locate 
here because of the quality of our health care program, 
particularly companies in the service industries trying to pay 
health insurance premiums for their employees.  That is bad for 
business.  The companies with lots of employees love to go to 
places that have good, inexpensive health care and a good 
government funded health care insurance program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be exciting when we start choosing where to reinvest. 
Obviously I will be fighting for job creation with investments in 
medical research, science and technology.  We should be debating 
where to reinvest, not whether to reinvest as the member's motion 
states.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Resuming debate. Because 
of the miscue before question period, 10 minutes of debate was 
taken away from the Reform Party.  We will correct the mistake at 
this point. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
believe the person who will be correcting that will be the third 
in line in this segment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to recognize the presence in the gallery of some 
constituents from North Vancouver, Mr. and Mrs. McKenzie.  I 
welcome them to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  I would remind members today that we are 
debating a Reform motion which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the government for making their 50/50 
election promise on any future surpluses without adequate public 
debate as to the optimal size of government, taxes and debt, thus 
threatening to repeat Canada's 27 year old history of 
irresponsible spending, creating high debt, financed by high 
taxes, causing high unemployment. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not difficult to see the reasons why we would propose such 
a motion in the House.  There is plenty of evidence out there 
among ordinary average Canadian taxpayers that they are very 
dissatisfied with any suggestion that government would increase 
its spending at this point in the cycle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>Financial Post</I> did a poll of Canadian CEOs and average 
taxpayers in September.  This poll was published in the 
<I>Financial Post</I> on September 27.  I can give members a couple of 
examples from this poll. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Peggy Witte of Royal Oak Mines stated in answer to questions 
that Royal Oak Mines left Canada because of the high Canadian 
taxes which made it difficult to attract top-notch talent to fill 
positions in the company within Canada.  I know that Peggy 
Witte's company, Royal Oak Mines, is certainly not the only one 
that has deserted our province because of high taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where I live in Vancouver, we are very close to the United 
States border.  There are something like 30,000 Canadians who 
have business interests just across the border in Bellingham and 
Blaine. Many thousands of Canadians go to work every day just 
across the border because there is a lower tax climate there both 
at the corporate and personal levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was not just CEOs though who responded to the poll and 
indicated that they were dissatisfied with tax levels.  Among 
average taxpayers, a vast majority favoured tax reductions and by 
28:1 they favoured cuts in personal income taxes. It is not 
difficult to see why they would favour cuts in personal income 
taxes when we look at an article that was printed in the 
Vancouver <I>Sun</I> on September 18 and sent to me by a constituent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The article shows Canadian household savings are on the decline. 
Canadians are saving much less than ever before and mainly 
because since 1980 the government's share of personal income has 
gone from 17 percent to over 25 percent.  The government has 
increased its take from personal incomes by 8 percent just since 
1980. As a result, people have far less savings.  In fact the 
graphs, which I cannot show to members, show that personal 
savings have dropped dramatically as taxes have increased 
dramatically since the early 1980s.  At this point the savings 
rate is running at about 1 percent.  That is a full 9 percent 
lower than it was just a decade ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course income taxes as we know were supposed to be a 
temporary tax.  I mentioned to members yesterday that I had a 
folder full of things that constituents had sent to me over the 
summer that they would surely hear about as we went on through 
the business of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another clipping here sent by a constituent who wanted 
me to remember that September 20 marked the 80th anniversary of 
the birth of the income tax in Canada.  It preceded today's 
income tax.  It received royal assent on September 20, 1917.  It 
was supposed to be a temporary measure which would be reversed 
once the war was over.  I think we are still in a bit of a war 
but now it is to try to battle back those who want to spend other 
people's money.  They certainly throw it around very freely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Trevor Roote in my riding was a bit outraged when 
bureaucrats at the GST collection department said that they were 
losing revenue because of the exemptions for groceries, drugs and 
medical devices.  He really objects to the way that bureaucrats 
say they are losing tax revenues because of exemptions.  He said 
that it was only through the permission of the people that they 
can have these tax revenues.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Really, it is quite outrageous that the government treats this 
as if it were a business income to which it has a right for some 
sort of service that it provides. I realize there are many 
services that the government provides which we all agree are 
necessary and essential but there is a tremendous amount of 
government waste.  Some of it was mentioned today during question 
period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure many members have seen the headline on the front page 
of an edition of the <I>Hill Times</I>:  “Pork barrel politics: 
Bagmen, old college buddies and riding association presidents all 
benefited from Liberal largesse collecting plum government 
appointments last month”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were some examples:  Gilles Champagne will sit as a member 
of the Canada Post board of governors.  The three-year 
appointment which was approved by cabinet on September 24 pays a 
$600 per diem and a $7,000 annual retainer.  The Liberal Party 
director in Quebec knows Mr. Champagne from their fundraising 
work together and he described him as a good Liberal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals for example made another appointment in the heart 
of Bloc Quebecois country.  Mr. Frappier, who is the son of a 
Liberal appointed judge, was given a plum position there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bryan Williams, a lawyer in the Vancouver area, a long time 
Liberal supporter, was named chief justice of the Supreme Court 
of British Columbia last month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a whole slew of examples even in the <I>Hill Times</I> 
and many of these examples find their way into the mainstream 
press.  We read about them regularly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think some of us will remember members who were not re-elected 
to this House.  Geoff Regan, whom I remember, represented Halifax 
West.  I mentioned to him at one time that his failure to 
represent his constituents on an issue would probably come back 
to haunt him. I see now though that not satisfied with the 
taxpayers' decision to throw Mr. Regan out of office, the 
government has appointed him senior assistant in the federal 
ministerial regional office located in Halifax, the executive 
suite where the ministers go to powder their noses.  Mr. Regan 
landed on his feet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course we remember Mary Clancy and how many times in this 
House she criticized the United States, how she slammed the 
Americans.  And where is she now?  She is in Boston in a 
patronage position at the embassy.  Imagine Mary Clancy as an 
ambassador for Canada.  Can you imagine that?  The person who 
condemned the United States constantly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one area of waste, but there are many others such as the 
federal-provincial infrastructure program of course, which Reform 
criticized because much of it went to pork barrel politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are the results of a questionnaire that was sent out to 
all members of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business a 
couple of months ago asking whether there should be a renewed 
federal-provincial infrastructure program. Of those who replied 
Canada wide 49 percent said no.  These are business people answering 
these questions about the way tax dollars should be spent. 
Forty-nine per cent Canada wide and fifty-six per cent in B.C. 
said “Don't use our tax dollars on these pork barrel 
federal-provincial arrangements”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we think about it, what a silly way to raise taxes for 
local infrastructure.  We tax workers in B.C., transfer their 
money to Ottawa where it gets shuffled around by the bureaucrats 
and then it gets dumped into a program for infrastructure and 
gets sent back to B.C. again where it gets shuffled around and 
handed out under the grants program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We probably if we are lucky get back 50 cents on every dollar to 
actually spend on the infrastructure.  It would have been better 
for the local government body closest to the taxpayer to be 
responsible for collecting that money in the first place and 
spending it on the infrastructure directly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the minister for multiculturalism today in question period 
said how carefully she screens the grants to multiculturalism 
groups and how they never waste any money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was an example in British Columbia which I wish I could 
have brought up for the minister at the time, the Canadian 
Association to Fight Racism, which of course has a wonderfully 
politically correct name.  No one would ever dare suggest that 
maybe it is doing something wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That organization had failed to file its papers with Victoria 
for three years in a row.  It got struck off the register.  It 
was still collecting money from the minister of multiculturalism 
when it had no mandate and no legal authority to exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the sorts of things that go on constantly with our 
taxpayers' money. I could go on.  I have a big stack of stuff 
here that I could go through for all these examples of waste, one 
which all the members in this House would have got about a week 
ago.

parliamentary session, $41,000 down the drain again, asking us 
whether we think there should be more women in Parliament and 
what we should do to arrange that. It is the voters who decide 
who will be in Parliament, not us.  What a waste of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish I could spend a half a day talking about this absolute 
pile of waste, but I know that members opposite are bursting to 
ask me questions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
congratulations to you on your appointment as Acting Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for North Vancouver for his comments.  I 
find it somewhat ironic that the member opposite often stands in 
the House to talk about the very excellent public policies of New 
Zealand.  I gather the member is originally from New Zealand.  I 
find it somewhat ironic in the sense that in New Zealand it was a 
labour government which was elected a number of years ago to 
clean up the fiscal mess which the previous conservative 
government had created.  It was the labour government which 
introduced a number of privatization measures and caused the New 
Zealand economy to revive and avoid the country going into 
bankruptcy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what the member's affiliation was when he was 
living in New Zealand.  It is rather irrelevant.  However, I 
think it is ironic that he stands in the House ad nauseam to rave 
about the excellent public policies in New Zealand when we know 
that country has experienced some of its own challenges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to turn to the subject of the GST. The GST was introduced 
by the Conservative government in the eighties.  When it was 
introduced, my understanding is that the government consulted 
widely with New Zealand to learn better from the mistakes of that 
country particularly in terms of the rate, how the rate was set, 
what kind of coverage the GST had and what kind of exemptions 
were made.  It was a Conservative government which looked very 
closely at the New Zealand model in order to learn from that 
experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the member could comment on the New Zealand 
experience with its GST, or whatever it is called in New Zealand. 
He might have some wisdom to share with the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Madam Speaker, I do apologize to the 
member for going on ad nauseam about New Zealand, but now he has 
asked me a whole bunch of questions about it so I guess I will 
have to do it again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I would mention that in New Zealand the type of 
government he is calling a conservative government which was in 
power just before the crisis was reached was known as the 
National Party.  However by North American standards, all 
governments in New Zealand were socialist.  When I lived there I 
thought the National Party was a progressive conservative style 
of government, but it was not really; it was socialist and I soon 
learned that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were all tax and spend governments.  They were the first 
with a welfare state in the world.  They really set the stage for 
the total collapse of a welfare state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes the Labour Party which took power had to clean up the mess 
because within a few days of taking power, those investors who 
had been prepared to buy government bonds deserted en masse. The 
New Zealand government ran out of international currencies within 
a few days of the Labour Party taking office.  Then the World 
Bank stepped in and helped them to recover. As a result of that, 
New Zealand really has found the optimum size of government and 
taxation.  The government is now about 40 percent of the size it 
was in 1983.  The country is functioning better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year New Zealanders were given on average a $200 per month 
income tax reduction.  However, the New Zealand government first 
began to pay down its debt before giving tax relief.  It realized 
that as soon as it started to pay the debt down, the interest 
payments would begin to retract very quickly and there would be 
more money to spend on other programs.  It has actually increased 
spending on social programs by almost $1 billion in the last 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now on the GST, of course the Liberals promised to scrap, 
abolish and get rid of the GST, which they did not do. It is true 
that the PCs asked New Zealand representatives to come here to 
give them advice on how to implement the GST.  The advice was 
ignored.  New Zealand's GST has no exemptions. It was at a lower 
rate across the board.  There were no exemptions at all and they 
urged that if there were to be a GST in Canada, it should be that 
type of GST at a lower rate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From a personal perspective to members, I am not sure that a GST 
could ever be successfully introduced when we have a bordering 
country that does not have such a consumption tax.  It makes it 
very difficult and very competitive.  Perhaps more consideration 
should have been given to that before that style of tax was 
introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member for his questions.  I am sure he will hear a 
bit more about New Zealand from me, but that goes with the 
territory, I guess. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, since this 
is my first formal speech in this 36th Parliament, I would like 
to thank you and congratulate you on your appointment. I would 
also like to express thankfulness to the constituents of Kelowna 
who saw fit to re-elect me, giving me the opportunity to 
represent them in this House.  It is an honour to be able to do 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constituents of Kelowna live in probably one of the most 
beautiful parts of this country.  Some people say there is at 
least one other part of British Columbia that is better than 
that.  It happens to be the place where they live, and of course 
I disagree with that because I think that Kelowna is the absolute 
most beautiful spot in which to live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish at this point to refer back to a question that was asked 
by one of my hon. colleagues from the Conservative Party. I 
unfortunately do not know which constituency he represents.  He 
asked probably one of the most poignant question that has been 
asked on this day in the debate of this particular motion, and 
that question was to the hon. member for St. Paul's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question was did she think that the taxpayer would be able 
to spend money more wisely or would a politician or a bureaucrat 
spend money more wisely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a moment I thought for sure it was one of my Reform 
colleagues because that is exactly the kind of questions we have 
been asking.  We have discovered over and over again that it is 
the taxpayer who is probably in the best position to determine 
how best to spend his dollars.  I am absolutely convinced that is 
true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for St. Paul's could not answer that question. 
She is prepared to take her money and let somebody else spend it 
for her more wisely than she is able to spend it.  I do not 
believe that she even believes that particular answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to get to the substance of this debate.  The substance of 
this debate centers around adequate public debate about what 
should happen after a surplus has been created in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is an absolutely critical point because we believe so 
fervently that it is the people of Canada, the taxpayers, the 
people who voted us into these chairs, who own these chairs, who 
own this House who would say now that we have a surplus, where 
should that money be spent. That is critical and that is really 
what this debate is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to address my remarks pretty well to the business of 
reducing taxes and cutting taxes.  There is a brief reference. 
It is not even a complete sentence.  There is just one tiny 
little phrase in the Speech from the Throne that refers to a cut 
in taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As individuals we are tired of the tax burden that we carry. As 
families, we are tired of the tax burden that we are carrying. It 
does not matter what business person you talk to, it does not 
matter what individual you talk to, whether they are married, 
whether they are senior citizens, every person comes back with 
the answer that their taxes are too high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently I read about an Asian centre that is being built in 
Surrey.  These people are considering that this may be their 
first and only investment until the tax structure changes in 
Canada to do any further development in this country.  That would 
be a very serious blow to that part of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average family today has real problems.  It is spending 
$3,000 less per year—that is all it has—on food, clothing and 
shelter, the very basic things we need.  Families are unable to 
spend that money because it has been taken from them by the 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another point and it has to do directly with the 
individual tax level, the brain drain.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In this part of the country alone, here in Ottawa, recently 11 
scientists out of 17 of that group have moved out of the country, 
most of them to the United States. Why?  The personal tax burden 
is to high and also because there is no money available to 
support the infrastructure necessary to conduct research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two difficulties with the infrastucture. Some of the 
material is worn out and cannot be used anymore and other new 
machines have to be brought in to do some of the more recent 
research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our high tax burden is a very serious detriment to retaining 
strong people.  It is at the point now that in some sectors we 
are missing the skills and the professional ability to carry 
forward the research application that needs to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague from North Vancouver alluded to a survey in 
the <I>Financial Post</I>.  There is a very interesting observation 
here. So many people argue that tax cuts are really not the thing 
that women want to support and that it is something men want to 
support. Women want social programs more than they want tax cuts. 
This is very interesting. There is a marked difference here. 
Women actually supported tax cuts to a greater degree than did 
men.  It would appear that protecting the financial interests of 
families may be more important that protecting government 
abilities to fund programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is very significant. The women have it right. They 
understand what matters. They can spend money very wisely.  They 
think they can spend it more wisely than the government. 
Congratulations.  It is about time we got some balance into this 
society of ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain:</B>   We need more women in Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>   Is that not a wonderful comment, Madam 
Speaker?  You have order in this place and another member said it 
is okay.  I am a man who said the right thing. That is a 
fantastic way to live in this old world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go back to research and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Pretty smooth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Madam Speaker, this is very interesting. 
Now we have another man in on this.  Now we really have a 
balance.  That is what the House is really all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to move into the technology partnerships Canada program. 
This program is supposed to help build innovation, research and 
development in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What is wrong with that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B> There is absolutely nothing wrong with 
that. The only difficulty is the contrast.  Whenever the minister 
makes an announcement, and he has probably made about 40 or 50 
announcements about these various partnership programs, he says 
it is repayable.  Not a subsidy, not a grant, this is a loan or 
an equity position.  It is very interesting that there is 
absolutely no reference to what the provisions of the contract 
are, what the partnership shall actually achieve and what 
schedule there will be of the repayment of the grant, subsidy or 
loan. If it is not to be repaid, if it is an equity position, 
what are the dividends that will be paid on the investment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the contract is a secret one, this does not prove anything. 
There is no accountability here.  That is very serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The DIPP, the defence industry productivity program, went 
essentially to the defence industry. The son of the DIPP, the 
technology partnerships Canada program, is going to exactly the 
same people.  The first $150 million of that was to carry over 
and pay for some of the programs that have not been taken care of 
under the DIPP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is what is going to happen, then we will have a DIPP and 
a TPC program which have not been paid for.  I think we have to 
say that the DIPP has become tipsy.

people can spend money where they want to spend it and spend it 
wisely.  The only way we can find that out is to ask the people 
where they think a surplus should be spent once we have a 
balanced budget and there is extra money in the treasury.  They 
will tell us far better than a bureaucrat or we sitting in this

where this surplus should go.  I find it really encouraging 
actually that the Reform Party has now come to the conclusion 
that the surplus is within sight.  I think we can honestly say 
that just a couple of years ago the Reform Party had very little 
confidence in our ability to manage the fiscal framework of this 
nation.  I am glad to see that today we have basically received 
its endorsement on the basic trajectory or direction that we are 
heading in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the debate on the surplus, I want to say to my 
friend from Kelowna that we will be on opposite sides.  As 
passionately committed as the member is to tax reduction, and I 
have done some work in this area, I am passionately committed to 
making sure that the human capital that has been through a lot of 
suffering, those people at the lower end of the income spectrum 
who have not had a voice in this Chamber for a long time, I am 
going to be with that voice.  I am going to be with that voice to 
make sure the Minister of Finance keeps his commitment that was 
stated during the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was elected in my community, which is a disadvantaged 
community in downtown Toronto, on the basis that we have been 
through a lot of belt tightening.  There have been a lot of cuts. 
There has been a big ratchet on this sort of obsession with the 
deficit and there has to be a dividend to look after the people 
in our community who are the most disadvantaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Tax relief, that is what we are 
talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  No, it is not in a tax cut.  If we 
really had a payday here and we can do both, terrific.  However, 
I want to be on the record that I really think that some very 
important programs have been gutted, and I hate to say this 
because I have been part of a government that was a party to 
this. I feel badly for some of my colleagues who went down in 
Atlantic Canada because the cuts were too severe.  They were 
victims, in my judgment, of extreme cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my own community, and I know the member will believe me when 
I say this, I have human capital, which is a very important thing 
to nurture, training and retraining.  The member talks about the 
brain drain.  One of the reasons we have a brain drain, even in 
the public service, is that we get all upset if we bonus some of 
our most respected senior public servants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the Reform Party, which has been very effective as an 
opposition, has to take a more balanced approach and realize that 
we have to start creating an atmosphere of hope in our public 
service and hope for some of our more disadvantaged.  I hope that 
he would modify his approach somewhat over the next few months.

mutual.  I have a lot of respect for the hon. member opposite. 
The important thing about human capital is what do we want to 
create? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he would read the Beyond a Balanced Budget document the hon. 
member will discover that there will be 1.2 million Canadians who 
will be off the tax roll.  They will have the money that they are 
now paying in taxes.  These are low income people who earn less 
than $30,000 a year.  That is very significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason some of these people do not have jobs is because of 
payroll taxes.  Many business people to whom I have talked, and 
the hon. member is a business man, know only too well how many 
people have not expanded their businesses because of the proposed 
increase in the CPP and employment insurance premiums.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
this is my maiden speech, so I respectfully request the 
co-operation of the members of the House of Commons, particularly 
members of my own party, to keep their heckling to a minimum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank the constituents that elected me and 
placed their confidence in me as their representative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I will speak on the Reform motion and, as a deputy critic

point of the industry department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three large regional development programs, the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency, Western Economic Diversification and the 
Federal Office of Regional Development of Quebec will account for 
nearly $1 billion in government spending in 1997-98. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we analyse the throne speech and dissect such phrases as 
“public-private sector partnerships” we should have a grave 
concern that the Liberals plan to not only continue funding these 
outdated programs, but actually plan to increase the number of 
tax dollars to these programs.  Throwing more taxpayers' dollars 
into regional development programs would be an awful mistake. 
They are inefficient, unaccountable and ultimately they 
represent, to Canadian taxpayers, money pits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us examine what the auditor general had to say in his report 
of November 1995. The auditor general examined these three 
regional economic development programs and what he uncovered did 
not sound good. As a courtesy to the Liberal members who have 
this big government, high spending, high taxation mentality, I 
would like to caution and advise them that they may wish to cover 
their ears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general found that information which the regional 
development programs supplied to him was inaccurate and 
incomplete.  He discovered that the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency had been reporting survey results as actual job creation 
figures. It had no idea about the actual number of jobs created. 
The Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency's rule of thumb is, if 
you do not know it, make it up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile, at the Federal Office of Regional Development in 
Quebec, the auditor general reported that its actions forced the 
closures of two fish plants, but its records showed a net gain of 
250 jobs.  At the Federal Office of Regional Development in 
Quebec the elimination of workers actually led to an increase in 
employment.  I think it is time for a remedial math course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general found that projects had been funded that did 
not require government money.  I guess it does not matter.  You 
fill out the forms, you get the money.  This is taxpayers' money, 
money from ordinary Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not recommend that the big government, high spending, high 
taxation Liberals uncover their ears just yet.  There is more 
they will not want to hear.

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general also found that the regional development 
programs had an inefficient system for determining qualified 
recipients. I guess that does not matter either.  If you apply, 
you get the money, taxpayers' money, money from ordinary Canadian 
families. The auditor general also stated “their objectives are 
not clearly established and performance measuring is inadequate 
so it is impossible to tell if the programs are meeting their 
objectives”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general is not the only one who has harsh words for 
regional development programs.  In November 1996 the Atlantic 
Institute for Market Studies published a book about the effects 
that the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency has had on the 
Atlantic region.  It concluded that over 35 years of regional 
development programs have led to huge economic distortions.  The 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency raised costs of producers, 
slowed private investment and kept unemployment high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This should come as no surprise.  These effects only stand to 
reason.  The government should not be injecting money into the 
private sector.  Wherever this is done an unlevel playing field 
is created.  Someone enjoys a rich government subsidy at the 
expense of others, at the expense of taxpayers and at the expense 
of ordinary Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The institute went on to say that subsidies handed out under the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency provided disincentives to 
work and promoted the expansion of inefficient companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, these regional development programs are subject to 
abuse by pork barrelling politicians.  The Liberals refer to the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency as the MLLM, money for loyal 
Liberal maritimers.  In the past election they were not as loyal 
as the Liberals expected them to be, were they?  This should 
worry us though.  Much of the new increased government spending 
the Liberals are talking about may go back into these regional 
development programs.  Now that the Liberals have lost support 
outside of Ontario, they will see these regional development 
programs as a way to buy back votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals wasted taxpayers' dollars throughout the 35th 
Parliament and now they are promising to waste even more in this 
36th Parliament.  The problem with the Liberals, which comes back 
to regional development, is that they believe government spending 
can create jobs.  They believe that massive job creation programs 
are the solution to the perpetual levels of high unemployment in 
this country.  They do not understand that that approach has been 
tried over and over again.  And guess what?  It does not work. 
It is a waste of taxpayers' dollars, money taken from average 
Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might think they might learn from trial and error, but the 
Liberals just cannot seem to shake their big government, high 
spending, high taxation mentality.  We have endured it for over 
20 years.  Actually that is not quite true.  We endured the 
Conservatives for a portion of that time and they were even 
worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians desperately need tax relief which will in turn spur 
job growth.  It is a win-win situation.  But the Liberals have 
raised taxes 35 times since 1993 and the average family has 
experienced a $3,000 drop in actual income.  The average family 
spent more on taxes than on food, shelter and clothing combined 
in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is approaching a balanced budget but it has not 
been balanced by cutting government overspending.  Instead it has 
been balanced on the backs of taxpayers, Canadian families, and 
their backs are getting really sore.  Trust me, I know because I 
am a chiropractor and the most common complaint I hear in my 
clinic is that taxes are too high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cries for tax relief from Canadian families are dismissed by 
the Liberals.  As long as they are dismissed, unemployment will 
remain unacceptably high.  There is certainly room for government 
spending on such things as education, health care and funding for 
research and development.  Canadians believe that governments can 
play a positive role, but that role does not involve handouts to 
profitable corporations.  It does not involve taxing small 
businesses into bankruptcy and it most certainly does not involve 
scattering public money all over the nation in an attempt to buy 
votes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
hon. member got his wish.  There was not too much heckling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, congratulations on your recent appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would encourage the member over the next four or five years to 
do what is best for his riding, and that is to offer proactive, 
positive comments and suggestions on how we can make Canada 
better.  He should not join the ranks of his fellow Reformers who 
constantly run a negative campaign, such as the one he 
demonstrated in his opening remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past couple of days I have heard my Reform colleagues 
consistently speak of open reform, public involvement, let the 
people make the decisions, referendum, referendum, referendum.  I 
find it a very noble statement to make on the surface.  However, 
I find it somewhat deceiving to make that statement when in fact 
they are suggesting that these referenda have to be somewhat 
selective.  They need to choose which ones should be referenda 
and which should not, which ones need to have public debate and 
which ones do not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member if he is prepared to use that selective 
approach in deciding which ones he feels should have public 
involvement and which ones should not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is rather ironic to hear a 
Liberal member criticizing Reform Party proposals for 
parliamentary reform.  We have led the way in proposing freer 
votes in the House of Commons; member recall, whereby members of 
Parliament would be held accountable to constituents who elected 
them; and asking for referenda on issues of national concern. The 
Liberals have rejected our suggestions for parliamentary reform 
time and time again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me to the point he raised about negative remarks. 
There are no negative remarks coming from members of the Reform 
Party.  We lead the way in providing alternative solutions.  If 
it was not for the Reform Party, the Liberal government, no 
doubt, never would have focused on the deficit.  If it was not 
for us it would not focus on the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want their taxes to be reduced and we are going to 
make sure that is done. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Labour, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to follow up on 
my Liberal colleague's comment about negative comments and the 
negative campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quite concerned.  I think there was a time when some 
Canadians were buying into that type of rhetoric, that kind of 
down talk.  I do not think they are buying into it any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have seen that a Liberal government has taken the country 
from a $42 billion deficit which was left by the Conservative 
Party to a deficit almost zero. In 1993 when I was elected, that 
was a very big concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague in the Reform Party did not say anything about 
the throne speech, about the fact that we have stabilized health 
care funding or about the fact that we have given $850 million in 
a child tax benefit to poor families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He touched a bit on partnerships and private sector funding, but 
he did not talk about all the good that has been done through 
internships and because of the fact that we have created 
internship programs for students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask my hon. colleague if the Reform Party is opposed to 
stable health care funding, to internship programs and to helping 
the poor in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member obviously was 
not listening to my speech.  I said there certainly was room for 
government spending on such things as education, research and 
health care.  That is an exact quote from the text of my speech.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to correct the hon. member on her position 
which seems to say the Liberals have somehow done a good thing 
with health care.  They cut health care funding from $19 billion 
to $10.5 billion.  Now they have brought it back up to $12 
billion and are trying to say that they have increased funding 
for health care.  I think they need a remedial math course along 
with the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just do not understand this thing about negativity.  We 
proposed positive reforms to the criminal justice system and tax 
cuts that will stimulate employment.  On national unity they have 
kept their ears covered.  It is time to uncover them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am a bit 
surprised by the motion today.  The Reform Party is attempting to 
suggest that a balanced approach would be fiscally irresponsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the member for Medicine Hat spoke earlier he talked about 
it being irresponsible spending and that things did not seem to 
improve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought I would start by getting it on the record, in case the 
member for Medicine Hat was not aware, that we will be the first 
government in almost three decades to balance the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the balance means that the government will not bend from 
its pledge to Canadians to invest in the future of our young 
people.  The future of our country calls on us to make 
responsible ongoing investments aimed at improving the 
educational and job prospects of young Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our young people are well prepared and well placed to take 
advantage of the many opportunities arising from our increasingly 
high tech and knowledge based economy, for they are the best 
educated and most adept ever in the use of technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, Canadians are worried about the prospects for 
youth.  A recent poll showed that 91 percent of Canadians were 
concerned about the difficulties facing youth today and 74 
percent of young Canadians said that they expected to have a 
lower standard of living than that of their parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such worries are reinforced by frequent media stories suggesting 
that many young Canadians will face bleak job prospects and will 
be forced to take work that does not enable them to contribute to 
their full potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly these stories have helped to perpetuate myths like the one 
that having a good education does not matter.  That is not true. 
Education matters more than ever today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also believed that the job situation and salaries of youth 
have deteriorated considerably compared to those of previous 
generations.  This is also not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many young Canadians today face very good job prospects, but far 
too many youth face serious challenges which must be addressed. 
That is why one of the first mandates of the government is making 
youth a priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, the government made youth a priority as soon as 
it took office in 1993.  We have already helped by introducing a 
number of initiatives aimed at helping youth.  For instance, the 
youth employment strategy launched in February 1997 will provide 
more than 110,000 young Canadians with the work experience 
opportunities they need to help them get that critical first job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This strategy builds on an investment of approximately $2 
billion in Government of Canada programs for young people.  It 
comes out of the commitment of the Government of Canada to 
address youth employment issues by working in partnership with 
all sectors of the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Guelph just mentioned, we talk about 
internships and mentor programs.  We know those are what the 
youth of the country need and want.  We are just starting.  We 
are at the tip of that program.  There are places to go and room 
to move within it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also moved to improve accessibility to post-secondary 
education by building on initiatives announced in the February 
1997 budget which included improved registered education saving 
plans, increased and expanded education tax measures, extending 
the period of interest relief for graduates having trouble 
repaying their loans, and gearing loan repayment to income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our colleague from Medicine Hat was actually on the finance 
committee with me as we travelled from the west coast to Toronto. 
He heard what the youth who came before us had to say.  They 
talked about having the opportunity for a first job, about having 
the ability to get an education and about having the ability to 
afford an education.  We took action in the 1997 budget and 
addressed it again in the throne speech.  We will continue to 
address the needs of youth as money becomes more available.  That 
is why the 50:50 approach worked, because 50 percent will go into 
social programs including youth where we need it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know what also works.  We know that higher education is the 
key to getting a good job.  We know that the Canada student loans 
program has helped young Canadians to get an education.  We know 
that getting relevant work experience is increasingly important 
to help make the transition from school to work.  We know that a 
variety of services are needed to address the challenges facing 
low skilled and low educated youth to give them a better chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we know that lifelong learning and access to labour 
market information contribute to the long term success of all 
young people.  Knowing what works is just the first step.  What 
really matters is translating this into practical initiatives 
that can make a real difference in the lives of our youth.  The 
Speech from the Throne has done just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our second mandate we will continue to build on what works. 
The Speech from the Throne has renewed the government's 
commitment to youth as a main priority for the second mandate. We 
will continue our efforts to support access to post-secondary 
education and to ease the transition from school to the first 
job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will also address the special needs of disadvantaged youth, 
especially those who face barriers to becoming self-reliant due 
to lower education, low skills or other social and economic 
factors.  These youth often find it difficult getting started in 
the workforce and deserve a better chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians have a stake in meeting these challenges.  No 
single sector could have all the answers.  In the area of new 
partnerships with the provinces, with the private and voluntary 
sectors, and with Canadians the government has made a commitment 
to our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Partnerships work.  We have seen the success firsthand of the 
internship programs undertaken by the private sector.  One good 
example is the career edge initiative which demonstrates the 
private sector's commitment to helping youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal, provincial and territorial governments will also 
continue to address the problem.  First ministers and territorial 
leaders will be working on the issue when they meet this fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must all contribute to helping young people take their 
rightful place in society.  We must also ensure that they have 
access to education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments have a responsibility to ensure the widest possible 
access to learning at all levels.  Working with its partners, the 
Government of Canada will continue to reduce barriers to 
post-secondary education by reforming the Canada student loans 
program, by making it easier for students to repay their student 
loans, by introducing new grants for post-secondary students with 
dependants and by introducing scholarships to promote academic 
excellence for low to moderate incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, just last week the prime minister announced a one 
time investment in learning and knowledge that will form the 
foundation of the most significant millennium projects for young 
Canadians.  Beginning in the year 2000, the Canada millennium 
scholarship endowment fund will reward academic excellence and 
will provide thousands of scholarships for low and moderate 
income Canadians to help them to attend college or university. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will also expand information awareness and guidance related 
to career and job options and the skills required for them.  That 
means ensuring that young Canadians know what education they need 
to get a job in high growth sectors of the economy.  There are 
thousands of unfilled jobs out their because we did not help our 
young people prepare for the demand.  This can, will and must 
end.  We will work to better equip ourselves, our partners, our 
government and Canadians to forecast the needs of our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at my own riding of Essex I know that each day in 
the paper there is a high demand for mould makers and skilled 
trade.  We are still not meeting that growth and demand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other parts of Canada the same thing is happening in the high 
tech industry.  We have to funnel our interests and efforts 
together at all levels of government.  We have to work to ensure 
that all youth in Canada have equal opportunity.  We must also 
ensure that they can make the transition to the workplace.

internships, by extending student summer job programs, by 
sharpening their focus on relevant experience, by building on 
existing exchange programs and by creating a new national career 
mentorship program in partnership with provinces and the private 
sector.  This will give them a better chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As announced in the Speech from the Throne, we will also focus 
on helping youth facing barriers to becoming self-reliant due to 
low education, low skills or other social or economic factors. 
To this end we will bring partners together to create a new 
community based program to assist higher risk youth, including 
aboriginal youth, upgrade literacy and basic work skills, create 
work opportunities and get the help they need from community 
resources.  We will do this in partnership with provinces, 
communities and employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will also seek to address the special needs of aboriginal 
youth through the creation of urban multipurpose aboriginal youth 
centres which will provide a relevant cultural and supportive 
environment capable of encouraging first nations youth to stay in 
school and complete their education and which will offer career 
planning and employment opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investing in young Canadians makes good economic and social 
sense.  The government has from the very beginning made preparing 
young Canadians for the 21st century one of its main priorities. 
As I mentioned, investing in young Canadians makes good economic 
sense.  It helps ensure they will become highly skilled and 
productive workers who can compete and thrive in a demanding 
global economy of the future.  It is good social policy too.

and is better able to contribute to the economic and social 
fabric of his or her community.  Our youth programs are aimed at 
ensuring that the youth of today can make the transition to 
tomorrow, can get access to education, can get experience in the 
workplace and can get a job in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also pleased that the throne speech mentioned that the 
needs of rural Canada would be addressed.  I am looking forward 
to the youth programs being adapted to meet the needs of rural 
Canada to ensure that youth return and work in the communities in 
which they were born and raised and bring the educational skills 
back to help those communities grow and prosper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Speech from the Throne makes clear, the Government of 
Canada intends to do even more by working in partnership with the 
provinces, business and labour, voluntary groups, youth and their 
families to ensure that young Canadians have access to the skills 
and knowledge they need in today's economy.  Federal, provincial 
and territorial governments are working to address the problems 
that face youth.  The first ministers will discuss the issue at 
their meeting this fall, as I mentioned earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commitment is vast because all of us must contribute to 
meeting the challenge, each in our areas of competency.  All 
Canadians have a stake in meeting that challenge successfully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an ambitious yet vital agenda since its success will 
ensure that our youth are prepared for the jobs of the next 
millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call upon all members of the House today to defeat the 
defeatist motion by the member of the opposition.  By doing so we 
will be sending the signal of support for our young people, 
thereby ensuring a prosperous future for our country.  Our young 
people of today are our future of tomorrow.  Our goal is to 
balance the books and then to spend 50 percent on investment in 
people and programs.  I believe this is responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will split our budgetary surpluses on a 50:50 basis over the 
course of our second mandate.  Half will go to investment in 
social and economic priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe that a member on the other side of the House 
would find the youth of today not to be one of those economic and 
social priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other half will go to a combination of tax reductions and 
debt repayment.  Members on the other side talk about how there 
will be no tax reductions.  That has not been decided.  We will 
consult with Canadians as we have in the past.  There has been a 
lot of talk about consultation but the government is the first 
one in many years to consult with Canadians.  The hon. member for 
Medicine Hat has participated in those consultations, in what we 
called prebudget consultations with Canadians.

this fall I assume there will again be consultations with 
Canadians.  They will be asked for their input concerning what 
will happen, the direction of Canada's future and how they want 
the 50:50 ratio to be adapted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They gave us a vote of confidence in the last election in which 
they said to this government “we want you back, we like your 
balanced approach, we respect the fact that there needs to be 
spending on social and economic priorities, we know that there is 
an issue of getting the debt under control and we are concerned 
about the level of taxation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has proven that a balanced record and a balanced 
approach are best for Canada and what guarantee a great future 
for this country.  I cannot believe the member for Medicine Hat 
could put forward today's motion after he sat on the finance 
committee with me as we travelled from Vancouver to Toronto.  He 
also sat in on many meetings in Ottawa.  He listened to the 
Canadians who came before us, in particular young Canadians who 
said they wanted a future in Canada, that they wanted to be a 
priority, that they were looking for investment in that future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I stand here and ask again that everyone defeat this 
motion and send the signal to our young people that they are our 
priority.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would like to ask the member some questions about the aboriginal 
funding initiatives that she mentioned were announced in the 
throne speech.  This is the only area in the last budget to 
receive an increase in funding.  Spending on Indian and northern 
affairs is now more than $6 billion a year which, as someone 
worked out, is the equivalent to $32,000 per annum for every man, 
woman and child in the aboriginal community.  It is quite a lot 
of money already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet in Alberta and northern B.C. in polls that were mainly 
aboriginal the member will probably be surprised to learn that 
the people in those polls voted Reform in the last election.  The 
reason they did that is in a lot of native communities the 
structure of the bands is not very democratic.  As the auditor 
general pointed out, about 20 percent of bands are in financial 
difficulties because they either improperly manage or are 
incapable of managing the money they get. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many rank and file band members recognize this as a problem but 
because there is no democratic structure within the band, it is a 
hierarchical chief system, they have no way of controlling 
expenditures or ensuring they get their share.  I see that on the 
Squamish Indian reserve within my riding.  I get complaints 
from band members there who are shut out of the process, who 
cannot get a home, who are not allowed to open a business, who 
cannot do things because they are not related to the chief, and 
there is no way they will ever get the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member identify any initiative of this government to 
first make sure there are democratic processes in place to make 
sure this money she is talking about will truly get down to the 
end user instead of being given once again to people who perhaps 
are incapable of managing or who improperly manage the money? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Susan Whelan:</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the member's 
comments but I am not sure he heard what I said.  In case he did 
not hear I will repeat for him that I was talking about 
aboriginal youth.  I said we are going to create urban and 
multipurpose aboriginal youth centres to help them provide that 
cultural and supportive environment, to encourage them to stay in 
school in order to complete their education.  We will help by 
offering career planning and employment opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the democracy of bands themselves, there is democracy 
in the elections of their leaders.  I will not comment on that 
because I am not part of that process, nor do I represent an 
aboriginal community per se.  I do know that in Ontario there are 
members who represent large aboriginal areas.  They supported the 
Liberal members on this side.  They returned them to Ottawa.  The 
minister is working very closely with all groups across Canada to 
ensure their needs are met and that they are a priority of this 
government.

from their pockets. They should get that money back.

we don't know how to return it”, well, it must be returned to those

stolen, from the poor, from the most disadvantaged? 
I am asking that the people of Matapédia—Matane get that money 
back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next Tuesday I will be seeing the fishers of Tourelle.  They

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a lot of work to do as a government to ensure that with

toward debt reduction, disadvantaged Canadians benefit at the 
level they deserve. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, if there were 
a family in my riding with an income of about $50,000 a year and 
it was spending $15,000 more than its income, having to borrow on 
credit cards, I think the last thing we would hear that family 
talking about when its borrowing decreased to $5,000 per year was 
where to spend the extra money. It does not have any extra money. 
It is still spending $5,000 a year more than what it is taking 
in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the state of affairs in this country.  The Liberals like 
to pass on to Canadians the myth that their finances are in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to concede, hesitantly, that they have made some 
progress.  They are borrowing less.  That is true, but to try to 
pass that off as economic success and as fiscal responsibility 
is—I cannot use the word.  That is what it is.  It is what I 
cannot say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member what she said in the campaign.

in order, please vote for us, we're great?  Now they are talking 
about spending money.  They have not even heard the question yet. 
What are the needs?  Where do we have to spend the money? 
Instead, they are in advance saying they going to spend 50 
percent of the surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During this Liberal government we went into debt another $100 
billion in the last term of Parliament.  If that does not stop 
then Canadians are doomed.  I want this member's response to that 
and I want that to be a responsible response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Susan Whelan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. 
member's question.  As he knows, we are not borrowing any money 
right now to meet our budgetary requirements.  In fact, we will 
balance the budget no later than the fiscal year 1998-99.  We 
stated that when the books are balanced and when we find 
ourselves in a budgetary surplus then we will split whatever 
budgetary surplus is there 50:50 within our fiscal framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell members what I told my constituents and those people 
who voted in the 1997 campaign in my riding.  I told them that 
this is the first government in 30 years to be able to say we 
will balance the books, and this government will maintain our 
fiscal track record.  At the same time, this government is 
compassionate and recognizes that there are social and economic 
priorities far beyond tax reductions.  We will ensure that all 
Canadians are treated fairly, and I will stand on that record.

Madam Speaker, I wish to advise you that I will be sharing my time

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to be here today, Madam Speaker, and to wish you 
good luck.  I congratulate you on your appointment to your new

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say how proud I am to be the first sovereignist

Saint-Eustache—Sainte-Thérèse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to take the opportunity to thank all the 
voters in my riding who enabled me to be in this House. 
I would especially like to pay tribute to my family and to the 
hundred or so volunteers who worked so hard throughout the 
campaign.  Without their support, the results might have been 
different.  I firmly intend to vigorously defend their interests 
and those of the people of Quebec, whatever their religion, their 
language, their culture or their country of origin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come now to the motion before us.  Like all my colleagues in 
the Bloc Quebecois, I must say I support the government's objective 
of eliminating the federal deficit by the year 2000.  However, I 
disagree totally with its means to this end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifty-four per cent of the cuts were to provincial transfers. 
In the end, thousands of people paid the bill, and the provinces 
bore the political pressure. 
And with this money it has saved on the backs of the provinces, the 
federal government is now going to finance new initiatives in areas of 
provincial jurisdiction, such as literacy, university and hospital 
research infrastructures, etc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our friends across the way have got it all worked out to fool the 
public.  I am not making this up.  The current President of the Treasury 
Board gave it away when he told <I>Le Soleil</I> on March 8, 1996, and I quote: 
“When Bouchard has to make cuts, we in Ottawa will be able to show that 
we have the means to preserve the future of our social programs”.  This 
is nothing but demagoguery, the kind of deceit that hurts the most 
disadvantaged and the workers who foot the bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how we, the Quebec people, have been forced in recent years 
to help lower the federal deficit, to the tune of 72 cents on every 
dollar contributed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all so much trickery, like using the five billion 
dollars—five billion, that is 5,000 million dollars—from the 
employment insurance fund to reduce the federal deficit.  Not 
only has the federal government failed to create the jobs it 
promised in its red book, but it has used the unemployed to 
reduce its deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, by changing the eligibility requirements for 
employment insurance, the federal government is forcing unfortunate 
unemployed workers onto welfare, with no regard for how terribly 
traumatizing this can be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the increase in tax revenues, where does the money come 
from? Certainly not from the wealthy taxpayers who take advantage 
of tax havens, but rather from the middle class, whose tax burden 
is getting heavier and heavier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal approach to putting our fiscal house in order is 
totally unacceptable. Year after year, the squandering of 
billions and billions of dollars by the federal administration is 
denounced in the auditor general's reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, during the election campaign, the Liberals promised they 
would root out waste. Did they deliver on their promise with our 
dear heritage minister's one million flags and the television 
propaganda from all government departments? I wonder how much it 
has cost the government to tell Quebeckers: “We love you. We 
love you”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four years later, the people of Quebec and Canada as well as the 
auditor general are still waiting for this shameful waste to 
stop. But the Minister of Finance is skirting the issue because 
he obviously does not want to cut in that area as he does without 
hesitation in social transfers to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not as if he did not know what the people want. I sent him 
a copy of the August 26, 1997 resolution the City of 
Saint-Eustache sent to the Prime Minister of Canada, informing 
him of its opposition to the federal government's cutting 
transfers to the provinces without reducing taxes by the same 
amount. This resolution comes from the City of Saint-Eustache. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Departmental spending was cut by 9 percent even though, in his 
1995 budget, the Minister of Finance had promised to cut it by 19 
percent. More empty promises! 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are incapable of honouring their commitments, and I 
still wonder just what gives the Minister of Finance cause to 
boast?  Next year's budget surpluses will be attributable to the 
efforts of Quebeckers and the provinces.  It is therefore his 
duty to distribute them equitably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given what I have just said about the government's 
mismanagement, my party and myself consider his announced 50/50 
policy to be a crock. Investing 50 percent of the surpluses in 
social programs and using the other 50 percent to reduce the debt 
and taxes is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this formula, the federal government is perfectly free to 
spend the surpluses in areas of provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have examples already, with the announcement by the Prime 
Minister of a $1 billion merit scholarship fund. 
We must not be fooled.  This $1 billion was taken from cuts in 
transfer payments for higher education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what the taxpayers want. And this is what the government 
must do: first, return $5 billion to the provinces; second, stop 
borrowing wholesale from the employment insurance fund; third, 
lower the rate of contributions to the employment insurance fund; 
fourth, increase the benefits that were drastically reduced in 
1997 under the new employment insurance plan; and fifth, stop all 
intrusion into areas of provincial jurisdiction.

discourse that were inaccurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about the fact that the Liberals have not been able to 
do much about unemployment. Indeed, we are not at a level we 
would like.  However, in 1993 when I was elected a member of 
Parliament, the national unemployment rate was 12 percent.  It is 
now stands at 9 percent and in my riding is at 7 percent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for the hon. member to understand that we all 
have to do our bit to help the unemployment rate and help the 
country.  The Bloc should understand that Quebec is a part of 
Canada and that it is important for it to acknowledge the 
benefits it gets by being a part of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member spoke about cuts in government.  However, he did not 
talk about additional spending in retraining programs by the 
federal government which Quebec enjoys, in literacy, internship 
and mentorship and student programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry that the hon. member from Quebec does not acknowledge 
that Quebec enjoys the money sent to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to also acknowledge the helping hand the 
Saguenay region received during the flood.  Who helped?  It was

the Bloc is creating with the scare of wanting to leave Canada.

opposites attract or what, but I have a question for the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, in fact, the Bloc Quebecois agrees on a 50/50 share of the 
anticipated surplus, I would remind the member that there will be no 
surplus available before the end of the next term of office in four 
years' time, barring an earlier election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron:</B>  Madam Speaker, we simply do not agree with 
the government and it has nothing to do with the 50:50 ratio. It is 
simply a matter of redistributing surplus money equitably, as it should 
be. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B>  Madam Speaker, there is something 
surprising in this debate and in the Speech from the Throne presented by 
this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its throne speech, the government makes a commitment: it is 
as if it was wondering just how it could keep on doing exactly 
the same thing it has been doing for the past 27 years while 
appearing to be doing something new. In other words, to keep on 
spending taxpayers' dollars to make them happy, gain votes, gain 
popularity or score political points at the expense of the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With budget surpluses within reach, the Liberal government is 
wondering if it could not carry on pleasing people, without their 
noticing what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It takes a profoundly irresponsible government to forget, as the 
Liberal government is doing, that, while the deficit could 
apparently be reduced to zero by the year 2000, this government, 
this country is still $600 billion in debt. A zero deficit does 
not mean Canada's debt burden has been made any lighter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this government took office in 1993, the Canadian debt has 
grown by an additional $75 billion. It is one thing to say I now 
have enough money in my pocket to buy groceries, but I will have 
to use some of the money I will save to reduce the debt I 
accumulated over 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But right now, the Liberal government seems to be favouring a 
formula that would once again shift the responsibility onto the 
provinces, which would be left with the dirty job of making cuts 
in health, education and social programs because the federal 
government has apparently decided to use funds earmarked for the 
provinces to repay its debts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it wants to reduce taxes, ensure that social programs benefit 
taxpayers to a greater extent and see the taxpayers' debt at 
every level of government go down, all the federal government has 
to do is give back to the provinces the money it took away from 
them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let the government give back to the provinces the $4.5 billion 
in transfer payments it cut, and the provinces can then maintain 
their social programs.  They can also then cut taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But no.  This is not what the federal government wants, because 
it wants the glory of being the one to give taxpayers the most. 
It wants to give the provinces the thankless job of making the 
cuts, and once they are suitably hated and detested by taxpayers, 
the federal government will ride in as the saviour and say to 
these taxpayers “The federal government, the best and strongest 
government, can now give you what the province denied you or 
deprived you of”.  That is what is hateful about the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This business started years ago.  We need to look back at our 
history.  When the federal government asked the provinces during 
the first world war for the loan of their power to tax directly, 
the provinces agreed to come to the aid of the nation at risk, to 
protect its future.  However, the federal government hung on to 
this power, refusing to give it back to the provinces.  The first 
theft, this country's greatest theft, started then, 
when it took over the power of taxation from the province, 
supposedly on a temporary basis, and never gave it back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the power the federal government is now using against 
the provinces, selling its bill of goods about a strong government 
in Ottawa and a subservient one in the provinces.  No wonder Quebec 
is now thinking of sovereignty, of autonomy.  It is tired of having 
to play the heavy, the one to make the cuts to the taxpayer, while 
the federal government, because of the taxation power the provinces 
have given it to collect taxes in its stead, has equipped itself 
with a tool for making the provinces subservient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transfer payments, which should have been used to share 
the wealth and rebalance the means of meeting the needs of the 
population, are being used far more by the federal government at 
this time to make the provinces subservient to its centralizing 
domination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces, Quebec in particular, are tired of this 
situation.  The government of Quebec wants to be able to tell its 
taxpayers that it is able to meet the needs of social programs, 
education, health, which are its responsibility, provided it has 
the taxes we are paying for that, and not just a portion of them 
with which it can meet some health needs, while the rest of the 
taxes go to the federal government so that it can say that it will 
also meet another part of health needs then leave it to the 
taxpayer to judge which of the two governments is doing a better 
job of fulfilling those responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same taxpayer is paying taxes to two governments at the 
same time.  One too many governments is involved in this, and 
Quebeckers feel that theirs is not the one that is superfluous. 
They pay twice to two institutions, and end up exploited and with 
fewer services than they ought to have. 
Our federal government, with the Liberal Party at its head, ought 
to think first of all of saving money, instead of making more cuts 
and more expenditures, if it wants to have money to spare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently once again, the newspapers have reported—and this 
was really not a new discovery, since the auditor general has been 
saying so since 1993, without the government doing anything about 
it—that the auditor general has spoken out against the fact that 
they are trying to put a new computer program in place for 
processing the old age and income security pensions.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the beginning, it was supposed to cost some $260 million. Four 
years later, the cost has reached $365 million and the computer system 
is still not operational. The people in charge of setting up the system 
are poised to ask a further $150 million to do so, four years later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has not seen fit to wonder whether it was on 
the right track. Are we on the right track with this computer system we 
are having trouble setting up? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine, $500 million for something which initially was supposed to 
cost $260 million. The auditor general has mentioned it in his reports 
a number of times, but the government has done nothing about it. 
This is where money could be saved. This is where the government should 
have saved money instead of cutting transfer payments to the provinces 
to be able to act later on and appear to be a generous big brother, a 
kindly father willing to meet the needs of the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebeckers can see through all that. So do Canadians as a whole. I 
believe maritimers, who also are faced with high unemployment and 
poverty, must be wondering what the federal government is waiting for to 
enter into partnerships with other governments, with the provinces. In 
this case partnership means “Here is the money we collected, take it and 
meet your taxpayers' needs in your areas of jurisdiction provided for in 
the Constitution”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Labour, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, my colleague talked a lot 
about the government having to cut in order to balance the books 
in some way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lately I have read with great interest about a past colleague of 
ours in 1993, when Mr. Bouchard was in this Chamber.  He talked a 
lot about being able to do things magically, being able to 
balance books without having to cut back on services.  I have 
since read an awful lot about the fact that Mr. Bouchard has had 
to make a lot of cutbacks.  He has had to try to balance the 
books.  As I understand it right now, he is falling dramatically 
in the polls.  The support for separation and leaving Canada is 
not a popular concept any more in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member could tell me how he feels about the 
fact that his premier who has left here has had to go on and do 
the very same things to try to balance the books and make a 
better Quebec.  It seems to me that my hon. colleague was 
speaking against the Liberal Party making cuts when in fact the 
premier of Quebec had to leave here to do the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could we have a direct comment on Mr. Bouchard having so much 
difficulty? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin:</B> Madam Speaker, the difficulties of the 
province of Quebec, and of the other provinces as well, arise 
mainly from the fact that it has a revenue shortfall in what it was 
receiving from the federal government in the form of what were 
called transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cuts by the government of Quebec account for 54 percent; 54 
percent of 
the cuts made are the result of transfer payments which are no 
longer coming from the federal government as they did in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not surprising.  It is as if, in a family budget, one 
parent required the other to clothe the children, but cut his or 
her budget in half at the same time. So something would have to be 
cut somewhere. 
Then, when the other parent is unable to meet the children's needs, 
the first one comes along to say “I will get you some fancy shoes 
and clothes, a nice hat, a nice dress”.  So, of course, one of the 
two parents comes out looking good, but he or she has done this 
with the other's money, because only one of them has had to make 
any sacrifices.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did this federal government, which was supposed to be cutting 
departmental spending by 19%, do? The fact is it has cut spending by 
only 9%. That is barely half as much as promised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of making the sacrifices it was supposed to make to reduce 
its deficit, the federal government had the provinces make them, asking 
that they do without the funding they used to receive from the federal 
government in the form of transfer payments. The government asked them 
to do without so it would not have to do without too much itself and 
have fewer cuts to make. No wonder the provinces are experiencing 
difficulties now and having to make cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>See what is going to happen. As one of my colleagues pointed out 
earlier, Mr. Massé made a statement to that effect. At a time when the 
provinces are experiencing difficulties, the federal government is 
blessed with a better than expected income and is about to start playing 
Santa Claus again because there is a provincial election coming in 
Quebec, and because that election will be followed by a referendum. To 
have the taxpayers believe that their future, comfort and security 
depends on it, the federal government will try to start investing again 
in health, education and social assistance, all of which are areas under 
provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the federal government will do. Every time the 
provinces put their fiscal house in order, the federal government steps 
in. The government is responsible for every deficit in the past 30 
years. The provinces also had deficits, but the federal government 
failed to play its role properly. 
That is why today we are speaking in favour of the motion put forward by 
the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not necessarily agree with everything the Reform Party said 
on this issue, but we agree with the principle of distributing 
surpluses, because we want them to be distributed differently and, on 
that basis, we will give our support. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
congratulations to you on occupying that chair.  It is a pretty 
face to see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is my first intervention in the 36th Parliament and I would 
like to thank the people of Durham who graciously have decided to 
send me back to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been debating the Reform motion which refers to the 
returning to the last 27 years of our history.  This is rather 
absurd because the reason we are here today debating the motion 
is the diligence the government has had toward its fiscal agenda 
to reduce the annual deficit. In my lifetime I do not remember 
another finance minister who not only set and met the targets but 
exceeded them.  It is because of the orientation the government 
had toward its fiscal agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems rather absurd to me that the second party is now 
thinking that somehow we are going to change all that again. The 
agenda is very clear in my mind.  We are going to continue to 
keep our fiscal house in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is some room to manoeuvre.  This will be the first year in 
which we do not have any positive net borrowings in the capital 
market to support our annual expenditures.  In future years we 
will be able to reduce not only the deficit but will also make a 
positive contribution toward reducing our outstanding debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the debate because it is very important to question 
what is a fair level of total debt.  At approximately 75 percent 
of our gross domestic product the current level of debt is 
inoperative and must continue to come down.  I believe most 
parties can agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the throne speech clearly talked about tax cuts.  Most 
of us will agree that Canadians are fairly heavily taxed and that 
they are probably entitled to some kind of rate reduction in the 
future. 
The operative word is future.  More important, what is the nature 
of the tax cut?  How is it physically done?

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This whole debate talks about spending.  The motion of the 
Reform Party talks about irresponsible spending as though we all 
know what it is.  According to Reformers all spending, as far as 
I can understand from listening to them, by the government is 
somehow bad.  It is very simple. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very interesting to be in the 36th Parliament because we 
have another group of parliamentarians at this end of the House 
who stand day after day and say that all spending by government 
is good.  It is interesting to sit between these two arguments 
and try to find out what makes any sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time again member after member of the Reform Party says 
that money in the hands of consumers is far better than money in 
the hands of government.   I have heard their speakers suggest 
from time to time that we also live in a period of high consumer 
bankruptcy.  It may actually occur to members that some people in 
society spend too much.  The negative impact is the consumer 
bankruptcies that occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about tax cuts I am very interested in exactly what 
we are talking about.  We are talking about rate reductions.  The 
income tax system in Canada is called a progressive system.  As 
income increases, tax rates also increase.  This is something 
that has been accepted in Canada for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard the Reform Party indicate from time to time that 
everybody should have a flat tax and everybody should pay the 
same.  That is a reallocation of taxes from the wealthy to the 
middle class.  That seems to be part of its agenda as well, 
although I have not heard much about it in this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we start talking about how to direct a tax reduction in a 
progressive taxation system, we have to take into consideration 
that the people who will benefit most are the very wealthy, which 
is why the Reform Party supports that group of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another point missing from the debate.  When we start 
talking about tax cuts and hitting higher income groups more 
efficiently, we do not consider the demographics of our 
population.  Everyone knows that Canada's population is aging. 
Almost a third of our country consists of what we call baby 
boomers, of which they tell me I am on the leading edge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If baby boomers today were given a choice and were told that 
they would be given an extra dollar from taxes, chances are they 
would save if for their retirement.  That is not so bad.  That is 
good because we know we are having trouble with some of our 
retirement programs as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that tax cuts will not necessarily lead to job 
growth.  There is no stimulation in the economy by people who 
simply save and do not go out and spend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, there is a great elasticity.  We may well give 
more money back to people, and well we should.  I believe our 
rates are too high.  However the argument does not follow that 
somehow the economy will be stimulated and jobs will be created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a premier in Ontario who ran a whole election based on 
giving a 30 percent rate reduction across the board.  Of course 
what happened is that most of it went to the same group I am 
talking about, the relatively wealthy, sometimes and often the 
baby boom population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jobs were created although during the period in which he made 
this announcement jobs were lost in Ontario.  Jobs have 
subsequently been created in Ontario, but I suggest that almost 
all jobs creation was created by lower interest rates which are 
directly related to the government's commitment to reducing its 
deficit.  In other words, all rate reductions in the world do not 
stimulate the economy and do not create any new employment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might consider that the same generation of people today, once 
again thinking about investments, are thinking about foreign 
investments.  I have heard members of the Reform Party talk about 
not making Canadians invest in Canada and allowing them to invest 
all over the world.  Essentially the agenda of the Reform Party 
is to promote capital flights:  give them a tax reduction and let 
them take the money out of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people will say that for every billion dollars of direct 
foreign investment in Canada 45,000 new jobs are created. 
Similarly it must follow that for every billion dollars removed 
from our economy 45,000 jobs may well disappear.  The Reform 
Party's agenda may indirectly result in reductions in jobs and 
not the increase Reformers constantly tell us about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a delight to be in this new parliament because we have two 
parties that are diametrically opposed.  I listened to members of 
the NDP who constantly think the simple answer to all our social 
problems is to spend more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a nation we have to spend money wisely and efficiently.  In 
my riding I have a program called CAPC, a federally funded social 
program to assist young teenage parents with a nutritional 
program and prenatal care.  I am proud to say that this coming 
week the program is being expanded in Port Perry in my riding. 
They have expanded it in many communities.  It is amazing that it 
has been done with the same budget it has had for the last five 
years.  More services are being delivered to assist these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot create smart parents.  I do not think everything we do 
will create better parents.  We need people in the communities 
who try to assist these people.  We can help in the delivery of 
the system to assist with child poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud to be part of a government that recognizes the 
importance of some of these building tools and building blocks. I 
am also very proud to be part of a government that recognizes 
there is such a thing as child poverty, especially in working low 
income families.  The government has changed the working income 
supplement to breathe more financial strength into parents who 
are trying to work and at the same time support their young 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the balance we need.  The word spending has been going 
around and around this room the past two or three days. What is 
missing from the debate is that there is a difference between 
consumption and investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give a definition.  To consume is simply that we pay out 
the money and it is gone tomorrow.  Some people might say that 
seniors are entitled to their old age pension cheques.  When they 
get the money in their hands they usually spend it and the money 
is gone.  There is no money coming back into the economic system. 
We owe these people the support.  They have entered into a trust 
agreement with us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other side of the spending equation is investment.  I heard 
the member for Kelowna talk about investments in the technology 
partnership program.  That program is oriented toward some very 
positive things.  When the money comes back in, all Canadians 
will benefit from it.  The money did not actually disappear.  The 
money is still out in the system and will come back not only in 
its original form but also added to it will be some of the 
benefits of the growth that has actually occurred in the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at government expenditures the problem is that we 
do not think about these two different factors:  the difference 
between investments and consumption.  I am very proud to be part 
of a government that talks in the throne speech about investment 
spending and investment in people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we can solve some of the child poverty problems that 
investment will come back to us.  Those people will be less of a 
threat to our criminal justice system.  More important, they will 
have the tools and the skills to live useful lives.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been very concerned about investment in the 
area of science and technology.  I heard some members opposite 
talk about the fact that many people with technological skills 
were being hired south of the border.  The average master's 
graduate in science and technological earns $45,000 to $50,000 in 
Canada.  In the United States they will earn $65,000 to $70,000. 
That is a great incentive.  Members opposite blame our tax 
system.  There is some relationship between our tax system and 
that of the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect of the economy is that our supply of those 
graduates is very low.  When the supply is low pure economics 
bids up the value of labour.  There is a bidding war.  Similarly 
when there is a shortage in the United States they bid up their 
costs and they are removed from our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have companies in Ottawa such as Newbridge Networks which 
needs 4,000 workers.  It will only hire half of them in Canada. 
Nortel needs 5,000 workers.  At best it can only hire 700 here 
because that is all that is available.  In my own riding Durham 
College has a science and technology program with an enrolment of 
700 students.  The bottom line is that they could all get those 
jobs twice over.  In other words, there is an emerging science 
and technology community which we are not filling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can governments do to invest in their people so that they 
will have the opportunities and that Canada and our standard of 
living will be better for it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud of a government that recognizes this is how the 
economy is evolving.  The throne speech talked about the new 
millennium fund of $1 billion to help low income people who want 
a post-secondary education, hopefully in the areas of science and 
technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very positive statement about how we want to invest. I 
keep coming back to the word invest as opposed to spending. 
Members opposite probably think this is frivolous, that money 
should have been given to higher income groups through rate 
reductions rather than by helping people to get the opportunity 
to better their positions in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As in the previous parliament we have the Canada Foundation for 
Innovation.  I am working with some of my community colleges to 
ensure they can access these funds to build their programs.  They 
have indicated to me that their biggest problem is not having 
enough money to run their programs.  They need more top grade 
scientific equipment to teach their people, to give them the 
skills to become competitive in the 21st century.  I am happy to 
be part of a process that recognizes we have to give these people 
the tools to compete in the new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time as we have this problem going on, we are going 
through a process of studying our immigration laws that satiate 
some of the demand of high tech companies in Canada.  In this 
labour market the total immigrant population in 1990 was 1,900. 
By 1996 the figure was 6,600.  These people were brought in from 
other countries because we did not have the skills to fill these 
jobs.  It is very important that we as a government take the 
initiative to give our people the skills.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I think what is really missing from this debate 
is when somebody stands up and says that spending is bad and tax 
cuts are good. That is a very simplistic argument.  The reality 
is we need to do more investing in people and I am very proud to 
be part of a government that recognizes that.  Yes, we are going 
to reduce the deficit and debt, but at the same time we are not 
going to forget the opportunities and challenges facing our 
people.  We are going to give them the tools to meet the 21st 
century.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to have listened to that speech and yet I am 
terribly disappointed in some of the content of the speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Durham and the hon. member opposite should 
listen more carefully and I would have enjoyed the whole speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was when I began listening with great interest that I began 
to recognize that something did not make sense.  There is a lot 
of stuff that does not make sense in that speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the suggestion was made somehow that people who cut 
taxes do not necessarily increase the employment of people.  I 
would like to refer the member to some statistics that I have put 
together here with certain American states.  In fact, there are 
about 10 of them that have increased taxes in the years between 
1990 and 1995.  During that time period we also have about the 
same number of states that have cut taxes.  We have two groups 
here, one group that increased taxes and another group that 
decreased taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was very interesting to note that for the tax hikers over 
that 10 year period, the total revenue that the states collected 
was increased by 27%. They hiked their taxes in order to 
increase their revenue.  They did by 27%.  The tax cutters 
cut their taxes and their revenues increased 32.6%.  That 
is very interesting. They cut their taxes but increased their 
total revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at job creation. The tax hikers increased 
employment, percentage wise, zero.  The tax cutters over that 
same five year period increased their employment by 10.8 percent. 
That is very significant.  These are not numbers that I made up 
or that somebody manufactured for this speech.  These are numbers 
that exist.  The hon. member can find those numbers himself. They 
are very significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member then suggested that when people get jobs all they do 
is spend the money, suggesting that somehow spending money is a 
bad thing.  Mr. Speaker, I know you are a businessman and I know 
that much of the business you have done in your lifetime has been 
spending dollars that have come from other people.  You, Mr. 
Speaker, have become a wealthy man because you invested that 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member opposite has had exactly the same kind of 
experience.  He has become wealthy because people spent their 
money.  The suggestion that is being made here is that when 
people spend money is disappears.  Investment money comes back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How it is that tax hikers had no increase in jobs but the tax 
cutters had an increase in jobs? Let him explain to us that 
spending actually hurts the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
his question.  Obviously I do not have the statistics that the 
member has before him.  However, I am sure that there is a 
plausible explanation.  I am glad that he used the American 
example because it lets me remind people that this whole agenda 
of the Reform Party is not new.  It was started by Ronald Reagan. 
Basic Reaganomics said that what it was going to do is reduce 
taxes, stimulate demand and get rid of the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The results are, and the member can and look just as easily as I 
can, as the member suggested to me, that the U.S. went to a 
deficit of $1 trillion in that same period of time, almost 
bankrupting that country.  Why is that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Reaganomics they did stimulate demand at that time. The 
stimulation went to foreign imports.  The bottom line is that 
they went out and bought Japanese cars. There were no more jobs 
created and the U.S. deficit went through the ceiling and they 
are still paying for it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the discourse of 
the member for Durham and I was trying to think what it reminded me of. 
I have finally remembered.  It is the same discourse we heard in 1970, 
1971 and 1972 in the early Trudeau years.  It is the same kind of 
discourse we heard then, telling us that the federal government would 
create a just society, that it could spend in all sorts of sectors 
outside its jurisdiction, and that we were going to see that it would be 
able to do it much better than any of the provinces or anyone close to 
the issue and the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is exactly what the present government brings to mind. 
After three and a half years, it has been forced, by a large 
deficit, to retract its promises and to adopt the Reform Party 
platform, just as the Trudeau government borrowed from the NDP 
platform in order to stay in power.  This is exactly the image 
that comes to mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member a question.  In this context, the 
Minister responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development made a wonderful announcement last week  “We are 
going to invest in employment and partnership for young people, 
in community futures development corporations, to set up a 
program to help people start a business, and to hire youth 
advisers”.  This is great for votes, it is very laudable and 
sounds very interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But we now know—we can no longer forget—that in the provinces, 
such as Quebec, structures have already been planned for the strategic 
development of local areas.  The federal government steps in, bringing 
with it further duplication of existing programs:  it creates a new 
program that will do exactly the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that the model that is ultimately going to be offered?  Will 
the citizens of Quebec and Canada once again be told that, now 
that it has turned the screws a little tighter, the federal 
government will again begin to meddle in affairs that do not 
properly concern it? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
his question. The reality is Canada's government has a commitment 
to its youth and the extent to which we take advantage of that, 
no matter what province they live in, is a positive thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a horizons program that takes young people in 
universities who have been educated in the area of export 
development and puts them into small and medium size businesses 
to make those businesses export ready.  There are a number of 
programs that once again take some of those youth with an 
understanding of the information highway and put them into small 
and medium size businesses to empower those businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is talking about duplication and overlap.  I do not 
think, frankly, that there is enough money to go around. The 
problem with good initiatives, whether they be federal or 
provincial, is that there still is not enough money to take up 
the need.  I am sure those students, those young people in 
Quebec, are happy to share in a federal program that has a 
federal initiative and vision about where the country is going in 
the area of science and technology. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
briefly to the issue of Reaganomics, during the Reagan era after 
the U.S. government cut taxes to top marginal rate, employment in 
the U.S. increased by 17 million jobs and revenues doubled.  But 
because of a profligacy in the Congress, the deficit did 
increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's own finance department said in a research paper 
that cutting payroll taxes does create jobs.  It talked about an 
increase in the payroll taxes causing about a 1 percent increase 
in unemployment in this country.  I would invite the hon. member 
to check the numbers from his own finance department to find out 
the horrendous impact that payroll taxes have on job.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will even concede to 
the hon. member that payroll taxes do have an impact on job 
creation.  I wish we could reduce them to a nominal amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality of government funding and government financing is 
that is not possible.  If you want us to stay in the Canada 
pension plan, like all the people in my riding have told me, then 
you have to implement reforms to make that happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about tax reduction, I do not doubt that UI rate 
reductions are going to be on the table.  We have been reducing 
them, by the way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to speak today against 
the Reform motion and that of the Liberal Party.  I also wish to 
thank the constituents and the people of Sackville—Eastern 
Shore, a new riding in Nova Scotia, who elected me and gave me 
their trust and honour and privilege to represent them in this 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is amazing when we hear the Reform and the Liberal Party go 
on and on with their rhetoric. I want to inform them that the 
people of Sackville—Eastern Shore, Nova Scotia elected me to 
come to the House of Commons for political solutions, not 
political interference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They wanted me to come and not only hold the government 
accountable and hold other opposition parties accountable for 
their actions and their responsibilities, but also to work with 
them to find the solutions of today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member for Durham talks about the NDP and our 
policies, I should inform this House that we are the only federal 
party whose parliamentary and constituency staff are organized 
under a collective agreement.  We do not hear anything coming 
from their side on that aspect of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are the Reform and Liberal backbenchers to help us 
eliminate the immigration head tax? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may digress a little, I wish to inform the House that I am 
an immigrant.  My mother and father and six of us moved to this 
country in 1956.  We went from Halifax at pier 21 by train all 
the way to Vancouver.  I want to tell members what my parents 
told me. At the time I was only eight months old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My father was in the Dutch resistance during the war of 1939 to 
1945.  The first person who rescued him out of a POW camp was a 
Canadian.  Because of that, he had a lifelong dream to come to 
Canada.  Because of the closure of the coal mines in the south of 
Holland in 1952, 25,000 families in the south of Holland had to 
literally evacuate the country because there were no 
opportunities at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We came to Canada in 1956.  My father got off the boat at pier 
21 and the first question he asked in his broken English to a 
woman from the Salvation Army who was there to help, along with 
the Red Cross, was where he could get food for eight people for a 
two day journey.  She asked where he was headed. He said 
Vancouver.  She laughed and laughed and of course it was 
contagious and my father started to laugh and laugh as well, not 
knowing what he was laughing about. He did not realize that it 
was a six day journey from Halifax to Vancouver by train. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyway, we got to Vancouver and that Christmas my mother 
received a turkey from her local church group.  She had never 
seen a 20 pound turkey before. Not knowing what to do with it, 
she cut it up in little pieces and fried it up in two huge cast 
iron skillets.  The woman next door who happened to be from 
Quebec and was living in Delta walked in to see how the turkey 
was coming along.  She noticed that this turkey was cut up in 
tiny little pieces and she laughed and laughed.  Of course my 
mother started to laugh as well.  It was quite contagious. This 
woman then took my mother down to the store and got another 
turkey for her and showed her how to cook it properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My parents, in return, invested in Canada by running a group 
home for over 25 years.  For over 25 years I grew up in a group 
home with over 400 children from across the country who were 
runaways, who were abused, from every aspect of life.  My parents 
did that to repay Canada for their lovely entry to this country.

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I say that is because I spoke with my parents the 
other day.  My father is under palliative care.  One of his 
closest friends passed away two months ago waiting for a 
transplant operation.  The hon. member for Durham should 
understand that my parents' laughter is now gone.  The cuts to 
health care have taken away their humour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are the political parties when it comes to health and 
education? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our most valuable resource is our children, and yet we turn 
around and say to people that children with disabilities cannot 
receive proper education because we do not have the money.  We 
have the money to give huge tax breaks to profitable banks and 
corporations. It is simply scandalous that this rhetoric can go 
on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to say a few things about the deficit and the debt and 
what we should do about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Average Canadians are the real heroes in the war against the 
deficit.  They are the ones who should benefit from their 
struggles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interests of big business and Canada's elite cannot be put 
ahead of ordinary Canadians.  The Reform Party and lobby groups, 
such as the Business Council on National Issues, are pressuring 
the government to give further tax breaks to Canada's highest 
income earners and the most successful corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unprecedented government cuts to programs, such as Canada's 
health care and education systems, might have improved the 
government's bottom line, but they have increasingly threatened 
the average Canadian; not only average Canadians who use the 
public services of health and education, but all Canadians who 
have a job; those who are said, from the government lines, lucky 
to have a job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current trend is that Reformers are pushing the Liberals 
into their agenda, away from the previous Tory agenda.  During 
the campaign I liked to say that the Liberals have reformed the 
Tory agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who have worked for 20 or 30 years are now insecure in 
their jobs.  They do not know if they will have a job tomorrow. 
They do not know if they will be able to meet their payments. 
They do not know if they will be able to send their kids to 
college. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I asked the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans if he would 
re-commit to a signed, written contract with the 40,000 fishers 
of Atlantic Canada and Quebec to maintain the income supplement 
program known as TAGS, for the fishers of those areas.  His 
response was that he consulted with those people, in order to 
eliminate the program, for an entire year.  Can I honestly 
believe that he would ask 40,000 fishers “Do you want to lose 
your income for a year?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is simply scandalous that the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans would stand here and tell us that is what he did.  It is 
an absolute scandalous mistruth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>   It's a fish story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  There is more to it than that.  We in New 
Brunswick, Newfoundland and Nova Scotia pay more for postage 
stamps than anywhere else in the country because this government 
introduced the HST.  It bribed, cajoled and did everything it 
could to the Atlantic provinces, and this is what we got stuck 
with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most dreaded tax of all time was the GST.  That was not good 
enough for the Liberals.  They had to throw the HST on people. 
There is HST on children's clothing.  There is HST on 
electricity.  There is HST on home heating oil. There is HST on 
gasoline.  How the heck do the Liberals expect low income earners 
and those on fixed incomes like pensioners to pay for the basic 
necessities of the day to day lifestyle in Nova Scotia, New 
Brunswick and Newfoundland? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is simply scandalous that the hon. member for Durham, with 
the cheerleading crowd from Ontario, and Reform members can stand 
and say that there should be more tax cuts.  Why do they not 
stand in the House and tell the people of Atlantic Canada “Yes, 
we will give you a tax cut.  We will give you a major tax cut on 
the HST”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have a premier who is unelected, Mr. Russell MacLellan. 
He was appointed by the Liberal Party.  He was here in the House 
and signed the agreement implementing the HST.  Now he is back 
there saying to the people, because he may be coming up for a 
byelection soon, that they will re-think the HST.  We are 
encouraging him to re-think it all the way back to the federal 
party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the finance minister is saying “Mr. MacLellan, 
before you can say anything like that you have to come to speak 
to us first”.  His hands will be completely tied because of the 
Liberal agenda, a Liberal agenda which has been pushed and 
controlled by the Reformers.  To us it is simply scandalous that 
this goes on and on.

enough taxes from profitable businesses and corporations that can 
afford to pay their fair share and spread the money around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An elderly gentleman in Cape Breton told me a year ago “Peter, 
money is like manure.  It is only good when it is spread around. 
When it concentrates in one pile you know exactly what it does”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on with this, folks, but I can assure the 
House that Atlantic Canadians will not stand for it any longer. 
Come May the original TAGS program, which was supposed to go to 
May 1999, is going to expire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I remind the House that in the last year we have had people 
in New Brunswick tear-gassed by the Frank McKenna government. 
They were fighting to keep their schools open. We have had Cape 
Breton unionized workers burn down an apartment building because 
they were in distress trying to find jobs.  We had people rocking 
a media bus in Newfoundland because of their desperation for the 
TAGS program and supplement programs of that nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage members of the House to work together to help those 
people in Atlantic Canada because if we do not, come May it is

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan—King—Aurora, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, first I would like to congratulate the hon. member on a 
heartfelt speech, one that raises some very interesting points 
about the direction in which our country is going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also very pleased to find out that the hon. member 
believes that now is the time to engage in serious debate about 
which direction we are going to take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I want to bring to your attention, since the hon. 
member is a new member in this House, that the Liberal government 
has used the consultation method, including prebudget 
consultation meetings, as well as a number of meetings across the 
country on social security review to modernize and restructure 
Canada's social security system.  We have made headway and 
positive change has occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the hon. member if his method of representing his 
constituents will be to hold townhall meetings?  For example, we 
know that in the very near future we will be consulting across 
the country on the next budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member believe that every member of Parliament 
should participate in that process?  We are in a very fortunate 
position in this country today, as a result of the measures and 
the fiscal responsibility exercised by this government, to begin 
to look at new ways and new programs and perhaps a new style of 
economics since we may in fact be heading for the first time in a 
long time toward the elimination of the deficit.  Does the hon. 
member think it is the responsibility of members of Parliament on 
both sides to seek public input on this prebudget consultation 
period and to hear from him where his constituents would like to 
see our government go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his question.  Yes, indeed, I will be holding townhall meetings. 
My goal is to hold at least 50 townhall meetings throughout the 
next four to five years.  Because I have such a large rural and 
urban riding, I think it is my responsibility and that of my 
staff to go out to the communities and speak to them on these 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to have the hon. member understand why I am sitting in 
this House and what gave me the push to get in here.  It was the 
last townhall meeting, the very famous one, where the prime 
minister spoke to a woman from Quebec.  She told the prime 
minister that she had three degrees and was finding it very 
difficult to get a job.  His response was “Well, Madam, you know 
in life some people are lucky, some are not”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second he said that I phoned my provincial secretary and 
asked him to tell me what I had to do to become a candidate in 
the next election so that I could face the prime minister and his 
party and question him on the fact that we do not base our 
society on luck.  We base it on hard work, compassion and 
fairness.

really impressed with the hon. member's speech. I came to this 
country almost 30 years ago and I went through hardships which 
were probably much easier than those of his parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last four years I had an opportunity to travel to 
Europe and the Pacific rim.  Just recently I was an election 
observer in Bosnia.  Last year for the first time I took my 
family to Europe for a vacation and I had the opportunity to meet 
a colleague from my childhood in Frankfurt for breakfast.  For 
the two of us it cost 36 Deutschemarks. The same breakfast could 
probably be bought here for $6. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the hon. member is this.  Does he have a better 
agenda than that of the government?  If he does, why does he not 
tell us?  What I heard from NDP candidates during the election 
campaign was that their agenda was similar to the eastern 
European agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to speak 
on and on.  Yes, we have another agenda.  Perhaps he would like 
to have a copy of it.  It is just one example of our agenda.  By 
all means, the member may come down and talk to us at any time. 
We are at Room 368 of the Confederation Building.  I would be

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would like to begin my speech by thanking the voters of the 
Churchill riding for their support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many know, the riding comprises some four-fifths of 
Manitoba's land mass.  It is home to the Sayisi and the 
Northlands Dene nation, a nation that is still disputing land 
claims north of the 60th parallel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Tadoule still seek compensation for forced 
relocation that almost saw the total destruction of an entire 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our riding is home to Churchill, the polar bear capital and a 
community of citizens such as Penny Rawlings and Robert Penwarden 
who believed in their town and the viability of the port of 
Churchill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a shame that the government of Canada did not have the 
same commitment to the port.  As many of us maintained, the port 
was not utilized to its fullest for years. The port is being used 
now after it was sold to an American company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Churchill riding is home to a number of communities where 
seasonal work is the only way of life. The government's changes 
to employment insurance saw many of the families in these 
communities forced to go on welfare as they did not meet the 
required hours to qualify for EI benefits. Some were only short 
by a few hours. The government should not be proud of this. Many 
people have simply given up looking for work and have been forced 
to go on welfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's cuts in social assistance dollars saw people in 
northern communities who have to pay $11 for four litres of milk 
paid social assistance benefits at the same rate as those down 
south paying $4.04 for milk.  Cuts to health and education have 
seen hospitals short staffed with line-ups for emergency 
services, not enough dialysis machines or not enough trained 
nurses to operate them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At a time when the royal commission on aboriginal people's 
report recommends 10,000 aboriginal health care workers are 
needed, we see fewer and fewer dollars going that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increased tuition costs have made it even more difficult for 
students of the north who must already pay relocation costs to 
continue their education in university. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's failure to act on our charter of rights, its 
failure to pay the public service workers money due as equal pay 
for equal work, its failure to treat women fairly is despicable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have often felt that I am from a generation that has not done 
without.  I have had medicare and maternity benefits, labour 
legislation, health and safety legislation, the security of CPP, 
employment insurance and employment equity.

us put the dollars toward the people who have earned it and to 
those who really need it. The Government of Canada owes some 
200,000 workers $2 billion. Let's pay the dues.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan—King—Aurora, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I would like to congratulate the hon. member on 
her speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There seems to be a perception on the other side of the House 
that things are not just right.  Perhaps the reason why I believe 
that things are getting better is that I was here as an assistant 
and as a member of Parliament under the former Conservative 
government and I can say beyond a shadow of a doubt that things 
are indeed getting better in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember as a Canadian born in 1960 when I came to this House 
there was a $42 billion deficit. Now we are entering a new era in 
Canadian public policy where we will have the first balanced 
budget in a long, long time. This is lost on the New Democratic 
Party whose members think somehow productivity gains and a 
competitive society is built simply by spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an Ontarian I remember the Bob Rae years with a great deal of 
sadness. We saw firm after firm leaving Ontario.  We saw the 
competitive edge of a once very prosperous province vanish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had to do a great deal of work to re-establish a competitive 
economy that speaks to modern day values, to the fact that we 
live in a global society.  We cannot be isolated as the New 
Democratic Party would like us to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a difference the past four years have made to the lives of 
so many Canadians.  Almost one million new Canadian jobs have 
been created as a result of some of our measures.  I want to ask 
the hon. member, if she were to define the optimal conditions for 
economic growth, would they not be low inflation rates and 
elimination of the deficit?  Do these not spur economic growth? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Madam Speaker, although there was not 
a question there, I thought I made it pretty clear without really 
spelling it out that the surplus was there as a result of the 
Government of Canada not paying its dues to its employees and not 
paying its dues to the people who were unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The surplus is there because those people are not paid 
unemployment insurance premiums the same way they would have been 
prior to this government.  I did not get into the nits and grits 
of the $12.3 million paid to 3,000 government managers while 
these same workers were not being paid.  I did not get into a 
reform of a tax system that would be fair for all Canadians.  If 
we need to spell it out, one plus one is two and zero added to 
zero is nothing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I too would like to congratulate my colleague from 
Churchill on an excellent speech.  She stands in a very good 
tradition that I am well aware of having served in this House 
with a predecessor of hers, Rod Murphy, the member of Parliament 
for Churchill from 1979 to 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the hon. member could elaborate for just a few seconds 
since we do not have much time on the injustice being done to so 
many women in the public service, by virtue of this government's 
persistent refusal to take seriously the judgment of its own 
human rights tribunal and pay what is due to women in the public 
service as a result of that judgment having been made with 
respect to pay equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will certainly respond. 
I thank the member for his comments.  I too want to acknowledge 
Rod Murphy and all of his help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1984 the pay equity issue has been on the table with the 
Government of Canada.  Since that time the government has failed 
to respond even though a report from the human rights commission 
indicated that those workers were entitled to fair pay for equal 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was speaking to a Reform motion I happened to become aware 
of a statement by a former Reform MP from Simcoe Centre.  I want 
to read his statement:  “As you are no doubt aware, the Reform 
Party and I do not support the notion of pay equity as outlined 
by the federal government and the human rights tribunal.  We 
believe the hiring and remuneration decisions should be made 
solely on the basis of merit without regard for gender or other 
inalienable characteristics”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would sound to me, just as I see this Reformer was using 
whatever he could to talk about equality— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  To the hon. member 
who has brought orange juice into the House, would you please— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thank you. Resuming debate. The hon. member for 
Vaughan—King—Aurora. 
<P><A NAME="LINK238"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan—King—Aurora, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I noticed with a great deal of interest the Reform 
Party's motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the government for making their 50/50 
election promise on any future surpluses without adequate public 
debate as to the optimal size of government, taxes, and debt, 
thus threatening to repeat Canada's 27 year old history of 
irresponsible spending, creating high debt, financed by high 
taxes, causing high unemployment. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind members of the Reform Party of something and 
point out the word consultation.  I do not know where they were 
on June 2 but I thought the people of Canada made quite a 
statement. They re-elected a majority Liberal government.  Hon. 
members may think what they want but we are back on this side 
after a vigorous debate precisely about this type of issue during 
the election campaign.  The debate spoke to the renewed 
confidence that Canadians have in their government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier in my preamble to one of the questions I posed 
to the hon. member from the New Democratic Party, indeed things 
in this country are getting much better.  That we are in a 
position today to even talk about this particular subject matter, 
namely how we are going to split the surplus, is only because 
Canadians and this Canadian government had the vision and made 
the sacrifices necessary to be in this position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to bring something to the attention of the Reform 
Party members. They need to understand that for the first time in 
a long time Canadians have a great deal of confidence in their 
government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I was sitting on the other side of the House in opposition 
during the Mulroney Conservative government era.  I saw Canadians 
being taxed to death, with no benefits to show for it at the end 
of those 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we took office we had certain objectives.  We had to get 
the fiscal house in order.  In large measure we have done that. 
As I said earlier, we are going to have a balanced budget. 
Second, we were going to restore honesty and integrity to 
government.  We have done that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also set some very good objectives.  We said that we would 
invest in areas which would generate economic growth and increase 
our productivity as a country, understanding full well that in 
order to compete in an international economy we need to have the 
type of regulatory framework which speaks to the decisions which 
will generate wealth in order to generate the revenues which will 
result in the type of social programs to which Canadians have 
grown accustomed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are our priorities? Youth is a priority. I have dedicated 
my political career to advancing the cause of youth.  When I see 
that the government has invested $2 billion in Canada student 
loans, which is a 57 percent increase over five years, I am quite 
proud of the fact that as a government we realize that 
accessibility to education is extremely important in increasing 
job prospects for youth. There is a direct correlation between 
the type of education a person has and the type of job they get. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also invested heavily in technology.  We understand the 
multiplier effect that investing in technology has.  Right here 
in Ottawa, in Kanata, and in Cambridge we have been able to build 
a highly skilled, highly paid workforce that is producing value 
added products.  We have helped to transform the economy into a 
new technologically advanced economy which is generating 
employment in key areas, areas in which we are quite competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a strategy in place.  We inherited a financial mess. We 
have cleaned it up.  Now we are entering the second phase and we 
need to identify our priorities.  What are they?  What do 
Canadians hold sacred?  Budgets and throne speeches must reflect 
Canadian values.  What are they? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of them is health care.  We made an announcement just before 
the election campaign when we found out that the financial 
situation in Canada was even better than we expected. What did we 
do?  We reinvested in health care.  Why was that? Because that is 
a part of the fibre of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What else did we do?  We reinvested $350 million on youth 
employment projects.  Why was that?  Because we know that the 
future of this country belongs to our youth and we need to 
provide them with the right opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How did we do that?  Did we do it the old fashioned way? 
Absolutely not.  We invested in areas where there was growth.  We 
identified 33 key areas of growth in our economy.  We entered 
into internship agreements with those sectors of the economy and 
now young people have a job and a future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gone is the old way of pork barrelling.  Gone is the old way of 
throwing money at problems without getting results.
