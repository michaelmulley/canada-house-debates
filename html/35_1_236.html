	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36, I wish to  present a petition that has 
been circulating all across Canada. This petition has been signed by 
a number of Canadians in my own riding of Mississauga South.
<P>
	The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that managing the family home and caring for preschool children is 
an honourable profession which has not been recognized for its 
value to our society. They also state that the Income Tax Act 
discriminates against families that make the choice to provide care 
in the home to preschool children, the disabled, the chronically ill 
and the aged.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to pursue 
initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against families that 
decide to provide care in the home to preschool children, the 
disabled, the chronically ill and the aged.

	The House resumed from October 2 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-93, an act to amend the Cultural Property Export and 
Import Act, the Income Tax Act and the Tax Court of Canada Act, 
be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the other day I had the opportunity to speak on a Reform 
amendment to this bill. I must admit my remarks were somewhat 
hurried and I was unable to review certain material before I was 
able to make those remarks.
<P>
	Today, having had ample opportunity to reflect on the excellent 
material available in support of the bill put out by the office of the 
minister and the department, I want to again praise the minister for 
introducing Bill C-93. It is a very good bill. It has been earnestly 
sought after by members of the cultural community who appreciate 
the very significant donations made to galleries, museums, 
archives and libraries by donors who own valuable cultural 
treasures.
<P>
	The department estimates that $60 million a year is donated to 
Canadian institutions. These very significant gifts are of possible 
tax benefit to the donor who may claim a deduction in respect to the 
value of the gift. I note the deduction that can be claimed in each 
case is only half the value. It is not the full value. It is substantially 
less than that. The part which is eligible as a tax credit therefore is 
much more modest than has been suggested in some of the remarks 
made by hon. members opposite.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	Donors, museums, galleries and professional associations have 
lobbied for the right to appeal the determination made by the 
review board which currently makes determinations of value, and 
this bill gives that right. It is only fair, it is only just and I think the 
bill deserves the support of all hon. members, particularly when we 
look at the substantial value of the gifts made to these institutions. 
Without these kinds of gifts many of these institutions would not be 
able to acquire the very substantial works of art they now receive.
<P>
	I submit this is a fair and reasonable way of proceeding and I 
urge all hon. members to support the bill in light of the facts and 
figures I have been able to bring to the attention of the House.

	The House resumed from October 2 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-98, an act respecting the oceans of Canada, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
the first time I have spoken from the left side of my chair instead of 
the right side and perhaps my left leaning ideology may come out a 
little stronger in this speech than it has in the last speeches I have 
made in the Chamber.
<P>
<B>(1020 )</B>
<P>
	I hope the bill finds a very broad degree of support by members 
on all sides of the House. It clearly establishes the framework of a 
piece of legislation, a commitment given by the government as 
espoused by no less than the Prime Minister to get a focus in 
government on the development and management of oceans and 
ocean policy.
<P>
	The bill has been a long time in coming and has been awaited 
with much anticipation by many individuals and organizations 
dealing with the marine environment. The Canadian Wildlife Fund 
and many other organizations have pushed for many years for the 
government to come in with a piece of legislation that would 
consolidate the administration of all governmental activities 
related to oceans as well as ensure the number one prerogative and 
prerequisite of this policy be conservation.
<P>
	If measures taken by governments respecting management of 
oceans and oceans policy did not pass the fundamental test of being 
environmentally sound, they would not be passed.
<P>
	The bill affirms the commitment of the government to a new 
approach to oceans management. The preamble clearly outlines the 
government's commitment to manage the oceans in a sustainable, 
environmental and ecologically sound fashion.
<P>
	The bill consolidates and gives impact and full effect to the laws 
of Canada, not just marine laws but environmental laws in our 
200-mile limit. It goes through a whole bunch of definitions of the 
contiguous zone, the coastal zone, the 200-mile economic zone and 
all of those things.
<P>
	In essence it puts in a single piece of legislation the regulatory 
legislative framework for us to act in the best interests of those who 
rely on our marine resource for a living. It directs government as to 
how it should deal with the marine environment.
<P>
	Part II of the act tries to consolidate a lot of governmental 
activity with respect to the oceans. I have been critical about the 
way the government has handled the oceans generally. I have been 
critical for fairly good reason.
<P>
	Over the years governments have come to see the ocean as a 
place to exploit a resource called fish. We can see this very clearly 
by the difficulties we have on both coasts, more poignantly perhaps 
on the east coast with the collapse of the ground fishery and over 
100,000 people without employment. Coastal communities are 
dying and a way of life unique to that part of Canada is perhaps 
facing extinction.
<P>
	It is all because governments have not been able to deal 
comprehensively in policy with that ocean resource. Current 
legislation almost ignores that there is an interrelationship between 
various policy arms of the government with respect to the health of 
the ocean resource.
<P>
	It also ignores that there is an ecology within the ocean that deals 
with living and non-living organisms. In the last number of years 
Canada has worked aggressively at the United Nations. It has been 
one of the states that has promoted to a great extent and has perhaps 
been the lead nation on some of the major conservation efforts with 
the United Nations law of the sea.
<P>
	Canada has talked a lot about the need for some international 
regimes to deal with oceans, to deal with those fringe areas, 
straddling stocks, highly migratory stocks. However, there are 
other issues in the law of the sea convention that Canada had some 
difficulty with, deep ocean bed mining, for example.
<P>
	How do we reconcile ourselves as a state to that? Whose 
resource is this to manage? When we get on to the continental shelf 
there are laws dealing with our proprietary right and our 
management responsibilities in the water column. Perhaps they are 
less clear about which level of government has jurisdiction or 
whether  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15142"> 15142 </A></B>
<P>
the Canadian government has any legal jurisdiction for the sea bed 
for minerals or deep ocean mining.
<P>
	There has been much debate in the last year with the Americans 
about sedentary species when dealing with the continental shelf. 
Who has management rights of those species? Who has the right of 
first exploitation and who has the responsibility to manage? The act 
seeks to consolidate in a fairly substantial way all the various 
issues, programs and legislation.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	I am pleased with the direction the bill has taken. I am pleased 
that it gives primary responsibility for co-ordination of the 
application of these pieces of legislation and regulations to the 
minister of fisheries. However, I am from Missouri, I am yet to be 
convinced the bill goes as far as it should to ensure a sharp edge to 
the sword in the management and policy development dealing with 
our marine resources.
<P>
	I am a bit confused that in the bill we give the minister of 
fisheries primary responsibility for co-ordination. I would rather 
see a direct line of accountability for the administration of some of 
the acts which still fall under the purview of other departments and 
other ministers.
<P>
	I think back to the dispute we had not long ago when two 
ministers worked very well together in dealing with the turbot 
dispute with the European Union, more particularly and poignantly 
with the Spanish fleet decimating a straddling stock. We almost 
saw another stock going into the record book as being extinct as a 
commercial and viable stock on our east coast.
<P>
	We had the good fortune at that time to have the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans working 
together on a co-ordinated and combined approach to resolve and 
put together the Canadian position, making sure the Canadian 
position was put to the international community very strongly and 
firmly and that it was accepted by the international community. As 
a result of that close working relationship, sharing the same goals, 
we were able to save a species and defuse a difficult international 
situation that had arisen with respect to the turbot allocation on the 
east coast.
<P>
	I am extremely pleased the bill is going to committee. As 
chairman of the committee, I want the committee to look at 
whether there are some pieces of legislation currently outside the 
direct jurisdiction of the minister, although the minister may have 
the responsibility for co-ordination, where we possibly can make a 
case that those pieces of legislation and programs should be more 
properly moved over to the minister of fisheries.
<P>
	When we talk about downsizing and government and operational 
review we must look at what makes sense. The policy as stated in 
the preamble of the bill is one I heartily support and I hope it will 
be supported by all members of the House.
<P>
	Part III of the bill talks about the minister of fisheries having 
primary responsibility for ocean research. It is an absolute given. 
There is more than fish in our oceans. There is more benefit than 
exploiting the stocks in our oceans. Ocean science in itself is a 
generator of wealth and employment which can be exported on our 
east and west coasts and in the labs of central Canada.
<P>
	I want to make sure that when the bill is passed the minister of 
fisheries, as stated in part III, has the tools at his disposal to ensure 
there is proper direction and proper resources applied to the whole 
area of marine and ocean science.
<P>
	In my riding of Dartmouth I am lucky to have the Bedford 
Institute of Oceanography, a world class centre for oceans research. 
In excess of 12,000 people produce good products. There is 
partnering by the scientific community employed by the 
government and the scientific community in the 
Halifax-Dartmouth area. Some of that technology is being 
exported around the world.
<P>
	In that facility the geological survey is doing incredible work. 
The work of the labs on the east and west coasts is leading science 
around the world. People from educational and academic 
institutions and other governments around the world come to see 
how we do our research in Canada.
<P>
	I get concerned, however, that lab is not under the direction of 
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. It is under the direction of the 
Minister of Natural Resources. It is not the primary objective or job 
of that department to ensure that deep ocean science has a 
pre-eminent position when you deal with where your resources go 
inside a department.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	At the same time, we have provisions dealing with deep ocean 
dumping, which seems to me should more likely be over with the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. Currently, although there would 
be a requirement in this act to see the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans as the lead, it does not hand that particular responsibility 
over to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	We have a chance through committee to show two things. One is 
that the committee can work. I have an incredibly good committee, 
and I am very proud as chairman to say that most of the work we do 
is non-partisan. Sometimes we fall prey to the fact that we are 
practitioners of the political profession and sometimes we become 
partisan.
<P>
	As a chair of a committee I want to let everybody in this place 
know that I believe there is a proper role for a committee to play 
with respect to examining legislation. I am hoping that when this 
bill passes second reading and gets to the committee we in the 
committee will do a fairly exhaustive review of this bill and will be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15143"> 15143 </A></B>
<P>
able to come back with a bill that is true to the principles and if  
necessary strengthens the hand of the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, we have 
talked in the House about Bill C-98 and the problems we have with 
it. The problem is that along with the consolidation of government 
regulations this bill also opens the door for the government to 
increase what it euphemistically calls access fees, but which we all 
know is a tax on fishermen. We know that the plans are to raise 
taxes 400 per cent on a segment of our society that can least afford 
it.
<P>
	The minister had a choice. The minister knew his budget was 
going to be cut and he had a choice. He could cut spending, he 
could deal with the bloated bureaucracy here in Ottawa and in other 
parts of Canada where they have these ivory towers, or he could 
raise access fees or taxes on fishermen. He chose to go after the 
fishermen. As I said earlier, these are people in our country who 
can least afford to pay a massive increase at this point in time.
<P>
	Let us talk about access for a minute. I think that is an interesting 
subject, given that this government is supporting an aboriginal 
fishing strategy on both coasts that allows special access to a 
resource based on race. The aboriginal fishing strategy, this 
government policy, sets people apart. It treats them differently, 
gives them different rules to live by, and it creates a gulf between 
people. It creates a mentality of us versus them. It creates divisions 
in our society that we do not need and we have not seen before, but 
which are growing as a result of government policy such as this.
<P>
	Not only does this set people apart by race, not only does it give 
different treatment to Canadians on the basis of their racial origin, 
it is profoundly anti-democratic at its very roots. The cornerstone 
of democracy is that all people within a democracy can expect 
equal treatment before the eyes of the law. They can expect to be 
treated the same as all other citizens in the democracy, in the 
country. This is no longer the case in Canada. We now treat people 
differently.
<P>
	I suggest that this is playing to a deeply rooted sense of 
tribalism. I suggest that both of these cannot co-exist within a 
democracy, this idea of tribalism where you have people who 
suggest they have special rights and should be treated differently, 
on whatever basis, whether it is racial origin or whether it is sexual 
preference, it does not matter, you name it. It is the cornerstone of 
democracy that we do not treat people differently, that everybody 
gets the same treatment in the eyes of the law. That is not 
happening here.
<P>
<B>(1035 )</B>
<P>
	The fishermen on the west coast and east coast who are being 
asked to pay a massive increase for access to the resource look 
across the way and see their neighbours and fellow Canadians 
getting access to the same resource  on a completely different basis. 
It is fundamentally unacceptable, I would suggest, in a democracy 
that we proceed with that kind of policy.
<P>
	We will hear members opposite say the courts made us do it. I 
suggest very strongly that there is no basis in law, no basis in our 
Constitution. There is not one legal case that has said that the 
aboriginal people of Canada should have special access to any 
resources on a commercial basis. It is completely unsupported. But 
these members opposite, other members before them, and other 
fisheries ministers have said that the Sparrow decision is what 
creates this aboriginal fishing strategy. It is faulty and not 
supported. I would suggest that by government following this 
policy it is just creating divisions in our society that we do not 
need.
<P>
	I would ask how the minister and this government can, under 
Bill C-98, contemplate and suggest that they are going to raise 
access fees to ordinary Canadian fishermen who remain in the 
commercial sector by some 400 per cent while at the same time 
they support and maintain an aboriginal fishing strategy that 
provides access to the resource on a completely different basis.
<P>
	I suggest that what the government is doing here is not supported 
in the industry. It certainly is not supported from the point of view 
of the Atlantic Canadian fishermen I have had the opportunity to 
meet in recent weeks. I believe there are many members on the 
opposite benches who are going to have a difficult time going back 
to their constituents to explain why they are supporting this bill in 
its present form, because their constituents do not support it. Their 
constituents are very unhappy with what the government is 
proposing.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to say that the Reform Party is opposed 
to Bill C-98. We are opposed because we see the minister 
increasing taxes on fishermen rather than cutting his own budget 
and his own spending. We know there are significant cuts that can 
be made within DFO at the top, which would probably increase the 
efficiency of the organization by 400 per cent. This would get the 
whole fishery on a more economically sustainable basis. It is 
unthinkable that we continue to pump the kind of money into DFO 
that we do based on the value of the fishery.
<P>
	I know the members opposite, particularly the member for 
Dartmouth and the member for South West Nova, are going to have 
difficulties in their ridings when they go back and try to explain to 
their constituents and the fishermen who live in their communities 
why they are supporting this legislation.
<P>
	I am here today on behalf of the Reform Party to say we are not 
supporting this legislation. We will not support these kinds of 
massive tax increases wherever we find them. This bill is 
fundamentally flawed because of this very important move by the 
government to increase those fees.

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it gives me 
great pleasure to rise today to speak to Bill C-98, an act respecting 
the oceans of Canada. I welcome the opportunity to chat for a few 
minutes about why I support the bill before us.
<P>
	I think it is clear to everyone at this point that there is a great 
need to move away from what the National Advisory Board on 
Science and Technology called the haphazard, ad hoc, and short 
term measures currently employed in the management of our ocean 
resources. The patchwork quilt strategy is ineffective and 
inefficient. The national advisory board called for Canada to 
develop a proactive oceans policy that allows for us to plan for the 
future instead of just responding to crises as they arise.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	Our ocean resources are far too important in this country. We 
need a management process that works better and serves the 
interests of all of us in the long term. We cannot afford to continue 
to make decisions on the management of our fisheries or the 
management of our other marine resources in isolation from those 
having to do with shipping or those having to do with 
environmental protection, and vice versa. Decisions on one have an 
impact on all others.
<P>
	We need to bring all these elements together under one roof. This 
legislation will accomplish that by asserting our national 
jurisdiction over a 12-mile contiguous zone in which all our 
national laws regarding fiscal, immigration, customs and 
environmental matters will apply, while at the same time creating 
an exclusive economic zone to assert our right to protect and 
manage all our resources out to a 200-mile limit, including all fish 
and also including all other resources.
<P>
	This bill will also extend our authority out over the continental 
shelf. Bill C-29, passed by the House last year, established our right 
to protect and manage the so-called straddling stocks of fish that 
move in and out of the current 200-mile limit. This legislation will 
reinforce that measure by exerting our authority over the 
continental shelf itself and the resources found on the shelf.
<P>
	Canada has always been a world leader in matters to do with the 
wise management of our ocean resources. We were one of the 
primary movers urging the UN to focus on the importance of this 
issue. Successive governments have made the case to our 
international partners that ocean states can and should have the 
right to control and protect their coastal waters. We have 250,000 
kilometres of coastline, more than anyone else in the world. As 
such, it has always been in our national interest to seek recognition 
of our rights in the waters immediately off our shores.
<P>
	The second thing this legislation does is to put overall 
responsibility for the creation of oceans management  strategy in 
the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. We can proceed in a more 
organized and cost efficient manner to deliver oceans programs in a 
more coherent manner. The goal is sustainable development of 
these vast stretches of our waters. We want to exploit the oceans for 
ourselves, but we also want to make sure that in doing so we do not 
damage them for future generations of Canadians or for current and 
future generations of people in other countries either.
<P>
	Eight years ago the concept of sustainable development was first 
introduced in a report of the World Commission on Environment 
and Development chaired by the current Prime Minister of Norway, 
Mrs. Gro Harlem Brundtland. The principles of the Brundtland 
report are supported in theory at least by almost every nation in the 
world.
<P>
	The previous government agreed with the principles in the 
Brundtland report and in fact made a commitment to bring in a 
Canada oceans act. However, no such legislation was ever 
introduced by that government. I congratulate this government for 
doing so.
<P>
	Under the terms of this legislation we have before us, the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans will be responsible for the 
development and enforcement of a new oceans management 
strategy. It is going to be done with a different approach from that 
used in the past. It is the government's stated intention to work in 
partnership with oceans industries and the people in them, the 
various resource extraction industries and the people involved 
there, with environmental groups and indeed with anyone who has 
an interest to come up with the best plan possible.
<P>
	An example given of this kind of partnership is the Fisheries 
Resource Conservation Council which brings together industry, 
educators and governments to advise on conservation in the 
Atlantic. The council has played an instrumental role in helping the 
government move to the fishery of the future. The government 
wants to expand this kind of partnership because it believes that 
these kinds of partnership approaches will bring the best results. 
That includes using the best scientific information from as many 
sources as possible.
<P>
	It is not going to be a matter of the federal government 
determining everything itself. It is going to work with other levels 
of government, the private sector, educators, scientists, 
environmental groups and all interested parties to make sure that 
Canada remains on the cutting edge of research and knowledge in 
this critical area and more important, that Canada uses that 
knowledge to make the right decisions about how best to manage 
our ocean resources.
<P>
	Hon. colleagues will also know that the government has already 
moved to integrate the coast guard into the department of fisheries. 
I think this move makes a lot of sense. Bringing together these two 
fleets of ships and aircraft will save the government money. This is 
always  good news for taxpayers. It is very welcome news for my 
constituents in the riding of Erie. More than that, it also gives them 
the opportunity to use all their vessels and aircraft for both 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15145"> 15145 </A></B>
<P>
purposes, that is fisheries and resource management as well as the 
traditional coast guard duties of search and rescue, ice breaking 
service, marine weather warnings, patrolling our coastal waters and 
so on.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	In addition, the regional offices of both will be consolidated into 
an enlarged and improved service which means further savings and 
a much better co-ordination of all activities that have to do with our 
ocean waters.
<P>
	Provision is also made in the act to allow the minister of 
fisheries to carry out scientific research in support of the ocean 
management strategy. It gives the minister the legal right to 
produce charts, reports and scientific data and to provide that 
information to those groups, organizations and individuals who 
have an interest in these issues. Also included is a new authority to 
provide guidelines under which foreign vessels can conduct 
scientific research in Canadian waters.
<P>
	For the first time the act will give government, following 
discussions and advice from scientists and other interested parties, 
a new authority to create protected marine areas, to safeguard 
ocean biodiversity and to safeguard endangered species.
<P>
	We all know that our oceans, particularly in our coastal 
communities, face a great deal of environmental stress as well as 
the depletion of the ocean resources through the destruction of 
habitats essential to the survival and growth of certain species. We 
need to protect these areas from further destruction. I welcome the 
inclusion of this provision in the act and encourage the minister to 
use it when scientific evidence demonstrates that it is necessary.
<P>
	The point has been made by others that passing the legislation by 
itself does not guarantee that our oceans will be safe from all 
environmental damage or resource depletion for all time. If it were 
that simple, I am sure we would have passed a law against the 
common cold many years ago.
<P>
	The bill puts a framework in place that will help us reach those 
goals. It also makes clear that we have to promote our own strategy 
with all the countries in the world that share oceans with us. In 
other words we have to make it clear that each of us is responsible 
for protecting them.
<P>
	I urge the government and the minister to continue to make 
Canada's voice heard on issues such as ocean dumping, 
conservation of straddling stocks, the proper management of our 
coastal zones, circumpolar management and all other issues that 
have an impact on the oceans of the world.
<P>
	The legislation gives us as a nation the opportunity to lead by 
example, to demonstrate to the world that Canadians care deeply 
about their ocean resources, that we want to preserve and protect 
them, and that we are willing to put our money where our mouth is 
by taking long term action to do so. The oceans act signals a 
renewal of Canada's leadership in ocean management. I am proud 
of this initiative asserting Canada's role as a world leader.
<P>
	Before I conclude I should like to address one point raised by the 
previous Reform speaker on cost recovery. The oceans act 
authorizes the minister to fix fees, to recover the cost of services 
and activities provided for under the act, for example ice breaking, 
traffic management and hydrographic charts. Access fees for 
commercial fishermen are established under section 8 of the 
fisheries act, not under the oceans act. The two pieces of legislation 
are entirely distinct.
<P>
	I hope every member of the House will consider the legislation 
as a very positive step in the right direction and give it their 
support. I certainly do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak on Bill C-98, the oceans act, 
an act to ratify the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.
<P>
	I will mention what I agree with and what I disagree with. I will 
give some constructive suggestions to make our oceans better, to 
improve our resource management and to ensure we have safe, 
clean oceans with viable populations of flora and fauna within 
those oceans for now and forever more.
<P>
	Unfortunately we will create another level of bureaucracy with 
this act. There are aspects of it that actually improve, streamline 
and make the system more efficient, for example with the 
amalgamation of the coast guard. We completely agree with that. 
However we have created in the oceans management strategy a 
whole new level of bureaucracy to monitor people monitoring 
other people when in effect we should just be acting.
<P>
<B>(1050 )</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately we continually study, report and analyse aspects 
not only within this ministry but within many others when the 
actual facts are already there, waiting to be dealt with. Sadly with 
this bill we see the same situation. Historically we can see the 
consequences of continuing to act, continuing to report and 
continuing to study.
<P>
	We have seen the decimation of our oceans and the fish 
populations within them. The disaster on the east coast has been a 
profound tragedy for all people living in the maritimes. On the west 
coast unfortunately the fish stocks are facing an impending 
disaster. For years the west coast fisheries of many species have 
been decimated. The reason is not El Niño, not mackerel, not warm 
water, although they can have a contributing effect. The  primary 
reason for the decimation of fish stocks on the west coast is 
poaching, poaching and poaching. That is the cold, hard reality of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15146"> 15146 </A></B>
<P>
what has happened on the west coast. It also happened on the east 
coast before.
<P>
	Unfortunately the ministry has been unwilling and unable to deal 
with it. It is not because DFO officers did not want to enforce the 
law but because middle management bureaucracy meddled in the 
ability of the DFO officers to enforce the laws which protect the 
environment and species for generations to come. These 
individuals are hiding behind their ethnic origins and using the 
aboriginal fishing strategy to poach and pillage our fish stock. 
Those are the facts.
<P>
	The colour or race of persons do not matter. If they are poachers, 
they are poachers and they should be dealt with in the same way as 
other people. This ministry has been unwilling and unable to do 
that. We see aboriginal people poaching up and down the Fraser 
River. DFO officers are unwilling to enforce the law because they 
are afraid of being shot. On Vancouver Island Vietnamese people 
have been decimating the shellfish stocks in full view of other 
people and the DFO officers have been unable to deal with it. They 
have been told by the bureaucratic masters above them that they 
should leave well enough alone.
<P>
	There are too many nets in the water. Seiners are going out into 
the straits of Juan de Fuca and are vacuuming the oceans. The DFO 
must take a leadership role to decrease the number of nets.
<P>
	The aboriginal fishing strategy is a disaster. Furthermore it is 
illegal. Court cases in the B.C. Supreme Court have determined 
that it is illegal. The Sparrow case my hon. friend mentioned 
proved there was no legal jurisdiction for the AFS.
<P>
	We should have one commercial fishing strategy for all people. 
It does not serve the law-abiding aboriginal people who care about 
and fish the resource. Nor does it serve anybody else to allow 
people within their community to hide behind the AFS and poach 
fish. The ministry has put people who are some of the biggest 
poachers in British Columbia in charge of the aboriginal fishing 
strategy. The aboriginal people know that and they are quite angry 
at the DFO for doing it.
<P>
	As I said before, there is widespread poaching of shellfish. 
Widespread poaching of abalone was stopped in 1989, but 
everyone who lives on Vancouver Island knows that abalone is 
being poached.
<P>
	Companies continue to dump their garbage into the oceans on 
the west coast and on the east coast. The ministry has been unable 
and unwilling to deal with it. It should be working closely with the 
Ministry of the Environment to develop a system to identify the 
people who are polluting our oceans, to enforce the law and to 
penalize them. Furthermore, so that it does not cost taxpayers 
money, the government should levy the costs  for cleaning up the 
dumping and the pollution on the shoulders of the groups or 
companies that are doing it. It should not cost the taxpayer any 
money whatsoever to do that. The full cost and beyond should be 
borne by the polluters themselves.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	I also encourage the Ministry of Fisheries and Oceans to work 
closely with the Ministry of the Environment and various 
universities across the country that are doing very interesting 
research in the oceans. They are also developing systems with 
strong commercial properties that can be sold internationally.
<P>
	We as a country can be a leader in areas such as aquaculture, 
resource management, fisheries and oceans management. All we 
need to do is have the courage to identify these sectors, promote 
them and capitalize on them for our economy and our country. We 
have been far too lame and non-aggressive in this area.
<P>
	I suggest that we do the following. We should give DFO officers 
more autonomy and stop letting them be hamstrung by middle 
management. I strongly encourage the minister to look at what is 
happening in middle management. Some of them are telling him 
what he wants to hear, not what is actually occurring.
<P>
	When the minister went to the west coast he did a very good 
thing by sitting down with the DFO officers and speaking with 
them in a forthcoming fashion. I think he found that productive. I 
know they did. I strongly encourage him to continue the practice.
<P>
	The sad byproduct of that meeting unfortunately is that some of 
the DFO officers have been penalized for being forthcoming and as 
a result have been removed from their positions at great cost to the 
ministry and at great cost to the fisheries. This is completely unfair.
<P>
	We must make enforcement a priority. We must allow DFO 
officers to continue to do their job. We must allow them to enforce 
the law as it is written and arrest and penalize anybody who 
poaches regardless of whom they happen to be.
<P>
	I put forth to the minister about a month and a half ago a new 
idea by which we can improve our fish stocks and generate funds 
for the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. It involved using 
salmon hatcheries.
<P>
	A recent study indicated that salmon hatcheries, many of which 
are inefficient, do not need to exist. I gave the minister a way for 
the department to pay for the hatcheries and to earn revenues from 
them. They would become self-sustaining and would not be a 
lodestone around the taxpayer's neck.
<P>
	I hope he pays careful attention to it. A model of it will be on the 
Sooke River in my riding of Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca. It is a well 
thought out plan and will make the hatchery self-sustaining in the 
future.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15147"> 15147 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. minister should look at new ways to manage our 
oceans and new ways to increase our jurisdiction beyond the 
200-mile zone. The reality is that we cannot even manage our 
oceans in the 2-mile zone, let alone the 200-mile zone. We have 
to show more courage in this way. I am hoping with the 
amalgamation of the coast guard we can use the coast guard more 
effectively to arrest individuals who are poaching.
<P>
	I warn once again that a lot of people are coming over from the 
United States of America to poach in B.C. waters because their 
waters are completely closed to fishing. The DFO has been 
completely unable to do anything about that.
<P>
	The officers should also be given the ability to work overtime 
and the ability to do night patrols and weekend patrols when a lot of 
poaching occurs.
<P>
	There are ways in which to generate money from something like 
this, so it will not cost the ministry more money. I strongly 
encourage the minister to look at these matters. My colleagues and 
I would be more than happy to help him in the endeavour to have 
one fishery for generations to come.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak on Bill C-98 
respecting the oceans act. It implements many of the key 
recommendations in last year's report called ``Opportunities from 
our Oceans'' by the committee on oceans and coasts of the National 
Advisory Board on Science and Technology.
<P>
	As government members opposite have already noted, this piece 
of legislation does three things to implement a strategy to better 
manage the environment and resources of Canada's oceans. First, 
the act establishes Canadian sovereignty over the ocean areas and 
resources of a 24-nautical mile contiguous zone and a 200-mile 
exclusive economic zone, in accordance with the United Nations 
Convention on the Law of the Sea, which Canada signed in 1982 
but never ratified. Second, the act develops and implements a 
national oceans strategy based on the sustainable development and 
integrated management of oceans and coastal activities and 
resources; this would include establishing protected marine areas. 
Finally, the act provides for the powers, duties, functions, and 
responsibilities of the Minister of Fisheries to manage Canada's 
oceans.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	This is an important bill which could move us forward toward 
managing both our natural resources and our fishery in a manner 
that is more sustainable for future generations. The idea of an 
oceans act is certainly overdue. I am supportive of the bill in 
general and pleased that Canada will finally implement one of the 
key provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the 
Sea.
<P>
	There are areas where the act could be improved. I wish to focus 
my remarks today on some of those improvements and on the fact 
that other legislation the government has on the Order Paper may 
limit the effectiveness of Bill C-98.
<P>
	Clause 35 of the bill allows for the minister to establish 
protected marine areas. However, the bill states that these areas are 
only for the conservation and protection of fishery resources and 
their habitat. These protected areas should not be limited just to the 
fishery. The act should also be broader so that the protected marine 
areas protect other endangered species and different habitats and 
ecosystems, not just the fishery. This would recognize the 
importance of biodiversity in the complex ocean environment. 
There should also be no take zones within these areas.
<P>
	The environment minister's proposed endangered species 
legislation will only protect 4 per cent of Canada's total land base. 
A broadening of the protected marine areas therefore would signal 
that even if the government does not intend to protect endangered 
species in most of the country, at least it will protect them in our 
oceans.
<P>
	This shows that when we look at what the government is doing to 
protect the environment, it is important not to look at this 
legislation in isolation from other government statements and 
initiatives on the environment.
<P>
	Last week I listened to government members opposite talk about 
how wonderful things in this bill would lead us toward sustainable 
development and how the bill's regulation would extend our 
jurisdiction to manage and protect ocean resources and our 
environment. They seem to be blissfully unaware that just last 
week the Minister of International Trade, a minister in their own 
government, said that Canada will have to cede its sovereignty and 
environmental standards to achieve freer world trade and that the 
environment will increasingly be subject to harmonization under 
international trade agreements. So which is it? Will Bill C-98 be 
used to protect and sustain our oceans, or will the environment of 
our oceans be sacrificed on the altar of free trade?
<P>
	As they talked about sustainable development and 
environmental regulations, the Liberal members also seemed to be 
unaware that their government has introduced two pieces of 
legislation, Bill C-62 and Bill C-83. Those bills could effectively 
gut the regulations in this bill and therefore prevent us from 
knowing if the government's oceans management strategy will ever 
lead us to sustainability.
<P>
	Just to remind members opposite, Bill C-62 is the regulatory 
efficiency act, and it does two things. It allows the government to 
sign compliance agreements with business, waiving the terms of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15148"> 15148 </A></B>
<P>
compliance with designated regulations. It also allows designated  
regulations to be administered by any government, Canadian or 
foreign, or by any other person.
<P>
	The proposed oceans act states that existing Canadian laws will 
apply to the exclusive economic zone. This would include the two 
most important federal environmental protection laws on the 
books, the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act and the 
Canadian Environmental Protection Act. Since these laws are 
effected mainly through their regulations, how can Canada exercise 
environmental jurisdiction over its oceans if Bill C-62 effectively 
guts the regulations of CEAA and CEPA and gives the power of 
environmental regulation to private corporations or indeed foreign 
governments?
<P>
	There are also parts of Bill C-98 that simply will not work 
without the regulations. I refer specifically to clause 16, which 
establishes the fishing zones of Canada; to clause 25, which 
establishes the outer limit of the exclusive economic zones and 
makes regulations concerning a marine structure and the 
application of federal and provincial laws; and to clause 35, which 
establishes protected marine areas.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	It is technically possible that compliance agreements under Bill 
C-62 would replace some of these regulations. In short, Bill C-62 
allows the possibility that the federal power in Bill C-98 could be 
administered by other authorities, including other provincial and 
national governments.
<P>
	As my final point I would like to mention that Bill C-83, which 
establishes a commissioner of the environment and sustainability 
within the Office of the Auditor General, could also limit how 
effective Bill C-98 will be.
<P>
	I spoke at length about this bill two weeks ago and how the 
environment committee recommended that the environmental 
auditor be given the mandate to evaluate whether government 
policy was leading us toward sustainability. Government members 
opposite did not lift a finger to defend the committee's report. You 
may remember that the government completely ignored the 
important recommendations of the committee's report; 11 out of 17 
of those recommendations were completely ignored.
<P>
	Now clause 30 in Bill C-98 bases the national oceans 
management strategy on two principles, sustainable development 
and the integrated management activities in Canada's sovereign 
waters. How are we going to know if the management strategy 
developed under Bill C-98 is sustainable, effective, or even 
desirable if the new environmental commissioner cannot look at 
policy established by the government?
<P>
	The powers of the minister under the oceans management 
strategy in clauses 32, 33, and part III of this bill illustrate the clear 
need for an independent  environmental auditor who can act as a 
watchdog and examine whether policies and actions are meeting 
environmentally sustainable goals.
<P>
	In conclusion, although I welcome the intent and objectives 
contained in Bill C-98, its passage is not enough to protect the 
resources and marine environment off our coasts. If the 
government were really serious about protecting our natural 
environment, about ensuring sustainable development strategies, 
about preserving and enhancing environmental protection 
regulations, about pollution prevention, and about protecting 
biodiversity and endangered species, it would do a number of 
things in addition to passing Bill C-98.
<P>
	The government would amend Bill C-83 so that the 
environmental commissioner can evaluate policy. It would 
immediately withdraw Bill C-62 from the Order Paper so that 
environmental legislation already on the books in this country is 
not gutted. It would bring in real effective endangered species 
legislation protecting habitats and it would implement the excellent 
recommendation in the environment committee's latest report, a 
review of CEPA entitled: ``It's About Our Health! Towards 
Pollution Prevention''. May this latest report of the committee fare 
better in the hands of the government than the last one.

	He said: Madam Speaker, for the benefit of members present 
who may not be entirely familiar with this bill and for the benefit of 
those thousands of Canadians earnestly watching this on television 
wondering what on earth this is all about, we are talking about the 
affirmative action bill of this Parliament. It is officially entitled 
employment equity.
<P>
	What this bill purports to do is primarily to the public service, 
but any private companies of 100 employees or more doing 
business with the federal government are going to be going through 
substantially more hoops than they have in the past in meeting 
quotas for employment.
<P>
	The amendments the Speaker has mentioned all have to do with 
three separate and distinct criteria. They are to remove the effects 
of this bill from application to the private sector.
<P>
<B>(1115 )</B>
<P>
	If it is the Liberal government's intent to foist employment 
equity or affirmative action on the operations of the Government of 
Canada there is little the opposition can do because the government 
is going to do what it wants to do. However this should be carefully 
considered as it applies to the private sector. Private sector 
employers have enough trouble these days without adding one 
more hurdle for them to overcome.
<P>
	I would also point out that the private sector by and large is light 
years ahead of the government in its relationship with minority 
groups. Much of what is done by the private sector is done in 
enlightened self-interest. There is nothing wrong with enlightened 
self-interest. A company will hire from those available the very 
best people it can get. They should not be acquired by a quota 
system, no matter how that quota system is comfortably or 
carefully disguised as employment equity. It is still affirmative 
action. It is still reverse discrimination. It still purports to set out 
that people are able to get jobs, advancement or opportunities 
based on human characteristics rather than merit.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15150"> 15150 </A></B>
<P>
	The other amendments I have proposed that we will be 
discussing, and we would ask the government to consider  
carefully, are that the sole criteria for advancement or employment 
be merit. It should be understood that although there are items in 
the bill that purport to say that merit has not been taken out, we 
think it would be improved if we were to explicitly say that yes, the 
Government of Canada understands and appreciates and affirms 
that merit will be the sole criteria on which people will be hired, on 
which people will be promoted and any distinction within the 
employment will be based solely on merit.
<P>
	The Speaker mentioned quite a number of amendments. Most of 
those amendments are consequential amendments that have to do 
with making sure that if there is an amendment, for example, to 
clause 3(2)(i) that those amendments follow through. Most of them 
really do not have any consequence. We are talking about just three 
major philosophical ideas in all of these amendments.
<P>
	The third is that there is quite a convoluted procedure whereby 
people must identify themselves to the responsible officer to make 
sure that the employment equity or affirmative action targets or 
quotas are met. The person from the government comes in and 
says: ``Hi, I am from the government. I am here to help you'', 
snicker, snicker. The person comes in and says: ``I am from the 
government, I am your employment equity or affirmative action 
officer and I am checking to see if you are in compliance''.
<P>
	Suppose this person goes into a room and everybody working in 
the room is black. There are 20 people working in the room. The 
person from the government looks at a piece of paper and notes that 
everyone has identified themselves as Canadians. They have not 
said that they are black; they have not said that they are yellow, 
white or green or whatever colour they might be. They have said: 
``We are Canadians''. Technically they would not be in compliance.
<P>
	This gives the compliance officer the chance to use some 
common sense and say: ``Wait a minute, these people are definitely 
in compliance with the spirit of the law, if not with the letter of the 
law''. It gives the compliance officer a little bit of flexibility.
<P>
	These are the three major thrusts of the amendments we would 
ask the House to carefully consider before automatically saying: 
``We are not going to consider any of these amendments''.
<P>
	That concludes my short remarks on Bill C-64 at this time. We 
will have a lot more to say on this subject when it is debated at third 
reading.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am often shocked by the simple analysis of how our 
society works and sometimes does not work for the people.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I would like to thank you for this chance to 
demonstrate the merits of the Liberal approach to employment 
equity and to expose the destructive nature of the proposed 
amendment.
<P>
	The effect of Motion No. 1 would be to exclude the private 
sector altogether from the act. This would be tantamount to 
repealing the existing Employment Equity Act. It is not acceptable 
to the government.
<P>
	The motion begs a very important question because it speaks to 
the type of work that members of Parliament do in committees and 
whether they are or are not listening to what people have to say.
<P>
	Did hon. members opposite hear what the business community 
had to say about employment equity during the hearings of the 
Standing Committee on Human Resources Development? Perhaps 
I can use this occasion to refresh their memories. The strongest 
proponents of the legislation were also those organizations 
representing some of Canada's largest employers, including the 
Canadian Bankers Association, the Canadian Association of 
Broadcasters and Canadian National.
<P>
	Banks alone employ nearly one-third of all federally regulated 
private sector employees. W.J. Lomax of the Canadian Bankers 
Association, like many others who testified, stated at the hearings 
that employment equity ``has stimulated fundamental reviews and 
enhancements in the bank's human resources policies and practices 
which have benefited everyone. It has helped us lay the foundation 
for managing an increasingly diverse workforce, something every 
employer of choice in the 1990s wants to do well''.
<P>
	The friends of business are speaking out against business. I have 
heard hon. members across the way offer their curious 
understanding of life in the Canadian workplace and employment 
equity. Here we have a party that tells the world that it is in favour 
of equality. It claims it is in favour of hiring on merit. It tells us to 
seed opportunity for all and yet attacks a piece of legislation that 
has helped employers clear away impediments for all Canadians.
<P>
	I am going to take this opportunity to dispel some of the myths 
the Reform Party has been stating. The first speaker on its behalf 
said certain things that are not quite accurate. What does the bill 
not do? The bill specifically states that it does not require 
employers to hire unqualified people. That is what the bill says.
<P>
	It also says that it does not require the federal public service to 
set aside merit principles. That is what this bill says. It exempts 
employers with less than 100 employees. The hon. member should 
listen to this: It does not create a rigid quota system and it makes 
clear this program must never cause undue hardship on an 
employer.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15151"> 15151 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> That's Liberal arrogance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Very Orwellian.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> Madam Speaker, I hear some heckling on the 
other side. Obviously the Reform Party has a great deal of 
difficulty dealing with the facts when they are presented as clearly 
and concisely as they have been this morning.
<P>
	Canadians understand. The Reform Party couches its intentions 
in elegant language but the people of Canada, the visible 
minorities, the average Canadian, young people understand what 
the Reform Party is all about. Its members may think they are 
pulling the wool over people's eyes. However, the fact is that 
everyone is waking up to the reality and the type of mean spirited 
outlook the Reform Party day in and day out demonstrates in the 
House.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, let me continue to enlighten the members 
opposite on the key issues of why employment equity builds a 
fairer and more just society for everyone. The Reform Party's 
position implies that people from designated groups choose greater 
unemployment, they choose lower wages, they look for more 
uncertainty as employees. They invite it. That is what visible 
minorities, aboriginal Canadians and women want. They want to 
make less than everybody else. That is what the Reform Party 
would like Canadians to believe.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	Canadians are more reasonable. They understand that 
employment equity is not about favouring one group. It is the 
realization that in our society there is something called systemic 
discrimination, that people sometimes have to overcome 
insurmountable barriers to find work and move ahead.
<P>
	The thoughts I have expressed today arise from rational 
discussion in every single part of the country. When people look at 
the statistics and at the fact that women make less than men in 
comparable positions and that aboriginals are being shut out of 
employment opportunities, they tell the government that 
employment equity makes sense.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Indian affairs is doing it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> I am somewhat surprised that the Reform Party 
would stoop this low-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Equal opportunity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> -and not allow Canadians from the 
designated groups their right to a job and to prosper like every 
other Canadian.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> I wonder why Ontario 
cancelled?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> It is because we do not like racism.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> Madam Speaker, I am one member who is 
going to expose the Reform Party for exactly what it is-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> You are racist.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> -a backward party.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I would ask the hon. 
member to withdraw his comments, please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Madam Speaker, I am sorry. I was carried away in 
the heat of debate. I withdraw the remark. Is the hon. member 
going to identify the groups on the basis of colour?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> Madam Speaker, this type of behaviour in the 
House which has become synonymous with Reform Party members 
is quite shocking. In my six or seven years as a member of 
Parliament-
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> I guess we do not like social 
engineering, do we?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bevilacqua:</B> -nobody has ever used that term to describe 
me. While I accept the apology, I think Canadians will understand 
that the term used by the hon. member was unparliamentary and 
unbecoming of a parliamentarian.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Are you going to identify the minorities on the 
basis of their colour?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, as this is the first time I have an opportunity to rise in this 
House, I wish to welcome you back. You can, of course, appreciate 
that we have no intention of supporting the motions and 
amendments put forward by the Reform Party, and certainly not 
those aimed at exempting the private sector from the application of 
the Employment Equity Act.
<P>
	With your permission, I would like to say that if we find 
ourselves with such amendments, it is undoubtedly because the 
Reform Party does not understand what employment equity is. 
What is being proposed through this bill and through various 
amendments is something that has been requested by a number of 
Canadians, especially those who submitted briefs to the Abella 
Commission and asked us to ensure not only that the Employment 
Equity Act has a greater impact on the private sector but also that it 
applies to the public service in general, which is what Bill C-64 
will achieve.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	We found it difficult to understand the position put forward by 
the Reform Party. How can they say on the one hand that the new 
jobs in Canada are created by the private sector, especially by small 
business, and claim on the other hand that the private sector should 
be exempted from employment equity?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15152"> 15152 </A></B>
<P>
	Tabling a motion like the one put forward by our friends from 
the Reform Party is to consciously deny that greater equality in 
Canada and Quebec can be achieved through the private sector.
<P>
	I would be tempted to say that it takes a whole lot of nerve to rise 
in this place and make this kind of remark.
<P>
	What is most disturbing about such a position is the line we were 
given-and will keep hearing throughout the debate today I 
guess-about white people-those the Reform calls the silent 
majority-being discriminated against.
<P>
	It will come as no surprise to you, Madam Speaker, to learn that 
the committee met with officials of the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission, who told us that 55 per cent of available jobs were 
being held by people with the traditional white, able-bodied and 
non native profile, while only 45 per cent of the workforce actually 
fits this description. This results in a situation where individuals 
who belong to what the Reform Party calls the silent majority are 
holding 55 per cent of the jobs, when in fact they represent 45 per 
cent of the workforce. And they would have us believe that there is 
reverse discrimination?
<P>
	The truth of the matter is that, deep down, the Reform Party does 
not believe in employment equity. It does not believe that, on the 
job market as we know it today, certain people find it particularly 
difficult to find a place for themselves, and these are women, 
people with disabilities, native people and members of a visible 
minority. I think that the Reform Party should have the courage to 
say that it does not believe that these people are subject to any 
particular form of discrimination and that it is our duty to ensure 
that the four classes of persons referred to in this bill can find a 
place not available to them at present.
<P>
	When we look at statistics, there is cause for rejoicing but also 
cause for concern. On the bright side-and I am sure this will 
please the Hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Health-the labour force attachment of women did increase. You 
can see for yourself, statistics all say the same thing.
<P>
	This is also true, to a lesser extent, of people with disabilities, 
who probably account for seven or eight per cent of the workforce, 
while making up 15 per cent of the overall population.
<P>
	If you look at the situation of aboriginal peoples and members of 
visible minorities, you see that very little progress was made since 
1986, when the act was first implemented. There are still enormous 
problems which, it must be recognized, are often related to culture. 
However, the fact remains that there are groups which are 
significantly under-represented in the workforce, particularly 
aboriginal and disabled people, as well as members of visible 
minorities.
<P>
	We know, of course, what the Reform Party thinks of aboriginal 
peoples, and we will get back to that issue later on during the 
debate.
<P>
	The Bloc supports this bill and is particularly pleased that it also 
applies to the public service. Indeed, it was somewhat of a paradox 
to ask private sector employers to make efforts and produce annual 
reports, to meet objectives and related deadlines, without asking 
the public service to meet the same objectives and expectations. 
That approach was rather questionable. So, we are pleased to see 
that the government will impose the same employment equity 
objective to 300 crown corporations and to all the departments, 
through Treasury Board.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	We are not saying that the bill cannot be improved; in fact, we 
will discuss that issue when we look at the motions proposed by the 
Bloc. We have a number of concerns, particularly as regards the 
establishment of employment equity review tribunals.
<P>
	We were hoping that the bill would include provisions providing 
for the establishment of an employment equity review tribunal on 
the basis of the actual representation of the designated groups.
<P>
	As regards this issue, it must be said that the government was 
particularly narrow minded and stubborn in its approach, from the 
very beginning.
<P>
	Members have an opportunity to participate in the debate today, 
and I hope that Reform members will display the dignity and open 
mindedness that should guide every parliamentarian.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I want to address Motions Nos. 8, 9 and 10.
<P>
	It is interesting that in speaking for the first time on this bill at 
report stage I have just come from a meeting of the human rights 
committee. The committee is reviewing the process of the national 
strategy for the integration of persons with disabilities.
<P>
	One of the key statistics presented at that meeting was that over 
70 per cent of people with disabilities are not even in the labour 
force, that employment is a major factor in keeping close to 50 per 
cent of persons with disabilities below $10,000 in incomes in a 
year. These are people who happen to have a disability. It does not 
mean they have no ability.
<P>
	Employment equity goes to the very heart of why people in our 
country with substantial ability have not had an equal opportunity 
to participate in the labour force, in the economy and to be 
considered full, equal citizens in the matter of employment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15153"> 15153 </A></B>
<P>
	One only needs to look at the recent edition of <I>Canadian Social 
Trends</I> at an article on the employment of people with disabilities. 
More than half of young people with disabilities were 
unemployed.
<P>
	If we look at any of the designated groups, we know that as a 
society we have not been colour blind. We have not been blind to 
disabilities. We have not been blind to race and ethnic origins. We 
have not been blind to gender when it comes to employment.
<P>
	Bill C-64 is about getting rid of all those blinders that have 
somehow made us incapable of seeing the abilities of these people 
to contribute through employment, to earn and to be self-sufficient 
through employment.
<P>
	Let me speak to Motions Nos. 8, 9 and 10. They go to the heart of 
how we as a society monitor and how employers monitor how well 
they are doing in taking their blinders off when it comes to 
employment, promotion and training opportunities and being fully 
equal opportunity employers.
<P>
	I have great concern over these motions. I do not understand how 
members of the House and the public should no longer receive an 
annual report from the minister consolidating information that 
employers have already collected as required by the Employment 
Equity Act. It is not only the reception of that information by the 
minister, it is the public awareness of that information and the 
awareness of that information by Parliament that allows us to make 
good public policies.
<P>
	The impact of the amendments in Motions Nos. 8, 9 and 10 
would be extremely damaging to Bill C-64. If implemented they 
would remove the most effective tools we have to monitor 
employment equity performance of individual private sector 
employers. More to the point, they would eliminate the means for 
Parliament to chart progress in achieving workplace equality and to 
ensure accountability.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	The annual reporting requirement is as much about motivation as 
it is monitoring. We heard from numerous witnesses before the 
human rights committee about their experience over the last seven 
years with the Employment Equity Act. They said the Employment 
Equity Act had led them to take a look at their hiring practices, to 
improve their hiring practices and to eliminate discriminatory 
practices of which they had not been aware. Many of them said to 
us it had substantially improved their human resources 
management and the quality of their workforce.
<P>
	The reporting which the Reform Party seeks to eliminate allows 
employers the chance to see how they measure up against other 
employers. The information forms part of the criteria for targeting 
the advice and assistance to employers that human resources 
development will offer in strengthening those employers' 
employment equity programs. Far from being heavy  handed, the 
reports are an invaluable instrument to help government work more 
co-operatively, effectively and constructively with the private 
sector.
<P>
	Furthermore, the annual reports improve the functioning of our 
labour market by providing detailed information to organizations 
whose purpose is to place members of designated groups and other 
Canadians and improve their opportunity to participate in the 
workforce. These organizations use the information to assist their 
clients in targeting their job search and training programs.
<P>
	Equally critical, they have been of paramount importance in 
enabling legislators to assess the appropriateness of provisions of 
the act and the practical operation of employment equity legislation 
in the real working world. Many of the changes the bill before us 
makes to the Employment Equity Act, which has been in place 
since 1987, are the result of the experience over those seven to 
eight years and of the information received not only by the minister 
but by Parliament and by the public as to how the previous 
legislation was working.
<P>
	The yearly reports are our window into the workplace, providing 
data for research and evaluation of employment equity principles 
and methods. The insights we gain from this annual procedure are 
as useful to us as they are to Canadian employers, to labour and to 
members of designated groups. The major change in the bill is to 
include the Public Service of Canada. I hesitate to say that most 
segments of the private sector are doing better than the 
Government of Canada in their employment of people who have 
traditionally been disadvantaged in their employment advancement 
and training. We as a government have a great deal to learn from 
the private sector and we learn it largely through reports from the 
private sector.
<P>
	They serve another useful function. The minister's annual 
employment equity report is a major tool for public education on 
the principles and progress of employment equity in Canada, a 
major tool for keeping us accountable for our progress in allowing 
all Canadians to participate fully in all segments of society.
<P>
	Annual reports on measures taken and results achieved have 
been crucial as monitoring and motivational, dare I say 
self-motivational, measures in the private sector since 1986. They 
have recorded the steady progress the private sector has made in 
achieving a more equitable and representative Canadian workforce.
<P>
	They have however also focused our attention on areas of 
weakness, reinforcing the need for the new employment equity 
legislation we have before us today. Anyone who questions the 
need for these provisions in Bill C-64 need look no further than the 
latest statistics. Annual reports indicate that despite significant 
progress for some individuals in the designated groups much more 
remains to be done. I referred to some of those statistics this 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15154"> 15154 </A></B>
<P>
morning. I expect fully to refer to more for the other designated 
groups as this debate proceeds.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	The reports show that even for those members of the designated 
groups that were employed, most did not see the same wage gains 
and promotion opportunities of other Canadians. Women, 
aboriginal peoples, persons with disabilities and members of 
visible minorities continue to find themselves on the bottom rung 
of the economic and social ladder.
<P>
	Until we see parity in the workplace there will be an ongoing 
need for reporting to measure progress and to further progress. I 
therefore urge the House to reject the amendments put forward. 
Perhaps we sometimes do not like what we see when we report on 
ourselves, but it is important that we look in the mirror and 
improve the situation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak on Motions Nos. 8, 9 and 10 
of Bill C-64 which deals with the employment equity issue.
<P>
	I would like to say at the outset that the impassioned speech by 
the deputy whip illustrates many of the concerns we in this party 
have. We want to ensure that all people in this country have equal 
opportunity to become the best they can become for themselves 
and also their families.
<P>
	We are particularly concerned in the Reform Party about those 
individuals who are on the lower socioeconomic strata within our 
society, to identify why they are there and to give those people the 
tools and the opportunities that will enable them to stand on their 
own two feet and become economically self-sustaining so that they 
and their families can enjoy happier, more fruitful and productive 
lives.
<P>
	Employment equity does not do this. It is in fact highly 
discriminatory. It says to a group of people who are identified by 
the government that they cannot compete because of the colour of 
their skin, because of their gender, because of their religious 
background or wherever they came from. That is what it says. It is a 
government designation. It is also insulting.
<P>
	As a person who is made up of many different ethnic groups, and 
I am speaking for other people who are also from different ethnic 
groups, it is insulting to be told you are going to be hired on the 
basis of the colour of your skin. What does it say to that person? It 
says you cannot compete on the basis of merit, on the basis of your 
skills, on the basis of your qualities; therefore we in the 
government are going to do it for you. That, I submit to anybody, 
regardless of where they come from, is an insult.
<P>
	Employment equity is social engineering at its worst. It is the 
government meddling in areas it ought not to meddle in. As I said 
before, it is insulting to all minority groups.
<P>
	We know that governments cannot legislate on how people think. 
They must legislate against the expression of people's prejudices. 
We cannot legislate against what people think. We cannot legislate 
to the prejudices they hold within their heart. However, 
governments must legislate against the expression of those 
prejudices. That is the role of government: to ensure that those 
prejudices are not in the realm of employment, are not in the realm 
of living in a peaceful society within the beautiful country we have.
<P>
	The role of government, instead of employment equity which is 
really employment inequity, is in effect providing a level playing 
field for all people. The deputy whip just mentioned that the people 
in the lower socioeconomic groups are finding it extraordinarily 
difficult to get on their own two feet. That is absolutely true. So 
how do we address the problem? We ensure that prejudices are not 
being expressed in the workforce. We also ensure that those 
individuals have the opportunities to become the best they can 
become. Give them the skills training or provide them with the 
opportunities for skills training. Provide them with the 
opportunities for education. Provide them with the abilities to get a 
job. Provide them and everybody else with a strong economy.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	We must also as a government and as a country enforce 
anti-discriminatory laws. Those must be enforced strongly, and 
where discrimination occurs it must be quashed. That is the role of 
government.
<P>
	People do not realize that employment equity is highly 
destructive to the soul of a country. Nobody takes into 
consideration those people who are being jumped over for a 
promotion because of the colour of their skin. You cannot say to 
somebody from a minority group that they are going to get a job 
over somebody else who is a Caucasian, for example. Nobody 
takes into consideration what that does to the Caucasian person. It 
is discriminatory to that person or whoever might be in their seat.
<P>
	The only objective measure in getting a job is merit and merit 
alone. Anything else is discrimination. The social engineering this 
government wants to do is discriminatory in the highest extent. 
When I spoke about what it does to Canadian society, the 
government may not be aware of how divisive this policy is. I have 
received many letters in my riding. I do not know who they are 
from, but many individuals have said God bless you for saying that 
employment equity is divisive.
<P>
	What employment equity is doing is saying to people who are 
being jumped over for jobs and promotions that they are not getting 
them because of characteristics that  have absolutely nothing to do 
with merit. The characteristics that governments would apply to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15155"> 15155 </A></B>
<P>
employment equity to ensure that subgroupings of people will get 
jobs have nothing to do with merit. Colour, gender, religious 
affiliation have nothing to do with merit and everything to do with 
discrimination. It is by its very nature discriminatory.
<P>
	I hope we will not follow through with this. I hope the 
government supports these motions and helps to develop more 
sense and sensibility over an issue that is very sensitive.
<P>
	I would reiterate that we in this party are very sensitive to the 
individuals who are the most dispossessed in our society. We want 
to create a stronger economy so that they can fulfil their potential. 
We want to ensure that people will get the proper education. We 
want to ensure that they get the skills necessary to stand on their 
own feet. We want to ensure that they and their children are going 
to live in a safe environment.
<P>
	I hope the government will join with us in ultimately putting 
aside and eliminating employment equity, which says to people and 
to companies that we need a certain number of quotas of these 
groupings of individuals because the law says it must be so, rather 
than advancing those people on the basis of merit. It also is highly 
destructive to an economy. If you advance people on the basis of 
characteristics other than merit, you actually weaken the economy 
ultimately.
<P>
	Employment equity is prejudicial. It is discriminatory. I hope 
this government throws it away, as has been done in other parts of 
the world, such as in California and in Ontario.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise in 
the House today to debate Motions 15, 16 and 17 put forth by the 
hon. member for Edmonton Southwest with respect to Bill C-64.
<P>
	When we consider the number of amendments the members of 
the Reform Party have presented to the House on this bill, it is clear 
that their attempt is to weaken the effectiveness of the Employment 
Equity Act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canadians often wonder whether there are differences between 
political ideologies. I would encourage them to listen to this debate 
because they will see that there are enormous differences. My 
colleague has just made the claim that this program is divisive. It 
can be divisive, yes, particularly when it is claimed that this was its 
intended purpose, when the reasons such a program was created are 
ignored.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is regrettable that the employment equity legislation is not 
looked upon by my colleagues from the Reform Party as it is 
intended to be. They do not see that it will make this nation a fairer 
one in the way in which we treat Canadians. The unfairness and the 
divisiveness occurs when people suggest that is what it does. This 
legislation is something we should be proud of, not something we 
should be running away from.
<P>
	With regard to Motions Nos. 15, 16 and 17, the hon. member is 
calling upon the government to eliminate provisions that are 
integral to administering the act's monetary penalty system. To do 
so would automatically eliminate the benefits inherent in such a 
system. It would be like telling the referees at a hockey game that 
they can call penalties but they cannot put anyone in the penalty 
box. Without these provisions it would be impossible to ensure that 
those private sector employees subject to the act fulfill their 
obligations with regard to reporting requirements. It should be 
noted that the monetary penalty system only applies in cases of 
non-compliance with the reporting requirements in the act.
<P>
	Motion No. 15 calls for the deletion of clause 38. Clause 38 
gives employers the option of either paying the assessed penalty or 
asking for an independent third party review, namely by an 
employment equity tribunal. Clause 38 provides employers with 
access to an open and fair appeal.
<P>
	Motion No. 16 calls for the deletion of clause 39. This clause 
combines the appeal and review mechanisms. An employer can 
apply for the tribunal to review the assessed penalty or the 
commission can take further action if an employer has neither paid 
the assessment on time nor asked for a review.
<P>
	Motion No. 17 calls for the deletion of clause 40. This clause is 
necessary to enable the commission to take a negligent employer to 
federal court to collect an unpaid assessment. If we remove the 
ability to take this action, it will mean removing the possibility of 
applying a just penalty to employers who are in contravention.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to stress once again that the system of monetary 
penalties applies only in cases of non-compliance with the 
reporting requirements. Only then. To date the only mechanism 
available to us for ensuring compliance with the reporting 
requirement has been recourse to criminal proceedings, an 
unwieldy process.
<P>
	This system costs less and is less unwieldy and easier on 
everyone concerned. For the reporting requirement to make any 
sense the statute must include an enforcement mechanism. It is 
totally illogical to set out monetary penalties without any means of 
implementing those penalties.
<P>
	If the government were to adopt the proposed amendments under 
those circumstances, the reporting requirement would be 
unenforceable. This is why I cannot support the hon. member's 
motions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15156"> 15156 </A></B>
<P>
	I would ask my colleagues in the Reform Party to look at the 
government's intentions and motivation not just with open minds 
but with open eyes as well. The intent is not to divide but to ensure 
representation for the under-represented, to ensure that they are 
taken into account. We are all aware that in the present system 
those who are not as strong as others are not always treated in 
a fair and equitable manner.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am delighted to debate the motions before us.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	By way of introduction I call on the attention particularly of the 
Reform Party, which participated in the committee on human rights 
and the status of disabled persons, the committee I had the 
privilege to chair and the committee that looked into this issue. The 
members of the Reform Party on that committee have to admit as a 
matter of truth that the vast majority of witnesses who appeared 
before our committee were truly in support of the Employment 
Equity Act.
<P>
	In other words, we strengthened what exists to include a wider 
coverage of the public sector and we instituted an enforcement 
mechanism.
<P>
	We have called our report ``Employment Equity: A Commitment 
to Merit'' to give a very clear message. I submit the Reform Party 
has to be reminded that the cross-section of witnesses regardless of 
their position on legislated employment equity all agreed on at 
least four points, all of which we agree with. The skills and abilities 
to perform a job are essential. Fairness in employment practices is 
a necessity. Elimination of employment barriers helps ensure 
applicants can compete on an equal footing. In principle 
employment equity and therefore a realization of diversity is 
crucial.
<P>
	However, we believe Canada, a country committed to social 
justice, must have these sentiments in policy. What better way to 
show that than to put these sentiments, that commitment, into a 
piece of law? That is the ultimate sense of a commitment to 
fairness and equality. We have succeeded in having a committee 
which included the participation of members of the Reform Party.
<P>
	If I honestly believed the motions we are now debating would 
clearly improve and strengthen this act I would support them but I 
think we can see these are only attempts to emasculate this piece of 
legislation. I feel they are trying to mislead Canadians. No one is 
being discriminated against in this employment equity law. We 
would only ensure that discrimination does not happen. In other 
words, we have the force of law. If only employers would comply 
with the principle of equity, and the vast majority do, then there 
would be nothing to fear.
<P>
	Here we have enshrined in our Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms equality for all. However, even the charter in a 
subsection of section 15 ensures we must have the ability as the 
Government of Canada to adopt policies and programs and pass 
legislation that give teeth to the principle of equality for these 
disadvantaged groups: women, people with disabilities, people of 
First Nations and people designated as visible minorities.
<P>
	I am really disheartened the members opposite could not see that 
we must have a centrepiece for our social equity, this piece of 
legislation on employment equity. This is really looked on as a 
hallmark by the people of the world, making Canada a unique 
nation where we exalt the importance of excellence in human 
endeavour while at the same time being committed to disallowing a 
retreat from that. This is not about reverse discrimination. This is 
not about redressing the injustices of the past. This is ensuring once 
and for all the injustices of the past do not recur.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to the motions put 
forward by the Reform Party on Bill C-64. This bill concerns me 
very much. The government certainly has Canadians' best interests 
at heart in this bill. It is attempting to redress problems in the 
workplace.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	However, I find myself giving some qualified support to 
Motions Nos. 8, 9 and 10 and Motions Nos. 15 to 17. These 
motions would eliminate clauses 18, 19 and 20 from the bill which 
are basically targeted toward private sector employers.
<P>
	I have great respect for colleagues on all sides of the House who 
have spoken on this subject because it is a subject we all feel very 
deeply about. I have serious reservations about implementing an 
employment equity program first for government employees and 
then extending it by whatever means to private sector employees.
<P>
	The problems with clauses 18, 19 and 20 are they require very 
elaborate reporting from private sector employers about their 
equity programs and as addressed in Motions Nos. 15 to 17, 
provide penalties if they do not comply.
<P>
	Private sector employers are required to give salary ranges of 
their employees who are in the designated group, the degree of 
representation of these designated persons, and it goes on about 
various subdivisions in order to give the government an 
opportunity to establish whether private sector employers are 
fulfilling the intentions of the act in their employment practices.
<P>
	While the act unequivocally says decision by merit will be the 
underlying principle, unfortunately the way it is phrased it gives 
discretion to bureaucrats to determine whether an employer is 
fulfilling the obligations as described in clauses 18, 19 and 20. This 
sets us on a  dangerous course for our social liberties as a country. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15157"> 15157 </A></B>
<P>
However well intended we are, this does create the opportunity for 
bureaucracies to determine what private employers are doing.
<P>
	I hate to use the extreme case, but we would have a situation akin 
to big brother. Any bureaucrat may interpret the legislation. No 
matter how well phrased, there is an opportunity for interpretation. 
Unfortunately there could be a degree of political correctness, 
although I hate to use that term as well. There could be a mindset in 
the bureaucracy of a less generous interpretation of how private 
sector employers are treating visible minorities, women, the 
disabled and other designated groups.
<P>
	This becomes very crucial when penalty is added. This is 
covered by Motions Nos. 15 to 17. Clause 36 of the act provides for 
a penalty of up to $10,000 for a first violation and $50,000 for a 
repeated or for continued violations. These violations involve 
failure to report or failure to fully meet the criteria in other 
legislation.
<P>
	I have great difficulty with that because when we apply penalties 
the misdemeanour should be very clear. It should never be open to 
interpretation. It is my fear that as the bill is written it does put an 
unfortunate and undue obligation on private sector employers.
<P>
	I recently came from the private sector and I can assure members 
that while the public sector may be behind in its treatment and 
hiring of designated groups, most private sector employers I know 
hire on merit and certainly try to represent all groups that come 
forward, and not in a discriminatory fashion.
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	It is very dangerous to think we can legislate away 
discrimination.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Training 
and Youth), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find myself increasingly 
frustrated by the many roadblocks the Reform Party is attempting 
to erect to circumvent this important piece of legislation. This 
piece of legislation is good for Canada and for all Canadians. As 
parliamentarians we have an opportunity to do the right thing and 
this legislation will do that.
<P>
	For all who believe in the principles of democracy and the noble 
ideals of this institution, the Employment Equity Act is a welcome 
reminder of the values we hold dear as a nation. It is an affirmation 
that Canadians are just and honourable people who passionately 
believe in fairness and dignity for all.
<P>
	To those of us who are members of the designated groups, 
employment equity is about human decency and democracy. It is 
not about inequity. It is not about getting more than your fair share. 
It is about equity. It is the freedom to exercise our constitutionally 
guaranteed rights to participate in the political process and to make  
contributions to the economic and cultural fabric of Canada.
<P>
	My expertise on this matter lies in my life and professional work 
experience and growing up in a northern aboriginal community 
where the chances were far greater that I would walk the halls of a 
penitentiary than the corridors of Parliament. That is why the 
Reform Party's damaging amendments disturb me so deeply. They 
would seriously weaken the intent and impact of the legislation.
<P>
	Of all the ill conceived amendments proposed by my hon. 
colleague, none concerns me more than Motion No. 6. If adopted 
this amendment would diminish Bill C-64 by deleting the 
aboriginal employers exemption in clause 7. It would remove the 
provision that allows an employer engaged primarily in promoting 
and serving the interests of aboriginal peoples to give preference in 
employment to aboriginal peoples unless that preference 
constitutes a discriminatory practice under the Canadian Human 
Rights Act.
<P>
	In practical terms this means the act would not allow municipal 
bands on Indian reserves to give preference to the hiring of 
aboriginal peoples, perhaps the most disadvantaged of the groups 
the legislation is attempting to assist.
<P>
	It is a well known fact that many non-aboriginal peoples work in 
and around large populated areas of aboriginal people. That has 
been historically so and still is in some cases. It should be the intent 
of all parliamentarians to change that and make accessible 
employment opportunities and training in other labour market 
related areas available for aboriginal peoples. There is nothing 
wrong with that.
<P>
	Indian band councils that employ more than 100 workers are 
subject to the Employment Equity Act. I want to be clear that this 
provision does not relieve aboriginal employers of the obligation to 
hire aboriginal women and/or persons with disabilities.
<P>
	I remind the House that aboriginal peoples of Canada have a 
unique constitutional status affirmed in section 35. These 
agreements are done through the British parliamentary system as 
we have it here. These agreements are recognized nationally and 
internationally. This status demands special consideration for 
measures aimed at enhancing their cultural, economic and political 
autonomy. It rejects no one.
<P>
	Historically, as I have stated, many aboriginal communities and 
populations have been served by non-aboriginal people, and well in 
many cases. There have been problems but that is not the issue. The 
issue is fairness.
<P>
	Perhaps most important, this motion goes against the very grain 
of the Liberal commitment to self-government. We are determined 
to give greater autonomy to aboriginal communities and to put the 
running of  aboriginal affairs in aboriginal peoples' hands. Why 
not? We have struggled with it as governments for 125 years. There 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15158"> 15158 </A></B>
<P>
are many problems. The aboriginal people should have the 
opportunity to serve themselves and to serve themselves well. They 
should at least have the opportunity to make their own decisions.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	Clause 7 of Bill C-64 supports the aspirations of aboriginal 
communities for economic self-sufficiency and self-determination. 
It simply confirms that aboriginal organizations may hire only 
aboriginals, provided such a hiring is justified under the Canadian 
Human Rights Act.
<P>
	I must confess that I am very surprised that the Reform Party 
would take the position it has on Motion No. 6. One can only 
assume it is based on a profound lack of awareness of the plight of 
aboriginal peoples in the country. It is no secret that members on 
the opposite side of the Chamber are not in favour of employment 
equity. We know that. However, from my reading of their minority 
report, it appears that they still believe the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission has an important role to play.
<P>
	There is a certain irony in the Reform's proposition. First is the 
fact that the commission's chair, Max Yalden, expressed his 
support for clause 7 when he appeared before the Standing 
Committee on Human Rights and the Status of Disabled Persons. 
In response to a specific question about the exemption he said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I think that aboriginal groups are a particularly disadvantaged group, a 
special group. The idea that native groups would, in their very special and 
particular situation, have a preferential hiring policy is not unreasonable.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There is another technical reason why clause 7 cannot be 
removed from the act. It is to ensure consistency with the Canadian 
Human Rights Act. I can only conclude, as did the commissioners 
in the Canadian Human Rights Commission annual report last year, 
that occasionally the tone of the opposition to employment equity 
seems more than a little shrill.
<P>
	Thus far I have outlined the logical and legal arguments to reject 
the Reform Party's proposal. Far more potent are the facts of 
everyday life for the aboriginal peoples of the country. 
Discrimination is not an abstract, philosophical concept for 
disadvantaged Canadians. Abuse of power by a privileged few is 
the daily reality for members of the designated groups, particularly 
if they are aboriginal.
<P>
	I challenge the hon. member to test the merits of his motion on 
members of aboriginal communities, especially those who are 
unemployed. Unemployment is very high. On some reserves where 
there are few employment opportunities the unemployment rate 
can rise as high as 95 per cent.
<P>
	Tragically, aboriginal peoples account for the most disturbing 
rate of suicide. It is five times the national  average. Let us think of 
the communities of Pangnirtung, the Whitedog reserve and 
Shamattawa, some communities in which we have seen many 
young people commit suicide. Not only do my people have the 
highest rates of suicide in the country but they are the highest in the 
world.
<P>
	At the other end of the scale aboriginal people have the lowest 
incomes in Canada. Almost one-half of all aboriginal adults have 
incomes of less than $10,000. Not coincidentally they face far more 
crowded housing conditions. Twenty-nine per cent of non-reserve 
aboriginals live in housing with more than one person per room, 
compared with just 2 per cent of the general population. The rate is 
31 per cent for Inuit people.
<P>
	There is a corresponding high welfare dependency rate as well. It 
is 43 per cent on reserves, or almost five times the national 
population, and over 50 per cent among the off reserve population.
<P>
	I am sure the Reform Party knows we share its view that it is 
better for people to be working. It is better for aboriginal people to 
become independent and self-sustaining than to be on welfare. It is 
better that we make these opportunities available than to slam 
doors in their faces so that progress cannot be made where help is 
needed.
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	Young aboriginal people are the most likely to drop out of 
school, to become teenage parents and to abuse substances such as 
alcohol, drugs and even solvents. With only 3 per cent of aboriginal 
teens completing high school, they have the highest illiteracy rates 
and lowest incomes in the country. Not surprisingly, more graduate 
from juvenile courts than from colleges or universities.
<P>
	I would never deny the successes. We have made some progress. 
I am willing to stand here and admit there has been progress. 
However it is not enough, not at this point.
<P>
	We have many graduates coming out of universities and 
colleges. For those who manage to rise above the daunting 
disadvantages, the thousands of aboriginal men and women who 
acquire university degrees and professional skills each year, 
employment opportunities still do not match their availability. The 
unemployment rate of aboriginal peoples with university degrees is 
nearly double that of white males with university educations.
<P>
	That is a fact. That is the truth. It is undeniable. Those highly 
skilled and highly trained individuals are desperately needed in 
their communities. That is why the act exempts aboriginal 
organizations from provisions which might prohibit them from 
hiring these invaluable employees.
<P>
	In conclusion, it is a lamentable commentary on Canadian 
society that the odds are stacked against far too  many aboriginal 
people. With Bill C-64 we can start to turn the statistics around. 
Centuries of inappropriate and damaging policies developed and 
administered predominantly by non-aboriginals have taught us that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15159"> 15159 </A></B>
<P>
it is time to let the Indian, Inuit and Metis people take control of 
their own destiny.
<P>
	That is why we need clause 7 in Bill C-64. The focus of federal 
policies is on seizing opportunities. The agents of change are 
individuals, because we are convinced that with the right support 
individuals can help themselves. That philosophy is at the heart of 
the aboriginal employers' exemption clause. A majority of 
Canadians recognize-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. It is with the greatest 
of reluctance that I interrupt the minister, but at this stage of debate 
the allocation is for 10 minutes. I would seek the guidance of the 
House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Could we 
have the consent of the House for the minister to wrap up her 
remarks on this matter in a couple of minutes?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It might be helpful if the 
minister could give the Chair some indication of how much longer 
she would need to conclude her remarks. If it is less than a minute, 
is there unanimous consent for the minister to conclude her 
remarks?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to all 
members of the House for allowing me to complete my remarks.
<P>
	A majority of Canadians recognize the terrible plight of 
aboriginal peoples and realize that for constitutional, social and 
moral reasons special efforts are necessary to reverse their 
misfortune.
<P>
	I am proud that I count myself among them. I urge all like 
minded members of the House to defeat the draconian motion to 
ensure that we remain the majority and do the right thing by 
leaving the doors of opportunity open for aboriginal peoples.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. This 
morning the hon. member for Nanaimo-Cowichan proposed, in 
relation to Private Members' Business today, that private 
members' hour not be proceeded with, with the intention of having 
his motion that was to be debated this afternoon dropped to the 
bottom of the order of precedence.
<P>
	I understand there is some misunderstanding concerning what he 
meant this morning. I think Your Honour would find that it was 
clear to all, except perhaps the Table and the Chair, the intention as 
discussed this morning was that the item would drop to the bottom 
of the order of precedence and we would proceed with private 
members' hour tomorrow in the usual way.
<P>
	I simply rise to clarify that point and if consent of the House is 
required, to seek it.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I thank the hon. 
parliamentary secretary for his clarification. We all understood that 
the point raised by the hon. member for Nanaimo-Cowichan with 
regard to the Private Members' Business listed for later this day 
was that it be dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence. I 
would seek the agreement of the House. Is that correct?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> And so ordered.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of the amendment of my colleague from Edmonton 
Southwest to delete application of the bill in the private sector and 
to speak not only in favour of the amendment but against the 
employment equity notion and concept completely.
<P>
	One of the things that frustrated me this morning in listening to 
the debate was that very few government members are looking at 
the issues and countering the points of view presented against 
employment equity. Rather they have chosen to be meanspirited. 
They have chosen to Reform bash and make this a party issue. I 
take exception to that. I take exception to the member for York 
North who rose in his place earlier today and called the Reform 
Party meanspirited.
<P>
	I come from the private sector. I have run businesses for 25 
years. I have hired and fired many people, male and female, and 
have had people work for me of various colours and of various 
ethnic backgrounds. I think I am a tough taskmaster but I am not 
meanspirited. I am an employer with a heart and with compassion. 
I believe in paying people a good day's wage for a good day's work.
<P>
	I am against the government-union philosophy that once people 
get a job in government they cannot be let go and have a right to 
work. That is not correct. It is not available in the private sector. 
Also it is unacceptable in the private sector to have government 
intrude into our lives with more and more regulations.
<P>
	Employment equity does that very thing. It tries to get into the 
lives of corporations and tries to dictate to them whom they have to 
hire and why they have to hire them. It is doing nothing more than 
social and economic engineering which this party stands against.
<P>
	It is not meanspirited to be against employment equity. It is not 
meanspirited to point out to the member for York North that we 
believe the best person available for the job should be hired for the 
job. If those best people are 10 black people, then they should be 
hired. If it is 10 white people, then they should be hired. If it is 10 
native Indians, then they should be hired.
<P>
	If the government tells the employer that he has to hire based on 
a quota because the demographics of the  census it has taken says 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15160"> 15160 </A></B>
<P>
that Canada is made up of certain colours and certain percentages 
of people that his business has to hire on that basis, then it is 
basically forcing corporations in a lot of cases to hire people who 
are not as qualified.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Nonsense.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I hear the member opposite say: ``Nonsense''. My 
argument is that whether people are male, female, black, white, 
yellow, red or green as the member for Edmonton Southwest said, 
it does not matter. They should apply for the job. If they have the 
training and the qualifications they will get hired.
<P>
	The employer should be free to hire. Is that not freedom? Is that 
not freedom of choice? Is that not in the charter of rights? What 
rights do employers have?
<P>
	We are trying to make a better system for the country. We are 
trying to encourage people. It is equal opportunity that is 
important. It is on equal opportunity that certain members of the 
government are missing the point. They fail to see that we are 
looking for introducing and encouraging businesses to hire the best 
person for the job but to give the black, the white, the Indian, the 
yellow or whatever race, equal opportunity to be interviewed for 
the job. That is the kind of legislation from which we need to 
protect people. Those are the kinds of regulations that perhaps we 
could introduce into our system to make sure that everybody has an 
equal opportunity. If they do not, then they are discriminated 
against and then we should do something about it.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	Employers cannot be legislated to hire certain types of people 
because of quotas. That is not meanspirited. That is right spirited. 
That is trying to put the heart and the mind in the right place to do 
the right thing for the right people, both employers and employees.
<P>
	The government is interfering once again in corporate Canada by 
bringing in regulations and red tape it has no business doing. 
Government is better off doing other things, such as balancing the 
budget and getting us out of debt. That is the problem. Government 
wants to add to it at 3 per cent of GDP per year. The deficit is not 
the problem, the debt is. Legislation such as this is going to make it 
more difficult and more inefficient for corporations to operate and 
function.
<P>
	In my years as an employer in the private sector, I have 
interviewed and hired a lot of people who are disadvantaged. I have 
hired people who were mentally handicapped. They did a good job 
in delivering internal documentation. Our encouraging them, 
working with them and seeing them grow in spirit, heart and mind 
was an encouragement and a boost for all of us. I did not need 
legislation to do that. Nobody ordered me to hire this gentleman.
<P>
	In a company I still own, there is currently an individual who is 
physically handicapped. He is short and one leg is shorter than the 
other. He is just one heck of a good draftsman. He is a great spirit 
around the office and fun to have. I have hired males, females, 
francophones. I have hired a Czechoslovakian who can barely 
speak English. Nobody ordered me to do this.
<P>
	I am saying this as a representative of the private sector, which I 
believe I am. I am about the average of the private sector. Certainly 
there are some people in the private sector who would take 
advantage of the rules but I would say the majority of people, 
which I represent, do not need legislation like this to tell them 
whom to hire and why to hire them. They are going to look for 
competent people, people who are going to fit into the mould of 
their corporations and their companies.
<P>
	To have this arbitrary law that says that you must now, Mr. Silye, 
interview people of this nature and this type because of the census 
is wrong. It says this is the only classification you can look for, 
when perhaps the very types of people I am being ordered to hire do 
not have the training or the background to do that particular job.
<P>
	Let us stick to the issues. Let us not bash the Liberal Party, the 
Reform Party. Let us talk about the merits and the demerits, the 
pluses and the minuses of employment equity. That is a debate. 
That is what the people are here to hear. That is what Canadians 
want to know about. Is it a good thing or is it a bad thing?
<P>
	I stand today in my place to say I think it is a bad thing. If other 
hon. members feel it is a good thing, let them say why they think it 
is good. Let me say why I think it is bad. Let us not get into Reform 
bashing and the meanspirited kind of crap that is going on which 
leads to unparliamentary language. Let us just stick to the issue.
<P>
	One of the biggest weaknesses of the government's argument 
and that of the individuals who represent employment equity is that 
in the name of introducing equity and equality they are, and I hope 
they can see this, introducing a form of inequality, a form of 
inequity that discriminates reversely against the very 
discrimination they claim they are trying to avoid.
<P>
	It is the same with the Income Tax Act which is convoluted, 
complicated and confusing. In the name of clarification, in the 
name of fairness, in the name of equity the government has 
introduced 1,000 plus pages of rulings and amendments to clarify 
the Income Tax Act. By adding another 1,000 pages is that 
clarifying it or is that confusing it even more? It is making it worse 
and worse and worse. It is the same kind of thing that is going on 
with this bill. By preaching and supporting employment equity the 
Liberals are introducing more legislation, more rules that make it 
more confusing, more convoluted, more complicated. It is a 
detriment to business. It is a detriment to the hard working citizens 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15161"> 15161 </A></B>
<P>
of the country who want to move forward and get on with  the job 
of stimulating the economy. At every turn another government law 
comes in with more red tape, more regulations, more rules to 
follow, more auditors. Now we are going to have people auditors.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	It is bad enough that Revenue Canada is checking our books 
every frigging month. It is bad enough that Revenue Canada is 
interpreting the rules for the government because we need money.
<P>
	Let me remind all those people at Revenue Canada it is not the 
deficit that is the problem. Let me remind the Government of 
Canada it is not the deficit that is the problem. The debt is the 
problem and the government is adding to it. High taxes are the 
problem and the government is adding to that. It is bad regulations, 
lousy rules like this, terrible laws like this which are the problem. 
The government is not listening. It is continually adding to the 
problem.
<P>
	I understand it is in the hearts of Liberals. I know they believe 
what they are saying comes from the heart and they feel it is 
helping Canadians. I believe when they say they are trying to 
eliminate discrimination that they are honest and sincere about it. 
But I am saying that in so doing they are not really eliminating 
discrimination, they are introducing a new form of discrimination. 
That is what is wrong. That is what I ask the government to 
reconsider.
<P>
	This amendment deals with the private sector. I hope members 
opposite will agree it has been a good employer, has promoted the 
economy. Eighty-five per cent of revenue generated in tax dollars 
comes from the private sector. At least leave it alone.
<P>
	If the government really believes in the legislation, then just 
apply it to the government sector. It can do what it wants with the 
bureaucracy. That is their baby. Do it, try it and see the inequities 
that will be introduced. But please support the amendment because 
it leaves one sector of the economy that can function viably well 
and will not in any way deter or detract from the intent of the bill. I 
know how the private sector thinks, acts and deals. It usually hires 
the best person regardless of race, colour, creed or whatever.
<P>
	If the government is intent on introducing employment equity, 
go ahead and do it in the public sector. Go ahead and do it with the 
bureaucrats and watch the uprising that will occur. I know a lot of 
people in the bureaucracy are not happy with the form of 
affirmative action that is taking place right now.
<P>
	I am asking the government to reconsider its opposition to the 
amendment and do something constructive. It can have it both 
ways. By accepting this amendment it can go ahead with the bill, if 
it is just applied to the public sector and leave the private sector 
alone. Then we will see which will end up being right.
<P>
	I believe the bill is an intrusion into our lives. It is an intrusion 
which the government does not need to do. It is an intrusion it 
would be better off to avoid and leave alone. I believe that 
employers can be trusted. I know that for the most part private 
sector employers, the vast majority, can be trusted.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I know you have a great interest in hockey. Does it 
discriminate against players from all over the world? No. It sought 
to change the rules, to bring in the best hockey players in the world. 
We have a National Hockey League that has every nationality 
playing on it. Was there employment equity introduced in that 
profession? No. We do not need employment equity. I stand against 
employment equity. I stand for this amendment and for equal 
opportunity for all.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, over the summer I spent my time in my riding of 
Windsor-St. Clair which is the centre of my universe.
<P>
	I returned to this session of Parliament with a renewed 
commitment to employment equity. I am convinced more than ever 
that Bill C-64 is the right thing for Canada right now. I am 
concerned though, after meeting with my constituents over the 
summer recess, that there is a great deal of misunderstanding about 
both the intent and the implications of our improved employment 
equity legislation.
<P>
	Distortions have resulted from a misinterpretation and frankly, a 
misrepresentation of the facts by a few. I have discovered that once 
these misconceptions are straightened out and the legislation fully 
understood, it gains widespread support. It seems to be essential 
that these misconceptions be corrected on the floor of the House.
<P>
	I specifically want to address several of the arguments raised in 
the Reform Party's minority report. I am particularly concerned 
about the attitude that report reflects, the ``I'm all right, I have got 
mine, Jack'' attitude. I have mine so everyone else can go to hell. 
That is the tone of the Reform Party's minority report. The idea in 
it is that I got ahead and so everyone else should just try to get there 
on their own. I do not owe it to anybody to help them or to assist 
them or to do anything.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	It is disingenuous for a woman to suggest that because she is 
successful, got there on her own, she owes nothing to her sisters 
who came before her. It is disingenuous for any of us to suggest 
that anyone can get to this job, can become an accountant, can 
become a banker or can become a painter. It is disingenuous, false 
and deludes the Canadian public.
<P>
	The idea that as Canadians we should not acknowledge and 
address systemic inequities and that in promoting that view it is 
okay to promulgate misinformation and to promote misconceptions 
is anathema to the government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15162"> 15162 </A></B>
<P>
	The first assumption I would like to address is the assumption 
that women, persons with disabilities, members of visible 
minorities and aboriginal people are somehow enjoying special 
privileges that compensate for their disadvantage and that are way 
ahead of the general population. Informed individuals know that 
nothing could be further from the truth.
<P>
	The 1995 United Nations human development report concluded 
that it is still an unequal world. Canada in practice is still in many 
respects an unequal country. Canadian employers agree with this.
<P>
	A witness representing the Manitoba telephone system told 
members of the Standing Committee on Human Rights and the 
Status of Disabled Persons the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There is very little evidence in the workforce to suggest that in the absence of 
affirmative measures or some intervention equality will indeed occur. We live in 
a society that prefers some values, some characteristics over others. The kind of 
legislation that employment equity represents is an appropriate intervention in 
the flow of business decision making.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That was stated by the private sector.
<P>
	There was also the suggestion that the current Employment 
Equity Act has been so effective that it has eliminated employment 
problems for members of the designated groups. The facts speak 
for themselves.
<P>
	The 1984 annual report on the Employment Equity Act, a copy 
of which all members of Parliament received, concluded that a 
number of Canadian companies covered by the legislation have yet 
to completely satisfy its intent. Of the 343 employers in the report, 
four employers had no female employees; 74 did not employ a 
single aboriginal person; 65 did not have persons with disabilities 
on staff; 28 employed no members of visible minority groups. This 
was the situation nearly eight years after the current act was 
proclaimed into force in August 1986.
<P>
	Like other government members here today, I certainly applaud 
the progress that has been made over the years, but I think all 
members will agree that we have some distance to go.
<P>
	Let us look at the suggestion that the market automatically 
solves inequities without government intervention, a suggestion 
that was heard from the last speaker. That theory was clearly 
addressed in the recently released United Nations report, the most 
exhaustive examination of the issue of inequality for women in our 
time. It was prepared by an international team of eminent 
consultants and stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The free workings of economic and political processes are unlikely to deliver 
equality of opportunity because of the prevailing inequities in power structures. 
When such structural barriers exist, government intervention is necessary, both 
through comprehensive policy reforms and through a series of affirmative 
actions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I remind the House that Canada is the number one nation in the 
world in its human development index ranking according to the 
UN. However, when we look at it closer and consider women's 
economic positions in our society, our country drops from number 
one to number nine.
<P>
	To add insult to injury, there are some who use women, members 
of visible minority groups, aboriginals and persons with disabilities 
as scapegoats as if we were somehow to blame for the stresses 
resulting from our rapidly changing economy.
<P>
	We are in the midst of one of the most momentous transitions in 
human history. In the span of this century we have shifted through 
the agricultural and industrial eras and are hurtling fast forward to 
the information age and the knowledge economy. If the general 
population finds itself a victim in this vortex, imagine how much 
greater the impact is on Canadians who are members of minority 
groups, on women, on persons with disabilities.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	It is not fair to suggest, as the Reform minority report does, that 
statistical data are skewed to make the case for employment equity. 
Canada's statistics and its statistical analyses are the best in world, 
so much so that our data is sought after by governments and by 
academics everywhere. It is true that no statistics are perfect, 
including those for gross domestic product, unemployment, or 
demographics. But does the Reform Party seriously suggest that we 
should abandon the pursuit of social justice and abandon the 
pursuit of economic growth just because there are numerous ways 
to read the numbers?
<P>
	Incredibly, the Reform Party report also asserts that employment 
equity somehow hurts designated groups. It suggests that 
designation ``carries with it a presumption of racial and gender 
inferiority''. I would like to hear the Reform Party stand before 
Women in Trades and Technology, who organized a letter writing 
campaign in support of Bill C-64, and say that. Letters to the 
human resources minister urged the government to go further. 
Many letters stated that much work needs to be done to urge, 
coerce, educate, and assist employers and unions to increase and 
enhance women's opportunities to train and work in their 
industries.
<P>
	These women are asking the government to modify policy and 
program interventions to support and encourage true equality in the 
workplace. They are not alone. In case somebody thinks they are 
alone, let me remind the Reform Party and this House that women 
are 52 per cent of the population.
<P>
	The vast majority of witnesses before the Standing Committee 
on Human Rights and the Status of Disabled Persons fully endorsed 
the direction of our new legislation. They recognize that treating 
people differently in order to achieve equality has nothing to do  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15163"> 15163 </A></B>
<P>
with inferiority. It has everything to do with ensuring each and 
every job applicant has an equal chance to prove his or her abilities.
<P>
	Recently I saw a cartoon that showed a monkey, a seal, an 
elephant and a dog being told by a circus job interviewer: ``For a 
just selection, everyone has to take the same examination. Now 
please, I would like each of you to climb that tree''. The idea that 
there is some ideal to which we all must conform is ridiculous. It is 
also discriminatory, and Canadians will not put up with it. If this 
legislation does nothing else, it will finally put some of these 
outdated and damaging beliefs to rest. It will ensure that yet 
another generation does not adopt the hardened attitudes held by 
their elders and perpetuate systemic and overt discrimination.
<P>
	Employment equity is a guarantee that every little girl and every 
little boy will grow up in this country secure in the knowledge that 
each can pursue his or her dreams, that they will some day work in 
a world that is fair, that is equal, that is free of racial slurs and 
unwanted pats on the backside, where doors are always open 
instead of being inaccessible. They will be assured of being 
citizens of a Canada where they can have a fighting chance of 
achieving their personal career goals.
<P>
	Is that intrusive? Is it really so much to ask? Today's working 
Canadians and tomorrow's future parents, taxpayers, and 
employees expect no less. The hon. members of this House must 
not let them down.
<P>
	I am convinced that Bill C-64 is the next logical step in our 
nation's progress. I am anxious to get on with the job.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
the House to speak to report stage of Bill C-64, in particular the 
motions being given today by the third party, the Reform Party.
<P>
	Some of what I have heard here in the House troubles me a great 
deal, which is why I thought it only appropriate that I rise and try to 
put down some of the myths that are being put forward by the third 
party through these motions. I was likewise distressed with a 
colleague of mine, the member for Hamilton-Wentworth.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	We heard, and I will quote as closely as I can, the member for 
Hamilton-Wentworth say that the bureaucracy should not be 
intervening in the matters of private enterprise. We heard that the 
government is being intrusive, according to the member for 
Calgary Centre, and I will try to quote him as closely as I can: ``I 
have chosen as a member myself to be meanspirited, but the 
government is trying to get into the face and get into the lives of 
private enterprise''. Those are pretty meanspirited remarks coming 
from the member for Calgary Centre.
<P>
	It is the job of government to ensure that things are done as 
properly as they can be, as we work as a team for Canada and what 
is in the best interests of the people of this great land. For example, 
when we talk about getting in the face of private enterprise, as the 
member for Calgary Centre has mentioned, yes, the government in 
matters of transportation got into the face of the transportation 
sector when it came to the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway 
system.
<P>
	Would we have a national airline if the government did not 
intervene? Would we have a national system of airports if the 
government did not intervene? Would we have a Trans-Canada 
Highway if the government did not intervene? Would there be a 
stretch of road of Trans-Canada Highway between Sault Ste. Marie 
and Winnipeg? Of course not. Why would we build that chunk of 
road? Who would use that chunk of road? Very few people would 
use that chunk of road. Naturally private enterprises would say they 
are not going to build that chunk of road, it does not make any 
sense.
<P>
	The government is here to provide the vision in order to make 
things happen that we know are going to be in the best interests of 
Canadians, not tomorrow, maybe not next week, but in the long 
term in the best interests of Canadians.
<P>
	I will try to explain why I believe the third party amendments, 
the motions, and the remarks of my colleague from 
Hamilton-Wentworth are quite frankly outrageous and 
misdirected and are totally lacking in fact.
<P>
	The first myth I want to touch on is that employment equity is 
about hiring the unqualified. We heard the hon. member for 
Calgary Centre take us down that road. The simple fact is that Bill 
C-64 does not oblige an employer to hire an unqualified person. It 
does not do that. Why carry the myth? It is quite explicit in fact on 
that point.
<P>
	Let me quote Mona Katawne of the Manitoba Telephone System 
who testified before the standing committee on the issue. She 
stated: ``There is no evidence that hiring from among the 
designated group members is a lowering of qualifications. In fact 
the evidence is to the contrary. There are people from the 
designated groups who are both available to work and qualified to 
work.''
<P>
	The fact is that our economy has surpluses of qualified people 
from all designated groups for many of the jobs that are out there. 
However, this myth persists because of misinformation, because 
there is a lack of looking at the facts.
<P>
	A perfect example is the Gallup poll which appeared in the 
December 23, 1993, Toronto <I>Star</I>, just after we were elected to this 
place. The headline blared that 74 per cent opposed job equity 
programs. Let us take a look at the actual question that was asked: 
Do you believe government should actively attempt to hire more 
women  and minority group members for management positions, or 
should government take no action whatsoever and hire new 
employees based solely on their qualifications? The question 
unfairly focused on people to choose between actively attempting 
to hire more women and minority group members and hiring based 
on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15164"> 15164 </A></B>
<P>
qualifications. It is amazing, quite frankly, that only 74 per cent 
chose qualifications.
<P>
	Employment equity means broadening access to all qualified 
people. It means giving people the chance to become better 
qualified.
<P>
	The second myth I want to touch on is that employment equity is 
about redressing the wrongs of the past. When this issue has come 
up with constituents, I have heard people ask why today's young 
white males have to pay for the sins of their fathers and 
grandfathers. I trust that I am not the only member of Parliament 
who has heard that remark. The short answer is they should not. 
Employment equity is about today's reality, today's problems, not 
yesterday's.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	The simple fact is that in 1993 white men without disabilities 
made up nearly 55 per cent of all workers newly hired, even though 
they only make up 45 per cent of the labour market. On virtually 
any scale, people in the designated groups fare poorly in today's 
labour market. The issue is not what happened in 1955 or in 1925 
but what is happening in 1995. There are still barriers to full 
participation by members of the designated groups. The goal is to 
end those barriers, not to create a new discrimination against 
someone else.
<P>
	Let us look at one specific group that fares especially poorly in 
our labour market and that is people with disabilities. Only about 
60 per cent of adults with disabilities are in the labour market at all. 
They have unemployment rates that are almost double the national 
average. That costs us all.
<P>
	The Canadian Association for Community Living did a study 
that looked at people with mental handicaps. They calculated the 
loss to our economy from the large scale segregation of these 
people from our economy in terms of lost tax revenue due to 
unemployment, social assistance costs, and lost consumption. They 
found that the cost to Canada's employment of keeping these 
people out of society is $4.6 billion a year. That is today's problem, 
not yesterday's problem.
<P>
	The final myth I want to touch on is the issue of goals and 
quotas. We have said it before and I will say it again: the bill 
expressly prohibits the imposition of quotas. The goal setting that 
Bill C-64 calls for is driven by flexible targets based on real 
business assessments of what is doable. Those goals are tools that 
measure success in breaking down the barriers. In fact, business 
witnesses who appeared before the standing committee agreed. 
They have no problem with this approach.
<P>
	If the hon. member for Calgary Centre had heard what went on at 
the standing committee he too would realize that. Do not get me 
wrong. The hon. member for Calgary Centre may be the jewel in 
the crown when it comes to employing people. He may have it 
right. But there are a lot of employers out there who have it wrong, 
and the hon. member has to come to terms with that.
<P>
	Bill C-64 is not designated to create a numbers mentality. 
Employers who adopt that mentality and attempt to short circuit the 
process do no one any benefit. The intent is to create a climate that 
encourages employers to build a better, fairer workplace through 
rethinking how their current processes work in practice and 
developing better ones.
<P>
	It would be easy for the government to do as the Reform Party 
suggests: to step back and do nothing to address the very real 
barriers in our labour market today. But it will not. The costs to our 
economy and our society are simply too high. Millions of 
Canadians are not prepared to accept a system that says do not do 
anything and let private enterprise take care of itself. They are not 
prepared to accept the notion that the response to the very real 
economic uncertainty faced by many workers is to set group 
against group.
<P>
	Canadians are not asking for special privileges here. Most 
witnesses representing designated groups made that very clear. 
They are asking for strong efforts to push companies to end barriers 
to full participation. In doing so, it does not help to have the 
ill-informed comments made by members of the third party on this 
issue. They have chosen to see the world as a zero sum game where 
any gain by a person who is in a designated group must be at the 
expense of someone else. They have chosen to fan the flames of 
intolerance rather than trying to find the solutions that address the 
very real needs of more than half of Canada's workforce. It means 
we define merit in terms that are clear, relevant and legitimate, in 
terms we recognize, diversity and the different conditions under 
which people live and work.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-64 is about creating that kind of plan in workplaces right 
across the federally regulated sector based on overcoming myths 
through action. Who said there are none so blind as those who will 
not see?
<P>
	I appeal to the third party to overcome these myths I have 
addressed. I appeal to the Reform Party to withdraw its motions. It 
would be the right thing to do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I just 
found out there is a positive aspect of being moved one more seat to 
the left. I am a little closer to the Speaker's plane of view. I 
appreciate being recognized in this very important debate.
<P>
	This is one of the issues that really galvanizes what our party 
stands for. It also makes strikingly clear what lies at the heart of the 
Reform Party. I have very strong views  when it comes to 
employment equity, affirmative action and government striking the 
fundamental policy framework that we expect our bureaucrats, our 
departments, our crown agencies and those businesses within the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15165"> 15165 </A></B>
<P>
federal realm of regulation in setting the parameters of the type of 
behaviour we expect them to follow.
<P>
	This is not the first time employment equity has been debated in 
the House. In the last Parliament on a number of occasions, be they 
private members' bills or motions put forward on days to eliminate 
racial discrimination, members put on record what they believed 
about employment equity.
<P>
	In the last Parliament we may have differed substantially on our 
economic approaches and policies and on our social policies but 
there was almost a unanimity of agreement with the New 
Democratic Party and with the Conservative Party when it was in 
government about a couple of fundamental facts about Canadian 
society.
<P>
	One was that systemic discrimination unfortunately does exist. It 
exists in the federal workplace. It exists in the provincial workplace 
and it exists in the private sector. Anybody who would get up in the 
Chamber and indicate they believe there is no such thing as 
systemic discrimination clearly is from another planet or has been 
living with their head in the sand for longer than I have been on this 
earth.
<P>
	Systemic discrimination is as real as the air we breathe and is as 
alive today as the people who sit in these chairs. More than once I 
have talked from the perspective of an MP who represents the 
largest indigenous black community in Canada, in Preston, North 
Preston, East Preston, Cherry Brook, Lake Loon. Those 
communities have been established in Nova Scotia a lot longer than 
the community I was born in, New Waterford. Most people in Nova 
Scotia see New Waterford as more of a Nova Scotian community 
than the Prestons which were founded by blacks from other parts of 
the globe over hundreds of years.
<P>
	Preston community is six kilometres outside the boundaries of 
my city. My city has an unemployment rate of anywhere from 7.5 
to 8.5 per cent. In the almost entirely black community, a 
ghettoized situation from 250 years ago, there are unemployment 
rates upward of 80 per cent in the winter.
<P>
	One of the first things I did in 1988 after I was elected to 
represent the good people of the riding of Dartmouth was go to the 
Speaker of the day. I asked the Speaker, Mr. Fraser, whether it was 
possible to use some of my budget to get a survey done. Our 
budgets were more restrictive.
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	I explained what I wanted to do. I had gone to the bureaucrats. 
They are good people, not racists, not bigots.  I asked them what 
information they had with respect to unemployment levels in the 
black community. They said they did not have any. Why not? How 
can there be federal programs such as skills training, job 
development and re-entry programs that are supposed to help those 
groups most dislocated from labour if there are no statistics about 
the degree of the problem in a particular community?
<P>
	Bureaucracies knew there were problems but did not want to 
quantify them. We spent $15,000 out of my budget and we 
quantified. There were no startling revelations except that finally 
somebody white in a position of authority said the facts are the 
facts and they are indisputable. It was only then that bureaucracies 
felt comfortable trying to address the problems of barriers to entry 
and participation by visible minorities in my area.
<P>
	I am saddened to say that seven years later I am worn down from 
my efforts of trying to battle systemic discrimination. Daily it 
becomes more systemic and rooted in the way bureaucracies 
operate.
<P>
	The bill does not seek to tell employers they have to hire a black 
person or a native Canadian or a Cape Bretoner, which I am, if they 
are not qualified. It sets down a framework and sets out a policy 
objective that says: ``If everybody in your organization looks like 
me, speaks like me and acts like me, they are more likely to hire 
somebody who looks like me, acts like me and speaks like me''. 
That is not individual racism; it is the way life is in most 
organizations.
<P>
	The bill seeks to build on the previous employment equity 
legislation passed in 1986 and say we have come a long way but we 
have a mighty long way to go yet. We cannot succumb to the insane 
attitudes of some on the loony right of the political spectrum and 
say, as the member from Windsor said: ``I am all right Jack. What 
is your problem?''
<P>
	I will tell the House what some of the problems are. A good 
businessman came to my office a week and a half ago. He operates 
without a line of credit at the bank and employs 17 to 20 people in 
the winter. He finances his operation through a finance company at 
28.8 per cent interest. He cannot access capital through the regular 
sources. He has been shying away from the sheriff for 20 years. He 
is a black businessman. There are barriers to his access to capital 
from banks.
<P>
	Seven years ago when we did the study the banks were angry 
because I fingered the banks and said there was systemic 
discrimination in their lending practices. They wailed. The facts 
coming to my office told me it was that way. How could an 
individual that resilient, who could operate from a line of credit 
from a finance company and who had no cash flow to work with 
stay in business? That was the best entrepreneur I ever saw.
<P>
	Just think what would have happened if he was a white 
entrepreneur who had access to capital from the banks.  Banks such 
as the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15166"> 15166 </A></B>
<P>
Royal Bank have recognized that when we talk about systemic 
discrimination we are not pointing a finger at individuals; we are 
stating facts based on statistics and we must work aggressively 
within a policy framework to deal with it.
<P>
	This bill simply sets out the framework. It says the government 
is still very much concerned that its crown agencies and 
corporations may not be working as hard as they should to ensure 
there are no barriers to participation in the federal public service, 
crown corporations and the private sector which is federally 
regulated, to ensure the people who do the hiring, the people in 
power, recognize they may have to work a little harder. If we deal 
on the other side of it with the people in the labour market, maybe 
the young black who wants to be an entrepreneur does not 
understand he could be welcomed as a client of the bank. He also 
has his own barriers to participation in the equity market or the 
labour market.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	Sometimes that extra effort is made to say: ``We will hire 12 
people and we have to make sure we do not send it just to the 
community college''. The community college in my area does not 
have the proper participation of minority groups. It is not 
proportional. If employers say they have made a commitment to 
hire qualified individuals, and it is all about the merit principle, 
they must recognize that by past practices there may be some 
groups in society that do not feel they are wanted at the door and do 
not make the application.
<P>
	Employers, because they have set it out as their policy to 
encourage qualified members of minority groups to participate, 
must make sure that instead of going just to the community college 
they also go to the Dartmouth East Black Learners Centre and say: 
``We need people with these skills. Are there some people you can 
send for us to look at?''
<P>
	That is what this bill is about. It is about setting a direction. It is 
about setting a goal. It is about a process whereby we remind 
ourselves that systemic discrimination does exist and that we can 
do something about it to ensure individuals are not discriminated 
against based on colour, language, gender, sexual orientation or any 
of those other things that really should not make a difference.
<P>
	I hope some of the misinformation from the Reform Party's 
minority report is put to the test. This is not about special 
treatment. This is about equal treatment and equal access. The bill 
does not solve the problem but it is another small step in the right 
direction toward allowing everyone regardless of colour, race or 
language to develop to the fullness of their potential. Governments 
are setting the tone and the direction to remove the obstacles to that 
full participation.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the fourth United Nations world 
conference on women concluded recently. I was there as a delegate. 
I learned that many developed and developing countries look to 
Canada for leadership in issues of justice, equality and human 
rights.
<P>
	I want to place Bill C-64 in that same international context. I 
want to look at our international obligations and how Bill C-64 will 
help us meet them. I want to consider some relevant international 
experiences with employment equity. I want to show the bill puts 
teeth in our commitment to equality and shows a leadership badly 
needed around the world.
<P>
	First I will discuss recent landmarks in understanding this issue. 
On August 17 the United Nations development program released 
its sixth human development report. Apart from the overall 
assessment, the report focuses on the situation facing women 
around the world.
<P>
	I am certain every member of the House took pride when once 
again Canada earned the highest ranking on the human 
development index. It is the third year running. It told the world 
what Canadians already know, that this country offers a quality of 
life that is second to none.
<P>
	I know each one of us also saw that we placed ninth on the 
gender related development index. Our track record on the place of 
women in society is not so good. Why that low? One of the factors 
is the economic gap between men and women. Money talks, and in 
Canada right now that means men shout while women whisper. 
Some in the House say there are very good reasons for this gap. 
They say we should just stand aside while the market works its 
mysterious forces. This is not what the authors of the United 
Nations human development report say. They point out that trickle 
down theories and laissez-faire approaches do not work 
particularly well to raise the economic status of women:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The free workings of economic and political processes are unlikely to deliver 
equality of opportunity because of prevailing inequities in power structures. 
When such structural barriers exist, government intervention is necessary both 
through comprehensive policy reforms and through a series of affirmative 
actions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The government understands the need for real action. This bill 
addresses that need by making markets work better. It will help 
women enter occupations that traditionally have excluded them. It 
will help women make their way from lower wage occupational 
ghettos.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	In 1993 in British Columbia women in full time occupations 
earned 67 per cent less than men. In 1993 in British Columbia 
women who had post-secondary education earned less than men 
with a grade 10 education. In 1993 in British Columbia, 99 per cent 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15167"> 15167 </A></B>
<P>
of secretaries and stenographers were women, but they still  earned 
79 per cent less than male stenographers and secretaries.
<P>
	We need this bill to remove the glass ceiling that still restricts 
women in many workplaces. It will do the same for aboriginal 
people, persons with disabilities and members of visible 
minorities.
<P>
	Bill C-64 is consistent with our international obligations. For 
many years Canada has been a signatory to international 
agreements on discrimination, human rights, women's rights, and 
labour force issues. Let me touch on a few of these.
<P>
	The United Nations has a number of conventions that cover 
equality issues. The convention on the elimination of all forms of 
discrimination against women commits us to pursue the equality of 
the sexes. Article 24 reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>States Parties undertake to adopt all necessary measures at the national level 
aimed at achieving the full realization of the rights recognized in the present 
Convention.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This includes modifying, and I quote again from the United 
Nations:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a view 
to achieving the elimination of prejudices and customary and all other practices 
which are based on the idea of the inferiority or the superiority of either of the 
sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Bill C-64 begins to take those steps.
<P>
	A similar commitment exists as a result of the United Nations 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
Article 7 touches on that. It says that states parties to the covenant 
recognize the right to ``equal opportunity for everyone to be 
promoted in his employment to an appropriate higher level, subject 
to no consideration other than those of seniority and competence''.
<P>
	Thirty-eight per cent of Canadian persons with disabilities find it 
difficult to achieve promotion in the workplace.
<P>
	This bill is about finding and removing the barriers that prevent 
designated members from realizing their legitimate aspirations in 
the workplace of this country. Equal opportunity means removing 
barriers so people can get to the starting gate equally.
<P>
	There are many conventions I can talk about: the international 
covenant on civil and political rights; the international covenant on 
the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination; and a number 
of international labour organization conventions.
<P>
	Article 2 of the international labour convention says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Members must undertake to declare and pursue a national policy designed to 
promote equality of opportunity in respect of employment and occupation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
It says that each member must undertake to enact such legislation 
as may be calculated to secure acceptance and observance of the 
policy. This is what we are doing here with this bill.
<P>
	Canada must take its international commitments seriously. We 
negotiate, we sign, we lead, we ratify these agreements with the 
intention of living up to them, or else why do we do it? It is 
certainly true with conventions on human rights and workplace 
issues.
<P>
	We can and we do point with pride to Bill C-64 and the existing 
Employment Equity Act, because as a predecessor it is an example 
of how this government wants to work to make equality of 
opportunity a real goal, not just something that is airy-fairy that we 
just talk about.
<P>
	Canada is not alone in this process. Other countries have signed 
these conventions and many are dealing with the same issues we 
are dealing with here today.
<P>
	For example, Australia is a country with which we have much in 
common. We are both senior members of the Commonwealth. We 
share similar constitutional and legal traditions. We both have 
significant aboriginal and visible minority populations. Persons 
with disabilities have become prominent advocates for their own 
cause. Women are taking a lead in society. Like Canada, Australia 
has an employment equity act too. Like us, they recognize an 
obligation to break down barriers, and they are doing so.
<P>
	Let us look at The Netherlands. The celebration of the 50th 
anniversary of its liberation by Canadian soldiers has reminded us 
of our close ties with The Netherlands. When the Dutch 
government looked for a legislated approach to promote the full 
integration of their immigrants into the labour force, where do you 
think they turned? Which country do you think provided a model of 
effective and appropriate legislation? Canada.
<P>
	Examples such as that show why Canada can attend international 
conferences with real pride. Regardless of the issue, we can point 
to initiatives we have taken at home, co-operation with other 
countries, and a commitment to results. This is true on workplace 
issues as well as human rights issues. We have much to do in 
Canada, however. This country has consistently tried to do more 
than meet a minimum standard. We have been motivated by the 
caring and tolerance of our society to do better.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	We realize that equality of opportunity means much more than 
the absence of formal discrimination. It means building a climate 
that encourages everyone to participate in our society and our 
economy. That is becoming a lesson to the world. Many countries 
are coming to grips with equality issues. We are leaders. They look 
to us for leadership.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15168"> 15168 </A></B>
<P>
	Canada has a distinguished history in human rights in the rest 
of the world. Countries that are looking for effective ways to 
improve human rights within their own borders are also looking 
to Canada. Countries that want to recognize their growing 
multicultural nature are looking to Canada. I saw over and over 
in Beijing how everyone turned to Canada for leadership. 
Everyone felt that Canada is the country in the world they all want 
to aspire to become.
<P>
	The Canadian approach to employment equity is a real 
contribution to the international community. It starts with the idea 
that all Canadians share a commitment to opportunity and a 
willingness to find solutions. It speaks to the finest qualities in our 
national spirit. Passing this bill will send an important message to a 
world that needs more of this spirit and looks to Canada to lead the 
way.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in the 1980s Judge Abella coined the phrase employment equity 
because she rejected the term affirmative action. Employment 
equity is a Canadian concept.
<P>
	There are a lot of myths surrounding the issue of employment 
equity, as some of my colleagues have already pointed out. The 
recent publicity surrounding the affirmative action policies in the 
United States and employment equity in the recent election has led 
some people to some inaccurate conclusions. They get the 
impression from the media that suddenly Americans, including the 
U.S. Supreme Court, are turning against affirmative action en 
masse. A vocal few seem ready to jump on the bandwagon, asking: 
``If the Americans are not going to keep it, why should we?''
<P>
	Before everyone falls for the myth that fairness in the workplace 
has fallen into disfavour all across North America, let me quickly 
review the facts. The real story is that programs that affirm 
employment equity are alive and well on both sides of the border. 
The most compelling argument for employment equity is that 
people actually want it.
<P>
	Let us look at the situation in Ontario, where roughly two-thirds 
of businesses responding to a poll just after the recent election 
reported they are in favour of reforming or keeping that province's 
employment equity law as it is. Only 8 per cent said they would 
cease implementing employment equity initiatives if the law is 
repealed, with 69 per cent saying that it would not have any impact 
on their company's equity plans. That sentiment is reflected in 
comments by the director of human resources policy for the 
Canadian Manufacturers' Association. Ian Howcroft was reported 
as saying that many of their members have already started 
employment equity initiatives and that he believes most of them 
will continue.
<P>
	Many members of the private sector are strong proponents of 
employment equity. They recognize the benefits to their 
corporation, benefits in terms of  improving quality of working life 
in their organization and in real financial benefits. Unlike the 
members of the Reform Party, these corporations are moving their 
companies into the 21st century. The Reform Party members think 
we should still live in the 1950s world of Ozzie and Harriet.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> 1850s.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Kraft Sloan:</B> Part of the misunderstanding of the bill arises 
from the myths created in the recent Ontario election. Employment 
equity is not about quotas. Moreover, this bill specifically states 
that employers are not required to hire unqualified members or 
create new positions to satisfy the legislation's requirements.
<P>
	The federal legislation takes a human resource planning 
approach to employment equity, relying on consultation and 
negotiation to achieve workplace goals. I know about this approach 
firsthand, as I worked as a consultant to the Ontario universities in 
developing training materials for employment equity.
<P>
	Another prevalent and incorrect assumption is that the federal 
employment equity is a carbon copy of American affirmative 
action policy and furthermore that Americans are now rejecting it 
out of hand. Neither belief is true. Let us start with the most 
controversial features of the U.S. affirmative action program, set 
asides. Set asides require that a specific percentage of government 
contract funds go to minority contractors. These are mandatory 
preferences dictated by law. Polls show that although most 
Americans favour affirmative action, they are opposed to this kind 
of preferential treatment. I want to set the record straight on this 
point. There is absolutely no equivalent to set asides in the 
Canadian approach to employment equity. They simply do not exist 
and have never existed.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	Let us look at the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision on 
affirmative action. Some people have a vague notion that this 
decision somehow struck down federal affirmative action 
programs, but let us look again. First, this decision was about set 
asides, which do not exist in Canada. Moreover, the Supreme Court 
decision did not strike down any federal laws or dismantle 
contracting policies, nor did it decide they were unconstitutional. 
The court simply requires federal affirmative action programs to 
meet the same standards of review already in place for state and 
municipal affirmative action programs, namely that the program 
serve a compelling interest and that it be narrowly tailored to 
achieve that purpose.
<P>
	The bottom line is that no program was struck down by this 
decision. On the contrary, seven out of the nine justices confirmed 
that sometimes affirmative action is indeed required to counter the 
effects of systemic discrimination.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15169"> 15169 </A></B>
<P>
	President Clinton pointed out that leading economists and 
distinguished American business leaders report their companies 
are stronger and their profits larger because of the advantages of 
workforce diversity. They insist that regardless of legislation they 
will pursue affirmative action because it is the key to future 
economic success in the global marketplace. Indeed, as I stated 
earlier, it is the Canadian corporations and the private sector that 
are very strong proponents of employment equity. The Reform 
Party purports to be a party for business special interest groups, 
so why can it not listen to the leaders in the private sector?
<P>
	Seeking solutions to employment inequality is precisely what 
Bill C-64 is about. The objective of our legislation is to ensure 
equality and justice for all. Canadians have an unwavering faith in 
values of fairness and equity. We believe heart and soul that there 
should be no discrepancy between our words and our deeds. We are 
determined that our constitutionally guaranteed rights should be a 
daily fact of life for every child, woman and man in this country. 
Equality and equity is the very foundation of our nation.
<P>
	It is in fact because of our employment equity legislation that we 
are on the leading edge in preparing this country for the 
unparalleled demands of the 21st century global economy. While 
we still have more to do in ensuring that all Canadians achieve their 
potential, our experience with employment equity has made us a 
world leader in the field, acting as a role model for other nations 
designing equity legislation. That is not rhetoric, but a reality of 
which every Canadian can be proud.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
was not really going to participate in this debate today in light of 
the excellent interventions by a number of my colleagues. Then the 
hon. member for Calgary Centre got into the act and started 
spouting the most unbelievable nonsense, so I felt it was necessary 
to correct some of the statements he made. Really, I was shocked. 
He worked himself into a real lather in the course of his speech 
about the evils of employment equity, which I thought most 
Canadians accepted.
<P>
	I have some quotes which I think are going to leave him 
speechless. He will wish he had not spoken. He pretended he was 
speaking on behalf of the entire private sector in Canada in 
speaking to this set of amendments moved by his colleague, the 
hon. member for Edmonton Southwest.
<P>
	I am surprised that a relatively enlightened member of the 
Reform Party would propose the amendments the hon. member for 
Edmonton Southwest has proposed. One suspects that his leader 
told him that this was caucus policy and since he is the critic he had 
better propose the amendments, so he did. I am sure in his heart of 
hearts he wishes he did not have to put forward such ridiculous 
amendments. What he is really doing is gutting this bill.  He is 
taking out all references in the bill to the private sector.
<P>
	The private sector has lived with this legislation now for many 
years and has functioned with it. I have spoken with constituents of 
mine who are bound by this legislation, not because it is binding on 
them specifically but because if they wish to contract with the 
federal government they are required to comply with it. They have 
been in compliance for some years, with some initial discomfort 
but not significant. They have found that their workplace has 
improved as a result of their compliance with this legislation. That 
has been the experience of most of the private sector employers 
affected by this legislation who have found that compliance is not 
all that difficult. Not only is it not difficult. It results in a better 
working environment in the places where it has been applied.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Edmonton Southwest must know this 
experience. He is a man of affairs; he has travelled around and has 
some businesses in the country. He must know the hon. member for 
Calgary Centre was talking through his hat this morning when he 
spouted the nonsense about the act being a bad thing for the private 
sector in Canada and one that stops job creation in the country. 
Quite frankly that is absolute rubbish.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> He said that it was not necessary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I hear the hon. member. That may be so because 
so many have complied with the rules already. Why not leave the 
rules in place? If everyone is complying and the rules are in place, 
fine, it does not do any harm to have them there. Yet the hon. 
member for Calgary Centre spouted absolute rubbish. He suggested 
that we did not need the bill at all and that we should scrap it. That 
is what these amendments do and I am not in favour of the 
amendments.
<P>
	City police forces, national chartered banks, multinational 
computer companies and more and more Canadian employers are 
enjoying the benefits of workplace inclusiveness and fairness, with 
good reason. Margaret Wente wrote in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> that 
employment equity programs were ``spreading, not shrinking. 
Their biggest boosters are powerful, middle aged white 
men-.They need diversity in their work forces, not to remedy past 
injustices but to be more successful''.
<P>
	The business argument for employment equity is 
straightforward. As our population becomes more racially diverse, 
it is essential that a company's workforce reflects the market it 
wants to sell to. This is increasingly true in the international 
marketplace. Business organizations ranging from B.C. Hydro to 
North American Life Assurance and the Bank of Montreal realize 
this reality and fully endorse equal opportunity employment. Many 
of those employers appeared before  the committee. The hon. 
member for Winnipeg North who is chair of the committee heard 
those 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15170"> 15170 </A></B>
<P>
witnesses. He has spoken about it and will continue to speak about 
it in the course of the discussion on the bill.
<P>
	They and other progressive employers have instituted 
employment equity programs in their workplaces not out of 
benevolence but out of good business sense. They have discovered 
that the best argument for employment equity is the bottom line.
<P>
	Black &amp; McDonald, the Toronto based mechanical and electrical 
services contractor, is an example in point. Many of the people 
hired as maintenance mechanics and building supervisors over the 
past few years were recent immigrants due as much to a skill 
shortage in Canada as to the firm's employment equity efforts. The 
company reports that the performance of this division has 
improved dramatically, which it credits to its highly skilled, hard 
working visible minority employees and the market potential they 
represent. More and more satisfied customers have resulted in 
more and more contracts for Black &amp; McDonald.
<P>
	A recent Conference Board of Canada study found that half the 
employers surveyed capitalized on Canada's ethnocultural 
diversity to expand their market share. That trend will only 
increase. By 2001 visible minorities should form 48 per cent of the 
consumer market in Toronto, 20 per cent in Montreal, and 39 per 
cent in Vancouver. Firms that fail to act quickly will be left behind 
in a country experiencing huge population growth among 
designated groups.
<P>
	Upwards of three-quarters of new entrants into the workforce by 
the turn of the next century, which is only five years from now, will 
be members of the designated groups. At a time when human 
capital far outweighs location or physical resources, it is 
imperative that employers maximize their people potential in the 
workplace.
<P>
	Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce chairman Al Flood put it 
very well when he said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The issue of underemployed intellectual capital is a major one for Canadian 
business in a competitive global society. A business in a complex, changing 
world needs more than one point of view. Those diverse views will only flourish 
in an environment uncontaminated by notions of ability based on gender, race, 
religion and so on.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The key word in that quote is ability because employment equity 
is really about assuring equal opportunities to individuals qualified 
to do the job. We are not talking, as the previous speaker said, 
about quotas. We are talking about ability, about assuring equal 
opportunities to qualified individuals. It is no coincidence then that 
half of all CIBC managers are women. Canada's banks have one of 
the best records in the economy for building diversity into their 
workforce. Yet never do we hear that such progress comes at 
someone else's expense.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	While I am on the subject of someone else's expense I quote 
again from the little green book of the Reform. I have a quote here 
from the hon. member for Beaver River that will be instructive. 
Perhaps it explains in part the silly amendments of the hon. 
member for Edmonton Southwest. She said: ``Women are just 
trying to lift themselves up to the detriment and expense of men''. 
This is what the hon. member for Beaver River says. I presume she 
believes this nonsense. I suspect what happened is that she has been 
sitting there listening to her seatmate, the hon. member for Calgary 
Southwest, telling her that is what happens.
<P>
	When the hon. member for Halifax or the hon. member for 
Nepean start speaking to me about lifting themselves up or 
changing their roles, I do not feel it is at my expense. I have never 
felt that it was at my expense. I am sure my male colleagues on this 
side of the House would share that view.
<P>
	Our female colleagues are not getting additional rights at our 
expense. If they get any additional rights we are all improved by 
them. There is not a finite supply of rights. Rights are created 
because individuals are there. Because individuals get rights does 
not mean the rights of someone else are necessarily diminished. 
Some may feel that way, but I suggest it is not true that they are 
necessarily diminished. The extension of the rights granted by this 
legislation have benefited all our society enormously.
<P>
	I do not know when the hon. member for Beaver River made this 
quote. Unfortunately the little green book, or ``The Gospel 
According to Preston Manning and the Reform Party'' as its other 
title reads, does not tell us when the quotation was made. 
Nevertheless the words are written down and I am sure the hon. 
member for Beaver River could not explain them away.
<P>
	Another very short quote from her is: ``I am basically a Tory''. I 
do not know why she is in the Reform Party if she is basically a 
Tory. She should help the hon. member for Saint John. Then we 
have a famous quote of her leader, the hon. member for Calgary 
Southwest: ``Deborah Grey is the prairie Margaret Thatcher''. 
What a fire that is.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I know the member is 
a very experienced member, but from time to time the Chair must 
remind members of certain rules of the House.
<P>
	Although he might be quoting from a text, those words are still 
attributed to whoever has the floor in the House. I would encourage 
the member to refer to member's ridings as the tradition and the 
rules of the House call for and not by proper names.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was being very careful only to use 
the proper name when it was in the quote. I was being very careful 
not to use it in any other sense.  That is why I said the hon. member 
for Calgary Southwest used the words: ``Deborah Grey is the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15171"> 15171 </A></B>
<P>
prairie Margaret Thatcher''. I do not think he said at the time that 
the hon. member for Beaver River was the prairie Margaret 
Thatcher. That is all I was doing.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> On that point, I am of the 
understanding at this time that when any member in the House 
reads a quote it is just as attributable to that person as if he or she 
were saying it.
<P>
	If I have erred I will gladly come back to the House and make 
that correction before all my peers, my colleagues here. However I 
am of the understanding at this time that any quote is attributed as 
if the person himself or herself is saying it. I will come back to the 
House if necessary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is fine. I accept the admonition. 
I have finished my quotes in any event.
<P>
	Those with the most experience with employment equity are 
usually its staunchest defenders. With nearly two decades of equity 
programs in the workplace Sun Life Assurance vice-president Lucy 
Greene says: ``It is just part of our thinking. It is good business 
sense. Everybody should be doing it''.
<P>
	Few would agree more than Troy Peck, a 25-year old 
administrative assistant with the planning department of the city of 
Vancouver. His employer adopted employment equity in 1976 
when Troy was still a little boy with a spinal tumour whose future 
employment prospects did not look promising. Thanks to 
employment equity this qualified young man who uses a 
wheelchair found his job on the basis of merit. Troy told the 
Vancouver <I>Province</I> this past summer:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Employment equity gives you the chance not to be automatically dismissed 
as an applicant because of your disability. It gives you the chance to show you 
are skilled and able to perform.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	That is all any member of the designated groups is asking of the 
House. They just want an opportunity to prove that talent comes in 
all kinds of packages. They ask us to remember that what is 
important is not the package but the gift inside it. Our gift to future 
generations in the country must be the assurance that we will give 
every last young woman and man that chance. With Bill C-64 
unamended we can do exactly that.
<P>
	I urge hon. members of the Reform Party to withdraw these 
amendments and proceed with the bill as it stands.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
today to rise in the House to speak in support of Bill C-64, the 
employment equity act.
<P>
	The fourth United Nations world conference of women 
concluded recently. An event like that one has many benefits for 
Canada. One is that it gives us an  international context to assess 
how well Canada has done and how far we have to go.
<P>
	During my remarks today I want to place Bill C-64 in that same 
international context and to look at our international obligations 
and how Bill C-64 will help us to meet them. I want to consider 
some relevant international experiences with employment equity. I 
want to show that the bill puts teeth in our commitment to equality 
and shows the kind of leadership that is badly needed around the 
world.
<P>
	Let me begin by discussing a recent landmark in understanding 
the issue. On August 17 the United Nations development program 
released its sixth human development report. In addition to its 
overall assessment the report focuses on the situation facing 
women around the world.
<P>
	I am certain that every member of the House took pride when 
once again Canada earned the highest ranking on the human 
development index. It told the world what Canadians already knew 
so well, that this country offers a quality of life that is second to 
none.
<P>
	However I am certain that each of us knows that Canada placed 
ninth on the gender related development index. Our track record on 
the place of women in society is not good enough. One might ask 
why it is that low. One factor is the economic gap between women 
and men. Money talks and in Canada right now that means men 
shout while women whisper.
<P>
	Some in the House say there are very good reasons for this gap. 
They say we should just stand aside while the market works in its 
mysterious way. That is not what the authors of the United Nations 
human development report says. They point out that trickle down 
theories and laissez-faire approaches do not work particularly well 
to raise the economic status of women. I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The free workings of economic and political processes are unlikely to deliver 
equality of opportunity because of prevailing inequities in power structures. 
When such structural barriers exist, government intervention is necessary, both 
through comprehensive policy reforms and through a series of affirmative 
actions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The government understands the need for real action. The bill 
will help address that need by making markets work better. It will 
help women enter occupations that traditionally have excluded 
them. It will help women make their way from lower wage 
occupational ghettos. It will help organizations remove the glass 
ceiling that restricts women in many workplaces. It will do the 
same for aboriginal peoples, persons with disabilities and members 
of visible minorities.
<P>
	Bill C-64 is consistent with our international obligations. For 
many years Canada has been a signatory to international 
agreements on discrimination, human rights, women's rights and 
labour force issues. Let me touch on a few of them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15172"> 15172 </A></B>
<P>
	The UN has a number of conventions that cover equality issues. 
The convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination 
against women commits us to pursue the equality of the sexes. 
Article 24 reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>State parties undertake to adopt all necessary measures at the national level 
aimed at achieving full realization of the rights recognized in the present 
Convention.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This includes modifying:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women, with a view 
to achieving the elimination of prejudices and customs and all other practices 
which are based on the idea of the inferiority or the superiority of either of the 
sexes or on stereotyped roles for men and women.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	To do that means taking real steps such as an active program of 
the type we have introduced in Bill C-64.
<P>
	A similar commitment exists as a result of the UN's 
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. 
Article 7 touches on conditions of work. It reads that states that are 
party to the covenant recognize the right to:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Equal opportunity for everyone to be promoted in his employment to an 
appropriate higher level subject to no considerations other than those of 
seniority and competence.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This bill is about finding and removing the barriers that prevent 
designated group members from realizing their legitimate 
aspirations in the workplace, the barriers that still prevent people in 
designated groups from competing fairly for promotions they want.
<P>
	There are other similar conventions that our country has signed 
and ratified over time. I will just name a few: the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the International 
Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial 
Discrimination; and a number of international labour organization 
conventions.
<P>
	I would like to refer to the second article of ILO Convention No. 
111 concerning discrimination in respect of employment and 
occupation which states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Members undertake to declare and pursue a national policy designed to 
promote equality of opportunity in respect of employment and occupation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Article 3 of the same convention states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-each member undertakes to enact such legislation as may be calculated to 
secure acceptance and observance of those policy.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Canada takes its international commitments seriously. We 
negotiate, sign and ratify these agreements with the intention of 
living up to them fully. That is certainly true with conventions on 
human rights and workplace issues such as these.
<P>
	We can and do point with pride to Bill C-64 and the existing 
Employment Equity Act as its predecessor as an example of the 
government at work to make the equality of opportunity we all 
want a real goal. Canada is not alone in this process. Other 
countries have signed these  conventions and many are dealing with 
many of the same issues in society and the economy as we are.
<P>
	For example, Australia is a country with which we have much in 
common. We are both senior members of the Commonwealth. We 
share similar constitutional and legal traditions. We both have 
significant aboriginal and visible minority populations. Persons 
with disabilities have become prominent advocates for their own 
cause. Women are taking on leading positions in society. Like 
Canada, Australia has an employment equity act. Like us, it 
recognizes an obligation to break down barriers and it is doing so.
<P>
	Another interesting case is that of the Netherlands. The 
celebration of the 50th anniversary of its liberation by Canadian 
soldiers has reminded us of our close ties. It reminds us of the 
many Dutch people who have made new homes here over the years.
<P>
	When the Dutch government looked for a legislated approach to 
promote the full integration of its immigrants into the labour force 
and therefore society, where did it turn? Which country provided a 
model of effective and appropriate legislation? The answer is 
Canada.
<P>
	Examples such as that show why Canada can attend international 
conferences with real pride. Regardless of the issue, we can point 
to initiatives we have taken at home, co-operation with other 
countries and a commitment to results. Certainly that is true on 
workplace issues and on human rights issues.
<P>
	While we have much to do, Canada has consistently tried to do 
more to meet some minimum standard. We have been motivated by 
the caring and tolerance of a society to do better. We realize that 
equality of opportunity means much more than the absence of 
formal discrimination. It means building a climate that encourages 
everyone to participate in our society and our economy.
<P>
	That is becoming a lesson to the world. Many countries are 
coming to grips with equality issues. They know we are leaders. 
Canada has a distinguished history in human rights in the 
international community. Countries that are looking for effective 
ways to improve human rights within their own borders are looking 
to Canada. Countries that want to recognize their growing 
multicultural nature are looking to Canada.
<P>
	The Canadian approach to employment equity is a real 
contribution to the international community. It starts with the idea 
that all Canadians share a commitment to opportunity and the 
willingness to find solutions. It speaks to the finest qualities in our 
national spirit.
<P>
	Passing this bill will send an important message to a world that 
needs more of this spirit.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15173"> 15173 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in offering 
my comments on Bill C-64 and the report of the standing 
committee, I want to go back to the fall of 1993.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	At the time, Canada was in the middle of an election campaign, 
and the Liberal Party published a campaign program in which it 
formulated its commitments.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	This campaign document explained the philosophy behind these 
commitments. At the beginning of the red book, our leader, the 
man Canadians chose as their Prime Minister, set the tone for a 
program I was proud to defend.
<P>
	This is what he said, and I quote: ``The result is a Liberal plan for 
Canada firmly anchored in the principle that governing is about 
people, and that government must be judged by its effectiveness in 
promoting human dignity, justice, fairness, and opportunity. This is 
our approach, and this election is about presenting that choice to 
Canadians''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Consider those words: ``Our platform was one of jobs and 
growth but it was not a narrow economic platform. It spoke to a 
vision of society in which growth reaches everyone. It spoke to a 
vision of society in which everyone has opportunities in practice, 
not just in theory''.
<P>
	On this side of the House when we think about the kind of 
Canada that we are engaged in building, we see a united people 
building a great country. We see a Canada with opportunity for all. 
Our Canada would have a strong and sustainable economy. Our 
economic pie would grow bigger through the skill, commitment 
and innovation of Canadian workers. From the chief executive 
officer to the newest employee, everyone would help create the 
opportunities of tomorrow. The government would work with them 
to take on the challenges that markets alone cannot.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The workplace, always according to the Liberal vision, must 
reflect the diversity of the population. It must never raise barriers 
to prevent someone from doing a job of which he or she is proud 
and participating fully in the development of this country. The 
Canadian workplace should emulate the best of what can be found 
in the rest of the world.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	That competitive economy would exist hand in hand with a 
tolerant and generous society. It would live with the golden rule 
that exists in all faiths that I have seen. Our culture, our race, our 
sex, none of these would be a barrier to friendship or to 
contribution. We would learn from each other and grow richer in 
the process.
<P>
	In our vision of Canada people would resolve differences in a 
spirit of goodwill. They would know that a reasonable people can 
usually find common ground to work out agreement. Our Canada 
would be one that builds on our traditional core values of equality, 
justice and fair shares of the opportunities that build better lives 
and a better country. It would recognize, as the red book did, that 
we exist in this society together and not apart.
<P>
	Canadians are far more than individuals driven by impersonal 
economic forces and narrow self-interest. We support and are 
supported by our families, our communities and our country. That 
has always been true. From the earliest days of human settlement 
here we have always worked best when we have worked together. It 
remains true to this day.
<P>
	The Liberal vision of Canada mirrors the aspirations Canadians 
have for our country. We want to live together in progress and in 
peace. In a troubled world Canadians recognize just how much we 
have accomplished in reaching for this vision. Our ranking in the 
United Nations human development report is a tribute to that.
<P>
	Still we know we have more to do. The situation of aboriginal 
people or our lower ranking on the equality of women in the UN 
report testify to what more we must do.
<P>
	Employment equity is a basic part of making our vision real. It 
recognizes that equality of opportunity is a goal that we have not 
yet reached. It brings us closer to the ideal caring society that I 
believe we all want.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In other words, if the concept of employment equity did not 
exist, we would have to invent it. In fact, it is an essential step 
towards ensuring that all Canadians have equal opportunities, are 
aware of that fact and take full advantage of this equality.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Certainly there has been progress both in numbers and attitudes. 
For example, the Bank of Montreal's president and chief operating 
officer, Tony Comper, noted that representation had increased 
significantly in that bank between 1993 and 1994. However, what 
was every bit as important was the extent to which employees of 
that bank have bought into the equity process. They have come to 
understand that diversity is a business plus in our times.
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	The same is true at Union Gas in southwestern Ontario. A 
company with a traditional workforce of technical and office 
workers has built a very successful equity program. Why? Because 
<P>

<B><A NAME="15174"> 15174 </A></B>
<P>
the company has been committed to making it a success. It trains 
staff on issues that arise in a diverse workforce so they can 
understand the new expectations of customers, co-workers and the  
company. It builds bridges, not walls, between employees in the 
name of equity.
<P>
	Let me quote the company's human resources manager, Maureen 
Ghettes: ``We often look at the cost of something and not the 
benefit. The cost of an employee who is not interested in working 
with a certain group or who does not take time to understand an 
accent is far greater''.
<P>
	These business people are telling us that employment equity is 
both a strategic social investment and an economic investment. It is 
consistent with the kind of targeted action the government has 
adopted across its agenda. It is an action we need more of.
<P>
	As the red book pointed out and as our experience tells us, 
people in the designated groups still have a long way to go. In the 
years since the original Employment Equity Act was passed, 
progress has been slow for women, people with disabilities, 
aboriginal people and members of visible minority groups.
<P>
	The standing committee heard from many groups with personal 
stories of barriers that have not given way despite years of trying. 
Representatives of the Filipino Technical and Professional 
Association of Manitoba describe the experiences of well-trained 
people whose credentials were simply dismissed on arriving in 
Canada. These people were not even given partial credit toward 
professional and technical designations despite their training and 
years of experience.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Spokespersons for the disabled described the professional 
ghettos to which persons with a mental deficiency are confined. 
They explained the problems encountered by even the best trained 
people who suffer from other disabilities. There may be various 
reasons why it is difficult for this group of workers to find a job.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	All of these groups are telling us that they believe in Canada. 
They believe this country and its citizens have the generosity of 
spirit to see what needs to be done and to do it. They are asking for 
us to continue the great mission of diversity that has enriched this 
country from its beginnings.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It is almost two o'clock. The hon. member will 
have the floor when we come back to debate. It being 2 p.m., 
pursuant to Standing Order 30(5), the House will now proceed to 
statements by members.

Canadians have made a special effort to celebrate National Family 
Week.
<P>
	This year, from October 2 to October 8, all Canadians will be 
encouraged to look inward and to contemplate the fundamental 
importance of our families and the relationships we have with the 
loved ones around us. This year's theme ``Families are Forever: 
Enjoy Family Times'' builds on the concept that families, like 
precious jewels, are forever and need to be enjoyed, treasured and 
celebrated.
<P>
	The family unit is an essential building block of all societies. 
The ties that bind us to each other are reflections of the ties that 
keep the greater family, the global community, together. During 
this National Family Week and indeed all year long we should 
enjoy the time we spend with our family members and enjoy the 
memories of good family ties.

<P>
	To convince Hyundai, it is hinted that the government might 
want to recover the federal contribution for the construction of the

the $110 million loan approved by Ottawa for the Boisbriand plant. 
To convince other parties, there would be references to federal 
programs to help industry and facilitate access to the U.S. market.
<P>
	It seems that the people they are counting on to do the job 
include Yves Landry of Chrysler Corporation, identified as the 
spokesperson for the automotive industry, and Maureen Darkes, the

	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, many Canadians 
are outraged by the continuing French nuclear tests in the South 
Pacific and are demanding our government take a stand. While 
other countries have strongly condemned the French behaviour, the 
Liberal government reaction has been pathetically weak.
<P>
	Instead of recalling our ambassador from France for consultation 
as the Reform Party demanded, the government lamely expressed 
its regret and yesterday the Minister of Foreign Affairs told a 
member of the House that the nuclear tests were nothing to get 
excited about.
<P>
	Instead of standing up to France, the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
has chosen the path of appeasement over principles, just like the 
leader of the Bloc Quebecois did on this same issue.
<P>
	Unlike the government and the Official Opposition, the Reform

the French nuclear testing because the people of Canada demand it.

Canadians are extremely disappointed at the weak response our 
government has taken with the Government of France on nuclear 
weapons testing in the South Pacific.
<P>
	Last week I had the opportunity to address the Council of Europe 
to convey the unhappiness of Canadians with France for 
undertaking these tests. Delegations from Canada, Australia, Japan 
and Mexico condemned France for its actions.
<P>
	Today I am calling on Canadians to boycott products from 
France such as wines, perfumes, bottled water, cheeses and 
clothing until the French stop testing nuclear devices. A boycott 
will pressure French business to lobby French President Chirac to 
end testing sooner.
<P>
	The government and Canadians must take a firmer stand on this 
issue. It is incredible that on the 50th anniversary of the bombing of 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki France should resume nuclear testing. It is 
equally incredible that the Liberal government has been silent on 
this issue which impacts negatively on world peace and on our 
environment.

environment and the environment of our neighbours.
<P>
	This past July the Minister of the Environment introduced 
measures to protect the environment of lakes, rivers and wetlands 
across North America by banning lead shot under the authority of 
the Migratory Birds Convention Act.
<P>
	Lead shot, which can be fatal when ingested by water fowl, is 
released into the Canadian environment by water fowl hunters at 
between 1,500 and 2,000 tonnes per year. This action taken by the 
minister will end the poisoning of our waters and will protect 
important species in our ecosystem. This measure will not only 
save our environment, it is one small step toward maintaining

live with.

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr.

research in sheep farming, with sheep production in full expansion.
<P>
	Neither Quebec nor the regional community was consulted about 
the closure, which was hidden away in the appendixes to the

had succeeded in extracting a moratorium, enabling it to revive 
agricultural research in the cradle of farming research in Quebec.
<P>
	Unfortunately, despite the minister's promise, the department 
has begun to remove the centre's equipment, in spite of the 
community action. Data provided by the federal government reveal 
that Quebec receives less than 15 per cent of the federal department 
of agriculture's spending on research and development.

rise in the House to add the federal riding of Elgin-Norfolk to the 
important debate on national unity. Recently I had the opportunity 
to meet with a constituent of mine, Mr. Tom Savage of Port 
Stanley, Ontario.
<P>
	Mr. Savage, an artist, has created a national unity T-shirt. This 
shirt truly represents all of Canada: a large red maple leaf with a 
fleur de lys of Quebec and the sacred hoop of the First Nations.
<P>
	In the wake of the crisis in both Ipperwash Beach and Gustafsen 
Lake and the constant debate on the Quebec referendum, Mr. 
Savage is one of many Canadians who feel Canada includes 
Quebec and aboriginals.
<P>
	It is frightening to envision the possibility of Canada's breaking 
up and therefore I commend the work of Tom Savage and hope that 
more Canadians step forward to voice their concerns. There is no 
room for complacency. It is time for all Canadians who together 
form our cultural mosaic to embrace our differences and stand 
united. This will ensure a strong and prosperous future for all of 
Canada.

	<B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the separatist leaders spent much of last week 
frightening seniors by claiming that, the day after a no vote in the 
referendum, their pensions would be cut.
<P>
	The federal government is being financially responsible by 
reviewing all its programs to see how they may be made more 
efficient and less costly. The PQ government and its separatist 
allies, on the other hand, continue to promise the world ignoring 
the fact that an independent Quebec will face a deficit of between 
$7 billion and $15 billion in the first year.
<P>
	Seniors, like the rest of the people in this country, prefer a 
government that states its intentions clearly over one that 
irresponsibly wastes money it does not have just to win its 
referendum. Seniors will say no on October 30 to the campaign of 
fear by the PQ and the Bloc.

ignored. Last Sunday, like thousands of other Quebecers, I saw the 
new Yes signs spring up in my riding.
<P>
	Two of them in particular caught my attention. The first one 
showed a nice big flower as the promise of a healthy environment. 
The second one showed the peace sign which, in my opinion, 
speaks for itself.
<P>
	While separatists were busy putting up their signs, a horrible 
drama was unfolding on the other side of the world as France set off 
its second nuclear explosion.

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, Senator Lise Bacon took offence at the treatment of 
Standard Life chief executive Claude Garcia by the Quebec 
government. Mr. Garcia became an instant celebrity at the start of 
the referendum campaign when he said: ``We must not only win, 
we must crush''. The Quebec government then remembered that 
Standard Life had been awarded important contracts without 
tenders and decided to issue a call for tenders, as should be done in 
any case.
<P>
	Instead of taking offence, Mrs. Bacon should feel stifled as part 
of the No side, as Quebec businesspeople have been targeted by the 
Operation Unity centre and blackmailed by the federal 
government. Mrs. Bacon's principles are quite elastic. Why does 
she not in turn denounce the unacceptable practices used by her 
own side?

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INDUSTRYCANADA">INDUSTRY CANADA</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today it was reported in <I>La Presse</I> that a secret document 
was sent last March to the Privy Council's Operation Unity centre. 
It seems that Industry Canada made a list of Quebec companies, 
sector by sector, in anticipation of the referendum debate. Ottawa 
identifies the levers-that is the word they used-it intends to use 
to urge business people to campaign for the No side, referring to 
various federal subsidies and contracts, especially in the aerospace 
and defence sectors.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Does he approve 
of the fact that a federal department, at the request of Operation 
Unity, made a list of the heads of large corporation in Quebec for 
the obvious purpose of blackmailing them and enrolling them on 
the No side in the referendum campaign?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think it is entirely normal that government officials 
should be able to inform ministers and the government of economic 
activities in Quebec that receive assistance from the Canadian 
government. That is all part of the basic argument. The purpose is 
not to blackmail anyone at all, in fact quite the opposite. It is so we 
can tell people that they can get ahead in Canada and that many 
industries in Quebec need the central  government, to access its 
funding programs as well as to find markets abroad.
<P>
	I think it is perfectly normal that the Minister of Industry should 
know what is going on in the industrial sector in the province of 
Quebec at a time when a referendum is to be held, so that he can tell 
the Prime Minister, the ministers, members of Parliament and the 
public what the Canadian government is doing for Quebecers.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the leader of the government forgot to mention that these 
documents include analyses of the political positions of certain 
heads of corporations in connection with the current debate, hence 
the importance of the use of the term ``levers'' in connection with 
the way they will behave during the referendum debate.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister not think there is something indecent 
about the fact that, when making this list of Quebec businesses, his 
government referred not only to subsidies that had already been 
paid under federal contracts but also to future subsidies that are 
now being negotiated?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think it only makes sense for a minister to want to know 
what is going on in his department. Members rise in the House 
every day to ask questions, and if a minister has the misfortune to 
say he does not know exactly what is going on in his department, he 
is accused of incompetence. I am not going to rise in the House 
now and tell my Minister of Industry that he is incompetent, when 
he is making sure that we have all the information relevant to the 
referendum debate in Quebec.
<P>
	Quebecers ought to know that what we can offer them now is 
something concrete, but the Bloc Quebecois and the Parti 
Quebecois are trying to make people believe in a hypothetical 
situation it will be impossible to realize. We are telling Quebecers 
in concrete terms what we are doing for them, and they are very 
glad to know about it.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what connection is there between a minister's jurisdiction 
and the political opinions of the business people with whom he has 
dealings? And why this excuse we are hearing today, that the 
minister has to know what is going on in his department, when he is 
much more concerned about the political views of the heads of 
Quebec companies? I think it is pretty obvious that this is an 
exercise in twisting the arms of business people in Quebec.
<P>
	I ask the Prime Minister to admit that with this list, his 
government has a tool to blackmail Quebec business leaders who, 
as long as they are under the present federal system, will depend on 
contracts and subsidies from Ottawa.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15179"> 15179 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am of course glad to see the Leader of the Opposition has 
conceded that the No side will win and the Yes side will lose. If he 
felt confident, he would have said that all this did not matter and 
that on October 30 they would no longer have dealings with the 
Canadian government and businessmen would no longer have to 
deal with the Canadian government. I wonder why he is so scared; 
is it because he realizes he will lose?
<P>
	However, I think it is rather surprising that the leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois should criticize us, when his leader, the leader of the 
Parti Quebecois, fired every single official representing the Quebec 
government abroad who did not swear an oath of allegiance to the 
cause of separation.
<P>
	When we see the kind of threats they make against people who 
are now speaking out in favour of the No side, as in the case of the 
chief executive of an insurance company who has been told he may 
lose his contracts because he is a federalist, I think the Leader of 
the Opposition is hardly in a position to criticize us for trying to 
find out who receives subsidies and in what sector, so that members 
and people on the No side can go to the ridings and explain to 
people that the Canadian government provides a good service to all 
Quebecers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we were 
well aware of how strongly allergic the Prime Minister was to the 
competitive bidding process in the Power DirecTv case involving 
his son-in-law. It will be remembered that he appeared to be 
extremely allergic in that instance. But it is completely normal for 
the government of Quebec to use a competitive bidding process.
<P>
	It is also important for Quebecers to know the true colours of the 
federal government right before making a decision. The Privy 
Council's Operation Unity centre has taken the trouble to collect 
information on Quebec businesses, their directors, their past and 
future contracts and grants, so as to be able to pressure them to be 
on the No side of the referendum. We know that a number of 
federal government bodies and departments possess confidential 
information on a number of Canadians and Canadian organizations.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Can he tell us whether 
some of the information in the hands of other federal bodies or 
departments has been acquired by the Operation Unity centre to 
create other files to be used for the same purposes as the first?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the allegations of the hon. member for Roberval are 
unfounded. The document produced examines the industrial 
sectors in the province  of Quebec, sector by sector. There are 20 or 
21 in all. In each, we look at the economic situation and the effect 
of federal government funding.
<P>
	It also looks at what effect separation would have on each of the 
industrial sectors in the province of Quebec, and in each case the 
conclusion is clear: separation would have harmful economic 
effects on the economic sectors of the province of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister's conclusion and the conclusions of his document are not 
even the same. He has not read it. True, this document was 
requested by the Prime Minister.
<P>
	When the minister states that these are unfounded allegations, I 
would like him to explain, to us and to all Quebecers, the 
following. While the Operation Unity centre was literally 
collecting secret information contained in Department of Industry 
documents for the purposes of bringing pressure to bear during the 
referendum, why would it have deprived itself of information held 
by other organizations and departments other than Industry on 
thousands of Quebecers and Quebec organizations? Why would it 
not have done so when it has collected similar information from 
Industry in such a shameful manner?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member for Roberval continues to make 
unfounded allegations which are not justified by the document. I 
shall send him copies of the report on the various industrial sectors 
in which the conclusion is that separation would be harmful for 
Quebec. He will then see that this is the case in the majority of 
sectors.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	When he says these are unnecessary documents, that is totally 
ridiculous, and I do not hesitate to say so, because the conclusions 
of the report clearly indicate the effects of separation on major 
industrial sectors in Quebec, essential information for the 
referendum. It comes as no surprise to me that the opposition has 
not read it, because it does not fall in line with their conclusions, 
but it is unfortunately the truth. Separation would be extremely 
costly for most industrial sectors of Quebec.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFNATIONALDEFENCE">DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL DEFENCE</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday Canadians learned that not only had 
officials at the Department of National Defence been falsifying 
documents but that former Airborne Commander Peter Kenward 
ordered videotape evidence destroyed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15180"> 15180 </A></B>
<P>
	Shortly after the destruction of the videotapes, Kenward was 
promoted to full colonel. The minister has already admitted that 
the chief of defence staff would not consider his reservations about 
this promotion and he did not interfere because he says that the 
promotion was a responsibility of the chief.
<P>
	I want the minister to clarify his position. When did he learn that 
Colonel Kenward had ordered the destruction of evidence? Was it 
before or after the promotion?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as a former 
member of the armed forces, I am sure the hon. member will be 
aware that following passage of the 1952 National Defence Act an 
order in council was passed.
<P>
	It is now found in Queen's Regulations and Orders 11.01(2). It 
states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The promotion of a member to any rank lower than that of brigadier-general 
requires the approval of the Chief of Defence Staff.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the minister knew that the evidence had been 
destroyed. Therefore he is ``complicit'' in concealing that fact from 
the Canadian people.
<P>
	The minister knew of this cover-up. He knew of the promotion, 
yet he did nothing. How can he justify this gross error of judgment?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, from time to 
time you caution hon. members about the language they use in the 
House. I would caution the hon. member. If he said this outside the 
House, it might be actionable.
<P>
	Second, because of the reservations the chief of defence staff had 
about the promotion and its delay pending certain investigations, 
out of courtesy he brought it to my attention. When he brought it to 
my attention, I expressed reservations that the promotion should go 
ahead. I reminded the chief of the defence staff that it was his 
responsibility to deal with these promotions and that it was up to 
him to decide whether or not to proceed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is not the prerogative of anyone within the military 
to impede an investigation and to destroy evidence.
<P>
	Canadians are gravely concerned that the minister, who is 
ultimately responsible, has allowed tampering with evidence as an 
acceptable tool for office management at the senior levels of the 
national defence department.
<P>
	These revelations undermine public confidence in the military 
and they destroy any shred of credibility still clinging to the 
minister. My question does not touch on the Somalia inquiry but 
goes right to the heart of the  minister's mismanagement. Given 
that the minister acknowledges to the Canadian people that his 
department is out of control, will he do the honourable thing and 
resign?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I might ask the 
hon. member if he would refrain from bordering on abusing the 
privileges of the member of Parliament for Don Valley East and the 
Minister of National Defence. I believe that is what he has done in 
his question, when there is a close reading of the question.
<P>
	I would like to tell him that the chief of defence staff will be 
making a public statement this afternoon and will deal with all 
these matters because they are under his purview.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member whether he expects the 
Minister of National Defence to have the governor in council 
rescind an order in council that was passed 43 years ago designed 
to prevent political interference in the promotion of officers of the 
armed forces. Does he want to turn the clock back?

	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	With respect to the aerospace industry, it is clear from the secret 
document prepared by Industry Canada for the Operation Unity 
centre that the federal government intends to use the defence 
industry productivity program to put pressure on this industry in 
Quebec by withholding funds earmarked for the support of new 
projects in 1995.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister confirm that the federal government is 
currently negotiating with Bombardier to establish a financial 
support program to help Bombardier sell regional jets?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, again, these are unfounded allegations. Clearly, whenever 
subsidies are granted, the government always considers which 
industries could use them and for what purpose. The stated 
objectives are profitability and job creation, and these objectives 
are those set by the federal government for industrial development 
in Canada.
<P>
	Is the opposition suggesting that we not look for ways to 
stimulate employment in Quebec? The burden of proof rests with 
opposition members. They are making allegations based on 
incorrect information and faulty  analysis. Instead, they should 
share 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15181"> 15181 </A></B>
<P>
with us the burden of developing Quebec's economy as best we 
can.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Obviously, Mr. 
Speaker, the minister did not read the document.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister not find it odd that information on 
negotiations between Bombardier and the government can be found 
in an Operation Unity document designed to put pressure on 
Quebec businesses to make them vote No?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, ever since I became a member of cabinet and even a 
member of Parliament, the Canadian aerospace industry has always 
relied on federal assistance for its development.
<P>
	I myself was Minister of Industry many years ago. When 
Canadair was shut down by the American company General 
Dynamics, the Canadian government took it over to put it back on 
its feet. It has now become Quebec's largest industry and biggest 
employer. The Canadian government wants to ensure that Canadair 
can go ahead with its aircraft development project.
<P>
	The development of regional aircraft by Canadair has been a 
government concern for many years, and we are trying to help this 
industry. In fact, in the past twelve months, we had the opportunity 
to help it start producing this aircraft which I feel is destined to 
have a great future, thanks to the aeronautics policies put in place 
by the Canadian government, which does a great deal for workers 
in that sector of Quebec's economy. That is why they will want to 
remain in Canada.

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	The minister will not tell us when he will release his long 
overdue reform of the Canada pension plan but perhaps he will 
share with us what he is planning to do.
<P>
	Through access to information we have obtained a briefing note 
by a senior policy analyst in HRD. She states that the Canada 
pension plan is financially unsustainable. She recommends that the 
minister either cut seniors' pensions or raise taxes to pay for the 
shortfall.
<P>
	Will the minister promise seniors that he will not cut their 
pensions? And, will he promise taxpayers that he will not raise 
their taxes? Yes or no.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will certainly take the hon. 
member's representation to my colleague, the Minister of Finance, 
which I know he will be thrilled to receive.
<P>
	As far as the briefing note is concerned, it is very difficult to 
keep track of a variety of briefing notes. I repeat to the hon. 
member that we made it very clear in last year's budget that we 
have a very strong commitment to maintaining the sustainability of 
the pension programs for seniors. We recognize, however, as a 
responsible government that in the future as the demographics of 
the country change there has to be new financing for the Canada 
pension plan. The Minister of Finance must meet with his 
colleagues, the other ministers of finance, later this year to discuss 
how that refinancing would take place.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	That is the reason why it is very important we engage in a serious 
review of how we can ensure the continued maintenance of a good, 
effective, sustainable pension program for Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
acknowledge the hon. member's response and would like to 
continue with a supplementary question.
<P>
	Reform believes that pension reform can be done without cutting 
seniors' pensions and without raising payroll taxes. In his letter last 
week the chief actuary for finance recommended that the 
government either raise taxes or cut benefits in order to save the 
Canada pension plan.
<P>
	Will the minister reject the advice of the chief actuary, refuse to 
cut seniors' pensions and refuse to raise payroll taxes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would be very interested in 
receiving a more complete and thorough presentation from the 
Reform Party on its proposals for the Canada pension plan.
<P>
	When I looked at the proposals that came forward from the 
seminar or meeting the Reform Party held a couple of weeks ago in 
Halifax, I noticed that if we had followed its recommendations 
there would have been substantial reduced pension benefits for 
800,000 disabled Canadians, 600,000 widows and 1.8 million 
pensioners.
<P>
	I hope that is not the position of the hon. member.

indicated,  would be difficult to provide. The assistance sought 
concerned the joint Canadair-de Havilland global express airplane 
project.
<P>
	How does the Prime Minister justify a request for financial 
assistance of this magnitude being in a strategy file intended for 
use in pressuring business in the referendum debate?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think I am going to have to explain this whole thing all 
over again. The Department of Industry document sets out clearly 
the position of the various industrial sectors. It indicates the effect 
separation would have on these sectors. It also indicates, in some 
cases, the amount of the financial assistance sought by certain 
firms.
<P>
	This is common practice, and one the government is familiar 
with. Many companies follow this practice each year; that is, they 
apply for funding. We have to respond to these applications for 
assistance each year, and it is usual for this type of information to 
appear in an Industry Canada document.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have the 
impression we are not talking about the same document and that 
the minister does not even have access to the document we are 
talking about. Are we to understand that one of the new criteria 
Ottawa has established for obtaining federal assistance under DIPP 
is a favourable recommendation from the operation unity centre for 
services rendered?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, clearly the answer is no. Government funding is provided, 
once again, according to the contribution a firm or an industry 
makes to the Quebec economy. It is provided on the basis of job 
creation. It almost always is public and is therefore subject to the 
government's public accounts.
<P>
	This funding must be approved by the members of Parliament 
and the House and is therefore granted objectively. Once again, the 
opposition's allegations are unfounded.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
negotiations on the harmonization of environmental management 
in Canada have been placed totally on hold. With each day the 
environment minister's version of events gets even more 
outlandish. She insists that Alberta scuttled the deal, but Alberta 
says that the minister's fear of decentralization is to blame. What is 
more disturbing  is that Alberta's environment minister was 
practically called a racist in the House.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	Why has the minister put this deal on hold and when will she 
apologize to Alberta Minister Ty Lund for her inflammatory 
comments?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I merely repeated in the 
House what the minister said at the meeting in Haines Junction 
when he said that he would be very happy if Canada had 
environmental jurisdiction in Alberta in the area of parks, that we 
could have their parks and their Indians. That comment has not 
been refuted by the minister.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what is 
more at issue here is the fact that these talks have been scuttled by 
the minister, regardless of reason. Whether it is the <I>Irving Whale</I> or 
whether it is the environmental harmonization agreement, the 
minister is always looking for new ways to pass the buck, and 
heaven help those who disagree with her. I am sure the Minister of 
Natural Resources certainly knows what I am talking about. She is 
in favour of the provinces and supports their attempts by her 
sympathies with harmonization.
<P>
	My supplementary question is for the Minister of Natural 
Resources or the Deputy Prime Minister. What do they plan to do 
to get these talks back on track?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the claim of the hon. 
member that somehow I have misrepresented what Ty Lund said is 
absolutely false.
<P>
	She got up on her first question and made a statement and I 
answered that statement. I said that Mr. Lund has not denied 
making the comment, which was heard by at least 10 people, to the 
effect that Canada's role in environment in Alberta should be 
restricted to national parks and their Indians.
<P>
	I would suggest that the hon. member, rather than trying to find 
another red herring, should stand in the House and apologize for 
her claim that I misrepresented Ty Lund's remarks.

	Will the Prime Minister admit that linking the survival of a

<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, again, the opposition's allegations are very close to being 
unparliamentary. They do this because they have no arguments to 
support their views.
<P>
	Speaking of documents, our document is available under the 
Access to Information Act. But what about the Le Hir studies, the 
hidden studies? When the Parti Quebecois and its little brother, the 
Bloc Quebecois, conduct studies that are inconsistent with their 
conclusions, what do they do? The same thing they did with the 
Georges Mathews and Bernier studies: they hide them.
<P>
	In this case, the information is available. This information helps 
us determine whether our subsidies can create jobs in Quebec. We 
have the public interest at heart. But in their case, the question is 
whether hiding the studies that are inconsistent with their 
conclusions is in the interest of Quebecers who will vote on 
October 30.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, could 
we have answers that come not from an armchair quarterback but 
from someone who is well briefed on the issue?
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister let Operation Unity take 680 
SNC-IT employees hostage by linking the awarding of a defence 
contract for the manufacture of ammunition to the referendum 
position of SNC bosses?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the allegation is totally false, and everyone knows that 
this industry is dependent on a Canadian government contract. That 
is the way it is. This industry has been in existence since the end of 
the second world war, since the war.
<P>
	Of course, if the Canadian government does not buy ammunition 
from an ammunition producer, I wonder who will.
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	It is quite normal for us to know this. If, in analyzing Quebec 
industries, the minister realizes that a business is completely 
dependent on the Canadian defence budget, I think it is quite 
normal for him to know this so that we can find out exactly what 
role the Canadian government plays in Quebec. In this case, it is 
fundamental.
<P>
	Without the Canadian government, without a defence 
department that buys ammunition from this industry, it would have 
to close its doors. But, since there is a Canadian government that 
has Quebecers' interests at heart, we continue to buy ammunition 
from this business.

mines that are now being discovered in Bosnia have a similar

the minister give the House his assurance that no land mines are 
now manufactured in Canada? More important, will he assure this

<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr.

have been informed that no such mines have been manufactured in 
Canada since 1992. In fact, none have been allowed to be exported 
since 1987.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, clearly, our referendum strategy calls upon all resources 
available to us in Quebec to try and convince Quebecers that it is in 
their interest to vote No.
<P>
	Now, I also read in <I>La Presse</I> what is happening. The CEQ, a 
pro-sovereignty union, is sending letters to all its members asking 
them to send money and to vote Yes. What is the difference 
between that organization and a business that needs to create jobs 
in a province and make profits and that realizes that its economic 
viability is dependent upon Quebec being part of a larger entity,  
namely Canada? Why should people who think it is in their best 
interest to do so not fight for federalism, just as the CEQ has no 
qualms soliciting money from its members and asking them to vote 
Yes?
<P>
	Clearly, what we are doing can be justified and is in the best 
interests of Quebecers.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr.

something before this House. That is a first.
<P>
	I would also like him to know that Ms. Pagé writes her own 
speeches and that, when she writes to her members, she has been 
given a mandate by the rank and file to do so. Perhaps he is the one 
who wrote Mr. Garcia's speech. This remains to be confirmed in 
another question.
<P>
	What does the Prime Minister call it when a government agency 
gathers information on business people, identifies ways of 
pressuring some of them and goes as far as telling them what to 
say?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I find it is quite normal to ask for other people's input 
when writing a speech. Information can be sought under the Access 
to Information Act. Any citizen can request information from 
government departments.
<P>
	So, when a citizen contacts a department and says: ``I have a 
speech to make. Can you provide me with some information?'' and 
that information is available, it is in keeping with our government's 
policy of openness to provide as much information as possible to 
all citizens, and Quebecers in particular at this time when they are 
about to make a decision that will affect their future for many years 
to come. In order to make the right choice, they must be fully aware 
of what the Government of Canada does for Quebec's industries, 
greatly helping them to develop and break into new markets so that 
jobs can be created for Quebecers within Canada.

bill combines our social and economic visions in a fair and 
reasonable way.
<P>
	Bill C-64 is a project for our entire society. It is based on 
partnerships. It is based on reaching for our highest ideals and 
turning them into a daily reality for all Canadians regardless of 
heritage, gender or disability. It is based on our truest sense of self 
as a people. Business, unions and designated groups agree we have 
found a direction for equity that is consistent with the best features 
of Canadian life.
<P>
	The Business Council of British Columbia said during a recent 
round of consultations: ``Employers alone cannot achieve 
employment equity. Employers want to be part of the solution in 
partnership with government, unions and employee 
representatives, educational institutions and designated group 
organizations''.
<P>
	The council is right. I know when I leave this place I will be 
pleased to know I helped with a piece of legislation that strengthens 
our economy and our society. It is simply one more step toward the 
kind of Canada we should all want to leave to our children and our 
grandchildren.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In my introduction, I used a quote from the red book, and I will 
conclude by doing the same.
<P>
	``We hope to ensure equal opportunities, so as to provide a 
decent standard of living to more Canadian families, as well as 
dignity and respect, in a country where social harmony prevails''.
<P>
	Equal opportunities for all. This is the Liberal Party's objective 
for Canada. This objective is at the heart of our vision of what our 
country should be.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have this 
opportunity to show how Canada is a leader when it comes to 
employment equity.
<P>
	Bill C-64 is a made in Canada legislative measure which meets 
the specific needs of the workplace in our country.
<P>
	I am proud to say that our government does not follow the 
American trend of criticizing employment equity. We should not be 
overly influenced by what goes on south of the border, since many 
problems arising American law do not occur in Canada.
<P>
	Given our history, our constitution and our social context, we do 
not do things the way the Americans do. I should add that the 
progress made so far tells us that we often make the right decisions.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let me offer this brief overview of the Employment Equity Act, 
an act that is unique in the world. It is distinctly Canadian.
<P>
	Our legislation is firmly grounded in this country's Constitution. 
In Canada every individual has the right to equality before and 
under the law, and equal protection and benefit of the law.
<P>
	As we have said in the red book, the Liberal Party plan for 
Canada, we want a country where we all see ourselves as 
contributors and participants, not liabilities and dependants. We are 
committed to a Canada characterized by integrity, compassion and 
competence.
<P>
	The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms recognizes that 
special consideration and the accommodation of differences are 
necessary to realize true equality under the law. Different treatment 
is not a departure from equality. It is essential however to achieve 
it.
<P>
	The Grand Chief of the Assembly of First Nations, Ovide 
Mercredi, explained it well when he told the Standing Committee 
on Human Rights and Status of Disabled Persons: ``I think 
sometimes people, white people in particular, forget that this is 
their society and it is not easy for others to get into it''.
<P>
	This legislation is designed precisely to build bridges between 
potential and opportunity.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In Canada, employment equity is proactive and positive. It is 
intended to prevent discrimination. It is designed to eliminate 
obstacles to employment for disadvantaged Canadians, through 
intelligent management of human resources making it easier for the 
new labour force of the 21st century to enter the job market.
<P>
	Our legislation encourages consultation between employers and 
workers to find solutions for problems arising at the workplace.
<P>
	Our approach is based on conciliation rather than use of the 
courts, because this is the Canadian approach. The aim of the 
federal government is to educate and help employers by creating 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15188"> 15188 </A></B>
<P>
employment opportunities enjoyed  by all members of the labour 
force for members of designated groups.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Another central feature of our system is our firm belief in 
flexible targets businesses can reasonably achieve. In both our 
original Employment Equity Act and in the current bill to replace it 
we have purposely sought the views of employers, unions and 
members of the designated groups.
<P>
	We have listened and learned, recognizing we must strike the 
right balance, ensuring the law will not solve one set of problems 
for employees by creating another problem for employers.
<P>
	That is why Bill C-64 has been specifically designed to 
minimize the regulatory burden. It also makes programs more cost 
effective and enforcement measures much more efficient.
<P>
	The bonus for Canadian companies is when everyone's best 
interests are served there is a direct improvement to the bottom 
line.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In fact, employment equity is not hard to sell. According to the 
Business Council of British Columbia in its testimony before the 
standing committee studying Bill C-64, the four designated groups 
make up 60 per cent of Canada's population. As employment 
equity programs are implemented, it went on to say, the labour 
force will better reflect the diversity of the Canadian people with 
all the social and economic advantages this comprises. Our 
experience with employment equity proves that, when a solution is 
practical for business and protects human dignity, everyone 
benefits.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	Employment equity helps fill the gaps in our economic 
development and therefore it strengthens our economy as a whole.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The newspapers are full of stories about business executives 
extolling the virtues of employment equity. For example, Dan 
Branda, chief executive officer of Hewlett-Packard Canada told a 
<I>Globe and Mail</I> reporter that diversity:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-is an absolute business imperative because it gives us the edge in attracting 
the best and the brightest people. It positions us as an employer of choice and 
will help us in competing in a market that is becoming increasing diverse and 
global.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The chief executive officer of the Canadian Occidental 
Petroleum, Bernard Isautier said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Diversity is a source of competitive advantage. Canada is a country with a 
respect for differences, for different cultures, for different opinions and respect in 
general for the individual. That makes Canadians particularly well received when 
they deal with  foreign countries. I think Canada should capitalize more on these 
capacities.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	No one would agree more than the young woman who is able to 
pursue a career in the trades, the young aboriginal student who sees 
his post-secondary studies lead to full employment in industry, the 
Asian engineer who is able to use her skills to improve production 
processes to make a firm more competitive or the disabled adult 
who gains financial and social independence, enjoying the dignity 
and security that comes with a salary.
<P>
	This legislation is a recommitment of the government to equality 
for all Canadians. With Bill C-64 we are continuing our tradition of 
international leadership in the area of employment equity, while 
choosing to lead rather than be led. In these changing times, 
assuming our responsibility is making the most of the opportunities 
that change represents. In the process, we are creating a more 
united nation and building a more innovative economy.
<P>
	Most of all, we are putting into practice the very values that 
make each of us so proud to be a Canadian: fairness, justice and 
equality for all.

He said: Mr. Speaker, this section of Bill C-64, the Employment 
Equity Act, otherwise known as affirmative action, goes right back 
to the start and I would merely add to earlier comments I made. I 
should put this in some context for members in the House who, 
unfortunately, were not here earlier today to hear my initial 
comments on the bill and for those many thousands of Canadians 
watching on television.
<P>
	Bill C-64 is the Employment Equity Act brought forward by the 
Liberal government. Employment equity is a phrase coined by 
Judge Abella about 12 or 13 years ago, in the full understanding 
that affirmative action would never sell in Canada. To make it 
politically correct it was given a new name and it became 
employment equity rather than affirmative action.
<P>
	Here we are with affirmative action in the guise of employment 
equity.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Wrong, absolutely wrong.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> I hear wails of 
outrage from members opposite. I can understand that. However 
the foundation on which this bill rests is faulty. It is false. The 
foundation is that somehow or other Canadians are a mean, 
regressive, racist, discriminating people. Canadians are nothing of 
the sort. We are not that. We do not need the federal government 
creating more paperwork, more book work, in order to do what it 
feels, I am sure, is the right thing, to prevent discrimination in the 
workplace.
<P>
	When debate on third reading unfolds we will make it 
abundantly clear that no such discrimination exists in the 
workplace. The workplace, particularly outside the federal 
government, is progressive. Industry leads. It is a totally 
unnecessary law.
<P>
	I know we are all going to have an opportunity to say what we 
wish to say about Bill C-64 when it comes to third reading and I 
will leave my introductory comments at that.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to address some of the fears 
and misconceptions which the Reform Party member is taking 
advantage of in this motion on best qualified.
<P>
	These are anxious times for many Canadians. The economy, 
while improving, is no longer as assured as it once was. Jobs are 
not as permanent as once expected. Canada's labour force has 
experienced swings as traditional industries shed workers, while 
new ones arise with different skill needs. There is a sense that the 
economic pie is not growing as much as we would like it to.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	The government understands that families face social pressures 
that were largely absent a generation ago. Young people grow up 
surrounded by issues from which they cannot be sheltered. There is 
a sense that our society is more troubled than it once was.
<P>
	The federal government is pursuing an agenda that is addressing 
those issues. However, we recognize that there are a lot of ways 
that people respond to those different kinds of uncertainty. One is 
backlash against people who are perceived as part of the problem. 
Any groups that are seen to be by some as pushing for too much or 
getting an undeserved share of too limited resources face an angry 
response.
<P>
	I think this is the real motivation behind the Reform Party's 
introduction of this motion on best qualified.
<P>
	However, the truth is often far different than those stories would 
indicate. Unfortunately, lots of people are having trouble finding 
good work. In fact, people from the designated groups under 
employment equity are more likely to experience those problems 
that other persons.
<P>
	Employment equity is not about preferential treatment. The 
simple fact is that Bill C-64 does not oblige an employer to hire an 
unqualified person. It is quite explicit on that point.
<P>
	Let me quote Mona Katawne of Manitoba Telephone System 
who testified before the standing committee. She said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>There is no evidence that hiring from among the designated group members 
is a lowering of qualifications; in fact, the evidence is to the contrary. There are 
people from the designated groups who are both available to work and qualified 
to work.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The fact is that our economy has surpluses of highly qualified 
people from all designated groups for many of the jobs that are out 
there.
<P>
	However, this myth of preferential treatment persists because of 
misinformation. A perfect example is the Gallup poll that appeared 
in the December 23, 1993 Toronto <I>Star</I>. The headlines blared that 
74 per cent oppose job equity programs. Let us take a look at the 
actual question. What was the question? It was:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Do you believe government should actively attempt to hire more women and 
minority group members for management positions, or should government take 
no action whatsoever and hire new employees based solely on their 
qualifications?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	With such a question the response was what the headlines blared. 
The question unfairly forced people to choose between actively 
attempting to hire more women and minority group members and 
hiring based on qualifications. I am not surprised that 74 per cent, 
when asked such a question, chose qualifications.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15190"> 15190 </A></B>
<P>
	Employment equity means broadening access to all qualified 
people. It means giving people the chance to become better 
qualified.
<P>
	On virtually any scale, people in the designated groups fare 
poorly in today's labour market. I want to underscore that point. 
There are still barriers to full participation by members of the 
designated groups. The goal of this legislation is to end those 
barriers, not to create a new discrimination against someone else. It 
is to end those barriers.
<P>
	Let us look at one specific group that fares especially poorly in 
our labour market and that is people with disabilities. Only about 
60 per cent of adults with disabilities are in the labour market at all. 
They have unemployment rates that are almost double the national 
average and that costs us all as Canadians.
<P>
	The Canadian Association for Community Living did a study 
that looked at people with mental disabilities. They calculated the 
loss to our economy of large scale segregation of these people from 
our economy in terms of lost tax revenue due to unemployment, 
social assistance costs and lost consumption. They found that the 
cost to Canada's economy of keeping these people out of society in 
many ways is about $4.6 billion a year.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	We must reject those attacks on employment equity and defeat 
the motion. It is important that those of us who come here 
responsibly realize and recognize the demands of society, the 
demands that are before us, and do what Canadians expect of all of 
us in the House. They expect us to be caring, compassionate, 
responsible individuals ready to meet the needs of society, ready to 
ensure that equity and equality exist in society.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and 
Addington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to address the motion put 
forward by the hon. member to amend clause 6.
<P>
	Let me say at the outset that clause 6 was included in the bill to 
dispel certain myths about employment equity. One such myth is 
that employment equity means hiring unqualified people. 
According to this myth employment equity requires employers to 
lower their standards and change their job requirements to 
accommodate inferior candidates.
<P>
	This notion is absolutely false. It is pure nonsense. It is the 
complete misunderstanding of what employment equity is about 
and it is extremely degrading to members of designated groups.
<P>
	We have included clause 6 in the bill to make it perfectly clear to 
everyone, so there can be no mistake. However the change 
proposed by the hon. member is unacceptable. Although it adds 
nothing of substance to the bill, it creates a host of additional 
problems by including the new notion of best qualified.
<P>
	The first problem is obvious. What does best qualified mean? 
How do we determine best? Best according to whose definition? I 
do not deny that sometimes it may be possible to establish a very 
sophisticated, completely objective method to determine a best 
candidate, but too often best simply ends up meaning someone just 
like me. In these situations best becomes another excuse to create 
barriers. We do not need more barriers.
<P>
	Who was best? Is the candidate with the most university degrees 
always the best? Let us say we are talking about hiring a cook or a 
manual labourer. Book learning is not the main qualification for the 
job. Obviously skill is. Is the candidate with a master's degree in 
law better qualified than the high school graduate, even though the 
degree has nothing to do with the job at all? Or, have we created 
just another barrier? I repeat that we do not need more barriers.
<P>
	The government stands firm about employment equity. It does 
not require any employer to hire unqualified individuals. However 
it asks employers to look actively for qualified applicants in places 
they might not have previously looked. It asks them to find 
qualified workers in designated groups that have been overlooked 
and consider them along with other qualified candidates. It asks 
them to eliminate barriers in these processes, but it does not dictate 
the outcome of the hiring and the promotion decision. It certainly 
never asks them to hire someone who is not qualified.
<P>
	Sometimes certain employers go further. Sometimes a big 
hearted employer will find and train people who have not had a 
chance. They will see to it that these people become qualified. Let 
us make no mistake. These employers do not have to do it. The law 
does not require it. However they find it brings their companies 
unexpected benefits.
<P>
	I will tell a story about one such employer. Canada Mortgage and 
Housing Corporation, a crown corporation, recently instituted a 
special pilot program for four young people with intellectual 
disabilities. Three of the four have Down's syndrome. These four 
individuals were carefully trained for the company for temporary 
photocopying, filing and messenger jobs. They were always 
willing and co-operative. They were extremely proud of their new 
found independence and their success in this work. Their families 
were grateful that the responsibility for their children was being 
shared.
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	It is most interesting that although the four people required extra 
supervision they unexpectedly brought much happiness and 
compassion into the workplace. Though their lot in life was 
different they never complained. Their happiness and gratitude 
were contagious. They caused very beautiful qualities to blossom 
in their fellow workers who were touched and inspired by their 
innocence, simplicity and gratitude.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15191"> 15191 </A></B>
<P>
	These four individuals brought a great deal of joy to the 
workplace. The project's participants, supervisors and workers 
received one of CMHC president's excellence awards in 1994. 
Though they may not have been the best qualified for the job 
according to traditional standards, they performed their job with 
enthusiasm and in doing it brought something special to the 
workplace. They made it a better workplace for everyone.
<P>
	Sometimes the whole is more than just the sum of the parts. In 
looking for excellence we sometimes find it in the most unexpected 
places. We sometimes achieve it in the most unexpected ways. This 
is one lesson of employment equity. I would not want to tie in any 
way the hands of an employer who wants to undertake an 
innovative program such as the one at CMHC.
<P>
	I frankly do not know what the full impact of including best 
qualified in this section might be. I fear, however, that it would 
ultimately constrain the efforts of employers who will look for best 
in new areas and for best in the sum total of the parts. For these 
reasons I cannot support the motion.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I should like to follow on the hon. member's comments 
with respect to the word best and the concept of best qualified 
which Reform is seeking to introduce into the legislation. It strikes 
me that it could have a twist, an irony of resulting in imposing on 
the private sector a ridiculous standard. The word best is very hard 
to define. The prior speaker indicated that he thought the language 
itself was problematic.
<P>
	If we use the term best qualified then we would have to look 
somewhere for a definition of it. I briefly looked in the Oxford 
dictionary and it states that the word best can be an adjective, a 
noun or an adverb. It is defined as follows: ``excelling all others, 
inherent or relative to some standard, the most appropriate, 
advantageous, desirable, or in a person, the kindest, the greatest in 
size or quantity'', and so on.
<P>
	I wonder how the Reform Party will explain that kind of an 
imposition of regulation on the private sector. Which of those 
definitions should we choose? Are we asking employers to hire the 
biggest person, the kindest person, the most appropriate person? If 
the job involves answering the telephone, do we need a Ph.D. in 
communications, or would a graduate certificate from a business 
college suffice? Could we use someone who has a physical 
disability to answer the telephone?
<P>
	My view and the view of many people on this side of the House 
is that the imposition of the term best qualified is ridiculous in this 
context. How can we legislate a definition of best, a word that 
could have different grammatical forms?
<P>
	All this goes back to the fundamental Reform position which is 
absurd in my view. Government is not here to create barriers. 
Government sometimes has to act to take  away the barriers, to 
intervene on behalf of our citizens to remove barriers in different 
situations: barriers in the legal system and barriers in employment.
<P>
	Reform has stated today: ``The only criteria on which people 
should be hired or promoted is merit. Anything else is 
discrimination''.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	Testosterone levels are a little high on the Reform benches today. 
The concept of discrimination is dealt with under the Canadian 
Human Rights Act. If Reformers would bother to read that act, they 
would see that their definition of discrimination does not hold 
water.
<P>
	The Canadian Human Rights Act specifically allows special 
programs designed to reduce the disadvantage suffered by groups 
or individuals when those disadvantages are based on race, national 
or ethnic origin, sex, disability and other characteristics such as 
accidents of one's birth or accidents of one's life. These programs 
are allowed under that statute and under the Constitution of 
Canada.
<P>
	I know it upsets them to mention the charter of rights and 
freedoms because they do not like it. However I would like to draw 
the attention of hon. members to the law of the land, section 15(2) 
of the charter which deals with the right to equality before and 
under the law and to equal protection and benefit for all 
individuals.
<P>
	Subsection 15(2) of the charter states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Subsection (1) does not preclude any law, program or activity that has as its 
object the amelioration of conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups 
including those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic 
origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is part of the country's Constitution. It means that equality 
means more than just treating everyone identically. It means that 
equality also requires special measures and the accommodation of 
differences. That is what employment equity seeks to do, to 
achieve equality in the workplace through the accommodation of 
differences, through the elimination of barriers, through outreach 
recruiting programs, but not through hiring the unqualified. This is 
not discrimination by any stretch of the imagination.
<P>
	We fully support hiring on the basis of merit. Nobody is 
disputing that point. However Reformers have created a strawman. 
They call it discrimination. They set it up and then they knock it 
down.
<P>
	That is why section 6 is included in the act. Section 6 is there 
because employment equity does not require any employer to hire 
someone who is unqualified. That is what section 6 does.
<P>
	How much clearer can we be? Reform repeatedly insists on 
raising this spectre. I want to be perfectly clear that employment 
equity is by no stretch of the  imagination discrimination. It is 
perfectly compatible with the Canadian Human Rights Act and the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. If Reform members 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15192"> 15192 </A></B>
<P>
object then we should let their objection be against the foundations 
of the country and not against the employment equity act.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have heard Reform members say that we should be hiring on the 
basis of merit. That is what the legislation is all about. It is what it 
has been all about for over eight years now.
<P>
	It is about getting rid of barriers in the system that have 
prevented people from being hired, from being promoted, from 
being given job opportunity regardless of merit. Colour of their 
skin, aboriginal origin, disability and gender have all acted against 
people of merit and kept them from getting jobs. That is exactly 
what the legislation is about.
<P>
	We disagree that the Reform Party does not want to accept the 
reality of life for over 60 per cent of Canadians who have not been 
given opportunity, despite their merit, despite their ability, despite 
the contribution they have to make. The legislation and the 
pre-existing employment equity act are all about making merit and 
only merit the criteria on which hiring takes place.
<P>
	I welcome the motion. It gives me an opportunity to clarify what 
the bill tries to do. It is an employment equity act. It is not an 
employment preference act. It is about creating equality in the 
workplace. It is about fairness. It is about removing employment 
barriers which blind us to the merit of individuals to provide all 
with the opportunity to compete fairly for jobs. It is about hiring 
qualified people to do the job, not only those who fit an image that 
for a long time we as a society and managers in our society have 
seen as the kind of person most likely to succeed.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	Let me read what Bill C-64 says in this regard. The bill states 
that the obligation to implement employment equity does not 
require an employer to hire or promote unqualified persons. That is 
very clear, notwithstanding the comments that have been made 
about employment equity requiring somebody to hire somebody 
just because they are female or are black or Oriental or aboriginal 
or just because they use a wheelchair.
<P>
	Members can refer to the existing paragraph 6(b) for 
confirmation. We want to create a level playing field for all 
workers. That is why we insist on the equal consideration of all 
qualified applicants. We believe that every individual, regardless of 
race, gender, or disability, must have a fair opportunity to prove his 
or her abilities and be given a fair chance to contribute to the 
Canadian workplace.
<P>
	For far too long a large segment of our society has not been 
allowed to contribute to the Canadian economy the  abilities they 
have. As we face an increasingly competitive global marketplace, 
we cannot afford not to use the full talents of all our people.
<P>
	Bill C-64 is not about dictating to employers the result of an 
individual recruitment decision. It is about encouraging employers 
to assess their entire approach to employment, to make sure they do 
not either consciously or inadvertently create barriers to capable 
job candidates. Let me repeat that: capable job candidates.
<P>
	There is no doubt that those barriers do exist. I believe my hon. 
colleague underestimates the prevalence of systemic although 
unconscious discrimination in the workplace. It is as insidious as it 
is invisible. Countless well qualified men and women members of 
the designated groups have not obtained positions or promotions 
because of their race, their physical attributes, or their gender. To 
dispute this is to deny mountains of reports that consistently paint a 
picture of workplace injustice. To deny this is to deny the real daily 
and painful experience and frustration of millions of Canadians 
who are not allowed to contribute up to their ability.
<P>
	Systemic discrimination is no longer acceptable. With this 
legislation we are encouraging employers to create the conditions 
in which no segment of the population will be discriminated 
against or excluded in job competitions. Only in this way can we be 
assured that those selected will be the most capable of doing the 
task.
<P>
	I hope my hon. colleague understands that this bill establishes a 
floor, a foundation from which employers can build a more 
equitable and representative workforce. They can only do that by 
getting rid of barriers that have kept women, people of colour, 
aboriginal people, and people with disabilities largely in the lowest 
paying jobs.
<P>
	The point of the act is not to tell employers how to go about the 
details of their business. This House is not interested in the 
micro-management of the affairs of business. Employers have 
made it clear that they do not need nor want the hand of 
government in their internal operations. That is why this 
amendment is so out of place. The impact of the Reform Party's 
amendment would be to get into the business of telling companies 
how to run their businesses.
<P>
	Best by whose definition? Best by the definition that has taken 
the category of clerks in the public service, the lowest paid and 
probably the least qualified in many cases. Eighty-five per cent of 
them are women. But in the top ranks of that lowest category, guess 
who rises? It is not the women, who are 84 per cent of the 
employees, but the men.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	We have had employment equity not by legislation but by policy 
in the federal government for over a decade. Still barely 18 per cent 
of our management category are women.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15193"> 15193 </A></B>
<P>
	Maybe Reform Party members would like to make the argument 
that women are inherently less qualified and that is why they have 
not risen to the top. Well, I would love to see them try to justify 
that argument.
<P>
	Maybe they have not read the reports that say that equally or 
better qualified black males in the country earn up to 20 per cent 
less than white males. Maybe they have not seen the reports that 
document how the disabled are kept out of employment and if they 
do get employment it is often temporary, short term, and low paid.
<P>
	Maybe Reform members want preferential treatment for less 
than half of our population to continue. Maybe they do not want 
everybody to have an equal opportunity. Well, this government 
does. We believe that we have an extremely talented population 
and it is going to be essential to our competitiveness that we use 
every bit of talent this country possesses. We have to get rid of the 
blinkers and blinders that have kept both government and the 
private sector from giving opportunities to people based solely on 
their merit. We have to get rid of the perception of gender that says 
women cannot do certain kinds of jobs, or certainly cannot do them 
as well as men.
<P>
	I do not know a man who is competent or capable who is not 
prepared to compete on an equal playing field with any woman in 
Canadian society. Those who want to continue preferential 
treatment must have something to fear, and they all seem to be 
concentrated in the Reform Party.
<P>
	This country has prided itself on equality of opportunity. This is 
another step forward in equality of opportunity. The Reform Party 
keeps referring to social engineering. Well, it is social engineering 
when 90 per cent of those who rise to the top represent less than 
half of the population. That is social engineering. It is 
unconscionable. It is a waste of the talents and energy of the 
majority of the Canadian population.
<P>
	No, I do not have all the answers. But I do know that I do not 
want to walk into the banks of this country and tell them very 
precisely that they must hire only the best qualified, which then 
government would be constrained to define in the legislation so 
they could apply my definition to every single hiring process, 
which happens by the hundreds of thousands in the banks of this 
country every year. No, I do not want to operate that way. Yet that is 
the way the amendment from the Reform Party would have us 
operate.
<P>
	I urge the House to reject the amendment and I urge us to get on 
with the business of hiring people in the country based on merit and 
not on their gender, race, disability, or aboriginal origin.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me 
great pleasure to speak on the bill  and maybe share with my 
colleagues some of my own experiences in this area.
<P>
	I can tell the House that Bill C-64 is very progressive because it 
is the way corporations and large businesses are going. As a 
member of the board of directors of B.C. Hydro, we adopted a 
theme and a vision for the corporation that the workforce of the 
corporation should reflect the community it serves.
<P>
	The bankers have said it is the right way to go. Let me read to the 
House what the Canadian bankers have stated on employment 
equity: ``It has stimulated fundamental reviews and enhancement 
in the bank's human resource policies and practices, which have 
benefited everyone. It has helped us lay the foundation for 
managing an increasingly diverse workforce, something every 
employer of choice in the 1990s wants to do well.''
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	Whether it is West Coast Energy, the banks, or any other 
corporation, they have recognized that the future workforce is 
going to be diverse. They have to plan for that diverse workforce. 
They have to ensure that the future workforce has the skills. 
Employment equity takes the barriers down. It takes away those 
barriers that do exist. And they do exist.
<P>
	I remember when I was about 18 years old I used to work in a 
sawmill at Crown Zellerbach. I noticed that out of a very large 
workforce of 2,000 to 2,500 it did not reflect what every other 
sawmill reflected. It came to my attention that the personnel 
manager at that time was discriminating. He was discriminating 
against hiring visible minorities.
<P>
	I had a job there. I got a job and I could have said I have my job, I 
do not have to worry about this. But it did not reflect the 
community. People who would apply there from visible minority 
groups and who had the qualifications would not get hired.
<P>
	I remember I was 18 years old and I made an appointment with 
the vice-president of the corporation. I went there and said he had a 
personnel manager who discriminates against certain groups and is 
not hiring them. Of course they were very defensive and said that it 
was not true, but in fact it was true. It was true.
<P>
	Even though the vice-president of the corporation at that time 
did not admit that, the personnel manager was let go. Lo and 
behold, over the next two or three years we saw quite a different 
hiring procedure, quite a different way in which people were hired.
<P>
	There are barriers all the time. There are barriers against the 
disabled. I know that. My own father unfortunately lost his vision 
around 22 or 23 years ago, when he was a young man of 40. When 
that happens to someone who is close to you, you realize the 
barriers that exist to them, the barriers of their daily life, never 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15194"> 15194 </A></B>
<P>
mind the barriers of trying to get employment, trying to make  sure 
that you are fulfilling your daily life, the things we take for granted.
<P>
	This employment equity bill recognizes that barriers exist 
against certain groups. We want to have a plan to reduce those 
barriers, just as we do in this House. We want to ensure for example 
that more women are represented in the House. Is it wrong to plan 
to do things in a better way to improve their representation in the 
House? Is that wrong? That is right.
<P>
	There are ways we can do things to take away those barriers, to 
reduce those barriers. That is what the employment equity bill is all 
about. It recognizes that barriers exist and that we want both in the 
public sector and in the private sector to lay out a plan. Maybe it is 
their hiring procedure. They have to look at how they hire.
<P>
	For example, the aboriginal community has been left out, and we 
have to work hard to include them. Look at the social problems in 
the aboriginal community. I have gone through the streets of 
Vancouver with a policeman and walked through some of the most 
difficult areas there. We know that we have neglected our job, that 
we have not done it, because we see so many of them with drug and 
alcohol problems, with tremendous social problems. They have 
been left out. They have not been able to participate in the benefits 
and in the economy.
<P>
	First we must recognize that those barriers exist. All of this is a 
plan to see how we can tear down those barriers, reduce those 
barriers by saying we are not doing things the right way. Maybe we 
are not hiring in the right way. Maybe we are not planning, maybe 
we are not training. All of these things are very important.
<P>
	It is also beneficial and profitable for the corporation. As 
someone who was an employer, I know how important it is to make 
sure you have a diverse workforce, because in the global economy 
that diverse workforce will be a great advantage to you. It will 
provide new sources of energy, different ways of looking at things, 
and it will open doors when we trade in the international 
community and in the global economy. We have to recognize that 
as an asset. We have to recognize that our diverse population is a 
tremendous asset. We have to recognize that in all our corporations 
and companies the diverse population should be reflected in those 
institutions and in our private sector corporations.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	This is an excellent bill. When the members of the Reform really 
have a good look at this bill they will support it. It will make sure 
we do things better, that we include people, that we make sure we 
have a good reflection of what this country is all about in all our 
institutions, in our private corporations as well as our public 
corporations.

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ) </B>moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 7</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-64, in Clause 15, be amended by replacing lines 14 to 27, on page 
10, with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``(<I>b</I>) the preparation of the employer's employment equity plan.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) Where the employees are represented by a bargaining agent, the 
bargaining agent shall participate in a consultation under subsection (1).</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(3) A consultation under subsection (1) is not a form of co-management.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(4) The employer and its employees' representatives must implement and 
revise the employment equity plan jointly.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am tempted to say that this is one of the 
best motions you will see during your career, and I am rather 
confident at this point that even the government will support it.
<P>
	We spent a lot of time reviewing Bill C-64, which was referred to 
our committee at second reading. This motion essentially provides 
that employment equity must be based on a joint effort, so as to 
ensure that it is effective and that the prescribed objectives will be 
reflected in the workplace.
<P>
	Any organization that has been successful in promoting 
employment equity has managed to do so because the employer's 
and the employees' representatives got together and agreed on 
certain objectives.
<P>
	This amendment seeks to ensure that employees' representatives 
can participate in the preparation and implementation of the 
employment equity plan. As you know, the Bloc Quebecois is very 
much in favour of employment equity.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15195"> 15195 </A></B>
<P>
	The problem that we found when we reviewed this bill, and the 
parliamentary secretary should pay attention since his support 
would be helpful, is that there is no clear provision to ensure that 
workers will be involved in the implementation of the plan.
<P>
	The bill only includes a rather vague provision on the 
implementation of employment equity plans, and the parliamentary 
secretary cannot pretend to ignore the fact that the clause did not 
receive much support.
<P>
	Indeed, the parliamentary secretary surely remembers that, when 
union officials appeared before the committee, they expressed a 
great deal of concern about clauses 14 and 15 dealing with the 
consultation process. Clause 15 refers to a consultation, but it does 
so in general terms; there is no mandatory or compulsory process.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	It is very important to understand the purpose of the amendment, 
and I think the Reform Party will agree that an employment equity 
policy is not feasible without the consent of all parties within a 
company.
<P>
	That is definitely the purpose of this amendment. Companies 
and workers even came to see us to compare notes. They told us 
that in the Canada Labour Code, a provision required the policy on 
sexual harassment to be posted. What kind of action or measures 
should be part of an employer's policy against sexual harassment? 
A number of unions came to see us and said that ideally, to promote 
employment equity each employee should receive the employment 
equity plan. The plan would be available in the company and be 
posted in public rooms and areas.
<P>
	We can never stress enough the importance of consultation and 
consensus in achieving this goal. We were and still are afraid that if 
we as parliamentarians, if the House of Commons does not adopt 
this amendment, the bill will again suffer a degree of imbalance 
and there would be a definite bias towards the employer and a 
tendency to be less forthcoming to the representatives of the 
workers.
<P>
	I may recall that this bill will make the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission responsible for monitoring employment equity. In 
case of violations of this legislation, the commission may establish 
an employment equity review tribunal.
<P>
	This is a major innovation. Unfortunately, the tribunal will not 
include labour representatives. What also bothers us in this bill is 
that because there will be an employment equity review tribunal 
consisting of three people, there will be no right of appeal. This is 
quite a decision, and I see Mr. Speaker, that you share my 
reservations and that is your social conscience speaking out.
<P>
	My point is that there are few instances under our justice system 
when there is no right of appeal. In most cases, whether we are 
talking about criminal law or an administrative tribunal, it is a 
foregone conclusion, and the hon. member for Lotbinière is aware 
of this, that the person who appears before a tribunal always has the 
possibility of launching an appeal.
<P>
	In this case, there is a clear imbalance which the amendments of 
the Bloc Quebecois are meant to correct, and I am confident that 
the government majority will support this view. As for the Reform 
Party, knowing what they are like, I never felt very confident about 
their support.
<P>
	It would be very interesting at this time, for continuation of the 
debate, if the parliamentary secretary would rise and agree with me 
that the bill would be improved by acceptance of the Bloc 
Quebecois amendments, which I would remind you would ensure 
that negotiating agents, if present in a company, would be involved 
in more than just the drafting process, through the employer's 
possibility of consulting them. These consultations however are 
often optional rather than mandatory.
<P>
	With our amendments, there would be an obligation not only to 
consult the workers' representatives, the negotiating agents, but 
also to involve them in the implementation process. Consultation is 
equally important during implementation, when an employment 
equity plan has been agreed upon, as it often has to be lived with for 
two, three or four years. There may be staff turnover, but the basic 
objectives remain.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	We on this side of the House are of the belief that the way to 
meet the objectives and to ensure that the plan is what both 
management and labour want is to require the employer's 
representative, who may make his views known in a tribunal 
specifically designed for that purpose, to remedy any existing 
imbalance, and to ensure not only that workers and their 
representatives are consulted on an optional basis, but rather that 
their participation in the implementation process is mandatory.
<P>
	As you know, the implementation process is, in concrete terms, 
the way the objectives will be met after concrete agreement on an 
employment equity program is reached. This is something no 
legislator can put into the wording of a statute, because it is part of 
the internal dynamics of a company. It is a bit like a marriage 
contract. You may well say: ``Who does he think he is, talking of 
marriage?''
<P>
	But you would be wrong in that, Mr. Speaker, because I have 
many examples around me of what marriage is, and I know that 
marriage is a matter of trust. It is a matter of an undertaking 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15196"> 15196 </A></B>
<P>
between two individuals, whether of the same sex or of opposite 
sexes, who have  chosen to forge a link of trust. For employment 
equity to be a viable entity, for it to be realistic, there must be trust 
and understanding involving all parties concerned. And by all 
parties concerned I mean of course the negotiating agents, if 
present in the company, and the representatives of the employer.
<P>
	I would be extremely disappointed-having invested a great deal 
of energy, working hard on the committee, as the government is 
well aware, the parliamentary secretary as well-extremely 
disappointed if ever these amendments were struck down. I must 
admit that my confidence in this government would be seriously 
compromised in future if that happened.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this 
opportunity to express our reservations concerning the amendment 
presented by my colleague. Like my colleagues I do, however, 
appreciate what my colleague and his party, the Bloc Quebecois, 
are attempting to do with a view to improving Bill C-64.
<P>
	Examining the motion, I find it goes a bit too far. Its intentions 
are probably honourable, but if we look at it in detail, the 
amendment is not practical. What is being proposed in this 
amendment is to create a prerequisite that both groups, employers 
and employees, establish equity plans.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This proposed change to the legislation would create a 
requirement for employer and employee representatives to 
implement and revise employment equity plans jointly.
<P>
	I can appreciate that my colleagues believe it is essential to have 
labour input for the planning and application of employment equity 
in the workplace. I assure them that within the existing legislation 
provisions have been made to ensure there will be consultation and 
collaboration between the parties in the preparation, 
implementation and revisions of companies' employment equity 
plans.
<P>
	The bill was amended by the standing committee as a result of 
input from the Bloc Quebecois. It was the previous speaker who 
encouraged the committee to include this provision.
<P>
	Clause 15 of Bill C-64 acknowledges that collaboration between 
management and labour is necessary if changes sought by 
employment equity are to come about. It signals that success in 
achieving an employment equity workforce requires the active 
collaboration of labour and employers to eliminate artificial 
barriers to members of the designated groups. However, we must 
not confuse representation with responsibility. Collaboration is not 
co-management for very good reasons.
<P>
	If implemented this amendment could seriously compromise the 
prerogatives of management to implement employment equity at 
the work site as it sees fit.
<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	The employer must have the final say over the way employment 
equity affects the workplace because it is ultimately the employer 
who is legally responsible for the act's implementation. Only 
management is accountable for meeting the obligations set out in 
this legislation. It would be patently unfair to impose that 
responsibility on management if it was forced to share all decision 
making with its employee representatives.
<P>
	There are several other good reasons why this motion must be 
defeated. Among them is the fact that the proposed amendment 
would only preserve the co-management limitations for the initial 
preparation of an employment equity plan. This provision would be 
removed for the implementation and revision phases of the 
employment equity plans. Further and perhaps of greatest 
consequence, the amendment could lead to a requirement for 
negotiation between labour and management rather than a 
consultation.
<P>
	I can assure the House that we are not prepared to see 
employment equity used as a bargaining chip in contract talks and 
negotiations. A bargaining agent might refuse to co-operate, 
perhaps motivated by reasons that have absolutely nothing to do 
with the goals of employment equity and thereby bring the 
implementation of a workplace plan to a halt. We will not have this 
critical piece of legislation compromised by the vagaries of 
union-management talks in negotiations.
<P>
	Another important consideration is that employment equity is an 
integral part of human resources management. Company after 
company testified before the Standing Committee on Human 
Rights and the Status of Disabled Persons and told us what an 
important tool employment equity has become in their overall 
business plans.
<P>
	The sort of regime proposed by the Bloc Quebecois might 
provide unions with an opportunity to exercise direct influence in 
areas that remain the sole prerogatives of management, such as 
recruitment.
<P>
	I have several other fundamental problems with this motion, 
which is obviously very flawed. Let us look at the reality that the 
collaboration requirement cannot be the subject of a direction by 
the human rights commission or an order by a tribunal. Clearly a 
true spirit of co-operation has to come about spontaneously. It 
cannot be forced or coerced.
<P>
	Aside from that, there is the fact that the primary reason the 
government decided against making this collaboration the subject 
of a direction or order is that there is no provision in the act for a 
tribunal to make orders against a bargaining agent. Collaboration 
requires  two parties working together. It would be discriminatory 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15197"> 15197 </A></B>
<P>
to enforce this provision against only one of those parties, that is, 
the employer. It is worth noting that the proposed amendment will 
also reduce the consultation requirement that exists in Bill C-64.
<P>
	In the amendment there no longer has to be consultation about 
the implementation or revision of an employment equity plan. That 
consultation requirement can be the subject of a direction by the 
commission or an order by a tribunal. I must say I find it surprising 
that the Bloc would recommend deleting these crucial provisions 
and replacing them with weaker provisions that cannot be the 
subject of a direction or order.
<P>
	For these reasons, it simply does not make sense to seriously 
entertain this motion. The government is satisfied with the clause 
the way it now stands as amended in committee.
<P>
	Again I want to thank the Bloc for its contribution in committee 
in this regard. I believe our willingness to accommodate the Bloc's 
concerns is testament to the goodwill we see in this House. But we 
must not be tempted by good intentions to push the process too far. 
To go further is inadvisable.
<P>
	Our approach to this issue is not arbitrary nor is our amendment 
despotic. It is simply realistic. Management has the final 
responsibility for all employer obligations under the bill and will 
be answerable to the Canadian Human Rights Commission if the 
obligations are not met. Therefore final decision making must 
continue to belong to management.
<P>
	I trust that this explanation satisfies the House that this motion 
must be rejected. I urge my colleagues to do precisely that.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be very brief. I am rising to speak in support of my 
colleague's motion.
<P>
	Members present all know that this legislation is going to go 
through come hell or high water, so the very least we can try to do 
is make it better. This motion by my hon. colleague does make it 
better. It ensures that the workers, the people who are intimately 
involved in this, have a say in what goes on.
<P>
	As long as we are going to have this employment equity or 
affirmative action, the very least we can do is try to make sure it is 
going to work. The motion put forward by my colleague from the 
Bloc will go a long way in helping to ensure that it does work. 
Therefore, I rise to make the point that we are in support of this 
motion.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I can hardly stay on my feet after that. It is phenomenal.
<P>
	The hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve has made a 
great contribution to this legislation at committee. Although I am 
not a permanent member of that committee, I do have some interest 
in this particular legislation and sat in on that committee a couple 
of times and was very encouraged by his participation.
<P>
	I do have some reservations about this motion, but not because I 
am not sympathetic to union-sided labour requests. In fact I am 
very sympathetic to their concerns. However, it seems to me that 
this section is not necessary in order to get co-operation between 
management and trade unions or employee unions in this context. 
Any employment equity plan could and should and indeed 
probably will be the subject of a collective agreement.
<P>
	The problem I have with this is in legislating union involvement 
as opposed to leaving the balance between management and unions 
the way it is so that management retains the prerogative in terms of 
recruitment.
<P>
	It seems to me that clause 15, which the member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve had a hand in establishing at committee, 
sets out the necessary collaboration between management and 
labour. However, the problem is that ultimately, because 
management has the prerogative to hire, only management can 
have the responsibility under the scheme of this act.
<P>
	I would be afraid that if we create a scheme where management 
and union are both responsible, then effectively we undermine our 
ability to enforce employment equity through management. We 
cannot simultaneously undermine management and promote a 
scheme that would make labour responsible for management 
activities. It seems to me that this is an integral part of human 
resources management and an important part of the general 
Canadian way of doing business.
<P>
	Only the employer has the final decision on who to hire, 
promote, train, or terminate. The hon. member should be conscious 
of the importance of that within this bill, because it allows us to 
maintain the balance between management and labour. There is no 
disagreement here. We need the unions to participate fully, but we 
cannot upset the balance by forcing them to co-design a program or 
to consider them co-responsible with employers or we are going to 
undermine the system.
<P>
	I would like to remind my colleague that workforces of 
employers are often represented by more than one union. This 
happens frequently, for instance, in Windsor, Ontario, where I am 
from. If all union representatives were expected to co-manage the 
preparation, implementation, and revision of this kind of plan there 
could be a situation of protracted delays in implementation, 
increased costs to employers, and possible deterioration in 
labour-management relations.
<P>

<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	To my good friend from the Reform Party, I would like to point 
out that the cost of this to government would be phenomenal. If 
unions as well as employers were to submit reports and the human 
resources ministry required to make the reports public, there would 
be significant additional costs incurred. Since the human resources 
development ministry is required to make reports public, every 
expansion requires a greater budget for copying and distribution to 
interested parties across the country.
<P>
	It is because of the Canadian people and in their interests that the 
Employment Equity Act is where it is today. It is a viable and 
effective tool for human resources management. I think we should 
let it continue to work the way it is, working co-operatively 
between management and unions. This has been done successfully 
in most employment equity activities for over a decade. Employers 
should continue to strive to get the input of interested parties in this 
valuable process, but let it be part of the collective bargaining 
system rather than something we enforce.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
begin by associating myself most strongly with the cogent and 
competent comments of my colleague. I would continue the 
alliterative strain by naming her, but that of course would be 
unparliamentary, so I would merely congratulate the member for 
Windsor-St. Clair.
<P>
	I want to say that I congratulate as well the member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, because I know he has worked very 
hard on the committee. But I think his amendments in this 
particular vein do not go anywhere to further the spirit of the bill. It 
is furthering the spirit of the bill that the passage is all about. I 
guess I could say we want it to go through spiritus intactus, because 
this is a very important piece of legislation. It is important because 
it is broadly misunderstood in more than one area.
<P>
	I heard earlier today, before leaving the House to go to 
committee, people equate employment equity and affirmative 
action. I want to talk about that first of all, because employment 
equity and affirmative action are not the same thing. Indeed, if I 
could go into employment equity, especially today, when we have 
all been visited by members and representatives of the Canadian 
Medical Association, a medical metaphor might be appropriate. 
When I say that employment equity is preventive, affirmative 
action is curative.
<P>
	I might add that affirmative action is something that is enshrined 
in our Constitution, in our charter of rights and freedoms. 
Employment equity too has a very respectable and respected 
history in the House and indeed in the legislatures of a number of 
the provinces.
<P>
	When I hear employment equity attacked I constantly hear it 
attacked on the basis of a new disadvantaged group. I want to make 
it very clear that I am not speaking now with tongue in cheek. I am 
not being sarcastic. I am, if anything, being plaintive. As I stand 
here in the House of Commons in this fall of 1995, I am a little tired 
of hearing that white males in this society are some sort of 
endangered species. White males still get 60 per cent of the jobs in 
this country. Name the profession, name the job category, name the 
area, and they still do better than anybody else.
<P>
	Just look at the Chamber when it is full. Look at it tonight when 
we have the vote. Who are the overwhelming members of this 
Chamber in all parties? White males, and fond I am of most of you. 
But there is no question that it does not reflect the demographic 
picture of this country.
<P>
	First, if the House were to reflect this country demographically, 
52 per cent of the seats would be taken up by females first and 
foremost. We are slowly but surely getting to that point.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Right on.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I apologize. There appears to be some 
problem with the ventilation system in the Chamber. I am not 
responsible for the noise I assure you.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member has a good point but I would 
ask her if she would please not use the term ``you'' except when 
referring to whomever happens to be in the chair. I am sure the 
noise will diminish.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> I apologize, Mr. Speaker. At any rate I have used 
this phrase in a somewhat humorous vein but I will use it in truth 
here in this Chamber.
<P>
	A number of my colleagues in debates on gender equality, 
employment equity or in whatever particular area you want said to 
me: ``There are women's groups, where are the men's groups?'' I 
say not at all in jest there is a men's group and it is called western 
civilization. That is the men's group.
<P>
	If you go to any legislative assembly in the western world with 
the exception of two of the Scandinavian nations, the majority of 
elected members are white males. This is not to say that white 
males do not do a good job. Sure they do. But it is not the only face 
to be represented. Nor is it the only face to be represented on 
television stations, in radio stations, in fire stations, in whatever 
areas of employment, particularly those that come under the 
purview of the federal government.
<P>
	It was my great pleasure and to my great benefit in the area of 
education that in the last Parliament I was the vice-chair of the 
committee that reviewed the employment equity legislation. I 
listened to a number of well-meaning white males who came 
before the committee and bragged. For example, in one  
organization-I will not name it but it has something to do with 
horses and red coats-in 24 years of an employment equity 
program it had added to the very highest echelons something like 
20 women. Mr. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15199"> 15199 </A></B>
<P>
Speaker, I think you will sympathize with me that I found that 
statistic a little wanting, not to say a little daunting as well.
<P>
	There is not a homogeneous culture in this country. There are 
any number of phrases that can be used to describe the beautiful 
face of Canada. The one that I heard most in my childhood was a 
vertical mosaic. I still like that one. I think it speaks very well to us.
<P>
	We have used the phrase multiculturalism over the years and I 
like that one too. I like the fact, no, I love the fact that in this House 
of Commons today we see represented a variety, a rainbow of 
races, religious backgrounds, creeds and so on. That is the face of 
Canada. Our sorrow, our tragedy and our fault as legislators is that 
the rainbow is not represented the way it should be in the 
employment categories in those various institutions that fall within 
the federal purview.
<P>
	When we dealt with employment equity in that committee in the 
last Parliament the big problem was enforcement and teeth. This 
bill is going to change that. This bill is going to make employment 
equity a reality.
<P>
	I can only say that those people who fear it-and I am prepared 
to explain the difference between affirmative action and 
employment equity if they have a problem-do not really 
understand it. There is nothing to fear in allowing, encouraging and 
promoting the participation in the fullest sense of the word of all 
Canadians. It is our country. It belongs to all of us. Everyone 
should have equality of opportunity.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	I do not for one instant think that anyone on either side of the 
House would be prepared to stand and deny that he or she agrees 
with equality of opportunity. That is something that all of us, no 
matter what our political stripe, agree with.
<P>
	Consequently, if one agrees with that, then you must support this 
legislation. This legislation is not about special rights. It is not 
about saying to people you deserve something better because you 
are different. It is saying: ``You deserve your share of the Canadian 
dream. You deserve equality of opportunity. You deserve to have 
systemic discrimination, unnatural barriers, removed so that with 
your training and your ability no matter what your skin colour, your 
gender, your religious background, your regional background, et 
cetera, you have the same road ahead of you as any other 
Canadian''.
<P>
	As we stand here and go forward in these pre-referendum days, 
Canadians are looking to us as legislators to talk about what this 
country really means. All of us know that what it really means is 
fairness, a  sense of justice and an opportunity even for people who 
do not know what they are talking about to speak.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member is part of the government. I would hope she would stay for 
just a few moments because I want to back up some of what she just 
said.
<P>
	There are some things she could do as a government member 
that ought to be done with regard to a certain problem that has 
developed literally outside the doors of this Chamber. As we all 
know, a construction program is going on outside. Fuller 
Construction has a renovation job. It has subcontracted to another 
contractor who has in turn subcontracted some more to a unit run 
by Ray Wolf. He apparently made the mistake of having a 32-year 
old female engineer named Ms. Raney in charge of the project. The 
intermediate contractor forced Mr. Wolf to quit the job because he 
was using a female engineer.
<P>
	Since the hon. member is part of the government I would hope 
she is listening to this and will do what she can to intervene to make 
certain this injustice is corrected.
<P>
	I realize the interim construction company is headed by someone 
from the Middle East who has a different view of the role of women 
than some of the rest of Canadian society. However, we live under 
Canadian law. These are the Canadian Houses of Parliament his 
company is working on. Surely there could be more ability to 
recognize people on merit rather than to discriminate against them 
because a company chooses to use a female engineer.
<P>
	I do not want to say very much more about this legislation. I am 
just so angry this kind of thing can happen here on the grounds of 
Parliament Hill that I wanted to make sure it was raised after 
someone who has been a firm and loud protector of the equality of 
women as is the member for Halifax who preceded me.
<P>
	I was hoping I could add some fire to her usual ability to get 
things done that would have her take on this case and see if the 
minister of public works cannot correct this great injustice which 
has no place in the Parliament of Canada or in this country.
<P>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Thalheimer (Timmins-Chapleau, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to say at the outset that the Bloc's 
recommendations have resulted in improvements to Bill C-64. My 
hon. colleague from Hochelaga-Maisonneuve contributed to the 
work of the Standing Committee on Human Rights and the Status 
of Disabled Persons. His dedication to employment equity has 
added to the legislation.
<P>
	I have to admit that I was somewhat surprised to see Motion No. 
7 put forward by the opposition. The Bloc Quebecois has already 
raised this issue in committee and  the committee has gone a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15200"> 15200 </A></B>
<P>
considerable way to accommodate it. The hon. member persuaded 
the committee to accept a requirement that employers and labour 
must collaborate in the preparation, implementation and revision of 
the employment equity plan.
<P>
	Let me begin by reminding the House that the existing act only 
calls for consultation between the employer and worker 
representatives. Bill C-64 would go further, ensuring that 
employees, through their unions or employee representatives, will 
have considerably more input to their company's equity plan when 
the plan is developed, implemented and revised. We saw the merit 
of this approach and have endorsed it. However, the proposed 
amendment to the bill goes too far and is not advisable. Allow me 
to explain why.
<P>
	This amendment would preserve the employer's sole 
responsibility to prepare its employment equity plan in 
consultation with employee representatives. However, if adopted 
this motion would import a government imposed requirement for 
co-management rather than collaboration between the employer 
and employee representatives in the implementation and revision 
of employment equity plans.
<P>
	This poses some potentially serious problems since the 
obligations set out in the act are imposed on employers alone. A 
bargaining agent might very well refuse to co-operate, perhaps 
motivated by reasons that have nothing to do with employment 
equity, and could bring the implementation of employment equity 
to a standstill, potentially putting the employer in a situation of 
non-compliance.
<P>
	Furthermore, since employment equity is an integral part of 
human resource management this sort of regime might provide 
unions with an opportunity to exercise direct influence in areas that 
have usually remained the sole prerogative of management, such as 
hiring and promotion.
<P>
	Surely my hon. colleague will recognize that management 
should have the final responsibility for all employer obligations 
under the bill and would be held accountable if those 
responsibilities are not met. It is only reasonable, therefore, that 
final decision making continue to belong to management in this 
area.
<P>
	For the benefit of all employers and worker representatives and 
for the good of workplace relations, I must recommend that the 
House not accept the proposed amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Murray Calder (Wellington-Grey-Dufferin-Simcoe, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to say at the outset that I endorse the 
principle of labour-management consultation and co-operation on 
matters relating to the workplace under federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	We all know that working together brings out the best results for 
all concerned. This is what we are trying to achieve in the wording 
of clause 15 of Bill C-64 as it has been reported back from the 
standing committee.
<P>
	Let me read the introductory portion of what clause 15 currently 
says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Every employer shall consult with its employees' representatives by inviting 
the representatives to provide their views-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Bill C-64 also explicitly recognizes the role of bargaining agents 
in the workplace. I quote further from clause 15:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Where employees are represented by a bargaining agent, the bargaining agent 
shall participate in a consultation under subsection (1).</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The above provisions underline the kind of environment we all 
want to have in the workplace.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	We do not want management to be making arbitrary decisions 
without consulting the interest of employees. We want the 
employees to be fully involved in all matters that involve them, be 
they health and safety issues or employment equity issues.
<P>
	We want to have a policy of inclusion followed, not one of 
exclusion. We believe that everyone in the workplace should have 
the opportunity to put forward their ideas and views. In line with 
the entire spirit of employment equity is the elimination of barriers.
<P>
	The standing committee recognized the value of this type of 
consultation when it reviewed the bill introduced at first reading. 
The testimony they heard from the witnesses at their hearings led 
them to strengthen the provisions. The provisions currently in the 
bill have already been strengthened from what was originally 
proposed. All one has to do is to read further in clause 15:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Every employer and its employees' representatives shall collaborate in the 
preparation, implementation and revision of the employer's employment equity 
plan.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The standing committee added the concept of collaboration. This 
goes beyond the concept of consultation. However the standing 
committee recognized that the concept of collaboration could not 
interfere with employers' obligations under the act.
<P>
	It is for the individual employer who has specific obligations 
under the act that there are provisions for non-compliance when the 
employer meets these obligations. That is why there is a very 
important provision at the end of clause 15:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Consultation under subsection (1) and collaboration under subsection (3) are 
not forms of co-management.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We need to recognize that the responsibility for implementing 
employment equity in the workplace is that of management. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15201"> 15201 </A></B>
<P>
current wording of the bill  provides for this. That is why I have so 
many problems with the wording of Motion No. 7. We have to be 
very careful in considering the implications of the proposed 
amendment.
<P>
	If adopted, the amendment would require the employer and its 
employees' representatives to implement and revise the 
employment equity plan jointly. In a perfect world perhaps this 
would work, but we must recognize that we are still trying to 
achieve a perfect world, as my colleagues from the Reform Party 
tell me on a daily basis. This is one reason there is need for an 
employment equity act and this is one reason the proposed 
amendment goes too far.
<P>
	A number of problems would result if the motion were adopted 
and the act subsequently proclaimed into law. Employers could try 
to evade their responsibilities by saying that progress is being 
stalled by an unco-operative bargaining agent. Presumably there 
would be a call for a compliance officer to intervene, but there are 
no enforceable obligations on bargaining agents in the legislation. 
There would nothing a compliance officer could do in a case where 
there are bad relations between labour and management, perhaps as 
a result or in connection with an industrial dispute.
<P>
	Employment equity is related to the human resources 
management field and to the hiring and promotion processes. 
These are traditionally considered to be areas reserved to 
management. We have to recognize this reality.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	Again I reinforce the purpose of the act as set out in section 2:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The purpose of this act is to achieve equality in the workplace so that no 
person shall be denied employment opportunities or benefits for reasons 
unrelated to ability and, in the fulfilment of that goal, to correct the conditions 
of disadvantage in employment experienced by women, aboriginal peoples, 
persons with disabilities and members of visible minorities by giving effect to 
the principle that employment equity means more than treating persons in the 
same way but also requires special measures and the accommodation of 
differences.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In summary the purpose of the act is to achieve equality in the 
workplace and to correct the conditions and disadvantages 
experienced by certain groups. Bill C-64, as currently worded, 
provides the appropriate balance between employee participation, 
management powers and obligations. That is why we should not 
adopt the motion.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 
38, to inform the House that the question to be raised tonight at the 
time of adjournment is as follows: the hon. member for 
Davenport-nuclear tests.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
should like to speak to Motion No. 7 that is before us.
<P>
	I congratulate the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve who 
has been an excellent member of the committee on human rights 
which I had the privilege of chairing and which looked into bill 
before the House today. The member made a lot of useful 
contributions to the committee. I am glad he affixed his signature 
to the majority report.
<P>
	There are still sentiments the particular member would like to 
continue to advance. I respect his need to see to it that employees' 
representatives be at the management table. Although he indicated 
that the amendment would not result in co-management, I think 
there are grave doubts and concerns about the amendment. That is 
why the majority of committee members saw to it that it would not 
happen.
<P>
	Why was that? It was because one of the underlying principles of 
the bill was a balanced approach to the setting of plans and the 
implementation of the employment equity plan. In that so-called 
balanced approach we must ensure that as we invoke obligations 
for employers we do not provide them with unnecessary' onerous 
and impractical burdens. Were the employees to be given this right 
despite the disclaimer it is very conceivable that it can be construed 
as a co-management approach. Certainly we feel it will add a real 
burden for businesses in particular.
<P>
	In recognition of the contribution of the member for 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve we amended the bill to see to it that 
employers and employees collaborate and consult in the 
preparation of the plan. We would have liked to have seen the 
employees' representatives being in on the co-management 
approach. In the spirit of co-operation at committee level we saw to 
it that employers would provide information to the employees 
about the purpose of the employment equity measures of the bill to 
be undertaken to implement a given employment equity plan.
<P>
	The committee also made the point that the bill would not 
require public availability of employment equity plans which, to be 
effective, would contain confidential and proprietary information 
on the part of businesses. Every member of the House would like to 
see to it that we do not divulge what businesses feel are their 
proprietary properties and therefore necessary to ensure their 
competitive advantage in the business world.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	We feel we must reject the amendment. In effect it would take 
the prerogative of management from employers. It would impose 
an impractical burden on them. Since the act in its totality imposes 
that legal obligation only on employers for failure to set and adopt  
an employment equity plan, it is only fair that this kind of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="15202"> 15202 </A></B>
<P>
responsibility rests solely with employers where the legal 
obligation rests.
<P>
	I can conceive of one possibility, for example. In the process of 
the joint approach to the development of the plan the bargaining 
agent for the employees, for reasons not related to the 
implementation of the equity plan, could stall or delay the 
finalization of the plan for reasons other than related to the 
employment equity plan. It would delay what we would like to 
have happen. On that basis we have to continue to retain the 
prerogative of the act to give the obligation, responsibility and 
privilege to employers.
<P>
	Briefly, again to put into context the motion before us, why it is 
important that we not overburden employers? In the beginning the 
employment equity concept in Canada started as a consequence of 
bias, of prejudice against employers. Those instances happened 
before the sixties and in the sixties the practice was recognized. 
Human rights legislation was enacted to potentially correct the 
biases and discrimination.
<P>
	It proved to be those approaches were not sufficient and so came 
the second phase in the evolution of the concept, that there exists 
systemic barriers in the system, unintended bias one may call it, 
systemic discrimination, but not without malice.
<P>
	To solve the problem of systemic barriers it is important to get 
the full co-operation of employers and the business side. It is 
important that we do not introduce any kind of provision in the act 
that businesses will see as an additional burden.
<P>
	Canada should be proud today that in so far as the employment 
equity legislation is concerned we nearly have unanimous support 
from the business community at large. We should thank that 
community for its confidence in the initiative of the government. 
We should continue to recognize that privilege. If we work on a 
co-operative and collaborative basis, the more we will achieve. 
Canada is unique in that regard. I can sense the hon. member is now 
agreeing to the arguments I am proposing.
<P>
	We welcome the contribution of the member, but I feel we 
should reject the motion for the reasons I have indicated. We need 
the full provisions of the employment equity law in Canada and we 
need to reinforce it very strongly. Now that we have extended the 
coverage and now that we have invoked an enforcement 
mechanism, the world is looking at us as a model. Contrary to an 
earlier amendment from the third party, we have embarked upon a 
new milestone, the further evolution of the concept of employment 
equity.
<P>
	As I said earlier in the debate on another motion, the committee 
in its wisdom respecting employment equity made a commitment 
to merit. I think even Mr. Speaker is smiling at the beauty of this 
report.
<P>
	I ask members to reject this motion.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NUCLEARTESTS">NUCLEAR TESTS</A></H4>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
September I asked the Minister of Foreign Affairs whether in light 
of the French government's decision to resume nuclear tests he 
would call for a boycott of products made in France. The minister 
replied that although deploring France's decision to test it is more 
important that next year France sign the comprehensive nuclear 
test ban treaty.
<P>
<B>(1730 )</B>
<P>
	Last May in Geneva, 25 years after the nuclear non-proliferation 
treaty was signed, 178 nations voted to extend it and make it 
forever illegal for any member country beyond the original five 
nuclear powers to develop nuclear weapons. In return, nuclear 
powers would sign a permanent test ban treaty next year, a first  
<P>

<B><A NAME="15205"> 15205 </A></B>
<P>
step in dismantling their nuclear arsenals as required under the 
non-proliferation treaty.
<P>
	While negotiations for a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty 
are under way, France has embarked on a course of action that 
threatens to destabilize this important treaty process. When these 
actions are combined with a reopened debate in the United States 
on whether nuclear tests below 500 pounds of explosives should be 
allowed under the proposed treaty, you can see why non-nuclear 
nations are wondering whether nuclear powers are truly committed 
to a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty and the eventual 
elimination of their nuclear arsenals.
<P>
	The government of President Chirac argues that the principal 
reason the present tests are necessary is to provide data for 
developing nuclear test simulation software. I repeat: nuclear test 
simulation software. By contrast, in 1991 President François 
Mitterrand ordered that nuclear test simulation software be 
developed without further tests. In addition, the American and 
British governments have already developed nuclear test 
simulation capabilities. The fact that the technology for nuclear test 
simulation already exists renders current tests by France 
unnecessary.
<P>
	As we talk in this chamber, the O.J. Simpson trial and other 
recent murder trials command more attention than the actions taken 
by the French government, which threaten the comprehensive test 
ban treaty process and the South Pacific environment. Such actions 
should not just be deplored, they ought to be forcefully criticized, 
as the Australian and Japanese governments have done.
<P>
	The Minister of Foreign Affairs ought to call in the ambassador 
for France and ask that the French government stop all further tests. 
If this is unsuccessful, Canadians can register their disapproval by 
simply boycotting products made in France, from wines to 
perfumes, from cheese to fashion, from cars to tourism.
<P>
	In Sweden the voluntary actions of citizens have resulted, I am 
told, in an 80 per cent reduction in the sale of French wines. 
Canadians as consumers can express their disapproval too. It is the 
only weapon we have as citizens to convey our sentiments about a 
primitive use of power or about an action that is best described as 
the pornography of power.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Davenport for reminding the public of the importance of this 
subject.
<P>
	With respect to French nuclear testing, the Government of 
Canada has expressed its view on the matter in a clear and 
unambiguous manner. We deplore the resumption of these tests and 
have made our position known to France in no uncertain terms. 
When China resumed its tests earlier this year, we also expressed 
our views on that matter.
<P>
	Our position is clear. We call on all nuclear weapons states to 
stop these tests. We call for a speedy progress toward the signature 
of a comprehensive test ban treaty, the CTBT, which is the best way 
to ensure the end of all tests for all time.
<P>
	Canada's position with respect to nuclear testing is not a recent 
one. This is a bedrock policy that we have had since the days of 
former Prime Minister Trudeau when he set out the strategy calling 
for the suffocation of nuclear arsenals. The hon. member was here 
at the time and helped to develop this policy.
<P>
	We are one of the few countries in the world that has the 
capability yet has decided as a matter of policy not to develop 
nuclear weapons. We have also chosen not to have any nuclear 
armed weapons stationed on our soil.
<P>
	Having succeeded in getting the non-proliferation treaty 
extended for an indefinite period we are now working very hard to 
ensure a truly comprehensive verifiable nuclear weapon test ban, 
the CTBT, is signed by June 1996.
<P>
	We are very heartened to learn that so far three of the five 
nuclear weapons states, the U.S., the U.K. and France, have come 
out supporting a zero option CTBT, which the hon. member will be 
pleased to hear. This means a treaty which will allow no nuclear 
explosions whatsoever.
<P>
	Again I congratulate the hon. member for helping Canada 
develop our policy in banning all nuclear weapons from this planet.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The House stands adjourned until 
tomorrow at 2 p.m.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 5.35 p.m.)
