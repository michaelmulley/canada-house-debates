summer of 1896 three men, Skookum Jim, George Carmack and Tagish 
Charlie, found large gold nuggets in the gravel bottom of Bonanza 
Creek.  Their cry of joy started the world's greatest gold rush. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Approximately 200,000 men and women from all over the world 
converged on the Klondike in search of gold.  More than 40,000 
of them found it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1898 Dawson City was the largest Canadian city west of 
Winnipeg and Yukon, for so long the proud home of first nations 
people, was created from the western area of the Northwest 
Territories.  On June 13, 1898, assent was given to the Yukon Act 
and four years later in 1902 we sent our first member to 
parliament, James H. Ross, a Liberal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand to commemorate the 103rd anniversary of the founding of 
Yukon Territory.  I invite all members and their families to come 
north this summer to see, as is described in the tourism brochure

strong and free.

have confidence in the abilities of our skilled airline pilots to 
take their precious cargo of passengers to Canada and to the

</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly Canada's transportation operation hours are some of the 
most liberal throughout the world.  Our standards are low.  This 
not only affects pilots.  It also affects train engineers, truck 
and bus drivers.  Public safety is at risk in the air and on the 
ground, the consequence of operators perhaps making a fatigue 
mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to take immediate action to improve our operational 
standards as a safeguard.  The Liberal government must do what is 
needed to address this urgent problem.  May it also not be found 
snoozing on the job.

I was delighted to attend this past weekend the ninth annual

event brings together people of all ages for a day of games,

to our community.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Stoney Creek, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
delay of the Red Hill Creek expressway project is an ongoing 
concern for me as the federal representative for Stoney Creek. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The project has been subjected to rigorous scrutiny and numerous 
assessments over the last 35 years, yet remains at an impasse 
currently due to the federal government's decision to appeal a 
lower court ruling.  This recent ruling confirmed that the Red 
Hill Creek project was a unique situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was started and irrevocable decisions had been taken prior to 
the CEAA taking effect.  I was disappointed by the government's 
decision to appeal, as it was my belief that the ruling was 
focused on the Red Hill project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, given that Bill C-19 will be back before the House in 
the fall, and taking into consideration the desire of both the 
federal government and the city of Hamilton to expedite the 
process, I will be proposing an amendment limiting the 
application of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act and 
specifically exempting the Red Hill Creek expressway project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask all colleagues, and specifically my local colleagues, to 
support this amendment when it comes before the House and to 
ensure that this necessary project be completed without further 
delay.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Lunney (Nanaimo—Alberni, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to pay tribute to some fine 
Canadians today.  The story involves the struggle of a young man 
from Victoria named Andy Horn.  Andy suffered much of his life 
battling cystic fibrosis.  He needed a new pair of lungs and it 
became necessary for him to relocate to Toronto to improve his 
chances of finding a donor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Victoria community really took Andy's case to heart.  To 
help with expenses, community and professional organizations 
including several Lions Clubs and hundreds of caring Canadians 
donated thousands of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Andy made the difficult move to Toronto with his mother and 
fiancée, his uncle called on his Canadian navy family for 
assistance.  Bob Dalgleish was quick to answer the call, going 
above and beyond the call of duty in hosting Andy and his family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am saddened to report that although Andy survived the surgery, 
he succumbed to related infections on June 2.  Nonetheless the 
surgery and the hope it offered were made possible by the 
generosity of many.  In this Year of the Volunteer we extend 
special thanks to Bob Dalgleish and the many citizens of Victoria 
for showing that they care.

June 28, 2000, the Governor General of Canada announced the 
creation of the well deserved Canadian Peacekeeping Service Medal 
for members of the armed forces, RCMP and local police who have 
served abroad as United Nations peacekeepers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Almost 125,000 Canadians have served in peacekeeping missions 
over the past 53 years, a record unsurpassed by any other nation. 
I personally wish to congratulate the more than 130 Prince Edward

Canadians who have been honoured for their past service at 
ceremonies across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, our valiant efforts to inspire peace around the world has 
not been without loss.  The red stripping in the medal's ribbon

I rise today to discuss the serious shortcomings of the Liberal 
government in the clean-up of contaminated sites. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More information has come forward indicating that the federal 
government has known of serious health threats to the people of 
Sydney, Nova Scotia and yet the only action taken was dumping 
millions of dollars into short term solutions.  Sydney is only 
one glaring example of thousands of known and unknown 
contaminated sites across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is also currently faced with the clean-up of the 
Giant Gold Mine near Yellowknife.  It is again leaning toward the 
cheapest, short term solution that will almost certainly cost 
Canadians their health, the health of their environment and the 
health of communities over the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government cannot boast about Canada's environmental 
superiority until it cleans up its act and takes responsibility 
for its own actions.  Canada's own house must be put in order and 
critical contaminated sites across the country must be cleaned up 
now.

are few cases of the right to self-determination that are more

few peoples whose right to self-determination has been more 
persistently and pervasively repressed, yet whose tragedy remains 
engulfed in a deafening silence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Kurdish political prisoner and Nobel prize nominee, Layla Zana,

</I></B></P><P align=left>Elected to the Turkish parliament in 1991 as the only Kurdish 
woman ever to serve in the Turkish parliament with over 80% of 
the vote of her Turkish constituents, she was arrested, 
prosecuted, convicted and sentenced in 1994 to 15 years in prison 
for nothing other than simply expressing support for the idea of 
self-determination.  This criminalization of freedom of 
expression and association invites universal condemnation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Turkish government should undertake all necessary measures 
to secure the release of all prisoners held for the expression of 
non-violent opinion, including Layla Zana and three other

still had fully dealt with what was a single bill in the last

there is nothing secret about the government's review of our

related to the HRDC scandal, the mishandling of the helicopter

the auditor general's question, “Who is minding the store?”. 
Whatever it is, the commissioner has named a list of departments. 
He has an actual list of departments that he says are seriously 
impeding the public's right to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will somebody in the government stand and take responsibility

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the information commissioner has been pretty specific when he 
talks about secrecy in the government.  He talks about secrecy in

Prime Minister, quite frankly, is the leader when it comes to 
secrecy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have asked for his bill of sale on the golf course to be

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister has been very open.  He tabled a copy 
of the document in the House.  He stood in this place and said 
that the copy was a copy of the real document, and did so even 
though this related to a time when he was not Prime Minister and 
related to a private business transaction, not to his work or 
responsibility as Prime Minister.  That is openness, true 
openness. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We wrote to the ethics counsellor, since the ethics counsellor 
said that he had seen the document, asking him to verify the date

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

on this opinion about this document, I presume it will next be 
turning to other issues of importance to it, like whether the

the Bermuda Triangle is located.

</I></B></P><P align=left>John Reid is even concerned that the government will take

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is plain for all to see that the Americans are intent on

but it has not said what exactly that will be. It has put several 
options on the table.  It has not determined which option or 
options it will actually deploy.  It has said it would consult 
very meaningfully with Canada and with all of the different 
allies, plus Russia and China, and it is in the midst of doing 
that.  We are nowhere near a decision on this matter because the 
United States is nowhere near a decision on this matter.

Mr. Speaker, economists are expressing growing concern that 
federal spending is running out of control at levels unseen since 
the current Prime Minister drove Canada into debt in the late

a new $4 billion mega project.

in 1961 the average family paid $1,675 in taxes from an income of

in taxes.  That is 47.5% of their entire income.  That is more

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that throughout this whole session virtually every

There is only one of two things that will happen:  Either we will

“The matter is well in hand and not indicative of a systemic

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
During question period I may have unintentionally implied that 
the corporations director of Industry Canada was reviewing the 
original bill of sale referred to by the Alliance member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take this opportunity to lay to rest that was not the 
case.  As members are aware, the Canada Corporations Act is 
administered by the Corporations Directorate.  I want to put on 
record that it reviewed the company's records earlier this year 
in response to a letter by the ethics counsellor.  Once the 
review was completed it replied to the letter.  It is my 
understanding that the company agreed to fully comply with the 
request of the act.

<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, 
Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-11, an act respecting immigration to 
Canada and the granting of refugee protection to persons who are 
displaced, persecuted or in danger, be read the third time and 
passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said:  Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I stand 
before the House today to introduce third reading of Bill C-11, 
the immigration and refugee protection act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all worked hard and fruitfully to bring the bill to this 
stage.  As members know, Bill C-11 is the product of extensive 
consultation and dialogue.  For the past four years we have 
spoken and exchanged views with the provinces, the territories, 
non-governmental groups, the legal profession, law enforcement 
agencies and interested Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before we crafted the bill we consulted with committee, not once 
but twice, and have made many adjustments along the way.  A 
number of ideas and clarifications suggested by the standing 
committee have been incorporated into the bill and I thank the 
members of the standing committee for their efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The extensive period of consultation to clarify the policy 
intent of Bill C-11 has improved the bill and has provided us 
with new legislation for which we can all be proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My goal as Minister of Citizenship and Immigration is and has 
always been to ensure we have legislation for the new millennium 
that will give us the tools we need to curb abuse while 
encouraging increased immigration to Canada.  We want faster but 
fair decisions for refugee claimants.  The bill would help us 
achieve these objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 would give Canadians the balanced approach they asked 
for.  It would ensure openness to those who would contribute to 
Canada and our collective future and ensure tough penalties for 
those who would abuse our generosity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be clear.  The bill would not be tough on the 
immigrants and refugees who built this country in the past or who 
would help us build it in the future.  However, it would be tough 
on criminals, terrorists and those who are threats to our 
security in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I assure all members of the House and all Canadians that 
everyone will receive due process, fair treatment and the 
protection of our charter of rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have told us clearly that it takes too long for us to 
do many of the things we do.  They have told us that it takes too 
long to remove those who are not welcome in Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would give us a clear, responsible and balanced new law 
that would help us continue to build the country.  In particular, 
it would allow us to say no faster so we could say yes more often 
to the immigrants and refugees Canada will need to continue to 
grow and prosper in the years ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again remind and assure the House and all Canadians that even 
as we say no faster to those who are not welcome in Canada, we 
would ensure there is full respect for due process and for the 
laws of Canada of which we are so proud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned before, this is framework legislation.  It would 
enshrine rights, key policies and key principles.  It would 
provide our immigration program with the flexibility needed to 
manage in an increasingly complex and continually changing 
environment.  It would enshrine our agreements with the provinces 
which recognize immigration as an area of shared jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our shared work on the bill has extended to proposals for the 
regulations that would support it.  Work on the regulations is 
already underway and, as committee members know, the results are 
posted and updated on a regular basis on our website. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want everyone to know the website address in case interested 
Canadians would like to visit it and get the most up to date 
information.  Visitors to www.cic.gc.ca can receive all the 
information about the legislation and other programs and policies 
of the Department of Citizenship and Immigration.  Information 
can be viewed on the website by members of parliament, 
non-governmental groups, the legal profession and anyone who has 
an interest in the evolving proposals for the regulations 
concerning immigration and refugee determination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think members will agree that the process is, has been and 
will continue to be a transparent one.  Following a suggestion 
made at the standing committee, proposed regulations would be 
tabled in both Houses of parliament as part of the normal 
pre-consultation phase before they are finalized.  This would 
underline the transparency of the process and ensure 
parliamentarians an important role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The regulations would include a strengthened program for 
overseas refugee resettlement, an expanded family class and new 
selection criteria to attract more skilled and adaptable 
independent immigrants.  They would also include an in-Canada 
landing class for temporary workers, foreign students and spouses 
who are already established in Canada and wish to stay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to state clearly for the record that the great 
majority of immigrants and refugees who come to Canada come here 
legally.  They respect our laws and we welcome them.  At the 
front door there is a big welcome mat as we say to those who come 
to Canada “Respect our laws.  You are welcome.  We need you.  We 
want you here and we welcome you”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They come here to make a contribution.  They make an important 
contribution to our society, our economy and our communities. 
Refugees and immigrants built this country and will continue to 
do so in the years ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want a new Immigration and Refugee Protection Act that 
respects our laws and traditions and, above all, continues our 
tradition of welcoming newcomers.  We must continue the 
humanitarian traditions of openness and compassion that have made 
this country so proud.  Bill C-11 and its accompanying 
regulations would do just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many who participated in the development of the bill deserve 
recognition and acknowledgement at this time. 
I acknowledge the important contribution of my parliamentary 
secretary, the member for Gatineau.  I thank him for his support 
and hard work in bringing the bill to this stage. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1525"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also acknowledge the important work of all members of the 
standing committee, particularly the members of the Liberal 
caucus who engaged in consultations in the very early 
developmental stages.  All members of the House were welcome to 
participate and did so at the standing committee with the kind of 
thoughtfulness that is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also thank members of the opposition.  I know the member 
opposite is surprised to hear that because he was a little 
concerned that I was too partisan in my remarks.  I thank the 
members of the opposition parties who asked very thoughtful 
questions.  Even though I was surprised by some of the positions 
they took, I believe the hard work of all members of the House 
helped produce a bill which should be supported by all members of 
committee and of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am aware that what happened at the very end of the committee 
process was quite collegial.  I was surprised to hear that the 
bill might not be supported by everyone in the House who 
participated because it deserves their support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also acknowledge the officials in my department, led very ably 
by the assistant deputy minister of policy, Joan Atkinson.  I 
think anyone who participated at the standing committee or who 
reads <I>Hansard</I> will agree with me that she gave clear and 
detailed explanations of very complex and often difficult policy 
implications and objectives.  She answered all questions from all 
members thoughtfully and articulately and has put on the record 
for future consideration the bill's policy intent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope all members of the House will agree with me that 
Assistant Deputy Minister Joan Atkinson did an outstanding job of 
not only defending the bill but ensuring that all members of the 
standing committee understood the policy intent and implications 
of the legislation.  I also thank all presenters who came before 
the standing committee and all who sent in detailed briefs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also acknowledge the many individuals and groups who met with 
me personally.  All that consultation, input and advice has 
resulted in an excellent piece of legislation that will stand the 
test of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many individuals check our website regularly.  Many do not. 
Those who have an interest in citizenship and immigration and in 
the important work we do should know they are always welcome to 
contact members of parliament on both sides of the House.  They 
can contact the department or the website, and the questions they 
have will be answered as quickly as possible.  We want to ensure 
that people know and understand why we have the policies we have, 
what their intent is and how we go about implementing them in a 
way which is consistent with our Canadian values and in a way 
which has become a model for the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I visit our visa posts around the world and meet with 
officials from countries with which we have bilateral relations, 
they all ask me about our open and transparent approach to 
immigration in Canada.  They are interested in our new point 
system.  They are interested in the fact that everything is on 
the Internet and that people are encouraged and welcome to apply. 
They are envious of our record of independent adjudication at the 
Immigration and Refugee Board.  They are interested in the fact 
that we have an arm's length IRB with three divisions, one of 
which sorts out refugee claimants. 
We know that even though Canada has a different approach than 
other countries, at the end of the day many countries in the 
western world ultimately have the same approval rates that Canada 
has.  There are different mechanisms and ways of getting there 
but we know, and I know this because I have met bilaterally with 
world leaders, that at the end of the day following due process, 
the difference for Canada is we make those decisions sooner in a 
transparent and arm's length way.  We give people access to 
judicial review.  We make sure that all risk conditions are 
considered.  We give them landed status and encourage those who 
are in genuine need of protection to get on with their lives in 
Canada as quickly as possible, to integrate in our society and 
feel welcomed.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that there are some people who come to us who are not in 
genuine need of protection.  The challenge for the IRB is to make 
those decisions and then tell those people who are not at risk of 
leaving Canada, who are inadmissible to Canada or who are not in 
genuine need of our protection that they must leave Canada.  That 
is always difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can understand why people want to come to Canada.  We are 
proud of the fact that for the seventh year in a row the United 
Nations has declared Canada as the best country in the world in 
to live.  One important parts of our immigration program is 
family reunification and our commitment to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill, as I said in my remarks before committee, strengthens 
our commitment to family reunification, both for immigrants and 
for refugees.  By leaving the application open for a year, we 
will encourage refugees' families to reunite more quickly.  By 
having an in-Canada landing class for spouses, we will encourage 
husbands, wives and partners to be together and have status in 
Canada as quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know there are many challenges that face us but, after almost 
two years as Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, I want to 
state clearly to the House the confidence that I have in my 
officials around the world at the visa posts.  They do their very 
best to make good decisions, to make decisions that are important 
for Canada because it is about nation building.  They are the 
ones who interview the applicants.  Those immigration officers on 
the frontline are the ones who make a decision as to whether an 
interview is needed at all.  They do this in the face of 
significant challenges.  We know that they often see documents 
that are not real.  We know that since the photocopier was 
developed we are seeing an increase in fraudulent documents. 
That poses a great challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why in this legislation we have made an inadmissibility 
category, that if persons present fraudulent documents to Canada 
they will be inadmissible to Canada for a period of two years. 
That is supposed to be a deterrent because we want people to 
respect our laws.  We want people to come to Canada, obey our 
laws, do it the right way and come through the front door where 
there is a big welcome mat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the door that we want to close is the back door to 
serious criminals, to terrorists, to those who pose a risk to 
Canada, to failed refugee claimants and to those who are not in 
genuine need of our protection.  At that back door there is a 
deportation order waiting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has one of the best records of removals of any country in 
the world.  Last year over 8,600 people were removed from this 
country.   Of those removals one-third, over 1,700, were those 
who were criminally inadmissible to this country.  However the 
other two-thirds were failed refugee claimants, people who had 
overstayed visitor's visas and those who had no status in Canada, 
no right to remain in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for us to know that if we are going to open that 
front door wider, to reunite families, to welcome the refugees, 
to encourage applications from around the world, to bring the 
immigrants here that we will need to continue to grow and 
prosper, we must give Canadians the confidence that we are able 
to say we want our laws respected.  We will treat them fairly but 
we want them to obey our laws.  We want them to come in the front 
door, not to try to sneak in the back door.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As difficult as it is for us to tell people that it is time to 
leave Canada, we know it is an important part of the integrity of 
the immigration program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My department has two mandates that are reflected in the bill. 
That is why I say the bill is balanced.  The priority for my 
department is to bring in the people Canada needs, to reunite 
families and to welcome those refugees who are in genuine need of 
our protection.  However, my department also has an enforcement 
mandate to ensure that our laws have integrity and that those 
people who have no right to remain in Canada are stopped from 
coming.  That is called interdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a network of immigration control officers around the 
world who do their very best in often difficult circumstances and 
with people who are not often telling them the truth when they 
try to come to Canada surreptitiously.  Our immigration control 
officers, we call them ICOs, are the frontline to try to prevent 
access to Canada by those who have no right to come here. 
However, because we have the largest undefended border in the 
world and are dealing with human judgments, we know that people 
are sometimes able to come into Canada.  Then it is important 
that the enforcement side of the department does its job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I say Bill C-11 is balanced, that is what I mean.  It is 
balanced with a tilt to welcoming and encouraging those people to 
who we will need in the future to come to Canada.  We are a small 
country with just a 30 million population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know about the dependency ratio.  By the year 2010 there will 
be five people working for every one person retired.  By the year 
2020 there will be only three people working for every one person 
retired.  That poses a great challenge for the government and for 
all of Canada.  Why?  Because we are not having enough babies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I jokingly can say I have done my part.  I have four children 
and six grandchildren.  I look around the House of Commons and I 
do not think I can count on everyone here to go out and start 
producing the people we will need, although I can hear some 
members opposite say they have done their part as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that we need people in every region of the 
country.  We need people in the urban and rural best kept secrets 
of Canada, the small and medium sized cities.  We have to tell 
the world of the wonderful communities ready to welcome 
immigrants and refugees because they want them to succeed and buy 
homes.  They want them to succeed and pay taxes that will support 
our public education and health systems.  We need them to bring 
their families because it is families that build communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some who would suggest that the family class does not 
contribute, but I would say they are wrong.  The family class, 
the parents, grandparents and dependent children who come 
together to create families and communities and contribute today 
but also in the future to the building of the country, is the 
reason why family reunification is such an important cornerstone 
of our immigration policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I conclude my remarks on Bill C-11, I want to assure the 
House that it is an extremely important piece of legislation 
because it sets the framework for the immigration program for the 
new millennium.  We know the world has changed since the last 
piece of immigration legislation was adopted by parliament almost 
25 years ago.  We know we are in a different world.  We know 
there are all kinds of communications, not only the kind of 
communication available through the Internet, telephones and fax 
machines, but the kind of communication that is available by 
getting on an airplane and travelling around the world.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I visited Pier 21 in Halifax.  I know it has special meaning for 
Madam Speaker and for the over 40 members of the House who came 
to Canada as immigrants, often as children, and many of whom 
arrived at Pier 21.  That historical museum, that monument to the 
immigration, tells us the story of how this country has changed. 
It has changed in many ways because of the contribution of those 
people who came to Pier 21, but it has also changed because of 
our environment, a global world where people are on the move. 
That is the challenge for all of us in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 responds to that challenge.  It is a thoughtful, 
reasoned approached, a bill that balances the duel mandate of my 
department.  That bill is worthy and deserving of support of all 
members of the House.  It is my hope that I will be pleasantly 
surprised and that we will see support from the opposition 
parties who were instrumental when assisting at committee, but 
then walked out the door and started to advocate for greater 
rights and longer processing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing this piece of legislation does is attempts to 
streamline so we can make decisions more quickly when it comes to 
refugee determination and faster but fairer processing for 
refugee applications.  We also want to be able to remove people 
more quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some amendments from the opposition party which would have made 
it more difficult to remove those people who posed a risk to 
Canada or those people who had committed heinous and serious 
crimes disturbed me.  We have a tradition in this country that 
only Canadian citizens have the right to remain in Canada.  Even 
Canadian citizens can be extradited if they commit a serious 
crime in another country and that country succeeds in making an 
extradition application.  That is done through the Department of 
Justice.  Everyone is assured due process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those people who are not Canadian citizens, who come to Canada, 
commit a serious crime, who pose a threat to the safety and 
security of our country should, in my view, be removed as quickly 
as possible.  I was disappointed that that view was not shared by 
members of the opposition party.  That surprised me.  I think if 
their constituents knew that, they would insist that they support 
the government's goal of trying to remove those who have 
committed serious crimes and who are a threat to Canadian society 
as quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vote we will have this afternoon will be for third reading 
of Bill C-11.  I appreciate the opportunity to participate.  As 
minister, I have seen first reading, second reading, full debate 
at committee and all consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to acknowledge and thank my predecessor for the 
important work she did in conducting the consultations that led 
to the development of the bill.  It was the foundation of those 
important consultations over a period of four years which led to 
the development of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my hope that when we have the vote this afternoon, Bill 
C-11, which is so worthy and deserving of support, will receive 
unanimous support by all members of the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would replace the 25 year old Immigration Act of 1976. 
There are some much needed changes in the bill but unfortunately 
it has a series of serious flaws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Immigration to Canada should be simple.  Either one meets the 
criteria to enter Canada or one does not.  The legislation should 
be clear, transparent, comprehensive, precise, democratic, 
accountable, efficient, effective, enforceable, easy to interpret 
and helpful to legitimate immigrants, while maintaining the 
integrity and security of Canada and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make it very clear that the Canadian Alliance will pursue 
a policy of open and transparent immigration.  The nation is 
strong because at one time either ourselves, our ancestors, our 
parents or grandparents all immigrated here.  Even many of our 
aboriginal peoples, anthropologists tell us, at one time found 
their way across the Bering Sea to what we now know as North 
America.  We all immigrated here at some time.  The strength of 
our nation will continue with a good and sound immigration 
policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation may be well intended but the outcome may 
unfortunately not serve its stated purpose.  Lack of clarity, 
prudence and real enforcement behind the legislation may 
ultimately cause more troubles than the legislation that it 
purports to replace.  There is far too much reliance to interpret 
89 pages of regulations that are in the legislation.  Much of 
what is in the regulations should in fact be in the legislation 
itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regulations really give the minister the option of running the 
department any way he or she sees fit.  That is not 
accountability in government, but the present government is not 
known for its accountability.  The Liberal government has a habit 
of governing by regulation and not by legislation.  Regulations 
cannot be debated in the House of Commons and so in a way it is 
governing through the back door.  It not only makes legislation 
undemocratic but makes it complex, opaque and difficult to 
understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance attempted to have amendments passed that 
would have made the legislation effective and workable but the 
Liberals refused to co-operate.  Most of the amendments presented 
at the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration by the 
Canadian Alliance member were rejected by the Liberal dominated 
committee.  There was no true freedom for members on the 
government's side to vote and support common sense amendments to 
the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a history of the government not accepting most of the 
opposition's amendments to any bill.  A government should be open 
to amendments that make sense.  It does not weaken the government 
in the eyes of the public.  It strengthens it when the government 
shows that openness.  We on this side are open to pointing out 
times when the government does that which is good. We point that 
out and we give it credit.  We think correspondingly it should 
respond to amendments from the opposition that make sense and 
would improve the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many examples where the government did not seem 
capable, certainly not willing, to do this.  For example, in Bill 
C-7, the youth criminal justice act, the Liberals refused to 
accept amendments from the opposition and eventually passed yet 
another ineffective piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that on Bill C-15 the government refused to accept 
an opposition suggestion to split provisions that would protect 
children from Internet predators, which we all support.  It would 
have split the bill into other pieces of legislation which we 
were willing to debate separately, but the government was not. 
The official opposition had a number of suggestions for 
improvement that we wish the government had incorporated into the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a general principle we have suggested that the minister 
should establish an ombudsman to receive complaints from 
Canadians on all matters pertaining to immigration.  The 
ombudsman would report annually to the House of Commons.  We feel 
that was a valid proposal, one that would not hurt the government 
but strengthen it.  It seems to have fallen on deaf ears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ministers should consult with municipalities.  Wherever I go 
across the country, and as members of the Canadian Alliance visit 
with mayors and municipalities, we see the need for a 
consultation process with the federal government with respect to 
resettlement for immigrants and integration programs where 
applicable.  The municipalities have to bear not only the 
responsibility but the cost of this, and there needs to be 
consultation with the federal government.  A Canadian Alliance 
government would do that.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should encourage open and accountable discussions 
between a variety of agencies, as well as the provinces and 
non-government immigration organizations.  In this bill the 
government has missed the opportunity to truly strengthen and 
have a vibrant immigration policy.  Our party would work with the 
provinces for policies on the settlement of immigrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance supports the current immigration levels 
but we would like to see immigrants in the jobs that they were 
trained to do.  We would like Canada to attract the best and the 
brightest from around the world, not just those who wish to come 
here so we can fulfil a quota but those whose skills correspond 
to the needs of our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Physicians and nurses are not on the list of occupational needs 
required by Canada despite acute shortages in those professions. 
This is an obvious deficiency in the bill.  Even if a doctor or a 
nurse were to immigrate to Canada, he or she might not be allowed 
to work in his or her field of endeavour for up to two years or 
until the minister granted a work permit.  Whether they are 
doctors or nurses, qualified immigrants should be able to find 
work in an expedient way in the occupations in which they were 
trained.  They should not have to work below the level of their 
qualification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to families, we support the expedient 
reunification of family members.  The bill purports to help 
family reunification, but without the proper enforcement and the 
staff to handle the changes proposed in the bill, the line-ups of 
people waiting in the system may be even longer.  The system may 
become further clogged, which is not the way to reunite families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order for people to have their spouses or fiancés immigrate 
to Canada, they must be financially responsible for them for up 
to five years.  That means the spouse or the fiancé is not 
allowed to work in Canada until his or her application is 
processed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A real case in point is when a Canadian marries an American. 
They both work in the high tech industry and they wish to return 
to Canada.  The American spouse can be sponsored but will not be 
allowed to work even though the need and the demand is here.  He 
or she can apply for independent status but will not be able to 
work for up to a year while the application is being processed. 
These kinds of discriminatory provisions should be removed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might add that the discriminatory right of landing fee, also 
called the head tax, is not a signal to families that we want to 
see them reunited.  The costs are shamefully high, especially to 
low income families wanting to reunite their families.  That is 
inappropriate and we are opposed to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 is also a direct attack in some ways on legitimate 
refugees.  We support and reaffirm our policy of taking in our 
share of genuine refugees.  However paragraph 3(2)(d) states that 
Canada is: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—to offer safe haven to persons with a well-founded fear of 
persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political 
opinion or membership in a particular social group, as well as 
those at risk of torture or cruel and unusual treatment or 
punishment; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This translates into meaning that every criminal or otherwise 
undesirable entering Canada who claims to be a refugee would be 
under Canadian protection from extradition to another country if 
there was reason to believe they would be under threat of any 
harm.  The list of undesirables includes international 
terrorists, murderers, members of organized crime, sex offenders 
and child abusers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key changes include referring refugees to the Immigration 
and Refugee Board within three working days.  What is key here is 
the processing time of a claim would still remain at 90 days. 
There is no improvement whatsoever and that is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unnecessary appeal processes need to be curtailed.  The 
onion layer effect of appeals actually causes more problems than 
it attempts to solve.  The definition of a refugee needs to be 
clearly defined.  Most Canadians know what a true refugee is.  We 
support doing our part to help those who are truly in need, but 
keeping them clogged in the system is not helping them, 
especially when they are found not to be genuine refugees and are 
deported.  Their lives are ruined after so many months and years 
in the system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would also give refugees, as well as refugee 
applicants, full charter protection.  If for any reason someone 
is either denied access to Canada or refused refugee status, that 
person would be entitled to an appeal.  It also means refugees 
would be given full rights as if they were citizens of Canada, 
appealing possibly all the way up to the supreme court.  No other 
country in the world does this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been reported recently that some 15,000 individuals 
facing deportation warrants are missing and Canadian authorities 
have no idea where they are. The government's record for tracking 
landed immigrants is abysmal.  We do not keep exit reports on 
those who depart and this is something that needs to be 
addressed.  There are 89 pages of regulations and the government 
does not have the ability to keep track of exit reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance, along with most Canadians, supports the 
deportation of undesirable individuals without question or delay 
in cases of criminal activity or non-compliance with the 
Immigration Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 would completely strip the minister of his or her 
right to deport those who have either broken the law or have come 
to Canada to escape the law.  The Supreme Court of Canada ruling 
in Minister of Justice v Burns and Rafay, which came down on 
February 15, applies to those individuals who face the threat to 
their person if deported from Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the ruling, all convicted or charged criminals can 
now seek asylum in Canada and the minister has no visible 
authority to deport them.  There is nothing in the legislation to 
address this supreme court ruling.  This is a grave deficiency 
and the minister will not address it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would allow for so-called front-end security screening 
but it would only apply to refugees, which in some cases is a 
physical impossibility.  Front-end screening would not apply to 
applicants in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill promises to deliver better enforcement of security 
measures for both refugee and immigrant applications but there is 
no plan of action set out in the bill to explain how this would 
work.  It appears that it would be at the whim of those who 
administer the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one should be allowed to enter Canada without proper security 
checks as to his or her risk to the country.  All persons 
entering Canada should be subject to a security check at all 
ports of entry.  All persons entering and leaving Canada should 
be recorded as deemed to have entered or left Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shortage of staff and inadequate training create a security 
risk.  This was evidenced by Mr. Lai Changxing, the accused 
kingpin smuggler who landed in Canada through queue jumping, who 
was not detected by the visa officer by even a simple background 
check.  This is just not acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In relation to human smugglers, the government should send a 
strong message to these individuals who exploit and prey on 
vulnerable people.  Our actions should be stronger than words. We 
need tougher laws and the will to implement them by levying 
longer jail sentences and higher fines.  All vehicles, be they 
ships, aircraft or automobiles, used in the illegal 
transportation of human cargo should be immediately seized and 
impounded for at least one year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no penalty for knowingly submitting a false application 
for immigration to Canada.  Individuals may submit as many 
fraudulent applications as they like.  A mechanism needs to be 
put in place that would prevent repeat fraudulent application 
submissions. The bill contains no deterrent from repetitious and 
fraudulent applications.  This will continue to cause endless 
paperwork for visa officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11, regardless of its intentions, does not deliver what 
it is promising without better enforcement, accountability and 
management.  There is no action plan in the legislation to 
achieve these results.  The good points in the bill are 
unfortunately outweighed by its flaws, flaws which we in the 
opposition parties have identified.  We have proposed amendments 
to improve the bill but they have been rejected.

this country, but the bill will not do it.

<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
Canada and Quebec are havens.  The Immigration Act should 
enshrine this welcome in a fair and equitable manner so as to 
respond as humanely as possible to the needs of new arrivals, be 
they immigrants or refugees, in accordance with international 
conventions and the values held by Canadians and Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the anchor point for Bill C-11 is the harsh treatment 
accorded illegal immigrants. 
Much of the bill focuses on the closing of the door on potential 
immigrants, through the consolidation of measures intended to 
prevent fraud, reveal false declarations and abuse and deny 
criminals and people representing security risks access to the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Initially, it would appear from the bill that Canada has been 
invaded by criminals of all sorts; in a word, the door is open 
too wide.  Not only is there a need for a bolt, but for an 
impenetrable alarm system as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois does not agree with this position.  While it 
is important, indeed vital, to prevent criminals, especially 
those in organized crime or who have committed crimes against 
humanity, from entering the country, we must remember that these 
individuals represent a minuscule fraction of the people 
immigrating to Canada. 
To do otherwise is to reinforce the prejudice against refugees 
and immigrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote to you, if I may, Madam Speaker, from an open 
letter from the Centre justice et foi de Montréal on Bill C-11: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 was introduced in an essentially negative and defensive 
light: campaign against the snakeheads, major increase in 
penalties, increased powers of detention, reinforced 
interception measures abroad, reduced possibilities of appeal or 
review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our opinion, this represents a serious and dual perversion of 
the entire Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.  First of 
all, it is situating immigration—an asset to society, a plus, 
even a demographic necessity in the case of Canada—in a reverse 
perspective, as a threat from which we must protect ourselves. 
Also, it is displacing the function of protecting those in 
need—the refugees included in the title—to protecting Canadians 
from the potential risk or abuse connected with these new 
arrivals. 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>...The logic of repression is everywhere, without 
escape and without end, and even if officially only certain 
immigrants and refugees are targeted, it will end up spilling 
over inevitably to all immigrants and all refugees. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in my opinion, is a very good summary of the general 
feeling of almost all individuals and organizations we met with 
during the committee hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the House awarded honourary citizenship to Nelson 
Mandela.  No one can ignore the paradox and irony of the 
contrast between yesterday's Motion No. 379 and today's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the new legislation had been in effect 40 years ago and 
Nelson Mandela had sought asylum in Canada, as a member of an 
organization for the subversion by force of any government, to 
use the wording of clause 34, he would have been inadmissible. 
He would have been sent back to South Africa and there is a good 
chance that he would not have ended up the Nobel Laureate we now 
know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the committee review of the bill, the Bloc Quebecois 
introduced an amendment to paragraph 34(<I>b</I>), so that only those who 
engage in or instigate the subversion by force of a 
democratically elected government be inadmissible. It seemed 
logical that the government should support this amendment. 
I do not have to tell members what the government's answer was. 
True to itself, it rejected the amendment. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1605"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process for appointing board members is another major 
component of this bill. The bill does not include any changes to 
the appointment process. However, for several years, the Bloc 
Quebecois has been criticizing the Liberals for constantly 
making political appointments to the commission. It is essential 
to set up a transparent appointment process that will ensure 
full impartiality and a selection based on the qualifications 
and professional experience of the candidates, and not, as is 
often the case, on their political connections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the bill provides that the decisions will be made by a 
single member, it is even more critical that decision makers all 
be extremely competent. Unfortunately, the amendments that we 
proposed in this respect were rejected. Yet, the government did 
not have to look very far. It could have looked at the 
appointment process for Quebec's administrative tribunals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A brief was presented to the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration by two lawyers and a psychiatrist. The Bloc 
Quebecois endorsed the proposed changes. By presenting them, we 
felt we would solve the problem of the political appointments of 
members by proposing the use of objective criteria guaranteeing 
the competence and independence of members. But the Liberal 
Party does not want this. It prefers to continue to appoint 
members in a totally arbitrary fashion, thus significantly 
reducing the moral and legal authority of these administrative 
tribunals. 
How dare the government toy in this way with the life, safety and 
freedom of these applicants? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Board members have an important responsibility, and it is no 
exaggeration to say that they have the power of life and death 
over those appearing before them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Early this year, a bad assessment had tragic consequences. 
Everyone remembers the tragic situation in which the federal 
government placed Haroun M'Barek, a Tunisian who requested 
refugee status but was sent back to his country of origin, even 
though all signs were that he might be tortured there, which was 
in fact what happened.  Too late, Canada recognized its mistake. 
In this case, the Bloc Quebecois' pressure on the government 
certainly played a role in Canada's interceding for Mr. M'Barek, 
but it would have been better if Canada had not had to intervene 
and Mr. M'Barek had been recognized as a political refugee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois finds regrettable the hard line taken by the 
government in introducing this bill and the accompanying public 
announcements.  Through its approach to this issue, we believe 
that the government, which seems to be trying to reassure the 
Canadian right, is reinforcing prejudices towards refugees and 
immigrants.  It is thus encouraging division and heightening 
xenophobic and racist sentiments in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years, the Bloc Quebecois has frequently argued that 
the Canadian system for granting refugee status should include 
two essential characteristics: it must be prompt and fair towards 
the person rightfully seeking asylum, and it must dissuade those 
who clog the system with unfounded applications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The slowness of the claims process is the cause of unacceptable 
human tragedies and puts people and families in extremely 
difficult situations.  Is it acceptable that, at the end of 
December 1999, in Montreal alone, over 7,000 individuals seeking 
asylum were still awaiting a hearing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should mention that, although the bill proposes changes to 
claims for refugee status, nowhere does Ottawa agree to assume 
the administrative costs.  If the government is so sure the 
measures proposed in the bill are effective, it should agree to 
assume the cost of them until the persons involved have been 
declared refugees and obtained permanent residence or left the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February, Quebec, Ontario and British Columbia criticized the 
federal government's handling of the movement of asylum seekers, 
demanded major remedial action be taken and called for the 
federal government, which is solely responsible for the refugee 
determination process, to assume all the costs of it.

year to look after persons awaiting a federal decision by the 
IRB. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to express to you a concern over the 
Canada-Quebec accord.  The importance of this agreement lies in 
the fact that Quebec, aware of its responsibilities to protect 
French, can and must promote francophone immigration.  It is no 
secret to anyone that the English language minority in Quebec is 
part of the vast anglophone majority in North America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's anglophone minority can absolutely not compare itself 
to French language minorities in the rest of Canada. We are 
obviously concerned, and so is the Quebec government, by 
paragraph 
3(3)(<I>e</I>) of Bill C-11, which reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>3.(3)(<I>e</I>) supports the commitment of the Government of Canada to 
enhance the vitality of the English and French linguistic 
minority communities in Canada; 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could it be that this paragraph challenges what had been agreed to 
in the 1991 Canada-Quebec accord relating to immigration and 
temporary admission of aliens? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In her presentation on this amendment, the hon. member for 
Saint-Lambert indicated on behalf of the government that the 
purpose of this added provision was to ensure that the spirit of 
the Official Languages Act would be respected, and to help 
Canada's official minority communities, and to reflect the 
spirit of the report of the Commissioner of Official Languages, 
who hopes that the Official Languages Act will be acknowledged 
in one way or another in every bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the Official Languages Act stipulates that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is committed to enhancing the vitality of the 
English and French linguistic minority communities in Canada and 
supporting and assisting their development. It is also committed 
to fostering the full recognition and use of both English and 
French in Canadian society. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The anglophone minority in Quebec cannot, however, flourish at 
the expense of the francophone majority, which is far more 
threatened and hemmed in on all sides by a North American 
anglophone tide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1991 Canada-Quebec accord introduced a new and important 
objective for Quebec, to preserve the demographic weight of 
Quebec within Canada and to ensure the harmonious integration of 
immigrants into that society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This addition to the Canada Immigration Act might also be in 
contravention of the spirit of Bill 101, which sets out criteria 
giving precedence to immigration by persons with a knowledge of 
French. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a consensus within the population of Quebec to the 
effect that it is imperative to ensure the survival of the 
French fact in North America.  Need I remind hon. members that 
only 2% of the population of North America is francophone? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This threat to the survival of French was noted by UNESCO in 
1999, when it judged that Quebec was entitled by law to restrict 
access to English schools because this was an appropriate way of 
preserving the French fact in Quebec.  Even the Canadian 
ambassador to UNESCO stated in his argument: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the specific demographic context of Quebec, the precarious 
situation of francophones and the preservation of their cultural 
identity in North America, and more specifically in Canada, 
required a legislative intervention tailored to their unique 
situation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could it be that wishing to support and assist “the development 
of minority official languages communities in Canada” and enhance 
“the vitality of the English and French linguistic minority 
communities in Canada” within the framework of immigration 
legislation could have the direct effect in Quebec of favouring 
the English-speaking minority in Quebec to the long term 
detriment of the very existence of the French-speaking minority 
in Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1951, Statistics Canada figures have shown a constant 
decrease in the size of Canada's French-speaking population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will therefore be important for the Government of Canada to 
enforce clauses 8 and 9 of this bill so as not to threaten 
Canada's French-speaking minority, most of whom reside in Quebec.

a complete lack of respect for the people of Canada and of 
Quebec.  It also shows a lack of respect for those men and women 
who dream of coming and building a better future in Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak against Bill C-11, as I have 
done on behalf of the New Democratic Party throughout the entire 
legislative process dealing with this bill on immigration and 
refugee policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was touted as constituting a major overhaul of the 
Immigration Act.  It was supposed to be a long awaited 
replacement for a law that has been in place for more than 22 
years.  We all know that it replaces Bill C-31, which died on the 
order paper when the federal election was called, so the 
government had a second chance to get this right but refused.  It 
had an opportunity to get up the courage and lead with some 
vision, but it failed miserably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rare in my experience to deal with a government bill that 
is so seriously flawed as this one, so universally opposed as 
Bill C-11.  Certainly I know that in our committee discussions 
there was universal opposition to the bill on the opposition 
benches.  That was before today, before the leader of the 
Alliance Party rose in his place and appeared to be contradicting 
the good work, on many different levels, of the Alliance critic 
for immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the wisdom of the critic for the Alliance will prevail 
and that we will see a co-operative effort on this side of the 
House in continuing to apply pressure on the government to 
improve the bill and to think twice before allowing it to come to 
a vote today.  I know that seems a bit far fetched, but the 
sentiments we heard from Canadians from coast to coast to coast 
were very clear and precise.  Canadians do not want to see this 
kind of rigid, restrictive and punitive approach and are very 
disappointed in the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an area that is sensitive.  We know that.  We know, 
based on how immigration issues are raised in the House and the 
concern on the part of Canadians to ensure a balanced approach, 
there is a need for leadership by the government to help educate 
and inform Canadians about the need for immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a matter of such importance as immigration policy, population 
policy, which really is fundamental to the whole policy area, it 
is hard to imagine any government proceeding without considerable 
backing, without even qualified support from the opposition 
benches or without some community organization leaping to its 
defence.  However, that is exactly what the government is doing. 
It is plowing ahead despite repeated concerns, suggestions and 
criticisms raised by Canadians, by individuals, immigration 
advocates, refugee sponsors, ethnocultural organizations and 
people who advocate and work in the field day in and day out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It cannot be said that efforts were not made to improve the 
bill.  It is not for the lack of trying that we end up in this 
position today with a bill that is virtually unchanged from the 
start of the process to the end.  The committee worked hard.  It 
has been acknowledged.  Canadians worked hard.  Throughout the 
committee process we heard from over 150 different groups from 
coast to coast to coast.  Almost in unison they spoke against the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We proposed hundreds of amendments at the committee level during 
clause by clause. 
There were over 80 amendments from the NDP alone.  Yet with the 
exception of perhaps a handful of amendments, a few small 
changes, the bill remains flawed.  It remains a document with 
many offensive and troubling aspects.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it clear that for the NDP, at least, this bill is 
problematic not because of one or two offensive clauses but 
because as a whole it goes in the wrong direction.  I think this 
is the case for other opposition parties and it had been the case 
for the Alliance Party as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is contrary to the very values that Canadians hold so 
near and dear.  The bill as a whole, in all of its parts, is a 
disappointment. It is a lost opportunity and is regressive in 
many ways.  Many have told us that bill would in some cases 
actually make the situation even worse.  Imagine that.  After all 
the consultations and the successive bills presented on this 
matter, it is not even possible to draw the conclusion from all 
groups involved, including experts and concerned citizens, that 
the bill is better than the present 22 year old law.  That is 
what we are hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine a Liberal government bill being so roundly criticized 
not because it offends, with the exception of the Leader of the 
Opposition and a few others, the extremist elements of our 
society, the right wing elements or the conservative doctrine in 
the country, but because it violates fundamental principles in 
the areas of democratic rights, civil liberties and humanitarian 
ideals.  That is astounding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As so many told us throughout the whole process, the bill, when 
all is said and done, is un-Canadian and undemocratic and it is 
certainly un-Liberal.  Liberal members in the House today should 
be ashamed for supporting this bill and for refusing to rise in 
their places and speak against this very regressive legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legislation in the immigration and refugee policy field should 
flow from our history, our traditions and the values of Canadians 
and it should be based on population needs.  In terms of history, 
as many have said in the House, this country has been defined by 
the waves of immigration that have taken place over a long period 
of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have all said in the House that except for Canada's 
aboriginal peoples all of us or our ancestors came from somewhere 
else.  We are all immigrants and we value the fact that our 
society is diverse.  We see Canada gaining strength from 
adversity in terms of our climate and our geography and also from 
our diversity in terms of the successive waves of immigration and 
the ethnocultural diversity of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is fair to say that Canada is one of the most 
ethnically diverse societies in the world.  It has certainly been 
stated that way by Gwynne Dyer, who wrote a wonderful piece in 
<I>Canadian Geographic</I> in the February 2001 issue, in which he 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is truly remarkable is the ethnic profile of the immigrants 
to Canada, which is unique in how closely it matches the global 
distribution of the human population...Canada, more than anywhere 
else, is truly becoming the world in one country. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's legacy, Canada's history, is about that diversity.  It 
is not just about the number of people who have come from so many 
different places.  It is about how we treat and deal with one 
another in the context of being a mosaic.  It is our tradition 
and our values that have shown the way.  Canada is a model for 
the world in terms of respect for differences, for not imposing 
one view or one way of thinking or one way of life on our 
immigrants and the people who make up this country.  Our way is 
one of easygoing acceptance, of generosity and tolerance and 
respect for differences.  We do not impose some uniform identity 
on the immigrants who come to this country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would think, based on our history, traditions and values, 
that today we would be at a point of advancing openness and 
tolerance in the form of the bill before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That happened about 30 years ago.  That was a significant part 
of our history.  The government of the day under Pierre Elliott 
Trudeau actually looked at this as an important policy area that 
had to be addressed.  We saw legislation introduced that allowed 
for the doors of our country to be opened up and for immigrants 
to come to this country from all over the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are today in the year 2001, the start of the millennium, 
with the hope that we could build on that history and that 
tradition.  Instead we are looking at probably one of the most 
restrictive and punitive pieces of legislation that parliament 
has seen in a long time.  It is certainly out of character in 
terms of Canadians' expectations with respect to Liberals in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the recent developments illustrate what kind of 
situation we are dealing with.  It is not just a regressive, 
restrictive, punitive law but also a fortress mentality that is 
deeply entrenched in the system.  Although the minister is 
addressing this issue, we saw the treatment of Tinuola Akintade, 
the British citizen who received such rough treatment at an 
airport in this country, thus showing us that legitimate visitors 
are sometimes treated like criminal suspects in the country 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also learned some lessons from the whole episode with 
respect to establishing honorary citizenship for Nelson Mandela. 
Although it is very important for the government to have taken 
this initiative, and we have supported it every step of the way, 
we certainly were appalled at the one or two Alliance members who 
objected to recognition for Nelson Mandela. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also galled by the decision of this government to make 
such an important statement at the same time that it is bringing 
in a bill that, if we were able to repeat history and he was 
seeking refuge from his particular circumstances, would have 
denied Nelson Mandela the ability to enter this country in the 
first place.  As we have heard from many organizations and 
certainly from my colleague, the member for Winnipeg Centre, who 
made this point repeatedly during the process pursuant to Bill 
C-31, Nelson Mandela would have been denied entry into this 
country because he would have fallen under the definition of 
being a terrorist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This point was made so well recently in an article in the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I> written by Sharryn Aiken and Andrew Brouwer, 
who stated that for many individuals the provisions of Bill C-11 
actually mean: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—that merely associating with known suspects, sympathizing with 
a national liberation struggle or doing some community organizing 
in Canada will be enough to get a person labeled “member of a 
terrorist organization,” if the cause in question happens to be 
on the government's informal...blacklist.  By permitting such 
findings of guilt by association, the provisions violate 
international standards and principles of criminal law, bringing 
to mind some of the worst excesses of the McCarthy era. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other important point in this debate is the need for this 
legislation to reflect population policy, for it to be based, to 
be founded, on our vision as a country in terms of numbers, in 
terms of where we want to go, how we want to grow and at what 
speed, and how we meet the needs of citizens in this nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada can no longer count on a steady stream of prospective 
immigrants knocking at our door seeking admission.  We are just 
not competitive any more.  We are not competitive because we have 
moved so far toward a very punitive, restrictive process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The numbers say it all.  We have heard so much from the minister 
about opening the front door.  We have heard so much about trying 
to get our immigration and refugee population up to 1% of 
Canada's overall population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that were the case today we would be at about 300,000 new 
immigrants or newcomers to Canada.  According to the latest 
statistics, we are not even close.  The numbers are a little 
higher than they were in 1967 when a Liberal government opened 
the doors and brought in legislation at that time.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not making great progress toward meeting that minimal 
goal of 1% of our population.  We are not meeting that goal in 
terms of immigrants or refugees.  We are not contributing in a 
major way, as many Liberals have stood up in the House to 
suggest, for Canada to be a home for displaced persons and people 
in need of protection.  We are told over and over again how 
Canada is a model in terms of refugees, yet when it comes down to 
the actual numbers, for the last year for which we have 
statistics, we are at about 25,000 refugees.  I do not think that 
is something to brag about.  It certainly points to the 
possibilities for more openness when it comes to both immigrants 
and refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are a large country.  We have the second largest land mass in 
the world.  With only a little more than 30 million people, we 
can do better than this in opening our doors to people who want 
to come to Canada.  We have to do better if we are really serious 
about renewing ourselves as a population and ensuring that we 
continue to meet the economic and social needs of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard from many groups that made that point, especially 
people from Manitoba such as the Manitoba Interfaith Immigration 
Council and the Citizenship Council of Manitoba.  Both 
organizations have said time and time again that our demographics 
show that we are both aging and we are not having enough 
offspring to replace our current population.  This was a point 
made by the minister today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the question is what is the action to deal with that 
situation, and why have we not taken more steps to open our 
doors?  Is this what Canadians want?  What affect will this have 
on our social and economic well-being?  Can we survive as a 
nation if we cannot be competitive because of a stagnant 
population?  Is this truly the kind of vision we have of Canada 
in terms of the global community? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point of all the presentations we have heard was to base our 
policy on history, values, traditions and on population needs. We 
have failed to do that through this bill.  We have lost an 
important opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government is really doing with this bill is protecting 
Canada from the world instead of uniting and re-uniting families 
and building a nation.  It seems to me that the bill is 
predicated on that fortress mentality of keeping out the bad guys 
and protecting Canadians from negative elements in the world. The 
bill fails to do what is fundamental to the task at hand, which 
is to ensure that we allow families to be re-united and that we 
build the country on the basis of the contributions that each 
individual and each family make, just as our ancestors did, and 
that in the process we build and unite this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are doing in the bill is the worst possible thing of 
all.  We are responding to an anti-immigration sentiment that is 
a very small part of public opinion these days and declining with 
every day that passes.  There is a pandering to prejudices tone 
in this bill that does in fact lead to xenophobia and racism. 
That is the last thing this place should be about.  This is the 
last thing the government would want to do I would hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are debating a bill that is keeping people out instead of 
re-uniting families and building a nation.  We tried very hard to 
expand the definition of family class.  We proposed adding 
grandparents, brothers and sisters.  It was a tie vote until the 
chair had to break the tie and kept with Liberal policy, which 
was unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equally unfortunate is the fact that the government refuses to 
look at the whole restrictive approach to visitors visas which is 
probably cause for the greatest number of concerns and cases that 
MPs hear in our constituency offices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill refuses to deal with the head tax which does restrict 
immigrants from less developed and poorer countries around the 
world.  It is discriminatory because of the head tax.  We tried 
very hard to get that deleted.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It falls short in dealing with the whole issue of foreign 
credentials and ensuring that we recognize people with training, 
skills and education from other countries.  It fails to, as we 
tried to do, eliminate and replace the live-in caregiver program, 
which is so repugnant in the treatment of women and the 
perpetuation of the notion of women being cheap slave labour.  It 
denies people the right to pursue their democratic rights for 
appeals to the courts.  We heard that over and over again. It 
does not live up to our international conventions on refugees and 
torture.  It is a disappointment on many fronts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to conclude with one sentence that asks the 
question:  In this world of globalization and rapid technology, 
does this have to mean harmonization and homogenization or would 
it not be better to ensure that the strength and the spirit of 
individual communities and ethnocultural populations is 
supported, enhanced and able to contribute to the strength of 
this country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I would like to seek unanimous consent from the House to 
share my time with my friend, the hon. member for Dauphin—Swan 
River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  Does the House give its 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK189"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, as we 
know, the twelve to eight split was unbalanced.  Although we did 
not get what we wanted out of Bill C-11, there was goodwill on 
both sides of the House during the presentations from over 150 
witnesses.  The hon. members for Mississauga West and London 
North Centre provided very solid contributions. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to pay tribute to the Bloc Quebecois immigration 
critic, the member for Laval East, and to the New Democratic 
Party spokesperson and the member for Dauphin—Swan River, all of 
whom made an important contribution to consideration of this 
bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our country was not built by a big Sussex, New Brunswick, or a 
big Lethbridge, Alberta, or even a big Winnipeg. We built it 
together.  A very multicultural pluralistic society built one of 
the best nations in the world, one that is the envy of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud of the Progressive Conservative background and 
our history of embracing immigration, which is an economic 
necessity to grow our vibrant society.  We also embrace the 
welcoming of human diversity in a protection of refugees. Canada 
is one of the four countries in the world that accepts convention 
refugees.  We should be applauded for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to pay tribute to members such as the hon. member 
for Cumberland—Colchester who was a member in the former prime 
minister, Brian Mulroney, government.  Immigration rates tripled 
from about 88,000 to about 240,000 over the nine year regime of 
that government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party of Canada has a very well-deserved history 
with respect to immigration.  Look how it opened its arms to 
Canadians through the era of statesmen such as Wilfrid Laurier, 
Lester Pearson and Pierre Trudeau.  That is the traditional 
position of immigration with the Liberal Party of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at Bill C-11, it would seem that the Liberal Party of 
Canada is the most reticent among the political parties in the 
House to embrace massive immigration and to provide the necessary 
tools to protect refugees. 
Clearly there was a divergence of opinion between the member for 
Dauphin—Swan River and the Leader of the Opposition with respect 
to their speeches, but I will leave that issue aside.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, we have some problems with the bill.  There is a 
lack of entrenched appeal rights for permanent residents and 
sponsors.  A clause in the bill specifies that a refugee may make 
only one claim per lifetime no matter how drastic the change in 
circumstance.  We have a problem with the fact that the final 
appeal for a refugee is a mere paper appeal.  We believe that 
refugee rights are human rights.  We should determine if a person 
could be persecuted, or tortured or perhaps die by not granting 
refugee status.  We should look that person square in the eyes 
when we make that determination, as opposed to a mere paper 
appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill has been rushed through.  We essentially have had 
closure on debate.  We are fast-tracking the bill as we head back 
to our ridings for the summer months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One initiative was taken and I want to compliment my colleagues 
on the opposition benches in particular.  After hearing 150 
witnesses from coast to coast and travelling this great country, 
we said we needed an opportunity to reflect on the information we 
had received.  We needed to have a week to prepare our 
amendments.  I put an amendment forth to force the government to 
move in that direction.  However to the credit of the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration and her colleagues on the Liberal 
benches, they saw the wisdom of that particular motion as we 
headed to the latter days.  In fact we were able to table some 
amendments that actually had a modest augmentation to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially what we are looking at with respect to the 
legislation is an opportunity to have a pioneering piece of 
legislation, one of which Canadians can be proud, which would 
replace an outdated piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  What did we get? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Instead we got mediocrity at best.  My 
friend and colleague from the NDP agrees with that position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Robert F. Kennedy stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Few will have the greatness to bend history itself, but each of 
us can work to change a small portion of events, and in the total 
of all these acts will be written the history of this great 
generation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every member in the House had an opportunity to take an 
incremental step to augment the legislation, to bend history and 
bring forth a better piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am concerned about is that the party of Pearson and 
Trudeau has had its traditional position eclipsed by individuals 
who see immigration as a problem, as opposed to something that is 
an economic necessity and is something that actually builds a 
greater Canada, economically and with respect to human diversity. 
The party has been sucked into the debate where it is easier to 
talk about the .00001% of immigrants or refugees who have 
criminal difficulty of some form, as opposed to talking about the 
fact that the glass is very full. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tough sounding legislation is not necessarily going to help 
the Liberals obtain their one per cent target with respect to 
immigration.  Stripping rights of permanent residents and 
refusing to protect refugees to the degree we should will only 
make life unfair and difficult, if not unjust, for many people 
who fall within the 99% range with respect to the immigrants to 
our great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a point of fact, we heard officials infer and offer in 
committee that the problem with addressing the criminal aspect of 
immigration and refugees and removing undesirables was not the 
bill.  They even advocated that the bill would not even enhance 
the situation.  It was the application of the act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I very much want to help the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration.  She simply does not have the resources to actually 
do what she wants to do.  In order to cover it up politically, we 
have a bill that sounds tough but really does not provide an 
additional tool kit.  It merely strips the rights of permanent 
residents and does not protect refugees to the degree that we 
should.  Moreover, it really taints the traditional position of 
the Liberal Party of Canada with respect to immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there were some actual wins in the bill.  I would like 
to point out one.  The Progressive Conservative Party tabled a 
particular amendment, which was passed, and I will refer to it as 
a great Tory amendment.  It specified that both permanent 
residents and protected persons shall be provided with status 
documents which allow travel, ID and access to school.  I thank 
my colleagues on all sides of the House who actually supported 
that amendment tabled in the name of the Progressive Conservative 
Party of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will just touch on other problems with the bill.  We know that 
it strips rights of permanent residents unnecessarily and denies 
them the fundamental justice of due process.  In fact in regard 
to the protection of refugees, I have two problems.  The bill 
does not provide for an oral appeal in the final application.  I 
will give credit to the government for adding an additional 
appeal to the process, but it is a mere paper trail.  It is not 
an oral appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need that extra appeal because of the very fact that we have 
moved from three adjudicators to one.  With a single person 
making the determination, it is that much more important to have 
some form of review of what took place in that particular 
determination.  I think this is a point that all members 
understand, but the bill fails to deliver on that particular 
aspect.  If we want to move faster, because we move from three 
adjudicators to one, so be it, but we need to have an oral 
appeal.  If we get it wrong and make an error in the 
determination of a refugee, people die, people get tortured, 
people get persecuted.  Those are the facts we have to endure.  I 
believe the bill falls short in this aspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another aspect that I believe falls short with respect 
to refugee protection.  We proposed an amendment that was 
supported by the opposition and was supported in spirit by 
members of the government side.  I want to pay tribute to the 
member for Winnipeg South Centre, who actually helped provide a 
compromise amendment.  We said that there should be a capacity to 
make a second appeal for refugee status if the circumstances in 
the country drastically change or if there is some reason why 
evidence could not have been deduced properly in the first 
hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a brief example.  Convention refugees receive status here 
in Canada after they were able to escape persecution in their 
home country.  Then things turn around in their home country, or 
they think so, and they go back.  Five or six years later or 
maybe even a couple of years later they look at it and say the 
country has gone to hell in a handbasket again, so they want to 
survive and find refuge.  Under this law it is a grey area.  I 
will not say that there is no chance of them getting a second 
application approved, but it is a bit of a grey area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the particular problems I have with the bill.  We 
thought the government missed some opportunities to further 
describe common law partner as meaning same sex and opposite sex, 
which would have meant a lot to a certain community.  We should 
have embraced that.  Also, the head tax is still there and has 
not been addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you know, Mr. Speaker, I am sharing my time with the learned 
member for Dauphin—Swan River, so we can actually have a 
diversity of opinion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have just a brief comment, and I want to 
congratulate my colleague from Fundy—Royal for his speech and 
also for his magnanimous gesture in including a member from 
another party in the debate.  I think that is a very good thing 
do.  I also congratulate my colleague from Mississauga West who 
gave consent and informed his members on the other side that it 
would be an appropriate thing to do.  I think that any time we 
can work in a less partisan way to address a serious issue it 
serves us all well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, first let me thank the member for Fundy—Royal for 
being very unselfish in sharing his time with me today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very honoured to take part in the third reading of Bill 
C-11, the new immigration act.  I have said to the House before 
that as a third generation immigrant to this country, I am very 
privileged to be here, and that includes the 44 other members in 
the House who are also Canadians by choice.  I believe we are all 
very thankful that this country has taken us in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately we still have a long way to go.  A new immigration 
bill is long overdue.  The bill is called an act respecting 
immigration to Canada and the granting of refugee protection to 
persons who are displaced, persecuted or in danger. Unfortunately 
the contents of the bill do not reflect the title. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also at this time I want to thank my deputy critic, the member 
for Blackstrap, for her due diligence and hard work as we 
travelled throughout the country seeking public information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to thank the members of the Standing Committee on 
Citizenship and Immigration, members from all sides of the House, 
for their tremendous co-operative spirit, which was demonstrated 
throughout all stages of Bill C-11.  There is no doubt that we as 
a committee wanted what was best for this country in our attempt 
to write the immigration laws for the next decade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the capable chairman of the committee, the 
member for London North Centre, for his relatively non-partisan 
approach.  I believe he has not forgotten that he, like I, 
immigrated to this country in the 1950s as a young child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also at this time I need to thank the clerks and the 
parliamentary support staff for all the hard work they displayed 
in keeping us organized and moving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard from all sides of the House about how important 
immigration is and how immigration built this country. Immigrants 
have been coming to Canada since the 1500s and they have shaped 
this country.  Canadians from all walks of life can relate in 
some manner to the immigrants who came to Canada seeking a better 
life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The manner in which Canada welcomed these newcomers was not 
always friendly.  In my brief intervention here I would like to 
quote from a book called <I>Whence They Came:  Deportation from 
Canada</I>, written by Barbara Roberts.  The foreword was written 
by Irving Abella in 1988 and I believe this is a good time to 
reflect on our history of immigration in Canada.  Mr. Abella 
states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a peculiar nation.  Peopled by immigrants, it is a 
country, paradoxically, which hates immigration.  Every single 
public opinion survey over the past fifty years indicates that 
most Canadians—including by the way, most immigrants 
themselves—do not want any substantial increase in the number of 
people admitted to this country.  This attitude may surprise 
Canadians, but historically it should not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one of our great national myths that Canada has a long 
history of welcoming refugees and dissidents, of always being in 
the forefront in accepting the world's oppressed and 
dispossessed, of being receptive and hospitable to wave after 
waves of immigrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We Canadians like to think that racism and bigotry are European 
or American in origin and play little part in our history, 
tradition or psyche.  We see ours as a country of vast open 
spaces and limitless potential which has always been open and 
available to the proverbial huddled masses yearning to be free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet as the recent history in Canadian literature has shown, the 
Canadian record is one of which we ought not be proud. 
Our treatment of our native people as well as our abysmal history 
in admitting blacks, Chinese, Japanese, Indians, and during the 
1930s and 1940s Jews, should lay to rest the myth of our 
liberalism and enlightenment on matters of race and immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us face facts  For most of our history Canadian immigration 
laws were racist and exclusionary.  We knew precisely what kind 
of people we wanted, and how to keep out those we didn't.  Until 
the 1960s our immigration policies divided the world into two - 
the “preferred” races who were always welcome in Canada and the 
“non-preferred” who rarely were.  The former were of British 
and European stock; the latter included almost everybody else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The central problem of Canadian immigration policy is that for 
most of our history we did not have one.  Since 1867 the country 
has had precisely four immigration acts.  Nor has there ever been 
in Canada—neither now nor in the past—any clearly articulated 
national consensus about what immigration should be or what it 
would be.  Except for one constant—its discriminatory 
aspects—our policies have had little consistency.

know why we use that as a target. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The integrity of Canada's immigration system is determined by 
processes that are used to determine who would be allowed to 
immigrate to Canada and under what conditions they would be 
allowed to reside in the country.  It is essential that the 
checks and balances be in place to ensure that decisions are 
just, because no system can ever be perfect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Enforcement of immigration laws can and does have severe 
consequences.  It causes a separation of parents from children, 
spouses from one another and individuals from a country that was 
their home.  To ensure that Canada has a balanced immigration 
system, Canadians need a process that is responsible, 
compassionate, equitable and fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 fails to preserve the process that is necessary for 
ensuring reliable and just decision making for immigrants and 
refugees to this country.  The bill strips away the progress that 
Canada has made in creating review processes that help bring 
balance to our national immigration policy.  Some of these come 
down to seemingly simple procedural issues but are critical for 
the administration of a fair and just immigration system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance cannot support Bill C-11.  It just goes 
against the values of being Canadian.  I thank the member for 
Fundy—Royal for sharing his time with me.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the hon. member for Dauphin—Swan 
River.  I understand from my colleague who is a member of the 
committee and others, and I believe he displayed it again today, 
that he takes a very moderate, tolerant and inclusive approach to 
the particular issue as well as to other issues that have come 
before the committee and the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not trying to be provocative in this question, but my 
confusion lies in the sense that it appears a different approach 
has been laid out by previous speakers, including his leader.  I 
want to make sure that we attribute the credit and the admiration 
for the position he has just put before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not trying to put him on the spot or have him distance 
himself from the previous speaker in his party, but I want to be 
generous in suggesting that he has taken an approach that I 
believe is very consistent not only with the position of the 
Progressive Conservative Party but with that which I think is 
more in line with the way Canadians feel that immigration should 
work.  Would the hon. member care to comment on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark:</B>  Mr. Speaker, to make things very clear, 
the Canadian Alliance is pro-immigration.  We promise to welcome 
new Canadians and at the same time keep out the criminals.  The 
Canadian Alliance immigration policy states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a nation of immigrants.  We have always been enriched 
by new arrivals to our shores.  A Canadian Alliance government 
will maintain the current level of immigration.  We will make it 
easier for immigrants who possess advanced skills and training to 
enter Canada, and will make the family reunification process 
truly responsive.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too was very impressed by my 
colleague's speech and his approach to the immigration question. 
He was critical of the bill.   Would he tell the House what he 
feels should be in the bill that is not in it at present?  What 
changes does he feel would be appropriate to assist immigrants in 
entering our country?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the irony of the hearings was 
that the majority, probably over 90%, of the more than 150 
stakeholders were in opposition to the bill.  Obviously there is 
something wrong with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is impossible to travel throughout the country and spend two 
weeks in Ottawa listening to Canadians voice their opinions of 
the bill.  Over 200 amendments were put in the committee on a 
clause by clause basis and the majority, again I would say over 
90%, were rejected.  Some of them were very rational and 
reasonable.  The government accepted a few, but not a lot was 
done with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will illustrate that the one area which needed to be clarified 
was the whole issue of foreign nationals and permanent residents. 
The member on the government side suggested we should perhaps go 
back to the old business of landed immigrant status.  If people 
land they are landed and have status.  That is a very rational 
approach.  I wish the government had listened to its own member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately permanent residents still risk losing their status 
when they leave the country.  Because permanent resident and 
foreign national intermingle at times, the government made it 
worse.  It put the words permanent resident alongside the words 
foreign national throughout the bill.  The government could have 
done a lot of things to improve the bill but did not.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I will be sharing my time in what is left of the debate with the 
member for Laval West.  I have witnessed what I can only call 
treachery in this place today.  I sat through committee hearings 
where the critic who just spoke put forward a number of 
thoughtful amendments that were surprising to many of us on the 
government side.  He listened to some of the people who came 
forward, took up the challenge they put before the committee, and 
put forward amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those amendments in essence would have allowed more rights of 
appeal for permanent residents who are convicted of a crime, 
sentenced to at least two years of a possible ten year sentence 
and who have served that time in prison.  When they come out of 
prison the minister under the new act would have the right to 
begin deportation proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The critic put forward amendments, as did other critics on the 
opposite side, that would have given more appeal opportunities to 
criminals convicted under what we call the 10 and 2 rule.  The 
amendments would have increased the opportunities for appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I came here today to listen to the leader of Her Majesty's 
official opposition deliver a speech in which <I>Hansard</I> will 
show and record that he said there should be fewer opportunities 
for appeal on deportation orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wondered if I was hearing correctly.  Was the Leader of the 
Opposition openly challenging and countering everything his 
critic has done in the weeks and months that have gone by in 
bringing the bill to the point of third reading? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall the requirement put in place recently that all speeches 
by the leader of Her Majesty's opposition be vetted by the critic 
within that caucus.  I wondered if the Canadian Alliance 
immigration critic had vetted the speech by his party's leader. I 
can only assume he did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is truly stunning to see this kind of treachery within one's 
own organization.  It is unfair, because while I may disagree 
with the member opposite—

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I 
listened very carefully to the hon. member.  It is very 
unparliamentary to accuse another hon. member of treachery.  That 
language is definitely over the top.  I would ask the hon. member 
to withdraw the word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The intervention of hon. member for 
Prince George—Peace River is timely.  I was reflecting myself 
about the implications of the term or the word. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that it has raised an objection, that in itself 
encourages the Chair to ask the member for Mississauga West to be 
far more judicious in the selection of his words during the rest 
of his intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the passion I feel and 
evoke over the issue is because of the stunning reversal of the 
leader of Her Majesty's opposition to the position for which the 
critic has consistently put forward and fought.  These people can 
call that whatever they want.  I will call it at the very least a 
reversal, an admonition, a bailing out, whatever members want me 
to call it in acceptable parliamentary language, and I am happy 
to live by that.  The fact still remains that what we saw today 
was unfair to the critic on that side of the House.  It was 
really quite remarkable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also heard in that same speech the need to define a refugee. 
How in the world can someone who purports to want to be prime 
minister of this land not know that that was done by the Geneva 
Convention in 1949 and that the United Nations has long 
recognized worldwide refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not need to define a refugee.  We need to define some kind 
of leadership who understands how important it is that we reform 
the immigration system and the refugee system.  We need to ensure 
that we can close the back door and boot out the criminals who 
are a danger to our society.  We need to open our arms wide to 
both refugees and immigrants in all classes, family classes and 
economic classes from around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need to do is some serious education within the confines 
of these walls to understand that the work a committee does is so 
vital to forming the final document which will come before this 
place for a vote.  For someone to stand up having done obviously 
no research and with no knowledge, understanding or empathy for 
his own critic and the work he has done is absolutely shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some possible options.  One option is that the critic 
should resign his post as critic within the Canadian Alliance or 
the leader should remove him because they obviously are divergent 
in their views on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another option is for the leader of Her Majesty's loyal 
opposition to apologize, not to me or Canadians but to the member 
for Dauphin—Swan River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  In the spirit of the summer break and the holidays, I 
would ask the hon. member to divert from his usual habit of 
political rhetoric and give us the real contents of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I trust the hon. member will take 
this with all the respect the Chair has for all the members of 
the House, but that is definitely not a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, another option is that 
the leader of Her Majesty's loyal opposition should resign his 
seat and his job in this place.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, while we are accustomed to the bluster of the member 
opposite and although he may have a good point, with respect to 
the bill before the House, it was his government that yesterday 
invoked a standing order to limit the debate today, to limit the 
debate on another important bill, Bill C-24, and to exclude the 
passage of an important bill with regard to water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the most heinous upshot of what the government did with 
that particular standing order was to deny members of the House 
of Commons the ability to vote on the spending of $166 billion. I 
wonder how the member reconciles that with the righteous 
indignation he has just expressed toward the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would the member say in defence of his position to strip 
away the right of the opposition on behalf of their constituents 
to have some say in the spending of $166 billion of taxpayer 
money? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I said I wanted to share 
my time with the member for Laval West.  While I would love to 
debate the member opposite, frankly my preference would be that 
we close the debate by hearing the fine words of the member for 
Laval West who has extensive credibility and experience in the 
area of immigration. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the member's speech was full of rhetoric but not 
much subject matter, which, coming from that member, is typical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the official opposition as well as the official 
opposition's chief critic for immigration articulated the 
immigration policy of the Canadian Alliance very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member tell us about the other side of the bill 
which would not close the back door but in fact leave it quite 
open?  I would like to ask the hon. member about the RCMP, which 
is allegedly, under the Liberal government's nose, probing 32 
federal immigration employees for criminal offences at 21 
Canadian embassies.  Another 16 immigration staffers are 
allegedly facing internal investigation by department officials 
for alleged offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP are also assisting in a probe of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees.  Most of the individuals and 
families admitted to Canada from Kenyan refugee camps since 1995 
have had to pay bribes to come to Canada.  They are genuine 
refugees but they could not come through the front door. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where in Bill C-11 can I find something that will counter and 
effectively control corruption and close the so-called back door? 
I do not see anything in Bill C-11 that would curtail corruption 
and bribery.  Where is it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I can see that colleagues 
opposite are not going to allow my colleague to speak. I am sorry 
to see that because we will be out of time.  With her indulgence 
I will respond to the accusations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly what Canadians hear when they listen to the former 
Reform Party and the current Canadian Alliance Party is a kind of 
fearmongering and castigation of people with absolute impunity. 
The members of that party have the ability to stand up and say 
whatever they want against people who do not have the ability to 
defend themselves. It is the most despicable game of politics 
that one could engage in and we have seen it over and over again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have met at least one person over there who has some 
integrity, and that is the critic for the Canadian Alliance. 
While I may not share his views, I will defend the member's right 
to put his views forward forcefully and honestly in committee and 
to debate them as he did clause by clause.  His integrity has been 
impugned in this place by the leader of that party today in the 
speech that was delivered.  It was the most shameful and 
disgusting display of politics I have ever seen.  Having looked 
at this, there is only one solution, in my view, that the critic 
could accept and that is an apology from the leader or his 
resignation.
