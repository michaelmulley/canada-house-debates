<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>KANESATAKE INTERIM LAND BASE GOVERNANCE ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill S-24, an act to 
implement an agreement between the Mohawks of Kanesatake and Her 
Majesty in right of Canada respecting governance of certain lands 
by the Mohawks of Kanesatake and to amend an act in consequence, 
as reported (without amendment) from the committee.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Robert Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.)</B> moved that the bill be concurred in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(Motion agreed to) 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  When shall the bill be read the third 
time?  By leave, now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Robert Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.)</B> moved that the bill be read the third time 
and passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, many Canadians will remember the summer 
of 1990.  Oka acted as a national wake-up call.  It sent a clear 
signal that as a country we had to take concrete action to ensure 
that the concerns of people like the Mohawks of Kanesatake were 
not only heard but acted upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is precisely what the Government of Canada and the Mohawks 
of Kanesatake have been doing ever since the barricades came 
down. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1010"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT2"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT2"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1010
<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, talks are currently underway between current grand 
chief James Gabriel, his council, the mayor of Oka and his 
municipal council to negotiate a harmonization of Kanesatake laws 
and Oka bylaws on neighbouring lands in the village of Oka as 
required by Bill S-24. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With incremental steps, we have proven that together the path of 
negotiation and reconciliation is the best option for all parties 
involved.  Bill S-24 would raise the bar another notch and would 
continue our work to resolve the outstanding issues confronting 
the Mohawk people of Kanesatake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-24, and the agreement it would implement, would formally 
recognize an interim land base for the Mohawks of Kanesatake. It 
would not be a permanent land base because the agreement in no 
way represents a final resolution of land issues for Kanesatake. 
It is entirely possible that additional lands may in the future 
be brought under the agreement should both parties agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the agreement is limited in its scope, it nevertheless 
represents a major breakthrough.  Kanesatake Mohawk lands would 
now fall under section 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 1867.  It 
is something the Mohawks of Kanesatake have sought for many 
years.  The legislation would prevent the lands from falling 
under the Indian Act, something they are determined to avoid. 
They fully realize that other first nations are trying to 
extricate themselves from the cumbersome provisions of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was for this very reason that I recently launched national 
consultations on first nations governance.  Although Bill S-24 
was developed before consultations on governance reform got 
underway, it is entirely consistent with the thrust of our 
initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These measures set the stage for further negotiations on a range 
of substantive issues.  They are the first crucial step in the 
ongoing process of ensuring peace and prosperity for the 
community. In the end that is our overarching objective no matter 
which side of the negotiating table we sit on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation sets out a framework by which the two 
communities would be able to peacefully co-exist, paving the way 
for economic and social development and an improved quality of 
life for all the people living in and around the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation is a tremendous accomplishment and a tribute to 
the hard work and tenacity of all parties involved, most 
particularly, the Mohawks of Kanesatake.  The future is as bright 
and promising as the young democracy that has taken hold in 
Kanesatake since the barricades came down and that we as 
legislators are helping to shape.  This achievement should be 
celebrated not just in the halls of parliament but across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to thank our colleagues in the Senate for their 
part in the review and adoption of Bill S-24.  I urge all hon. 
members to follow the example of the Mohawk people of Kanesatake 
who acted in good faith to achieve this landmark agreement by 
voting to adopt the historic legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Saskatoon—Wanuskewin, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to 
rise and speak today to Bill S-24, the Kanesatake interim land 
base governance act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleagues have stated previously at second reading and in 
committee, the Canadian Alliance will be supporting the bill.  We 
believe the intent of the bill is correct and that it is one 
small incremental step in correcting a long outstanding issue for 
the Kanesatake Mohawks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will however use this opportunity to again express our concern 
over the manner in which the government and the Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development brought the bill to the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first concern, and I say it respectfully to the minister, is 
the way in which the minister brought the bill to the House.  It 
was tabled in the other place first.  My colleague from 
Nanaimo—Cowichan stated it previously but I believe the 
minister's comments during the Senate committee hearings are 
worth repeating.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 25 the minister stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without being too derogatory to my own colleagues in the House, 
maybe things will go better if I send them here first.  Perhaps 
that is a good trend to continue.  We will test it for a while. 
We have other pieces of legislation that will be coming your way 
in the next year that we may have some discussions about and 
consider, with the approval of the House leadership. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I am sure that you will agree with me when I state 
that I and many members on both sides of the House find this 
attitude and this approach completely unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second matter I am concerned with is that without the 
insistence of the official opposition party, the Canadian 
Alliance, the bill would have been rushed through with rather 
undue haste without committee hearings and therefore without the 
opportunity to hear from concerned Kanesatake community members 
who oppose the bill.  When there is opposition for various 
reasons, we need to hear from those who are opposing.  Maybe we 
could learn from them as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly I wish to state for the record that although we will be 
supporting Bill S-24, we have concerns over the process that was 
used in the handling of the bill through the negotiation in that 
territory and, in particular, the manner in which the community 
was not fully involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fully realize that no process is perfect and that not everyone 
will be satisfied with the end results.  However, the government 
and particularly the minister having responsibility need to 
reflect for the future on the inadequacies of this process and 
improve upon it for all future negotiations so that there is 
co-operation among parties on these matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many community members feel that they were not a part of this 
important process.  I would like to take this opportunity to read 
into the record excerpts from a letter that was received from a 
Kanesatake community member following the committee hearings.  I 
would like to thank him and others who have attempted input in 
this manner.  This letter was addressed to the chair of the 
standing committee in Ottawa and states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Good day to you, please allow me to introduce myself, my name is 
Eugene Nicholas, member of the Kanesatake band, No. 0690074401, 
province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has come to my attention that there are hearings being 
conducted on the Kanesatake Land Governance Agreement, referred 
to as:  Bill S-24.  I would like to extend you an invitation to 
our community, to give the community members a chance to voice 
their concerns and opinions/facts before the Standing Committee, 
before Bill S-24 is passed as law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned with these proceedings because of a lack of 
information and input from the community level.  We are not 
consulted or given the facts behind this agreement.  Our Leaders 
and negotiators have neglected to properly inform and consult the 
population on all matters pertaining to this accord.  We have not 
publicly debated the contents of this said agreement in which 
constructive and positive measures can be suggested in regards to 
our community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I view the entire arrangement as questionable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year when the agreement was to be initialled, no one from 
the community was invited/advised or told to be present for such 
a historical signing, other than the Chiefs of the Council, INAC 
representative Walter Walling, and Mr. Eric Maldoff, federal 
negotiator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, Mr. Robert Nault was in our community to sign or 
initial this agreement, and ironically it was done on Aboriginal 
Day, where our members were celebrating in the Pines area.  Mr. 
Walter Walling of the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs 
Canada, was seen riding in a Kanesatake Police Vehicle, making 
sure that trouble makers (opposition to the agreement) were not 
in the area!  Why was he doing this?  Is it in the Federal 
Government's interest to have their public servants do community 
police work, or is it to cover up the fact that the Minister was 
here and that we were not permitted to attend this event because 
it was supposed to remain a secret?  In other facts where the 
Department of Indian and Northern Affairs provided funds to hire 
an individual to privately investigate our police officers.  I 
found this to be quite odd.  Does the federal department (INAC) 
other than the Solicitor General, provide discretionary funds for 
this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were not allowed to speak to the media because Mr. Eric 
Maldoff issued a media blackout, which meant that we could not 
give our opinions to the public, and they call this a free 
country?  Only James Gabriel and anyone who favoured the 
agreement, was heard or published. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge you to hear the community speak for themselves, they 
deserve a chance to be heard and it is their right, after all it 
is a human right.  Also, you will know the truth about this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly encourage the Standing Committee to come to 
Kanesatake to see for yourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yours in Peace and Friendship, Eugene Kanatiio Nicholas, Band 
Registry No. 0690074401 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like that letter on the record.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In concluding, I would like to thank the Liberal members who 
stated to our chief critic of aboriginal affairs that they were 
pleased to have met those who were dissenting.  They said it was 
good to hear other points of view.  They indicated in committee 
that they were pleased to have met and listened to those 
community members, one represented by this letter, and to have 
had the opportunity to hear other viewpoints on this very 
important legislation.  I believe they have realized it is 
imperative that the parliamentary process not be subject to 
whims, to just moving things through too quickly at the whim of 
any particular minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the opportunity to join in the debate and 
anticipate that we will have continued involvement in the future, 
hopefully in constructive ways, as the minister brings matters 
like this forward. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
purpose of Bill S-24, the Kanesatake interim land base governance 
act, is to implement an historic agreement which recognizes, for 
the first time, a land base for the Mohawks of Kanesatake, as 
well as the powers to exercise jurisdiction over these lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to point out that the word interim is used 
precisely because there is the possibility of other lands being 
added in future, with the consent of both parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-24 will make it possible to settle Mohawk property rights, 
thereby reducing the economic uncertainty surrounding the 
ownership and use of the area's lands and resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our position is based on a careful analysis of the situation as 
a whole.  In addition, on May 14, the leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois and the member for Charlesbourg—Jacques-Cartier, our 
party's aboriginal affairs critic, met with the Kanesatake 
Mohawk band council and its Grand Chief, James Gabriel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agreement is the outcome of long months of negotiation and 
is evidence of the desire to create a peaceful and positive 
atmosphere between aboriginal and non-aboriginal peoples, 
following on the disturbing events of 1990 to which the minister 
referred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois' favourable position on this bill is 
indicative of our party's openness to the comprehensive claims 
of aboriginal peoples and is part of the constructive dialogue 
our party has maintained with the first nations for quite some 
time now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mohawks' present land base has always been kept as public 
lands, rather than reserve lands as defined in the Indian Act. 
For this reason, the band council did not have the same legal 
tools at its disposal as other first nations for controlling and 
ensuring the development of its own land base, or for preventing 
these lands from being used for purposes contrary to their 
interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 21, 2000, negotiators for the Kanesatake Mohawks and the 
government signed an historic agreement with respect to 
Kanesatake governance of the interim land base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agreement constitutes the first legal recognition by the 
Government of Canada of the ability of the Mohawks of Kanesatake 
to determine and control the use of their interim land base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effect of the agreement is to transfer to the Mohawks of 
Kanesatake lands over which they will exercise full authority, 
thus putting an end to years of legal uncertainty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worthy pointing out that this very uncertainty was one of 
the key causes of the Oka crisis in 1990.  The powder keg was 
set off, hon. members will recall, by the expansion of a golf 
course onto land claimed by the Mohawks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the terms of the agreement, the Kanesatake Mohawk lands 
would fall under subsection 91(24) of the Constitution Act, 
1867, which gives the Government of Canada exclusive legislative 
power over Indians and lands reserved for the Indians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the agreement, however, the lands covered by the 
agreement do not become a reserve within the meaning of the 
Indian Act, but belong to the band council, which thus obtains 
jurisdiction with respect to the maintenance of law and order. 
These lands are therefore guaranteed clear legal status along 
with protection from coming under the cumbersome and restrictive 
land management provisions of the present Indian Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement with the Government of Canada will empower the 
Mohawk community to adopt its own laws and regulations relating 
to the land occupied by it.  The band council will be able to 
enact laws relating to waste management, building inspection, 
zoning and wildlife protection and management.  It can also 
regulate traffic.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the agreement gives Kanesatake the right to appoint 
its own judges, once there is an agreement on the relationship 
between these judges and the Quebec justice system.  The 
agreement provides as well that laws passed by Kanesatake will 
have to be harmonized with those in force in the neighbouring 
village of Oka. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the harmonization process is reciprocal, according to 
the bill.  It depends on the good will and co-operation of the 
two communities.  A framework is established for discussions 
between native and non-native officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to understand the need for harmonization, it is vital 
to know that all sections of Kanesatake land are not contiguous 
and that 57 parcels of the lands of the Mohawks of Kanesatake 
are located in the town of Oka. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important aspect of the agreement is the fact that it 
was concluded without prejudice to any right of the Mohawks of 
Kanesatake, be they ancestral or treaty rights and without 
prejudice to the land claims pertaining to the Seigneurie du Lac 
des Deux-Montagnes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These issues are still under negotiation between the Government 
of Canada and Kanesatake.  This is not a general agreement on 
self-government or a treaty.  It is a unique agreement on land 
management that reflects the circumstances of Kanesatake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite some opposition from June 21, 2000 until the eve of the 
ratification vote, on October 14, 2000, the band council led an 
intensive information and consultation campaign. It held several 
public meetings and organized over 50 workshops to explain 
the scope and impact of the agreement. The ratification vote on 
the land governance agreement took place in Kanesatake on 
October 14, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Community members were also asked to approve a code on the 
exercise of government powers. This code provides that the 
Mohawk Council of Kanesatake will act as a transparent and 
responsible government, in the best interests of the community. 
It also sets the rules of procedure and conduct that relate to 
the accountability of governing authorities and to conflicts of 
interests. The vote was very close with 239 voting in favour of 
the agreement and 237 voting against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Grand Chief James Gabriel pointed out, such a close result 
was indicative of the energetic debate in his community, without 
calling into question the legitimacy of the agreement. He said 
that “It is always healthy to have differing views. Let us not 
forget that we have traditionalists on our territory who do not 
participate in these votes, because they do not think they are 
legitimate. I truly respect their choice”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 14, 2000, the result of the ratification vote was 
confirmed through a recount by the Hon. Lawrence Poitras, a 
retired chief justice of the Quebec superior court, who 
conducted the independent judicial control of the ratification 
vote and procedure. The judge concluded that these aspects of 
the process had been perfectly proper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The historic agreement was therefore officially signed in Ottawa 
on December 21, 2000 and must now be approved by an act of the 
Parliament of Canada in order to take effect, which is what we 
are aiming for today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to recall that these are federal lands and that, 
for this reason, tripartite discussions involving Quebec, Ottawa 
and Kanesatake were not held.  However, I am pleased to point 
out that the government of Quebec was consulted and informed 
about the agreement and gave its general approval, as did the 
municipality of Oka. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois also examined the proposed legislation 
carefully and heartily endorse it.  We support this initiative 
and are proud to share in what is an historic moment for the 
Kanesatake Mohawk nation, which will now have the necessary 
tools for its own development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, the Bloc Quebecois wishes to point out that it 
supports the recommendations of the Royal Commission on 
Aboriginal Peoples. These call for an approach based on the 
concept of self-government, which acknowledges aboriginal 
governments as a level of government with jurisdiction over 
questions concerning governance and the welfare of their people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the entire royal commission report was based on 
recognition of the aboriginal peoples as an independent nation 
occupying a unique place within Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement respecting Kanesatake governance fully reflects 
the spirit of the conclusions and recommendations of the 
Erasmus-Dussault report, which is why we are pleased to 
facilitate speedy passage of the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to join in the debate on behalf of our party's critic, 
the member for Winnipeg North Centre, who spoke at length on the 
bill.  I will at points reflect upon the comments he previously 
made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will emphasize exactly what the bill is about, because unless 
one happened to be part of the standing committee on aboriginal 
affairs or was somehow involved with the Senate discussions, we 
in the House really did not hear a whole lot about it.  This is 
really somewhat of a shame considering its major achievement.  It 
is truly a major achievement in Canadian history to see this type 
of bill come forth.  It reflects the true interests of the people 
of Kanesatake and of process taken, which started some time ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time I want to congratulate Chief James Gabriel and the 
people of Kanesatake for their efforts and their work.  I also 
want to congratulate all those who made a point of taking part in 
the voting process.  We heard the numbers earlier.  If I heard 
them correctly, I think it was 237 to 239, although I may be a 
little off.  However, when I heard them I was really quite 
impressed because it shows that the people did care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point I want to comment on a problem I think we have 
within the House, which relates to the situation of voting, and 
sometimes the misunderstandings we have in the communities. It is 
inherent upon us as a House, when we are talking about issues 
that pertain to specific first nations communities, to 
acknowledge that all people in those communities do not have the 
same opportunity of education and economic opportunities.  As a 
result they cannot always get to Ottawa or to other places to get 
their points across.  It is inherent on us, when dealing with a 
specific first nation, to make the point of taking our 
hearings into those communities.  That is what we should do as a 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not go through this process in my community on an issue 
that pertained to specific bands in my riding, which was northern 
flood agreement.  With all my heart and soul I wanted us to hold 
those meetings there or at least have our hearings videotaped, so 
the people in the communities could be a part of the process. 
What is more important is that we hold the meetings so that all 
people in the communities have the opportunity to come out, voice 
their opinions and to make an informed decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we have a vote of 237 to 239, we should never have any 
question about someone not having all the information.  We should 
recognize the vote was taken and the decision was made.  I do not 
always like the outcome of elections, especially close calls.  If 
I had my druthers, the mix in the House would be a whole lot 
different.  The bottom line is I accept the process of having 
elections.  A vote takes place and one accepts the result.  One 
can fight against the parts disagreed with and support those that 
are good for the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recognizing that the vote indicated the support of the chief, 
the council and those people who wanted that process in 
Kanesatake, we should also support it.  As a parliament we need 
to support the bill.  I would love to see it supported 
unanimously in the House as a show of acknowledgement to first 
nations people that we respect their right of decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As indicated, the bill will not put the first nation of 
Kanesatake under the Indian Act.  The people of Kanesatake will 
have a separate process in place for their community.  Because of 
their unique position, they have had some opportunities that 
other first nations have not.  They have had the opportunity of 
not being totally under the thumb of the government.  This has 
given them an opportunity to expand in areas where other first 
nations people could not.  We see that independence in their 
decision making.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the areas noted, which was instrumental in putting the 
extra push to the bill, was the issue of the land use.  The 
people in that area did not have an opportunity to make a 
decision on what they wanted for their area.  That was the 
additional incentive to push for this.  They wanted control over 
what was happening with their land, while recognizing that the 
environmental laws of Canada would still fall into place and be 
in force in Kanesatake.  However, they would be able to use the 
land as they wished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point I would like to tie the issue of wanting control 
over their land to what happens with the land in Canada, if we do 
not make sure that we stay in control of it under free trade 
agreements.  A very instrumental first nations leader from, I 
believe, Manitoba made a comment one time that trade agreements 
would make Indians of us all because we would not have control of 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fight that the people of Kanesatake have had has just 
emphasized that even more for me.  They did not have control over 
their land and needed to make sure they put rules and legislation 
in place that would give them that right.  I want us to pay 
attention to the words of that aboriginal leader who said trade 
agreements would make Indians of everybody and that we should see 
the struggles that they had.  That will be us in the years to 
come if we do not make sure we as Canadians have control over our 
land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to impress upon the minister that point, but 
certainly more on his government.  I would like to commend him 
for the process on the bill and encourage him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he was making his comments he spoke of his new initiative 
with the first nations peoples.  He and I both know that the 
first nations leaders in Manitoba are not acceptant of his 
process.  I would like to emphasize to him that they have good 
reason not to be acceptant.  This process was dumped on them with 
the suggestion that this was the way we were going to do it, once 
again without the involvement of those first nations leaders. 
They were not happy about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I do not like the outcomes of all the elections 
sometimes, but the bottom line is I accept that in first nations 
communities, even though there is unhappiness sometimes over the 
outcomes of them, and I impress this upon my colleagues from the 
Alliance, the point is chiefs in council for the most part are 
elected.  When they are elected we must give them the right to 
make the decisions for their people.  If the chiefs in Manitoba 
are not acceptant of the process, then I suggest to the minister 
that he needs to consult with them to make sure the process which 
will take place is one that they are okay with.  I do not think 
that has happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have nothing but good results in my discussions with the 
chiefs in Manitoba, certainly with the first nations communities 
in my riding.  There is good and bad, we do not always agree but 
that is life.  I have my thoughts and they have theirs, but they 
represent the people of their first nations.  I acknowledge that 
and so should the minister.  He needs to acknowledge that this is 
the position they want to take.  It is their first nations 
communities and he really needs to take that into consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not go into all the intricacies of the bill.  That has 
been done a number of times.  I do not think we want to delay the 
process.  I know the people in Kanesatake want the bill to go 
through.  We in the New Democratic Party want it to go through. 
We support it and I would encourage all my colleagues in the 
House to show respect for the first nations people who have made 
the decision on the process they want to take.  Members should 
acknowledge that with a show of respect by supporting the 
decision they have made.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member for Churchill spoke about a very important aspect of 
the bill, that was the closeness of the vote.  She enlarged on 
that somewhat and discussed the fact that although the vote was 
very close, it was a democratic vote.  I have heard comments from 
some of the speakers which cast aspersions on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question concerns a vote that was taken in her riding on the 
northern flood agreement where a number of communities were very 
close to being in a tie situation.  There were a number of 
aspersions cast that the process may not have been correct, but 
at the end of the day the vote was accepted.  The fact remains 
that we have to accept the votes for what they are, regardless if 
they are close or one person away from deciding a tying vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member enlarge on what happened with the northern 
flood agreement and on the fact that the vote was close but ended 
in an agreement?  There may be people, and the member may be one, 
who were not in complete agreement with everything that went on, 
but that at the end of the day we moved forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in the case of my 
riding, it was not an extremely close vote like the Kanesatake 
vote.  It was the questioning as to the process, directed under 
Indian affairs.  A lot of the problems over the years have been 
because it has been directed by Indian affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had years and years of policy and implementation of 
different processes under Indian affairs.  As a result, the first 
nations people have not had the same opportunities we have. 
Non-aboriginal people may not vote throughout Canada, but none of 
them can ever argue with the fact that they have opportunities 
for education, economic opportunities and to be with their 
families, in most cases year after year.  They do not have the 
history of first nations people who have been taken from their 
homes or children have been taken away from their parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First nations people have not had the opportunity to evolve as a 
society and as a nation the same way we have because they were 
under the thumb of the government.  They lost a lot of years of 
evolving through what I consider a democratic process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I firmly hope that each and every first nation will accept, over 
time, the democratic system in Canada, because quite frankly I am 
happy with it.  I would suggest that something like proportional 
representation is a better route to go within our election 
system.  I would prefer if we are going to have a Senate that it 
be elected, but the bottom line is we can make those decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to give first nations people the very same opportunities 
we have all had.  We need to give them the opportunity to fail as 
well as succeed.  If they happen to fail in some instances, it 
does not mean the process is wrong and it does not mean they do 
not have the right.  They just need the same time and the same 
opportunities we have had to evolve through a process of forming 
their society as they would like to form it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
was intrigued with the answer the member just gave my colleague. 
She mentioned two things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, she talked about closeness of vote, that a majority is a 
majority.  However, as the member knows, there are times when we 
say a majority is not a majority.  The people of Quebec certainly 
would argue that, and there are other issues we discover within 
leadership races and major decisions, where people look at the 
majority in relation to the problem.  I wonder if there is 
something there that should be looked at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, she mentioned concerns with the Department of Indian 
and Northern Affairs and the Indian Act.  Yesterday 
the committee heard the legal advisor to the national chief, Mr. 
Mercredi, express devout concerns about how aboriginals were being 
treated, and rightly so, regarding a lack of consultation and 
involvement.  I would appreciate the member's views on those 
issues.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will take this 
opportunity to say with pride that Mr. Mercredi is originally 
from my riding.  His parents live in my riding.  As well, the 
former grand chief of the Assembly of First Nations, Phil 
Fontaine, was from my riding.  I mention that to give some 
indication of the type of riding I have the pleasure of 
representing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Residents of my riding have the benefit of knowing that two of 
their members have gone on to represent the first nations people 
of Canada.  As a result, I think the people of the riding have 
benefited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the treatment of first nations people, there is 
no question that it has been absolutely terrible.  I grew up in 
Lebret, a very tiny community in southern Saskatchewan, which had 
a residential school.  In my years of living there I hardly 
knew a child who attended that school because it was in a 
segregated area.  A lot of aboriginal people lived in the 
community where I grew up, so I believe I have an understanding 
of the situations that first nations people live through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My father actually managed one of what were called the Indian 
and Metis farms in Saskatchewan.  I had the opportunity to see 
the differences when first nations people are given the 
opportunity for employment, the differences that can take place 
in their lives and their children's lives for years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of families that had the opportunity to work on farms 
or at other jobs and to be paid fairly and to live in adequate 
housing have gone on to see their children educated.  Many of 
those children have become productive people within our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have failed in a lot of areas.  Those farms were not the 
norm.  There was the odd one here and there throughout Canada, 
though I only know of the ones in Saskatchewan.  We have failed 
to give economic opportunities to first nations people.  It is 
very hard to do that on the type of reserve system we have.  It 
will take a lot of years to change that system but those changes 
will never happen if we do not put enough dollars into proper 
housing, into proper sewers and water and into schools that are 
big enough to hold the number of students in them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of schools in my riding were built to hold only so many 
children and they probably need room for another hundred.  Those 
children do not have the opportunity of going five miles down the 
road to the next farming community to go to another school. Most 
of the reserves are off somewhere so they try to cram people into 
the schools in order to give them the educational opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must be seriously committed to following through 
on the recommendations of the royal commission on aboriginal 
peoples and to putting enough dollars into housing.  Anybody who 
thinks for one second that first nations people do not look after 
their housing should know that they get the bare minimum standard 
of housing.  Their houses in no way compare to the houses we have 
in our communities.  Their houses would never have been allowed 
in our communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The communities do not have adequate firefighting services and 
the firefighting services it does have is paid for through its 
global budgets.  When I hear Alliance members talk about wasted 
dollars in first nations communities, I would suggest to them 
that if their municipalities had to do everything aboriginal 
communities had to do with their dollars they would be here 
screaming and hollering too. 
<P><A NAME="LINK13"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, before I 
speak directly to the Kanesatake interim land base governance 
act, a bill which came from the Senate to this House, I will make 
a quick reference to the words of the member for Churchill.  I 
have always enjoyed listening to the member speak.  She brings a 
certain clarity and a personal reference to the subject that a 
lot of other members simply do not bring. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1050"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I have never been in complete agreement with everything 
the member says, she speaks from her heart and with a wide 
knowledge of the subject.  That knowledge could certainly be 
listened to by a lot of members in the House and influence a lot 
of party policies that are dedicated and manufactured in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mohawks of Kanesatake, also known as Oka, live on a tract of 
land roughly 50 kilometres west of Montreal.  On these lands 
which have been set aside for the Mohawks but do not constitute a 
reserve live both aboriginal and non-aboriginal peoples.  It is 
extremely important when discussing the bill to understand that 
we are not in any way, shape or form talking about an Indian 
reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990 the problem of unresolved aboriginal land claims erupted 
in the Oka crisis.  The Mohawks erected barricades to block 
roads.  In response to a request from the Quebec government, the 
federal government sent Canadian forces to help resolve the 
confrontation.  In the conflict that ensued one Quebec officer 
died. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot say those words lightly in the House.  The reason I 
say them at all is to give a little history lesson to everyone in 
this place.  We need to look back at where we were in 1990 and 
come ahead to where we are today.  This may not be the perfect 
agreement.  It may not suit every member of the House.  However 
the reality is that light years from where we were in 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are on the eve of signing an agreement so that we can step 
forward into the reality of the 21st century.  It is long 
overdue.  Over the past 10 years the Mohawk of Kanesatake have 
worked with the Government of Canada to resolve questions and 
grievances regarding land use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March 1991 the Mohawks and the federal government agreed on 
an agenda for negotiations within the community of Kanesatake.  I 
must point out that since 1991 the Mohawks of Kanesatake have 
switched from a traditional system to an elective democratic 
system that includes off territory voters.  They did so because 
they felt that everyone who has an interest in Kanesatake should 
be able to participate in the elections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, a lot of progress has been made over the past 
10 years.  In 1994 the memorandum of understanding over land 
purchases was signed between the Mohawks and the federal 
government.  In 1997 the federal government made land purchases 
in the name of Kanesatake, and the Mohawks established their own 
police station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 21, 2000, a new land governance agreement was signed 
between the Kanesatake and the federal government.  Bill S-24 
represents the culmination of negotiations engaged in over the 
past 10 years.  The bill did not suddenly appear before us.  The 
bill has taken over a decade to go from where it was to where we 
are today.  The bill is a critical milestone for the community of 
Kanesatake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-24 would provide legal recognition of the land base for 
the Mohawks and would include powers of law making, policing and 
other services.  The agreement with respect to Kanesatake 
governance of the interim land base was ratified through a 
legitimate democratic process by a majority, albeit a slim one, 
239 to 237, but a majority nevertheless.  An independent legal 
review of the ratification process and recount of the vote 
results, both conducted by a former chief justice of the Quebec 
superior court, confirmed that the process was conducted in a 
fair and open manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-24 would ensure that the Kanesatake Mohawk interim land 
base constitutes lands reserved for the Indians pursuant to the 
constitution but not as a reserve under the Indian Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-24 would also provide a framework for the exercise of 
jurisdiction and establish principles for the harmonious use and 
development of those lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the legislation the Mohawks of Kanesatake would have legal 
capacity to acquire and hold property, enter into contracts, 
borrow, expend and invest money, and be party to legal 
proceedings.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Mohawks would also exercise power to make laws formerly made 
at the municipal, provincial and federal levels.  It must be 
pointed out that laws made by the Mohawks of Kanesatake could not 
be less stringent than municipal or provincial laws already in 
existence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These laws would affect health and qualify of life, protection 
and management of fish and wildlife, disorderly conduct and 
nuisance, prevention of trespass, residency, fire safety and fire 
prevention, local works, zoning, waste management and public 
sanitation, traffic regulation and the appointment of judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While violators of any of these laws would be punishable by the 
Mohawk of Kanesatake, fines or imprisonment terms may not exceed 
limits established in subsection 787(1) of the Criminal Code of 
Canada.  Subclause 8(1) of the bill specifies that a Kanesatake 
Mohawk is not governed by the Indian Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the Mohawk of Kanesatake can enact the legal powers 
accorded to them by Bill S-24, they must adopt a land governance 
code that sets out the law of the land.  The code shall establish 
the rule of law, land use rules, conflict of interest rules, 
rights of appeal and redress, and procedures to amend the code. 
Furthermore a land use plan must precede any form of commercial 
or industrial activity.  Storage or transportation of hazardous 
materials or waste disposal can happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-24 stipulates that Kanesatake Mohawk land should be 
consistent with federal standards and can exceed in strictness 
provincial standards.  It must be pointed out that although 
environmental standards can exceed in strictness provincial 
environmental standards, they must be equivalent to or exceed 
standards already in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before substantial land use practices can be changed, Bill S-24 
establishes the process by which Kanesatake land use rules should 
be harmonized with the land laws of the municipality of Oka. This 
task will be an onerous one and is an onerous one, considering 
that the entire land area affected by the bill and inhabited by 
the Mohawk comprises many small parcels of land occupied by both 
aboriginal and non-aboriginal residents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-24 addresses the issue of governance but does not include 
debate regarding first nation treaty rights or other outstanding 
disputes and grievances.  Neither does it represent settlement of 
a land claim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the PC Party supports the legislation.  Bill S-24 
has been 10 years in the making and there has been appropriate 
consultation with the third parties involved.  We would have 
appreciated more time to look at the bill and have more witnesses 
appear before committee.  However sending legislation through the 
Senate first has become commonplace for the Liberal government. 
The House should not be here to simply rubber stamp a piece of 
legislation but should be actively involved in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will clarify this point because I do not want my colleagues in 
the Senate to think I do not approve of legislation coming from 
the Senate.  That is what makes the Senate a more appropriate 
vehicle of governance in Canada and gives it legitimacy.  We 
should be seeking more legitimacy for the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, we are supportive of the will of the Mohawk of 
Kanesatake and the extensive consultations that have been carried 
out with the community of Kanesatake.  As critic for Indian 
affairs and northern development in the last parliament, the 36th 
parliament—

Does the member for South Shore want to wrap it all up within a

period?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the value of the Canadian dollar compared to the U.S. 
dollar has dropped approximately 25% since the Liberals came to 
power.  The implications of this fact are important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it creates an attitude of complacency on the part of 
Canadian exporters.  Due to the lower Canadian dollar, Canadian 
exporters observe that they can easily compete with a similar 
product produced in the U.S. without maximizing efficiencies of 
operation.  Canadian workers are lulled into a false sense of 
security that their jobs will be safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the lower Canadian dollar means a higher cost of living 
for Canadian consumers.  That creates hardship, particularly for 
Canadians on limited or fixed incomes, many of whom are seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How much lower is the Liberal government willing to let the 
dollar fall?  The Liberal notion of Canada's competitiveness is a 
fool's paradise that builds wealth on a false sense of security 
and efficiency.  It is time to stop the Canadian dollar from 
falling further.

my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  It has to do with 
the study released today by the David Suzuki Foundation entitled 
“Fuelling the Climate Crisis”, which claims that the 
continental energy plan, and particularly the development of the 
Alberta tar sands, will raise Canada's greenhouse gas emissions 
to 44% above the commitment to the Kyoto protocol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the Deputy Prime Minister commit his government to an

of the development of the Alberta tar sands before any further

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the Deputy Prime Minister again about energy.  I 
raised it in the House the other day with respect to the purchase 
of Gulf by American interests.  I know that the Deputy Prime

that American ownership is lower than it used to be, but this

</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is interested in working with our

consistent: no.

amend the criminal code to prohibit coercion in medical 
procedures that offend a person's religion or belief that human 
life is inviolable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners want to ensure that health care providers will 
never be forced to participate against their wills in procedures 
such as abortions or acts of euthanasia.  They note that Canada 
has a long history of recognizing the rights of freedom of 
religion and conscience.  They lament the fact that health care 
workers and those seeking to be educated for our health care 
system often have been denied those rights in medical facilities 
and educational institutions.  Some have even been wrongfully 
dismissed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners affirm Bill C-246 because it would make these 
conscience rights explicit in law and would safeguard health care 
workers' fundamental human rights.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill S-24, an 
act to implement an agreement between the Mohawks of Kanesatake 
and Her Majesty in right of Canada respecting governance of 
certain lands by the Mohawks of Kanesatake and to amend an Act in 
consequence, be read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will 
conclude my remarks on Bill S-24 on an extremely important aspect 
of the bill and one that we should try to introduce into future 
pieces of legislation as we hand political and economic 
responsibilities over to first nations in Canada, and that is, 
the ability to pass laws for the first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would give the Mohawks of Kanesatake the power to make 
laws in a number of areas that were formerly made at the 
municipal, provincial and federal levels.  It must be pointed out 
that the laws made by the Mohawks of Kanesatake could not be less 
stringent than existing municipal and provincial laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was the critic for Indian affairs and northern development in 
the 36th parliament.  This issue came up time and again in 
various legislation, especially in municipal legislation, in the 
Mi'kmaq Education Act and in the First Nations Land Management 
Act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each and every one of those times that aspect of those bills was 
refuted or ignored by critics of those bills. We cannot ignore 
that.  We cannot give people rights and privileges without 
according them the powers to implement those rights and 
privileges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important here, and it was extremely important in other 
pieces of legislation as well, is that the reins of political 
responsibility are being handed over to the Mohawks of 
Kanesatake.  It ensures that the rights of individuals in the 
Mohawk nation are protected because the laws that will be passed 
in the areas over which they have jurisdiction will be no less 
protective of those areas than existing laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not preclude the Mohawks of Kanesatake from passing 
laws that are superior to existing laws, that are more protective 
of the environment, that are more protective of peace, good order 
and good government.  However it guarantees a base from which 
they must start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an extremely important part of this piece of legislation 
and others we have passed in the House.  It is with pleasure that 
I stand on behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party to

assistance. I was impressed by the work of our immigration 
officers. Again, I learned a lot.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the clause by clause study, several issues were addressed. Of 
course, many of these issues were debated in a spirit of 
co-operation. We really wanted to end up with a bill as in sync 
with the Immigration Act as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many things can be said and many comments can be made about the 
most positive elements of this bill, but three things caught my 
attention. The goal here is to make the Immigration and 
Citizenship Act much more effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we try to make changes to legislation to make it more 
effective, people sometimes say “To speed up the process, you 
might have to scratch some significant elements. I do not think 
that is the case here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill includes very positive measures 
for refugees, like new appeals to the Refugee Appeal Division. 
Measures are being taken to ensure that refugees have the 
opportunity to integrate into Canadian society. I do not think 
the changes proposed to the legislation ignore this issue. Quite 
the opposite, we have made access to our country easier for 
refugees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many concerns were raised during consideration of this bill, and 
rightly so. 
There are people who come to our country and apply for refugee 
status because, unfortunately, they have been victims of torture 
in their country of origin. Therefore, in response to 
initiatives by Canadian NGOs and the United Nations, we 
incorporated an element about torture into the bill, meaning 
that people who are or have been victims of torture, or who are 
at risk of being tortured, may be able to qualify to become 
Canadian citizens, provided that they meet other criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also introduced a new measure: risk assessment before 
removal.  There are occasions when, unfortunately, people 
claiming refugee status do not meet all our criteria, which are 
very compassionate.  Nonetheless, such people have a second 
chance, as it were, to have their case reviewed. 
If the circumstances have changed in their country of origin 
such that it would be dangerous for them to return, that is one 
of the factors that could work in favour of their being accepted 
into Canada. However, I do not wish to dwell any further on 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have already mentioned, several other members have comments 
to make on this bill.  As a general comment, as immigration 
evolves in our country, we know that it is extremely important 
for our future and for the prosperity of our country.  With this 
evolution, there will be changes in the regulations, and the 
parliamentary committees will be able to examine all these 
regulations.  I am sure that this will be done in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am grateful to all those who helped draft this bill.  I 
learned many things along the way. 
It should also be pointed out that the Minister of Citizenship 
and Immigration has been very open, always ready to explain or 
clarify elements of the bill.  I believe that this bill is a 
great improvement, and that there will be others in the future.

<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank you for giving me the opportunity to join in the debate on 
Group No. 1 at report stage of Bill C-11.  As the former 
spokesperson for immigration issues for my party, I was very much 
involved in the development of Bill C-31, which as we know is now 
known as Bill C-11.  It will make changes to the Immigration and 
Refugee Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As is well known, our party has been quite critical of the 
shortcomings of Bill C-11 and the former Bill C-31.  We were very 
open in our criticisms.  We disagreed with both the tone and the 
content of the bill in many ways.  We felt the bill dealt far too 
much with enforcement issues.  We felt that the whole immigration 
policy dealt far too much with enforcement.  It dedicated much of 
our time and resources to keeping people out of the country 
rather than trying to attract people into the country.  This is 
the type of tone or the type of content that we now see in Bill 
C-11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We pointed out that much of the impetus or rationale behind this 
tone found its origin in an overreaction to the Chinese boat 
people who drifted up on the west coast of British Columbia.  The 
public hysteria whipped up by the Reform Party and by the 
Canadian Alliance Party would have us believe that the country 
was under siege or being invaded in some irresponsible way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of us remember the reaction of members of parliament from 
the Reform Party in British Columbia when those boats started 
arriving.  They were saying:  “Turn them around and send them 
back in these rusty old tubs.  Who cares if they drown at sea? 
They do not deserve sanctuary on our shores.  They do not even 
deserve to have a hearing to determine if they are actual 
refugees”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were press conferences in which Reform members were saying 
such things.  They used what was really an anomaly of 600 people 
within a relatively short time arriving on our shores for their 
own political purposes.  It was an anti-immigration stance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very critical that somehow the ruling party, the Liberal 
Party, seems to have allowed itself to be pulled around by the 
nose on this issue.  This is the attitude or reaction that we 
found more and more.  All they want to talk about in the bill is 
enforcement: how to keep people out, how to keep our borders 
secure, and how to stop criminals from getting in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  That is wrong.  That is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Again the Alliance Party is fond of 
trying to whip up this hysteria that our borders are an open 
sieve, that we are allowing criminals in and that we are some 
kind of sanctuary for every criminal element, gangster and 
terrorist in the world.  This is what the Alliance Party would 
have us believe about immigration.  I find it frustrating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with the bill as it stands now.  Flawed as it is, 
we are talking to it.  I am very proud of the member of 
parliament for Winnipeg North Centre, the new spokesperson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Sure you are.  You lie all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think someone just called 
me a liar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  You lie all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin:</B>  I do not think that is very flattering. 
It is unparliamentary at the very least.  I will continue anyway. 
I have fairly thick skin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Winnipeg North Centre has done an admiral job at 
the committee to try to move amendments and improve some of the 
shortcomings in the bill.  One of the significant changes that 
she put forward, which was in fact passed, was having a gender 
analysis done of the bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1235"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT31"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT31"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1235
<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something that should happen automatically.  It is in 
keeping with federal government policy since 1995 that for new 
legislation an adequate gender analysis should be conducted to 
review whether there is a disproportionate impact of any piece of 
legislation we might undertake, to review whether it affects 
women differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We succeeded in that.  We had that amendment passed and I think 
it will improve the bill, because there are issues.  When we talk 
about family reunification and about income requirements to 
sponsor family members, there is a gender factor.  As we know, 
women make 66% of what men make.  If a person's ability to 
sponsor a family member is to be tied to their income, then 
certainly we must have some sensitivity in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one thing not addressed in the amendments at the committee 
stage is a shortcoming we have pointed out many times, that is, 
there was no mention of eliminating the right of landing fee, 
which we believe is one of the biggest barriers to attracting new 
Canadians to our shores.  We have been calling for its 
eradication ever since it was introduced by the Liberal 
government, to tell the truth.  We finally convinced the 
government to eliminate the right of landing fee for refugees, 
but it still stands to this day for other classes of new 
Canadians.  In fact, we are also calling for the elimination of 
the administration fees that are still being charged to refugees. 
We were not successful in that, but we will continue in our 
campaign to have those charges and fees eradicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also pointed out a number of shortcomings in the bill.  One 
of the flaws we pointed out and wanted to change is that too much 
in this bill is left to the regulations.  We were very concerned 
that members of the House and members of the committee would have 
very little input into the drafting of the regulations.  It was 
the member for Winnipeg North Centre who moved agreement at the 
committee stage that the regulations would in fact be put before 
parliament for approval.  This is huge.  This is a really 
innovative change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I compliment the member for Winnipeg North Centre for 
having the foresight to bring that forward, because it was 
glaringly obvious to all of us who read the bill that a lot of 
the details that will affect the day to day operation of the 
immigration department will be found in the regulations and not 
in the act.  As members of parliament we want some ability to 
have some say in how those regulations are crafted.  With the 
bill, they would come before the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another thing that should have been cleared up.  I 
appeal to the minister and the department to address it, even 
after Bill C-11 passes.  There is very little in the former act 
or in Bill C-31 or Bill C-11 that helps to clear up the 
definitions of terrorists, criminal activity, what level of 
criminal we are trying to bar from entry to the country and what 
sort of membership and what kind of terrorist organization one 
must have taken part in to be barred on those grounds.  The bill 
is very vague.  It leaves far too much to the discretion of 
officers who may have varying ideas of how this is to be 
implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We pointed out that if we are too absolute in barring people who 
may have taken part in or may have been members of terrorist 
agencies, if we are too strict in our enforcement of this, we 
could be barring people like Nelson Mandela, who was a member of 
the ANC, which was called a terrorist organization.  Now it is 
called the government of the day, but at the time it was a 
terrorist organization that took up arms to fight for freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely this is not the intention that the architects who drafted 
the bill had in mind, but it is one of the byproducts of being 
negligent by not being very clear about what we are seeking to 
achieve when we try to bar people who may have been involved in 
some kind of terrorist activity at some point in their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the smuggling of people is a very top of mind issue.  I 
have pointed out a number of times that sometimes smuggling of 
people is done for humanitarian reasons, in order to get people 
out of harm's way, to save their lives in many senses. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The underground railway through which American slaves were 
smuggled was a trafficking in human beings.  When we talk about 
cracking down on smugglers, yes, we want to stop people from 
exploiting people and trading in human cargo but let us keep in 
mind that sometimes these actions take place for humanitarian 
reasons.  Smuggling of people can be done with the best 
intentions of keeping people from harm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate being able to add my remarks on Bill C-11.  We will 
be voting against the motion as it stands. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we 
are talking about two sets of objectives.  One set of objectives 
relates to immigration and the other relates to refugees.  Some 
clauses in the bill in relation to the objectives are laudable, 
but when we go beyond the statement of objectives and get into 
the meat of the bill, we, like our friends who just spoke, have 
concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the objectives would permit Canada to pursue the maximum 
social, cultural and economic benefits of immigration.  Who can 
argue with that?  All of us in the House could be considered 
immigrants to Canada at one time or another.  In my case, my 
ancestors on both sides came from another island called Ireland. 
They settled in Newfoundland about 150 to 200 years ago.  Many of 
the people who lived in the area in which I live came from the 
same place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those people came to Canada when Newfoundland was not a part of 
the country.  Canada joined us in 1949.  They came here to settle 
in different communities and fish, because at that time they 
could make a living.  Today we would not refer to it as a living. 
I guess we would refer to it as an existence, but sometimes we do 
not know the difference.  As somebody once told me, we did not 
know we were poor until somebody told us.  I guess that is it 
when we start comparing standards.  It depends on how much we 
have and how well we deal with it.  In those days people dealt 
with their lot very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, today it is entirely different when people come to our 
country.  We have an immense country.  We just have to fly over 
it and look out the airplane window at the open spaces.  I quite 
often think about that, having flown over places such as India 
where the population is so dense that there are very few open 
spaces any more.  Even when we fly into mainstream Europe or over 
England, we can see that almost every inch of the land is 
cultured and cultivated.  Then we fly over Canada and see what a 
difference there is and how people who live elsewhere in the 
world in crowded conditions could appreciate our openness, our 
fresh air and what we have to offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do have a tremendous amount to offer, particularly in the 
development of the great resources in our country, if only 
government regulations would let us develop these resources for 
the benefit of the people without throwing in a lot of red tape 
and political jargon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the concerns I have heard raised just recently by people 
who have immigrated to our country was that as new groups come 
in, new people who are perhaps not familiar with our customs and 
language, they are having a problem finding suitable employment. 
In a lot of cases they are not aware of the customs and do not 
speak the language very well.  They find it very hard to get by 
the different industrial concerns, particularly in our large 
cities. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1245"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT33"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT33"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1245

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That raises a major concern.  First, I suppose it is idealistic 
to say there should be a crash preparatory course, something like 
a premarital course, for people coming to our country.  Quite 
often people come not because they want to but because they need 
to depending on the conditions they leave behind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people come to Canada I do not know how well we are 
prepared to make sure that they fit into our society, that they 
are accepted and that they are nursed along so they can establish 
themselves without basically being rejected because they do not 
fit into the mainstream. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our larger centres we have groups who are not brought into 
the mainstream and cannot find employment because of where they 
came from, the language they speak or whatever reason.  There is 
a tendency for younger people in such groups to do what our own 
young people do when they are kept not active: get into trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the concerns raised in larger cities about such groups 
are not raised simply because there is an innate, built-in reason 
for them to rebel against society.  It is because they do not fit 
into the new society in which they find themselves.  The onus is 
on us not only to welcome people into the country but to make 
sure we have provisions in place to deal with them when they come 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about enriching and strengthening the social and 
cultural fabric of Canadian society while respecting the federal 
and bilingual character of Canada.  It is an extremely important 
objective.  The people who come here from all over the world add 
to the culture of our country.  They add to the strength of our 
country.  They all bring much with them and make a contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can look around the House on an ordinary day and see members 
who represent different districts in the country.  Looking at the 
backgrounds of members we realize that they come from all over 
this great world.  We are now living in Canada and are all 
Canadians. It does not matter what our backgrounds are.  All of 
us in our own way have contributed to the growth of this great 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the concerns is in relation to the second part, 
respecting the federal and bilingual characters of the country. 
One of the things we must realize is that when people come to 
Canada they ask to be Canadians.  If people have problems where 
they come from, if they leave countries because of oppression, 
persecution, social conditions or whatever reason and choose 
Canada, as so many do, they must be encouraged as immigrants to 
make sure they are now part of this great country we call Canada. 
Quite often it means having to leave behind habits, customs and 
so on, but that is the choice people make when they come here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a bilingual country whether or not we all accept it. A 
lot of people may say that is insignificant.  However those of us 
who move throughout the country realize that the two founding 
nations are still extremely strong.  The two languages are 
extremely strong and are the accepted languages of the country. 
We should make sure we know them and can communicate quite well 
in them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also must keep in mind that people who come to our country 
might find it hard to adapt.  That again is where it is great to 
have objectives, but if we do not provide for the implementation 
of the objectives then people who come here will have no way of 
coping with what we require.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again in relation to refugees, many people come here because 
they are forced to.  Again, these are things we must deal with. 
The objectives are tremendous.  The implementations in many cases 
are weak and that is what we must work on collectively. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak to Bill C-11 today. 
There is no question that it has been a long time in coming and 
contains comprehensive changes.  However, as my colleague from 
the NDP indicated, the bill does not contain enough changes for 
us to support it.  We still have great concerns about many areas 
in the legislation and I will reflect on a few of those. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who work in Citizenship and Immigration Canada have 
been absolutely excellent for the most part when my staff and I 
have dealt with them.  They are extremely helpful and go out of 
their way to try to resolve issues.  Problems tend to arise not 
because they do not want to help or do their best but because of 
the policies and processes that have been put in place.  As a 
result, some people have come into the country who should not be 
here.  There have been instances where people have not acted 
their best while in Canada.  As the saying goes, one bad apple 
spoils the whole bunch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those cases have not been blown out of proportion, but a number 
of them seem to have been.  As a result, people immigrating to 
Canada, especially in the last few years, have been attacked by 
people with certain agendas.  As a Canadian, I am disappointed to 
see that because I expect more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I grew up in a Canada that was quite different.  In rural 
Saskatchewan where I grew up there were often only one or two 
obvious minorities or other nationalities.  Other than first 
nations people and the usual European mix of people and French 
speaking people whose parents or grandparents had come over, 
there was only the odd obvious minority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I grew up with a very great respect for multiculturalism 
in Canada.  It was taught in our school system.  I grew up 
respecting the diversity of cultures and not expecting everybody 
to be the same.  I grew up respecting people's differences and 
understanding that we were all here to enjoy Canada and be active 
participants in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, my experience with departmental officials has been 
for the most part very good.  However there are extreme failures 
in the system.  One of those failures, which has not been touched 
on in this or previous debates, is the fact that changes within 
the department have led to case files of people who enter the 
country being dealt with by people who are not always the most 
qualified or experienced.  As a result, we do not necessarily 
have the best outcomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not blaming the individuals.  However the experienced 
people are not dealing with the files or not enough people are 
dealing with the files and as a result things do not flow as 
smoothly as they should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will comment on some cases I have personally dealt with within 
my office.  I apologize to the minister because I have never 
discussed the cases with her.  I often intend to because I have 
certain views of how things happen but I have not had the 
opportunity.  These cases are not ones on which the minister has 
been made aware but it is obvious that there are other such cases 
or we would not have these clauses in the bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the major issues is in relation to gender and race.  I 
was quite surprised to get the impression, from a number of cases 
I have dealt with through my office, that women from certain 
countries do not get treated the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That has been hard for me to handle.  The first situation was 
regarding women in Russia who want to come to Canada.  In one 
case there were teachers in Canada who were willing to sponsor a 
young woman.  The woman worked in Russia as a teacher.  She was 
single and probably in her late thirties.  The teachers had known 
her for some five years.  They went over and visited regularly as 
part of an educational program in Russia.  I had the opportunity 
to see how that program worked when I was in Russia so it was a 
great experience for me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the young woman paid the equivalent of $50 Canadian to 
apply to come and visit the teachers in Canada.  She was denied 
outright.  The Canadian teachers told me this was an ongoing 
problem whenever they wanted to bring someone over for a visit, 
even when they signed on the person's behalf.  There seems to be 
an impression that a Russian woman coming to Canada does so for 
only one reason: to somehow try to stick around, stay in Canada 
and not adhere to the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
There have been consultations with the other parties and I 
believe you would find unanimous consent for the House to concur 
in the 24th report of the Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs presented to the House earlier this day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the hon. member for Elk Island 
have unanimous consent of the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais:</B>   Mr. Speaker, because there is an 
impression out there that a lot of single Russian women only want 
to come to Canada for one reason, they all get painted with the 
same brush.  I found that rather disheartening because I firmly 
believe someone is innocent until proven guilty.  If someone has 
not committed a crime they should not be denied access to our 
country because they might commit a crime.  To me there must be a 
justifiable reason.  That was disappointing for me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Russia $50 Canadian is a whole lot of money.  It might not 
seem like much to us but in Russia it is a whole lot of money. It 
was about three months' salary for that person.  She applied and 
was denied and did not get her money back.  Any time there is a 
new application the money is gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another situation involved a woman from India who had to travel 
some 200 kilometres to apply to come to Canada to visit her first 
born grandchild.  Her son had been adopted out to another family

conclude her remarks and hopefully the negotiations will be 
brought to a conclusion the next time the matter is raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I was saying, there 
was a situation where a woman in India wanted to come to Canada 
to see her first grandchild.  She travelled close to 200 
kilometres to make her application only to then have it denied. 
She did not have a record so there was no reason for the denial. 
It was suggested that she would not return to India even though 
she had a husband there and they had a business.  Once again it 
was presumed that the person would commit a crime before it was 
committed.  I find that disheartening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take this opportunity to admit to those who are not aware 
that I am a grandmother.  For that reason it was especially 
upsetting for me to hear that this woman, who wanted to come and 
see her first born grandchild, was not allowed to.  Again, there 
was no reason for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know of another situation involving a young woman from China 
who wanted to visit her sister who is married to a Canadian. I am 
not sure if the woman's sister is working but the husband works 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This young woman lives on a very low income in China and I 
understand her family helped out by making sure she had enough 
money to visit Canada.  Once again, she was denied the 
opportunity to visit Canada just because she might not go back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In every case that I have seen like this it has always involved 
women.  I have seen issues relating to men wishing to come over 
but there had always been some reason why they could not come. In 
most of the cases that I have dealt with dealing with men there 
was no problem.  However, in each of the cases involving women 
there were no crimes committed but they were not allowed to come 
to Canada just in case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The gender issue has to be recognized as a problem.  I 
acknowledge that an amendment was passed that dealt with that 
issue.  I hope when I do have the chance to speak to the minister 
in more depth about these cases that we are able to sort out some 
of those issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to comment on an amendment that did not pass, which 
I was quite upset about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about another situation involving an older woman 
from India.  However at the age I am at now she is probably not 
all that much older than I am.  The woman had some problems with 
her knees.  We are all getting on and we might have a little bit 
of arthritis or something like that.  She was denied access 
because of her health problem.  As it was not a severe health 
problem, there was no justification for not letting her in. This 
was a minor health problem and she was denied entry.  The family 
was willing to sign a form saying that they would look after any 
medical costs but she was still not allowed in.  On those issues 
alone I have been extremely disappointed with the system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the 
people of Surrey Central to participate in the report stage 
debate on the motions in Group No. 2 to amend Bill C-11, an act 
respecting immigration to Canada and the granting of refugee 
protection to persons who are displaced, persecuted or in danger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the bill contains much needed changes to the Canadian 
immigration system, it also has a series of serious flaws, no 
matter what the weak Liberal government tries to tell Canadians 
about the new legislation.  It can participate in all the 
propaganda and sugar coating it wants, but Bill C-11 will not 
deliver what it intends to deliver without proper enforcement, 
management and accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier the NDP member from Winnipeg Centre spoke to the first 
group of amendments.  I do not believe he believed in what he 
said in his speech.  The lack of clarity, prudence and real 
enforcement behind the legislation, despite its wrong tone and 
content, would ultimately cause more troubles than the 
legislation it purports to replace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is far too much reliance on 89 pages of regulations to 
interpret the legislation.  Much of what is in the regulations 
could be drafted into the new legislation.  The regulations 
essentially give the minister the option of running the 
department any way that she or he sees fit.  This is not 
accountability or transparency by government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The weak Liberal government has a habit of governing not by 
legislation but by regulations.  It not only makes legislation 
undemocratic but makes it complex and opaque.  Being the past 
co-chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Scrutiny of 
Regulations I can say that with certainty.  The regulations 
cannot be debated in parliament, so I call it governing through 
the back door. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make it absolutely clear to everyone, including those who 
have taken the time to watch the debate on TV, that the Canadian 
Alliance policies are pro-immigration, but we do not want 
ineffective legislation passed in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Dauphin—Swan River, the hon. member for 
Blackstrap and I as members of the citizenship and immigration 
committee attempted to make amendments to make the legislation 
effective and workable, but the Liberals refused to co-operate. 
Most of our amendments were rejected by the Liberal dominated 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is history to indicate that the arrogant Liberal 
government will not accept most opposition amendments to any 
bill.  It has blatantly refused to accept amendments from the 
opposition to Bill C-7, the youth criminal justice act which we 
debated a few days ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 would replace the 25 year old Immigration Act, 1976. 
The previous act has been a mess.  That is why in many of the 
constituency offices of MPs major workloads are arising from 
mismanagement by the department. 
Sixty to eighty-five per cent of the resources in constituency 
offices are utilized in many ridings by immigration alone, and 
that is not fair.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have difficulty understanding why politicians have to be 
involved in visitors' visas, for example.  MPs are elected by 
Canadians and represent Canadians, not people in other countries. 
It should be the responsibility of the immigration officers 
abroad to make fair decisions, not the politicians but those 
well-trained immigration officials. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surprisingly the Liberal candidates, or even the failed 
candidates, made promises to people to get visitors' visas 
issued.  They should be immediately stopped from making any 
representations on behalf of Canadians to the immigration 
officials in our embassies and high commissions abroad. Ministers 
continue to abuse ministers' permits to oblige their Liberal 
friends for political support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this group there are four amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 5, moved by the Canadian Alliance, deals with the 
inadmissibility clause 34 of the bill.  It replaces line (d), 
“being a danger to the security of Canada” with “being a 
threat to the security of Canada as defined by section 2 of the 
Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no definition of danger or threat to the security of 
Canada in the act.  It is left to the subjective judgment. 
Therefore, this amendment is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opinion of those government agencies and officials with 
expertise in security must be heard and employed.  It should not 
be ministers or politicians who should decide on political lines. 
The decision should be made by experts, based on facts and 
logic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CSIS, RCMP and other law enforcement agencies know who is a risk 
and who is not a risk.  They should be the authority in the area, 
not the weak Liberal minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the finance minister and the international 
co-operation minister should not have attended the fundraiser by 
the organization said to be the front for Tamil tigers based on 
advice from CSIS.  That is why this weak Liberal government 
should not have ordered to shred the report called “Sidewinder” 
written by a frontline officer, Brian McAdam. He is contacted for 
advice on security issues by the United States, Australia and 
many other countries.  However, at home the Liberal 
government applied political pressure and had that report 
shredded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-11 is weak with respect to security risks.  It allows for 
front end security screening, but it only applies to refugees, 
which in some cases is a physical impossibility.  Front end 
screening does not apply to applicants in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill promises to deliver better enforcement of security 
measures for both refugee and immigrant applicants, but there is 
no plan of action set out in the bill to explain how this will 
work.  No one should be allowed into Canada without proper checks 
as to his or her risk to the security of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no provisions in the bill for improved communications 
between visa officers, law enforcement and international criminal 
investigative units.  Communication among the RCMP, CSIS and 
other international criminal investigation units should be 
mandatory and employed immediately.  The auditor general pointed 
out in his most recent report that this type of communication was 
imperative.  However, without a more open system and a far more 
communicative department, the bill will not achieve these goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen Lai Changxing, the accused kingpin smuggler, land 
in Canada through queue jumping.  He was not detected by the visa 
officer by even a simple background check.  Then there is the 
example of the fellow who came to Canada with an active case of 
tuberculosis and exposed some 1500 people to the deadly virus.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 6 was also moved by the Canadian Alliance.  It deals 
with loss of status by replacing line 1 in clause 50. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, there is no linkage between CSIS and the Department 
of Citizenship and Immigration.  Information from SIRC is 
presently not utilized.  CSIS may make mistakes which oversights 
people's rights.  The whole purpose of an appeal may be defeated 
just because of that.  SIRC reviews cases, and it is an oversight 
committee over CSIS.  It could take away power from the minister. 
Probably that is the reason why many Liberals will not support 
this.  I urge them to look at the merit of the amendment and how 
effective this will make the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motions Nos. 7 and 8 were moved by other parties.  Motion No. 7 
deals with right of appeal.  This amendment will delete some 
clauses and replace some others.  Motion No. 8 will add something 
to clause 64 that a permanent resident would be allowed to state 
his or her case before being subjected to deportation or refusal 
of entry, when CIC that saw fit to allow them into Canada in the 
first place after due processing.  These amendments are 
important.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, all 
four motions in Group No. 2 have been put forward by the 
opposition parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would love to be proven wrong and see at least one of these 
amendments supported by the Liberal majority. That is how naive 
I can be on any given Friday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first amendment is from the Canadian Alliance. This 
amendment, which we will support, clarifies the concept of 
security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reference is therefore made to the definition found in the act. 
I will not say more about this amendment, except to reiterate 
that we will support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second amendment is also from the Canadian Alliance. 
However, I do have some reservations about this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill already involves many stakeholders. Since only a few 
stays are provided for in the bill, to set up a new committee to 
examine the merits of an application to stay a removal order has 
me a bit concerned. So, we will be voting against that 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third amendment is by far the most important.

<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> I would ask the 
Conservative member to control his enthusiasm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 7 aims at reintroducing what can currently be found in 
the legislation. 
Under the present legislation, there are two stages to the 
removal of a refugee or of a permanent resident to his or her 
country of origin. The adjudication division is responsible for 
the removal order, and the appeal division reviews the 
circumstances of the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under clause 64 of the bill, the decision will be made by the 
officers, with no possibility that the case be heard by a court 
of law or an independent tribunal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone in this beautiful country recognizes the value of our 
justice system. I find it particularly troubling that a person 
would be denied the right to appeal a decision that went against 
his or her expectations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am asking in my amendment is that clause 64 of the bill 
be deleted in its entirety since it is aimed at denying a 
protected person or a permanent resident the right to appeal a 
removal order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the third amendment. 
Should that amendment be defeated, which is highly unlikely, we 
will support Motion No. 8 proposed by my colleague from the 
Conservative Party.

</I></B></P><P align=left>These days, the government of this multicultural, multilingual 
land built on immigration sounds disappointingly less welcoming 
than it should. The (immigration minister's) proposed to reform 
the 25-year-old Immigration Act, Bill C-11, falls far short of 
the standard which Canada should use in treating immigrants and 
refugees to this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Progressive Conservative opposition critic on an immigration 
committee, I sat and listened to the testimony of more than 150 
witnesses and groups who almost all repeated the very same 
serious concerns that parts of the bill were “draconian” and in 
fact even “unCanadian”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am trying to utilize the language of this aspect of the report 
today to shape where I am coming from for my motions. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of the day, the same committee members on the Liberal 
side who had heard repeated testimony across the country (at the 
clause by clause stage) voted to allow only minor alterations to 
a to the flawed bill.  While the legislation does include some 
very positive measures, such as increased fines for human 
trafficking, we should not settle for legislation that still has 
very serious problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has unleashed this series of “tough measures” 
which strip rights—including appeal rights—of permanent 
residents in Canada and removes protection from refugees, under 
the guise of making our system both fairer and faster.  That's 
where the support of this flawed piece of major legislation falls 
apart. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard commentary that the issue of the expediency of existing 
legislation is more of a matter of application of the act as 
opposed to a fault with the act itself.  I noted that members 
from the Canadian Alliance talked about the issue of enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go into the actual motions and our position on them, I 
would like to share some language from a former prime minister, 
the right hon. Brian Mulroney.  I would ask all members of the 
House to reflect on these particular words.  He once said in the 
early days of taking office: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no obligation more compelling, no duty more irresistible 
in Canada than to ensure that our minorities, linguistic and 
otherwise, live at all times in conditions of fairness and 
justice. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we allow this legislation to pass as is, including a clause 
limiting refugee claimants to one claim per lifetime regardless 
of any drastic change in circumstance, we are not fulfilling the 
promise of Canada and living up to the legacy of our 
predecessors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it extremely ironic that the party of Wilfrid Laurier, 
Pierre Elliott Trudeau and Mike Pearson, which had a legitimate 
record on immigration, is now perceived to be the party the most 
reticent to protect these—

<A NAME="LINK256">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the 
opinion of this House, the government should: (<I>a</I>) recognize 
as genocide the killing of 1.5 million innocent Armenian 
men, women and children in the period 1915 to 1923; (<I>b</I>) 
condemn the genocide of the Armenians and all other acts of 
genocide as the ultimate act of religious, racial and 
cultural intolerance; (<I>c</I>) recognize the importance of 
remembering and learning from the mistakes of history; and 
(<I>d</I>) follow the recommendations of the Third Report of the 
Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage, in the Second 
session of the 36th Parliament, regarding the establishment, 
within one year, of a research facility on genocide. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, first I would like to acknowledge the 
members of the Canadian Armenian community sitting in the 
gallery, members of the Armenian Cultural Association of Ottawa, 
His Excellency the Ambassador of the Republic of Armenia and of 
course His Excellency the Ambassador of the Republic of Turkey. 
This is not the first time these two ambassadors have come 
together.  On May 28, when we had the independence day 
celebration, the ambassador of Turkey certainly was a celebrity 
in the crowd of Armenians.  I congratulate him for attending the 
reception along with the Armenian ambassador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go further in explaining my motion, I would like to 
give a historical background of the Armenian nation.  Armenians 
have over 3,000 years of recorded history.  As a matter of fact, 
on May 16, in room 200 of the parliament buildings, the Armenian 
community celebrated the 1,700th anniversary of Christianity by 
Canada Post issuing a stamp commemorating that fantastic event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last 2,000 years or so Armenians have had four kingdoms. 
The last king died in Paris when he went to Europe seeking the 
help of Christian Europe, so to speak, for the defence of 
Armenian rights in Asia Minor.  Soon after that Armenians lost 
their independence of their kingdom in a region called 
Al-Ladhiqiyah, which is located on the northeast corner of the 
Mediterranean Sea.  From the 13th century to the 19th century 
Armenians had a good relationship, on and off, with their 
neighbours and communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in the early 1800s many Armenian intellectuals went to 
Europe to study and educate themselves further.  They went back 
to Armenia at the end of the Ottoman Empire and asked for the 
same rights for their fellow Armenians in the region that they 
had had in Europe.  The Red Sultan saw this as a threat.  As a 
result of the activities of the Armenians who were demanding 
human rights, the Red Sultan decided to initiate the first major 
massacre of the 19th century, which occurred in 1895 and 1896. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was followed, in the early stages of World War I in 1915, 
by what was known as the final solution by the party in Turkey at 
the time.  I should point out that this was before Ataturk came 
to power in the early 1920s.  As a result of the arrest of a 
group of intellectuals on April 24, 1915, Armenians were deported 
from their homeland.  They were murdered and slaughtered.  We 
acknowledge their murder and slaughter but we do not characterize 
it as genocide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Syria, in the Middle East, there is a town called Deir 
ez-Zour.  Deir ez-Zour is the Auschwitz of the Armenian nation. 
Everyone knows about Auschwitz, but few people know about Deir 
ez-Zour, and fewer people yet have been to Deir ez-Zour to see 
the ruins and the remains of the Armenian nations as they were in 
1915 to 1923. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The turning point for Armenian genocide was in 1965, the 50th 
anniversary of the genocide.  At that time, despite the fact that 
Armenia was part of the U.S.S.R., the Armenian government was 
brave enough to establish the first genocide memorial in the 
world.  That focused the attention of everyone in the world, 
especially the Armenians living in Armenia.  They go there every 
year on April 24 to pay their respects to the victims of 
genocide.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The year 1965 also happened to be a turning point in the 
diaspora for genocide activities to make sure they were 
recognized by the world community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this country in 1980 the Ontario and Quebec parliaments 
passed resolutions recognizing the genocide and asked the federal 
government to follow suit and recognize genocide.  I am glad to 
say I have been involved with this activity since 1965, that is, 
for the last 35 years.  So far our activities have been fruitless 
in this parliament and other parliaments around the world, but I 
have to admit that Armenians throughout the world are making 
progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years ago a United Nations committee recognized the 
genocide and what happened to the Armenians.  International 
bodies recognized that what happened to Armenians was genocide. 
The latest parliament to recognize the Armenian genocide was 
Italy's.  However, the most important thing at this stage is 
this:  I want to acknowledge the national assembly of France, 
both its lower and upper houses, and the president of France, Mr. 
Chirac, for France's recognition of the genocide of 1915 and for 
passing a law.  As I understand it, people cannot deny the 
genocide, just as the Holocaust cannot be denied.  People who do 
can be charged with misrepresenting history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point I would like to ask for the unanimous consent of 
the House to table documents from the French national assembly, 
the Zorian Institute and the Armenian World Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the House give its consent to 
the hon. member for Brampton Centre to table the documents? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on April 23, 1996, 
the House of Commons unanimously passed a motion that stated: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—that the House recognize, on the occasion of the 81st 
anniversary of the Armenian tragedy which claimed some 1.5 
million lives on April 24, 1915, and in recognition of other 
crimes against humanity, the week of April 20 to 27 of each year 
as the week of remembrance of the inhumanity of people toward one 
another. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion was passed unanimously in the House as a consequence 
of debate on the motion brought forward by the then Bloc 
Quebecois member of parliament for Ahuntsic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the passage of that motion in February 1999, our 
colleague from Scarborough—Agincourt brought forward a private 
member's motion asking for similar recognition.  I regret that 
the Department of Foreign Affairs came up with a totally 
unacceptable reply during that debate.  As a consequence, the 
then minister of foreign affairs, Lloyd Axworthy, asked fellow 
Liberal members of parliament to form a committee to study this 
issue.  It was more than a study.  It was to confirm the fact 
that the genocide took place.  For some reason the minister at 
the time did not see fit to call it genocide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in reply to my question in the House on June 10, 1999, 
the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Minister of Foreign Affairs I wish to inform the 
House that together with all Canadians we remember the calamity 
afflicted on the Armenian people in 1915.  This tragedy was 
committed with the intent to destroy a national group in which 
hundreds of thousands of Armenians were subject to atrocities 
which included massive deportations and massacres. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government introduced Bill C-19, an act respecting genocide, 
crimes against humanity and war crimes, which was passed by the 
House on June 13, 2000.  Subsection 6(3) defines crimes against 
humanity as intent to kill, in whole or in part, a national 
minority group.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same answer I was given by the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs.  It was defined in Bill C-19.  It also happens to be the 
same definition of genocide as the UN's.  I asked this question 
of the foreign affairs representative when I was on the foreign 
affairs committee.  How come there is that same definition of 
genocide in room 705 across the street, but in the Chamber the 
same act of destroying national minorities, in whole or in part, 
is defined as a tragedy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answer that was given, which members can see in the minutes, 
of course, was that it had nothing to do with the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs.  That gentleman could not answer my question 
about why it is that in this Chamber, destroying people in part 
or in whole is a tragedy, but across the street it is genocide. I 
am waiting for someone to give me the answer.  Maybe we could all 
rest in peace, then, if we could know why there are two standards 
in the different rooms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, the Turkish ambassador was with us on 
May 28.  He mentioned jokingly that he felt like a celebrity. 
There was a real celebrity in Toronto in the Scarborough area on 
May 25 when the Armenian General Benevolent Union, together with 
the Zorian Institute, organized a seminar.  The speaker at the 
seminar was a Turkish scholar who accepts the fact that there was 
a genocide.  He wonders when Turkey will do the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scholar mentioned four reasons why Turkey cannot join the 
European Community:  first, the treatment of national minorities, 
especially Kurds; second, the occupation of Cyprus; third, the 
Armenian genocide; and fourth, Muslim fundamentalists in Turkey 
who are getting stronger every day.  His point was that Turkey 
will have to address these four issues before it joins the 
European Union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also said that in his mind many people such as scholars and 
intellectuals in Turkish universities and research centres have 
the same feeling, but they cannot speak up because of a fear of 
retaliation from the government, like we have seen in the past 
when even members of parliament were imprisoned.  Scholars would 
be denied their chairs and funding and what have you in Turkish 
universities so that they would not be able to speak up on this 
issue.  However, with Canada being a free country the gentleman 
felt free to express his point of view.  I have to add that the 
hall was packed with 500 people who showed an interest in the 
gentleman speaking up.  That was not the first time.  There have 
been a few others in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, France recognized the genocide of the 
Armenians.  The Turkish government was of course very angry and 
upset, which could have been expected.  It was very 
disappointed and tried to cancel a contract with the French 
government.  I have asked about a dozen people to tell me the 
monetary value of the cancellation, but so far no one can.  Maybe 
there was an impact from it in the first few weeks, but I do not 
know of any dollar figure on how the French economy was damaged 
due to the fact that this recognition took place.  The Turkish 
ambassador was called back from Paris to Ankara at the beginning 
of February this year, but I understand that he is now on his way 
back to France or is about to go to France.  I think the issue is 
dead now.  There are no more problems between France and Turkey 
because of France's recognition of this genocide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we recognize it in the House, I do not think there will be 
anything big.  The House will not cave in.  World War III will 
not be declared.  It would simply be stating the historical fact 
that, yes, genocide took place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like thank the leaders of all five parties who me gave 
unanimous consent to present this issue again.  In that spirit I 
would like to ask for unanimous consent that the House accept 
Motion No. 285. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I would like some clarification from 
the hon. member for Brampton Centre.  Is he seeking unanimous 
consent of the House to agree to the motion or unanimous consent 
to make the motion votable? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is unanimous 
consent to agree to the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the hon. member for Brampton 
Centre have consent to propose the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate on the debate on the 
four elements of the private member's Motion No. 285.  I 
appreciate the sentiment, the emotion and the sense of pursuing 
research, education and remembrance, as well as learning from the 
mistakes of history, which is at the heart of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our colleague, the hon. member for Brampton Centre, did a great 
deal of work on this issue in the last parliament.  He even 
caused this matter to come before the Canadian heritage committee 
and forced the committee to issue a report.  This was no small 
feat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At my House of Commons office some weeks ago, I had a visit by a 
delegation from Canada's Armenian community that provided me with 
some information.  I also received information from the 
Federation of Canadian Turkish Associations.  I highly appreciate 
the interest expressed by both communities in the work we do as 
parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very emotional and controversial matter.  My heart 
goes out to the families, the relatives and the survivors of this 
dark era in human history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having previously spoken on a similar motion today, I rise with 
misgivings about what the Liberal government is going to do with 
this debate.  I regret I cannot be more positive in my outlook, 
but I do not want to try to fool anyone.  I do not want either 
the Turkish or the Armenian people to be hoodwinked by the weak 
Liberal government that lacks vision.  I want to be very clear 
from the outset that the government is not going to recognize the 
genocide to anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider an exchange between Brian Mulroney and the late 
Pierre Trudeau concerning the apology to Japanese Canadians for 
their internment during the second world war.  Mr. Trudeau said, 
as recorded in <I>Hansard</I>, June 29, 1984: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no way in which we can relive the history of that 
period.  In that sense, we cannot redress what was done.  We can 
express regret collectively, as we have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see how I can apologize for some historic event to 
which we or these people in this House were not a party.  We can 
regret that it happened.  But why mount to great heights of 
rhetoric in order to say that an apology is much better than an 
expression of regret?  This I cannot too well understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does Mulroney not apologize for what happened during the 
Second World War to mothers and fathers of people sitting in this 
House who went to concentration camps?  I know some of them, Mr. 
Speaker.  They were not Japanese Canadians.  They were Canadians 
of Italian or German origin, or some old French Canadians who 
went to jail, who went to concentration camps during the Second 
World War.  Why do we not apologize to them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it is the purpose of a government to right the 
past.  It cannot re-write history.  It is our purpose to be just 
in our time, and that is what we have done by bringing in the 
Charter of Rights. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 14, 1994, the Liberals' position on redress was 
articulated by Sheila Finestone, the then secretary of state for 
multiculturalism and status of women. 
She said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seeking to heal the wounds caused by the actions of previous 
governments, six ethnocultural communities have requested redress 
and compensation totalling hundreds of millions of dollars.  The 
government understands the strong feelings underlying these 
requests.  We share the desire to heal those wounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is whether the best way to do this is to attempt to 
address the past or to invest in the future.  We believe our only 
choice lies in using limited government resources to create a 
more equitable society now and a better future for generations to 
come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the government will not grant financial compensation 
for the requests made.  We believe our obligation lies in acting 
to prevent these wrongs from recurring.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This latter quote, I believe, is most significant because this 
is what the hon. member for Brampton Centre is up against.  He is 
up against his own political party on this issue.  I seriously 
doubt that he will be successful.  The apology and compensation 
package given to Japanese-Canadians has set a precedent. 
Italians and Ukrainians interned in World War I and World War II 
have also demanded apology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other communities and groups asking the 
government to redress the historical past, the wrongs done in 
history.  Let me also remind the House of another situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the political parties in the House was in power in 1914 
when 376 passengers, who were British subjects, arrived on a ship 
named Komagata Maru.  They were not allowed to land on Canadian 
soil because of an exclusionist immigration policy based on race 
and the country of origin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The policy had its origin in the 1880s, when the Canadian 
government first imposed a head tax on Chinese immigrants.  The 
government erected a variety of barriers until 1962. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The passengers on the Komagata Maru thought they had the right 
to enter Canada because they were British subjects, British 
citizens.  Ninety per cent of the passengers on the ship were 
Sikhs.  The rest were Hindus and Muslims, but they all came from 
Punjab.  Sikh soldiers who had served throughout the British 
Empire thought they should be able to work wherever the British 
flag was flying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After two months of detention in Vancouver harbour, the 
government brought in the cruiser <I>Rainbow</I> and aimed its 
guns at the Komagata Maru.  That was the first time the Canadian 
navy used the ship for aggression.  The ship was escorted with 
352 passengers still on board.  It was a bitter and disappointing 
moment for the friends watching the ship disappear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A voyage that began on April 4 did not end until September 29 in 
Calcutta, Indian, where the police opened fire and killed 19 of 
those passengers.  Others were arrested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a more tolerant Canada, the Komagata Maru remains a powerful 
symbol for Sikhs and one that should remind others of the 
historical past.  As a consequence, we are beginning to reassess 
our past.  Giving attention to the Komagata Maru is part of the 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the government offer an apology?  I do not think so. Still, 
some of the candidates of the Liberal Party in the last election 
shamelessly used all the propaganda they could without 
apologizing or redressing for their party's behaviour with 
respect to the Komagata Maru incident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How about the Chinese interns who are demanding a redress along 
with 10 or so other groups? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, the hon. member is facing unfavourable odds in terms 
of having his motion passed by the House.  He already 
acknowledged that the government, his party which governs this 
country, has double standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly the human race should recognize the importance of 
remembering and learning from the mistakes of history.  We should 
make sure that such incidents are not repeated again anywhere on 
this planet.

this is not the first time that I have risen in the House to 
talk about the Parliament of Canada recognizing the Armenian 
genocide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over 1.5 million people were killed, disappeared, in the course 
of the Armenian genocide, a deliberate act of a government which 
had decided to eliminate this population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first motion in which I participated was in 1996.  It was 
introduced by the member for Ahuntsic, Michel Daviault, and its 
purpose was the same as that of the motion today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion back then was agreed to, but the government was very 
careful to replace the word genocide with the word 
tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have now entered the third millennium.  It is perhaps time 
that the Government of Canada followed in the footsteps of many 
international parliaments and had the courage to call a genocide 
a genocide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have always been governments who have taken it upon 
themselves to wipe populations off the map.  Even here, in 1755, 
there was an attempt to wipe the Acadian people out of 
existence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It did not succeed.  It seems that, however great the desire to 
destroy, there is a life force which keeps these peoples alive 
and keeps them remembering.  They remember that destroying a 
people is like destroying a person: it is a wound from which one 
does not recover. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a sizeable Armenian community in Laval.  This is a 
community that never fails to amaze me, as its members are so 
well integrated into Quebec society, while at the same time ever 
mindful of who they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are great-grandmothers in Laval who are survivors of the 
Armenian genocide and who have transmitted to their 
grandchildren and great-grandchildren the painful knowledge that 
someone once wanted them dead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that a country like Canada, which passes itself off in 
all international forums as a champion of human rights, has a 
duty of conscience to recognize the Armenian genocide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Numerous motions have been passed, even in the Senate.  One of 
the members of the Senate has proposed a similar motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will this government have the courage to recognize the Armenian 
genocide?  I do not believe that this government lacks 
compassion.  What it does lack is the courage to differentiate 
between economic interests and values.  I believe economic 
interests are important, but I also believe that, over and above 
economic interests, values must come first.  If the economy is 
what takes precedence, we will be able to accept just about 
anything, and I do not believe that is what Canadians and 
Quebecers want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are there many countries in the world that have recognized the 
Armenian genocide? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beginning with Canada, there are two provinces that have 
recognized the Armenian genocide.  These two account for some 
60% of the total population of Canada.  Hon. members will 
realize I am speaking of Quebec and Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, 60% of the people of Canada acknowledge that the Armenian 
genocide did indeed occur and must be recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will head south a little.  In the United States, a number of 
individual states have also recognized the Armenian genocide. 
The ones close to us include New York, Massachusetts and 
Delaware.  In the centre, things are quiet.  However, it is not 
surprising to discover that California too recognizes the 
Armenian genocide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about Europe?  France, Israel, Lebanon, Russia, 
Bulgaria, Greece, Belgium and Cyprus have recognized it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In South America, Uruguay and Argentina have also recognized it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 18, 1987, the European parliament, in accordance with 
the guideline of the UN human rights commission issued two years 
previously, also recognized the Armenian genocide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am having a very hard time understanding why the Government of 
Canada is resisting what has become a matter of fact.  We may 
well be in the third millennium, but genocides will continue. 
With the speed of communications, will international society let 
peoples disappear because a government has decided they should? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the start of the 20th century, communications were much less 
sophisticated than they are now, as we know.  The Rwandan 
massacre occurred not so long ago. 
There could be other ones, whether it is in Africa or in Asia. 
Do we not have a responsibility to act as a watchdog? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Government of Canada recognizes the Armenian genocide, 
will it not send a clear message that it will never again close 
its eyes on a future genocide? We cannot change the past, but we 
can recognize that a genocide took place and we can regret that 
it happened. In the future we may have to make decisions that 
will involve the respect for individuals, nations and our 
society's values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call on all parliamentarians to begin a personal reflection on 
values such as compassion and respect for individuals. None of 
us can reject out of hand the kind of reflection that we must 
make as parliamentarians and citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us cannot be a votable item. I deeply regret 
it, but there will be other ones. I hope the next one will be a 
votable item, because I tabled one a few weeks ago, with the 
same objective: that parliament recognize the genocide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I firmly hope that this motion will be a votable item and that 
parliamentarians will stand up and tell the world that Canada no 
longer tolerates genocides, because they are totally contrary to 
the human values of equality and respect.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise to indicate my own support for Motion No. 285 and I can 
say with certainty that all members of the NDP caucus support 
this particular motion.  It contains language, the use of the 
word genocide, to describe what happened many years ago, language 
that we find acceptable, language which we would urge the 
government to adopt in its description of those same events. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also note, as have others, that many national parliaments in 
Europe have recognized the Armenian genocide.  The Bloc Quebecois 
member who just spoke I believe noted the fact that the Ontario 
and Quebec legislatures have done the same.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly we do not understand the reluctance of the Canadian 
government to recognize the Armenian genocide.  We think it would 
go a long way toward healing the hurt that the Armenian Canadian 
community feels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will speak a little later about how that hurt was aggravated 
not so long ago by the Minister of Foreign Affairs when he 
treated a question about the Armenian genocide in a very cavalier 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only do I not understand the Canadian government's 
reluctance, but I do not understand the Turkish government's 
reluctance to accept that the Armenian genocide can be called a 
genocide without having the consequences that apparently the 
Turkish government would want the Canadian government to believe 
and without having the consequences for Turkey that the Turkish 
government would want people to believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was something that was done a long time ago by the Ottoman 
empire.  I do not believe that current regimes should be held 
responsible for what happened a long time ago, unless of course 
by their reluctance to call things what they were they seem to 
assume a certain amount of responsibility in an indirect kind of 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the Turkish government to drop its defensiveness and 
realize that calling a spade a spade, calling a genocide a 
genocide, is the beginning of a process of healing and 
reconciliation which we would all like to see between the 
Armenian community and the majority community in Turkey.  This 
would be the beginning of a process which, in the end, would be 
of great benefit to their country.  I urge that particular 
perspective to be taken seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also note that not so long ago the Canadian government, with 
respect to our involvement in Kosovo, was very quick to use the 
language of genocide when it was describing the ethnic cleansing 
that was going on in that community.  It did not mind using the 
word genocide to describe what was going on and why it wanted to 
do something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why the reluctance to properly name something that went on a 
long time ago which was clearly of the nature and the magnitude 
that deserve the particular description? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sometimes said by the Turkish government that this was a 
civil war as if that excuses things.  Recently there was a civil 
war in Rwanda.  There was a struggle between the Hutu and Tutsi 
peoples.  The fact that it was a civil war did not prevent the 
international community from saying that there was a genocide in 
Rwanda.  The fact that something has the nature of a civil war 
does not mean that there are not things going on which also have 
the nature of a genocide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There may be a civil war in which many people of the same ethnic 
or national community are killed and it does not qualify.  It may 
qualify as a tragedy, a slaughter, a murder and everything else, 
but it does not qualify as a genocide.  There may also be a civil 
war in which one group seeks to exterminate the other and it does 
qualify as a genocide.  I submit the circumstances we are talking 
about warrant the use of the term genocide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally I refer to what was a very regrettable day in the House 
of Commons.  On April 25 my colleague from Burnaby—Douglas asked 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs a question with respect to the 
issue trying, as we have many times in the NDP and as have other 
members of other parties, to get the Canadian government to use 
the word genocide to acknowledge the Armenian genocide, and the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs did not even answer the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He did not even address himself to the substance of the matter 
at all.  Instead he referred to a story in the paper that day 
having to do with the participation of the hon. member for 
Burnaby—Douglas in the protest against the free trade area of 
the Americas at the summit in Quebec City.  He then made a joke 
about something that had happened at that time, something he 
should not have made a joke about anyway.  The offence was even 
further compounded in the sense that it had nothing to do with 
the question that was asked. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1410"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would be bad enough in terms of parliamentary decorum and 
procedure, and the fact that we would expect ministers to try to 
pretend that they are answering the question.  We know they often 
do not answer questions, but at least they like to appear that 
they are addressing the same topic, not the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When asked a serious question about the Armenian genocide, he 
referred to something completely different.  By so doing, he did 
not just insult the House of Commons, he insulted the Armenian 
Canadian community.  He in effect made fun of and mocked the 
concern that the member for Burnaby—Douglas expressed on their 
behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To my knowledge the Minister of Foreign Affairs has not made 
amends for that offence against the House and the Armenian 
Canadian community.  I wrote to him today calling on him to do 
so.  I hope other members would do so as well.  I certainly know 
that the Armenian National Committee of Canada wrote to him to 
express its dismay at the insult it felt on his behaviour that 
day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate could be carried on in a serious way, with serious 
arguments on both sides, although I happen to think the argument 
for using the word genocide is a much more serious and convincing 
argument, than the rather weak arguments that we sometimes get 
from the government side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, we now have an 
element introduced into the debate which is entirely unfortunate. 
The Minister of Foreign Affairs has the responsibility to clear 
this up, to admit that he made a mistake and that his partisan 
political nature got the better of him on that day when he 
responded to the member for Burnaby—Douglas in a way that he 
should not have.  That would go a long way to healing the offence 
that was committed that day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The greater offence that we speak about here today is the 
offence against the Armenian people that was committed a long 
time ago.  We say that offence was genocide and that is what the 
world should call it.  We say that would be the beginning of 
reconciliation and that the Canadian government should use that 
word sooner rather than later.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise today to talk on the private member's motion 
which is certainly an emotional one.  I commend the member for 
Brampton Centre for bringing it forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are often criticized, as members of parliament and 
politicians, that we do not do enough.  This member has done a 
great deal to speak on behalf of the members of his community, 
protect their interests and try to take steps toward healing and 
reconciliation, especially over the Armenian crisis which 
happened between 1915 and 1923. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is obviously deeply committed to this cause.  I met with him 
yesterday to talk about it, because I was not that familiar with 
the issue.  I wanted to get some direction from him.  He spoke 
strongly about healing and reconciliation, and how the 
recognition that it was genocide would be a step in that 
direction.  I commend him for moving the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also commend him for his recent involvement with establishing 
a national stamp in recognition of the Armenians.  This is 
entirely unique.  No one can say that the member is not earning 
his keep and doing his job.  I have great respect for him and the 
approach he takes to all his causes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously the events between 1915 and 1923 were terrible and 
horrifying, resulting in the deaths of millions of people. 
Certainly the Armenian people suffered greatly and more than 
anyone else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party is abhorred by any mass 
slaughter or killings, or anything that could be termed genocide 
by any country or any group, be it Rwanda or Europe.  It is 
important that we remember these issues, and this is exactly what 
the motion has us all doing today.  By discussing it, it will 
maintain public awareness to maybe help the healing process and 
reconciliation just by the fact that we have had this debate.

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot go back and relive the era, or change it or change the 
results.  It is just a fact.  However, there are things in this 
motion that we totally agree with, and anybody could agree with 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One part of the motion is that we condemn acts of genocide as 
the ultimate act of religious, racial and cultural intolerance. I 
am sure that every single member of the House would agree to 
that, even though the motion to pass it unanimously was just 
turned down.  This section and another section certainly would be 
to recognize the importance of remembering and learning the 
mistakes of history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is part of what we are doing here today; remembering some 
of the mistakes of history and talking about them.  Not all 
parties agree exactly on the circumstances between 1915 and 1923. 
We are here to talk about them.  Many of us, myself included, 
have learned a great deal from the debate.  It is motions and 
activities like this that will help us remember them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has the responsibility to voice the 
Canadian human rights standards around the world and to take 
these questions seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Winnipeg—Transcona mentioned earlier that the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs did not treat a question about this 
very serious issue with a great deal of respect.  I too urge the 
minister to rectify that.  It is not his usual practice to treat 
issues like that.  Perhaps it was a moment of political weakness 
or something like that, when he disregarded the question 
presented to him.  In my experience with the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs that is not the way he would consider issues of human 
rights and issues like this.  I hope he will correct it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to commend the member for his persistence in his ongoing 
efforts and initiatives to support his Armenian causes and the 
Armenian community.  He has done a great job.  We admire him for 
very much for that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK261"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin—Middlesex—London, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is my honour to speak today in the House of Commons. 
Let me say from the beginning, whether we use the words calamity 
or genocide, we should acknowledge that the government does take 
this issue extremely seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the hon. member for expressing his views on the 
events that took place affecting the Armenian people from 1914 to 
1925.  I congratulate the hon. member for Brampton Centre on 
bringing this matter to the attention of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada acknowledges and deplores the fact that many Armenians 
and others lost their lives in wars that marked the end of the 
Ottoman Empire.  Millions were forcefully displaced under 
terrible conditions, a situation that led to a large number of 
deaths and caused indescribable suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We sympathize with these Armenian victims and with their 
descendants, many of whom have chosen to make a new life in 
Canada.  Canada opened its doors to many displaced people during 
and after that period.  We will continue our traditional practice 
of giving humanitarian assistance to victims of conflicts in this 
new century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following extensive consultation, the Government of Canada's 
position on these events was articulated by the hon. member for 
Halton on behalf of the Minister of Foreign Affairs in a June 10, 
1999 statement to this Chamber.  At that time the hon. member for 
Halton said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—we remember the calamity afflicted on the Armenian people in 
1915.  This tragedy was committed with the intent to destroy a 
national group in which hundreds of thousands of Armenians were 
subject to atrocities which included massive deportations and 
massacres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May the memory of this period contribute to healing wounds as 
well as to reconciliation of present day nations and communities 
and remind us all of our collective duty to work together toward 
world peace— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our remembrance of this calamity and the suffering of the 
Armenian people has not, and will not, change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The theme of reconciliation mentioned in the hon. member's 
statement is one that bears repeating.  The world looks to Canada 
as a nation where people from diverse backgrounds can live 
together in peace.  Individuals from every conceivable nation and 
ethnic group make up our country, and we have learned to respect 
each other's culture, religion, race and ethnicity.  We are 
therefore able to empathize with the pain of those Canadians who 
have at one time been victimized by bigotry and oppression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our experience as a nation of many peoples also enables us to 
understand the importance of moving forward, while remembering 
the lessons of the past.  At home this means joining together, no 
matter what our background, to ensure that bigotry and prejudice 
are not tolerated.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Every jurisdiction in Canada has enforceable human rights 
legislation designed to combat discrimination in areas such as 
employment, accommodation and the provision of goods and 
services.  This legislation is important, but legislation alone 
is not enough.  It must go hand in hand with a respect for the 
unique human dignity of every individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our diversity is also one of the country's greatest assets.  The 
strong foundation it provides has allowed us to build a Canada 
that is vigorous and dynamic, a Canada which has been rated 
consistently by the United Nations as one of the best places to 
live in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Internationally, our heritage allows us to help lead the way 
toward a safer and more peaceful world.  We can speak with 
credibility on the need to protect people from threats to their 
rights, their safety and their lives.  We can fight for the 
creation of an international criminal court and know we will be 
listened to.  We can sponsor a campaign to fight the scourge of 
land mines and feel confident that we will be heard.  We can 
stand up in international fora, such as the United Nations, and 
talk about the need for people from different backgrounds to live 
together in peace with the knowledge that we speak from

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am very pleased to rise in the House and add to the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a great deal of empathy for what the member is doing, 
since this also has to do with the history of my family.  I 
suppose I cannot expect everyone to have heard everything I have 
said in the House, but I have made reference to this before.  For 
those who have heard it before, I apologize for the repetition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only two generations prior to me my family suffered direct 
persecution, mostly because of religious reasons in what my 
grandmother always called the old country.  Several of my 
grandfather's brothers were killed.  Criminals came into the 
villages at night and shot men and older boys who were able to 
fight.  Because they were participants in the revolution, they 
were considered to be enemies of the revolution and were 
therefore killed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have great concern about the fact that we should not in any 
way minimize the magnitude of that type of human behaviour, where 
people with guns and power ride roughshod over very basic rights, 
even the rights to human life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of our family history, we have had what I would call 
a privilege and an honour of having our son work in some of the 
wartorn parts of the world, including Rwanda.  He has told us 
stories about some of the horrendous atrocities that took place 
there, including the atrocities against children.  The stories 
are beyond imagination.  It is almost evil to even think of some 
of the things they did, let alone acknowledge that these things 
happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my support of what the member is saying, I believe it is so 
important for us to raise awareness of the fact that human beings 
are capable of doing these things to other human beings. 
Hopefully by increasing that awareness, we will somehow increase 
the level of conscience that would prevent people from doing 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know in this case the member is speaking of the Armenian 
people.  What happened to them happened to a number of other 
racial and religious groups around the world.  Indeed, it 
continues even to this day.  I believe Canada should be one of 
the primary players or interveners in stopping these activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is little doubt in my mind that we are not doing anywhere 
near what we could or should be doing.  I know we have limited 
resources, but we ought to be involved, not only in the 
prevention, education and awareness side, but when it comes to 
sending in our peacekeepers to stop this kind of activity.

Speaker, I take this opportunity to thank all members who joined 
in the debate, especially those who expressed themselves in a 
positive way.  I did not hear anybody objecting to it, but I 
cannot say the support was 1,000%.  However I am quite happy with 
the content of the speeches delivered in the Chamber regarding 
Motion No. 285. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read a message the Armenian community received on April 
24 from the Prime Minister.  The message stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am honoured to extend my sincere greetings to all those 
participating in the activities commemorating the 86th 
anniversary of the calamity suffered by the Armenian community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians recognize and deplore the demise of such a large 
number of Armenians during the turmoil of the First World War and 
its aftermath.  Many survivors subsequently immigrated to Canada, 
and the contributions they and their children have made to Canada 
has greatly enriched our country.  Let us thus be reminded how 
important it is to work together to eliminate intolerance and 
fanaticism wherever it appears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Please accept my very best wishes. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was signed by the Prime Minister of Canada.  This is exactly 
what the Canadian Armenian community is asking for.  Victims and 
survivors of the genocide and their children need a simple 
recognition that yes, a genocide took place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I admit it happened in the last century.  It happened 86 years 
ago in a place far away.  However the Armenian genocide is the 
only genocide of the last century that has not been officially 
recognized as a genocide.  Being the first, we would think people 
would recognize it in order to set an example for others from 
which to learn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even Adolf Hitler said “After all, who remembers the atrocities 
of the Armenians and who shall remember what happened in World 
War II to other minorities?”  I regret that we did not learn 
from history.  It was repeated from 1939 to 1945.  It has been 
repeated since then in many parts of the world: Bosnia, the 
Balkans, Africa, Cambodia, all over the world.  Someone gave me a 
figure that in the last century 95 million people died as a 
result of crimes against humanity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically my point is that 93.5 million were recognized and 1.5 
million were left out.  I have no answer when people ask me why 
that is so, why everybody is recognized except the Armenian 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one point on one day we as representatives of the people of 
Canada must collectively come together to give the answer.  We 
must set history right for future generations so that we can say 
proudly that the House spoke to the issue, spoke unanimously and 
spoke the truth without being revisionist and without changing 
history as it was in 1915. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said in my speech earlier, Deir ez-Zour is the Auschwitz of 
the Armenian people.  I have been there and I hope members will 
get a chance to go to Syria and visit Deir ez-Zour so they will 
recall the conversations we have had in the House today and in 
previous years.  I was hoping we would put an end to it today, 
but we will continue.  We look forward to co-operation and to 
working together with the Republic of Armenia and the Republic of 
Turkey.  After all, these two countries are neighbours and must 
live together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My feeling was that Canada could play a positive role, but 
without a recognition of genocide by Turkey and the G-7 countries 
we cannot go forward and ask these countries to totally forget 
the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Armenians are prepared to forgive.  However in order for one to 
forgive, someone must ask for forgiveness.  We must go forward 
from there.  Mr. Speaker, if one is to ask for it, this is the 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank everyone for joining in the debate.  I hope we continue 
the discussion after we leave this place, because we did not come 
to a conclusion.  However I think it was a good exercise.  I 
congratulate everyone for joining in and debating the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The time provided for the 
consideration of private members' business has now expired.  As 
the motion has not been designated as a votable item, the order 
is dropped from the order paper.

next, at 11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
