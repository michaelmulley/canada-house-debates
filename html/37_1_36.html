<P><A NAME="LINK3"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order. Last week, as a parliamentarian, I asked the House 
of Commons to make a correction to what is commonly called the blues. 
These are the preliminary transcription of what is said here in the 
House and sometimes corrections are made to it, sometimes not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had asked for a correction. 
Mr. Luc Bélanger and Mrs. Louise Brazeau, an editor, pointed out 
to me that the correction I was asking for could change the 
meaning of what I had said in the House and that the only way to 
make corrections was to listen to the recording in order to see 
whether a word or expression makes no sense the way it is 
written down.  The purpose is to make the record of what was 
said as faithful as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only corrections that can be made are to improve the quality 
of the English or French as the case may be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In connection with this, I commented to House Services that I 
had often had the impression in the past that substantial 
changes had been made to <I>Hansard</I>, far more substantial ones than 
what I was asking for. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1105"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT2"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT2"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1105
<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They swore that was not the case, that all changes were 
from the tapes and that never would the editor in 
question looking at a potential change decide to alter the 
meaning of remarks expressed here in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I advised the transcription group that I would be watching 
the operations of the service very carefully, given that I had 
been treated unfairly compared with what I had seen done in the 
past.  I did not have to wait long to see that there was a double 
standard at least in this service of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would draw your attention to what the Prime Minister said in 
the House on March 21, 2001.  In what are called the blues, 
the Prime Minister said, and I quote “We had no financial 
interest in that company in November 1993”.  That was the 
statement and it was very clear.  It was limpid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In <I>Hansard</I>, we find: 
“Mr. Speaker, we did not have shares in that company since 
November 1993”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know under what authority the editor responsible for 
this or the head of the editing group changed “We had no 
financial interest” to “We did not have shares”.  It is 
substantially different. 
The sentence was in perfectly good French and at no time was 
any correction whatsoever of the form necessary, as is clear 
from the blues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the corrected version the meaning has changed.  Why?  One 
might think that someone from the Prime Minister's Office had 
stepped in, because that is how things are done, and requested 
that the House editors change the substance, not the form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why, when the Bloc Quebecois House leader asks for 
a verb tense to be changed, is he told that it is impossible, 
that it is too great a shift, that it changes the meaning?  Why 
are requests from the Prime Minister's Office treated differently 
than requests from the office of the Bloc Quebecois House 
leader? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the first point I would like you to clear up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to have to conclude that if the Prime Minister's 
Office requested a change between what the Prime Minister said and the official 
House <I>Hansard</I>, it is because that office had a special interest, 
and what was that interest?  It resorted to what amounted to a 
coverup of an answer given by the Prime Minister.  Why did the 
Prime Minister feel the need to make a substantial change in the 
statement he made here in the House from “intérêt financier” 
or “financial interest” to “parts” or “shares”.  The two 
things are completely different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I therefore ask you to take my point of order into 
account.  I think my parliamentary privilege has been 
somehow breached.  I think the editors have not behaved 
appropriately.  I think the influence of the Prime 
Minister's Office is so pervasive that it has managed to change 
the editing service's rules for handling our requests. 
Ultimately we will sort this out with the Prime 
Minister in oral question period. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> The question asked by the hon. member for 
Roberval is very specific. I will inquire to determine if other 
members, whether it is the Prime Minister or another member of 
parliament, are treated differently than the hon. member for 
Roberval. I believe the question is properly put.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope to be able to provide the House with an answer after 
looking into the matter, but we must now proceed to the 
consideration of private members' business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member for Roberval have another question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, obviously I would like the 
Chair to see whether the change was actually made. That is one 
thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like the Chair to rule on whether the Prime 
Minister's Office had the right to ask for such a change. Why is 
a change of this nature rejected when it is asked by the 
opposition but accepted when it is from the Prime Minister's 
Office?  Is there a special relationship? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> I understood all of that in the question put by the 
hon. member. I indicated that the difference of treatment, if 
that is the word in French, can be explained if there is indeed 
a difference, and that I will get back to the House on this 
issue. In my opinion, it is not necessary at this point to hear 
other members on this issue. This is an issue raised by the hon. 
member because of the way he was treated. I will inquire and I 
will get back to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B> It being 11.12 a.m., the House 
will now proceed to the consideration of private members'

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont—Petite-Patrie, BQ):</B>moved: 
<A NAME="LINK8">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should show 
leadership on the international stage: (<I>a</I>) by taking action 
designed to increase the number of signatory countries to the 
Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child 
Abduction; (<I>b</I>) by signing bilateral treaties that include 
commitments to respect custody and access orders as originally 
handed down by the courts; and (<I>c</I>) by taking the necessary steps 
within its own borders to combat international child abduction. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker, it is with considerable joy as well as 
considerable emotion that I rise to speak to Motion no. 219 which I 
am introducing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I am aware that it is not traditional to do so, I would 
like to begin by thanking the standing committee on private 
members' business, not only for allowing debate on this matter 
today but for making it possible for members to express 
themselves clearly in a vote that will be held very shortly in 
the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will touch on a number of aspects relating to international 
abduction, beginning with a general picture of the present 
situation both internationally and in Canada. 
I will also list some of the programs developed by the Missing 
Children's Registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, I will speak about the convention on the rights of the 
child, an international convention containing a number of 
provisions aimed at combatting the illegal transport of 
children.  In my opinion, this is something a number of 
countries should take into consideration if we are to expand the 
fight against international child abduction so that it is not 
merely a Canadian effort but an international one as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will also be speaking about the Hague convention on the civil 
aspects of international child abduction, which has been signed 
by 54 countries. Unfortunately, too few countries have signed it 
at this point.  Unfortunately too, it has certain flaws 
which need to be addressed if located children are to be 
returned to their country of origin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will also speak to the matter of bilateral agreements. In many 
cases, even if the international conventions have not been 
signed, particularly the hague convention on the civil aspects 
of international child abduction, a certain number of countries 
have entered into bilateral agreements. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1115"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to parents who are victims of child abduction, we 
will take a look at just how the conventions are applied to see 
whether parents can find an appropriate way to recover their 
child as a result of the signing of these agreements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will also look at the question of measures to be taken within 
Canada.  It is not just a matter of showing diplomatic and 
international leadership on this issue, Canada must show 
leadership at home, within its own borders, in order to fight 
international abduction of children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will set out a number of appropriate measures Canada could 
consider and act on in order to fight this major scourge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will mention a number of recommendations appearing in a report 
drafted by the standing house sub committee on foreign affairs in 
April 1998 when the House considered the entire question and 
proposed a number of recommendations.  In my opinion, the 
government should have between 1998 and today noted the report 
and come up with a number of solutions and measures to fight 
this scourge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I will note that the fifth special commission on the 
Hague convention on the international abduction of children is 
being held from March 22 to 28.  The Minister of Foreign Affairs 
should have been in attendance at this commission in our opinion 
in order to improve various aspects and measures of the 
convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the motion I have tabled today, which will be 
debated, demands that the federal government exercise some 
leadership in order to increase the number of countries that are 
signatories to the Hague convention on the civil aspects of 
international child abduction.  It calls on Canada to sign 
bilateral treaties that include commitments to respect custody 
and access orders as originally handed down by the courts. 
Finally, it demands that the federal government take the 
necessary steps within its own borders to combat international 
child abduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only am I very pleased to speak to this motion today as a 
parliamentarian but from a personal point of view this debate 
also gives me the hope of seeing a fundamental issue finally 
resolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On January 17, 1993, my spouse's son, Karim, of whom she had 
legal custody for a few years, was abducted. He was three years 
old at the time. The father, a Canadian of Egyptian origin, took 
advantage of a Sunday outing with his young son to abduct him 
and take him to his native country. That was the beginning of a 
long process involving three lawyers and high legal fees, but 
above all, it was the beginning of a sad human and family drama 
that is still unresolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada for 1999 alone it is estimated that 358 children 
were abducted by their father or mother, according to the number 
of cases reported to the Missing Children's Registry. Half of 
that number were the subject of a custody order from the court. 
In Canada, under our criminal code, such an offence carries a 
sentence of 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, however, the belief that abduction is the most 
serious violation of a child's rights is not yet widespread. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Hague convention on the civil aspects of international child 
abduction, the only multilateral instrument against 
international child abduction, which came into force on December 
1, 1983, has been signed or ratified by only 54 countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to protect the interests of children, each signatory 
country agrees to respect custody arrangements made under the 
laws of other countries and to return an abducted child to his 
or her legal guardian in the country where he or she resided 
before the abduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members must know, however, that the geographical scope of this 
convention is very limited since no country under Muslim law has 
signed it yet. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1120"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT5"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT5"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1120

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would seem that Muslim laws and religious customs 
establishing the rights of parents and the influence of the 
family are the main obstacles to middle eastern countries 
signing the Hague convention.  For instance, by law in Egypt, 
the child of a Muslim father must observe Islamic religious 
practices and a mother must be married to the father of her 
child for reasons of morality.  In addition, Islamic countries 
apparently do not see the family as consisting of two equal 
partners, both with an equal right to access to their child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only recourse for parents whose children have been abducted 
are bilateral treaties with countries that are not signatories 
to the Hague convention, negotiations which could be conducted 
between countries and which could result in the conclusion of 
provisions similar to the convention.  In this connection, it 
should be pointed out that Canada has signed a repatriation 
treaty with Egypt.  Unlike the convention, this treaty is not 
binding and contains no obligation to comply with the custody 
and access order handed down by the initial court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada must therefore show leadership on the international and 
diplomatic stage so as to increase the number of signatory 
countries to the Hague convention, and negotiate bilateral 
treaties with non-signatory countries by imposing legal 
obligations for the return of children to the country in which 
they resided before being abducted. 
In addition, Canada must take immediate measures within its own 
borders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that three year old Karim was allowed out of the country 
with his father, who did not have custody of the child, without 
the permission of his mother, who had a court order?  What sort 
of document check was carried out, particularly with respect to 
the production of a passport for a child?  Did customs officials 
and airline personnel have the required authority and training 
to prevent such a situation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is estimated that there have been approximately 200 cases 
where customs officials have suspected that a child was being 
abducted but were unable to stop the presumed abductors because 
they did not have the authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fight against international child abduction is first and 
foremost a fight for the right of children and for the love of 
their parents. The solutions require the Canadian government to 
show international and diplomatic leadership and to foster 
close co-operation between the solicitor general, the Canadian 
Association of Chiefs of Police and the provincial ministers 
responsible for law enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, this is a general picture of what we are 
experiencing here in Canada. Moreover, we know that, in 
1988 the solicitor general and the government created the 
Missing Children's Registry. 
The primary roles and objectives of this registry, along with a 
program entitled our missing children, are to intercept and 
rescue children who have disappeared, have been abducted and 
have crossed international borders to publish lookout notices 
at the borders, and to install placards of missing children at 
all Canadian border crossings. This organization also provides 
training to the personnel of law enforcement bodies and of other 
services, such as airline companies, so that child abductors can 
be found out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mandate and role of the Missing Children's Registry and of 
the related program did not achieve the results anticipated. The 
time has come to be more rigorous in the training provided to 
civil aviation staff.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come to give more powers to customs officers. They 
must not merely monitor the importation and exportation of 
goods. They must also ensure that children do not leave the 
country without the previous authorization of both parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I referred to the mandate of the Missing Children's Registry. 
The mandate is even broader. The registry must also help, if 
necessary, all police forces during their investigations on 
missing children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When victim parents appeared before the standing committee on 
foreign affairs in 1988, many of them told us that even though 
complaints were made to local police stations, it took more that 
24 hours before an investigation was opened. It is important to 
realize that the first hours, the first days, the first minutes 
are the most important if we want to find the child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot wait 24 hours after a parent makes a complaint to his 
or her local police station to open an investigation. The 
protocol established for police has to be stronger and stricter to 
ensure that an investigation is undertaken in the first hours 
after a complaint is received and that the Missing Children's 
Registry officials and Interpol are informed. 
If the abductor is no longer in Canada, we should be able to 
station Interpol officers at various U.S. border crossings, if 
necessary, to anticipate the return of the child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that the protocol has to be strengthened, and of 
course that has to be done in co-operation with the RCMP, the 
Sûreté du Québec and municipal police forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the registry's mandate is to check the Canadian Police 
Information Centre's file, also called the missing persons 
computerized system, to give more information or follow up on 
missing children investigations, as needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be more effective and better if customs officials 
had in their possession all the information on the custody 
order? If they saw that there was a custody order from a court 
and that a parent who did not have the custody of the child was 
trying to leave the country, that person could be arrested 
before boarding a plane belonging to a foreign airline. We 
should never forget that from the moment that the abductor 
parent and the child are inside the plane of a foreign airline 
company, there is nothing more we can do, even if the plane is 
still on Canadian territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Customs officials have a crucial role to play in the 
identification of abductors. They must be provided will all the 
means to do their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, Quebec acts as the central authority in that regard, 
under the convention on the civil aspects of international child 
abduction. 
Quebec is responsible for the implementation of the convention. 
As I said, the administrative law branch of the justice 
department of Quebec acts as the central authority responsible 
for the implementation of the convention on the civil aspects of 
international child abduction, which helps to locate and 
repatriate children who are illegally taken to a foreign country 
by a parent.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what is presently done in Canada, in Quebec we can 
identify, and this is easily accessible on the website of the 
Department of Justice, countries where abducted children have 
been taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was one of the requirements made repeatedly to the House 
subcommittee on foreign affairs by organizations, namely The 
Missing Children's Network Canada, which come to the assistance 
of parents whose children have been abducted. They asked that a 
national register of children abducted in Canada be established 
to facilitate their identification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot help but note there is no such registry available that 
would allow us to intervene. As we know, Quebec has 
one. For example, we know of a number of cases in the United 
States, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Switzerland, 
Venezuela, Zimbabwe as well as in Egypt. We know that a number 
of children have been abducted and taken illegally into these 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It might be high time we had a national registry, as requested 
by the groups that appeared in March 1998 before the House of 
Commons standing committee on foreign affairs, and by others as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must also know what the terms and conditions of the convention 
are. It is not that simple. Before one's case can be examined 
under the Hague convention on the civil aspects of international 
child abduction, a number of conditions must be met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out a number of points I have brought 
forward but I want to remind the House that the fifth meeting 
of the special commission on the operation of the Hague 
convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction 
is being held from March 22 to 28. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 5, I asked the foreign affairs minister to take part in 
that meeting. Unfortunately, we cannot help but notice that the 
minister will not participate. I think it would have allowed the 
government to show leadership at the diplomatic level, as my 
motion is calling for today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish that all members of parliament could vote for this 
motion, which essentially calls for action, as I said earlier, 
for the defence of children rights and for the love of their 
parents. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Marcel Proulx (Hull—Aylmer, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to support Motion No. 219. International child abduction is 
a tragic phenomenon that affects too many Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion calls on the Government of Canada to show leadership 
on this issue on the international stage. This is what Canada is 
already doing. Indeed, for many years the Government of Canada 
has been leading the efforts globally to find effective ways to 
prevent and solve international child abduction cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian approach toward child abduction has always been to 
ensure that children's best interests are a priority. The Hague 
convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction 
was drafted some 20 years ago and became a reality through 
Canada's efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a long time, Canada's priority has been to prevent 
international child abduction cases, whenever possible, and to 
find solutions when abductions happen. In the great majority of 
cases, these situations happen during or after the parents' 
breaking up, particularly when one parent or both have close 
family ties with another country whom they are citizens from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Twenty years ago, Canada started negotiations that led to the 
drafting of the Hague convention on the civil aspects of 
international child abduction. The Hague convention came into 
force on December 1, 1983. Canada is still the first among those 
who are trying to broaden the application of the Hague 
convention, the only multilateral instrument providing for 
effective assistance to children who are victims of transborder 
abductions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the objective and guiding principle of the Hague 
convention, the child's interests are best served by him 
returning promptly to his normal or regular country of 
residence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1983, when the Hague convention came into force, only three 
countries signed it, including Canada.  Thanks to pressure 
by the foreign affairs department, more than 65 states are now 
signatories of the convention and that number is likely to 
grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Hague convention is the only international agreement that 
one can refer to when dealing with international child 
abduction. 
Its accomplishments are impressive, and the commitment to make 
it work and to increase the number of signatory states remains 
one of the most important and constant priorities of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Hague convention puts the interests of children first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade published a report entitled “International 
Child Abduction: Issues for Reform.”  In that document, the 
committee recommended that Canada continue to promote the Hague 
convention and to increase the number of signatory states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government's reaction to the recommendations was 
positive. The Minister of Foreign Affairs stepped up his efforts 
and approaches to many countries in order to set forth the 
benefits of the Hague convention. 
Representations have been made internationally, especially with 
several nations in Asia-Pacific, Africa, Latin America and the 
Middle East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, a team of officials of the foreign affairs and 
justice departments went to Vietnam in late February for 
bilateral consultations. Among the subjects discussed were the 
benefits of the Hague convention. Canada urged Vietnam to 
consider signing the convention and offered important practical 
advice on the implementation of the convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same kind of initiative was taken several times in many 
countries throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has a leadership role in the preparation of the fourth 
special commission on the Hague convention on the civil aspects 
of international child abduction. This meeting will be the most 
important international operational review since the convention 
came into effect. Many options have been suggested. The 
international consensus is that the best option to prevent and 
remedy the problem of international child abduction is to abide 
by the Hague convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But we know that all countries party to the convention do not 
always implement it as it should be. 
Procedural delays, non-compliance with court orders to return 
children, contradictory domestic legislation and legal 
interpretations not always in accordance with the Hague 
convention are some of the problems that can arise when 
proceedings are taken in other countries under the Hague 
convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To  maintain the confidence of the international community in 
the Hague convention, member states must commit to fully uphold 
their obligations under the convention. To promote a cohesive 
interpretation of the convention, the justice minister will hand 
out a $15,000 grant to the Hague child project in order to set 
up a data bank where will be stored legal decisions pursuant to 
the Hague convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth special commission will be a crucial meeting where 
decisions on how to better implement and enforce the Hague 
convention will be made. Canada is sending to this meeting a 
huge multidisciplinary team: representatives of the foreign 
affairs and justice departments, provincial delegates in charge 
of implementing the convention and judges who have to apply the 
convention.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a world leader in promoting the goals of the Hague 
convention. We do everything we can to increase the number of 
signatories to the convention. In fact, we are taking all 
appropriate measures to make the Hague convention more 
efficient, to help the Canadian families of children who have 
been abducted and to ensure that abducted Canadian children are 
returned to Canada safe and sound. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With your permission, I will now examine the question of 
bilateral treaties respecting custody and access.  Canadian 
consular authorities have growing responsibilities in the area 
of family matters, including the abduction of children by the 
father or mother and other types of matters where the wellbeing 
of Canadian families travelling or residing abroad is a source 
of concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This increased volume of family matters requiring consular 
assistance is due in part to the increased numbers of Canadians 
with dual citizenship and the high mobility of Canadians and 
Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Encouraging countries to sign the Hague convention on the civil 
aspects of international child abduction remains Canada's method 
of choice in managing cases of child abduction. 
However, given the concerns raised by the Hague convention in 
many countries in the middle east, where Shariah family law is 
in effect, Canada has negotiated innovative bilateral agreements 
that constitute an effective way of dealing with such cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As cases of international child abduction are not covered by 
official agreements, they can drag on, be hard to settle and 
become bilateral irritants.  Parents are separated from their 
children, and children are taken away from familiar 
surroundings.  The parents of a family in conflict try turning 
to the justice system of one country in order to establish 
living conditions or terms of custody of members of the family 
that live usually in another country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>International child abduction is a crime. 
Canada has put comprehensive and effective measures in place to 
fight this phenomenon.  However, cases of abduction continue. 
The Government of Canada is determined to find new ways to 
prevent and resolve cases of child abduction.  We must all work 
on this objective. It is in the best interest of our children.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Vic Toews (Provencher, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak today in support of the motion put 
forward by my colleague from the Bloc, the hon. member for 
Rosemont—Petite-Patrie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In introducing the motion, my colleague has raised an important 
issue that few will disagree should remain a priority for the 
House, that is, the protection and best interest of the children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many years the international community has recognized the 
need for countries to co-operate in order to remedy child custody 
and abduction problems.  In 1976 the Hague convention on private 
international law accepted a Canadian proposal to alleviate some 
of these problems.  This proposal led to the Hague convention on 
the civil aspects of international child abduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objectives of the convention are:  first, to secure the 
prompt return of a child wrongfully removed to or retained in any 
contracting state; and, second, to ensure that the rights of 
custody and access of one contracting state are effectively 
respected in the other contracting states. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a leader in these negotiations, Canada was the second country 
to ratify the convention which came into force in December 1983. 
To date, 53 countries, including Canada, have adopted the 
convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Department of Foreign Affairs and International 
Trade, over 300 Canadian children have been returned under the 
convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the convention is supported in principle by a number of 
countries and has been relatively successful in achieving its 
aims, some recent reports say that we are not doing enough.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report stated that although it: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—was a giant step forward in dealing with cases of international 
child abduction in a more uniform, consistent way...in too many 
cases, the Hague Convention appears not to be working as 
originally intended, and too many cases remain unresolved. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some problems cited were: a lack of systematic data; wide 
variations in outcome and interpretation; undue delay in reaching 
resolutions; lack of public awareness; and lack of enforceability 
of return orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government has not been entirely oblivious to these 
problems.  The government's 1998 response to a committee report 
reviews 14 recommendations that address similar issues relating 
to the Hague convention, as well as domestic issues pertaining to 
child custody issues and abduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the committee's recommendations are similar, if not 
identical, to the provision of today's motion, although it 
remains to be seen what action the government has taken to 
implement the recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue must not be left unresolved.  Now that it has come up 
again in the House, we must find real solutions and initiate 
concrete action on behalf of children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us consider the first provision of the motion that calls on 
the House to take action designed to increase the number of 
signatory countries to the Hague convention on civil aspects of 
international child abduction.  There is no question how 
absolutely crucial this is.  The convention can only be effective 
insofar as other nations are willing both to participate and to 
enforce once they have signed on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of Europe and North America, as well as Australia and New 
Zealand, have signed on.  However only five African nations are 
signatories.  In Asia and the Middle East there are six, and in 
South America there are seven. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulties in increasing the number of signatory countries 
are many.  In particular, the laws of some Middle Eastern and 
African nations may make international co-operation on the matter 
more complex, especially in terms of parental abductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many middle eastern and African countries, as my colleague 
from the Bloc pointed out, the father's permission is often 
required for his children to leave that country.  The father will 
often have ultimate custody, despite the fact that the child may 
have dual citizenship in Canada or another country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bearing that in mind, it may be difficult to persuade countries 
with such laws to subscribe to or subject themselves to these 
principles.  In taking any steps one must obviously bear that in 
mind.  As my colleague from the Bloc has stated, Canada needs to 
show leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the difficulties, we must step up our efforts to 
persuade other nations that it is in their interest to co-operate 
to protect children both at home and abroad.  It has often been 
said that it takes a village to raise a child.  In this case, it 
will take all nations of the world working together to ensure 
that children's rights are secured and protected and that parents 
do not need to live in fear for their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second provision, to sign bilateral treaties that include 
commitments to respect custody and access orders as originally 
handed down by the courts, is extremely vital.  If we cannot 
persuade non-signatory countries to sign on to the convention, we 
must continue to negotiate bilateral treaties with those 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third and last provision of the motion is to take the 
necessary steps within our own borders to combat international 
child abduction.  Of course, any international initiative must 
and should begin at home.  Authorities, such as the solicitor 
general, the RCMP, the police associations and provincial and 
territorial ministers, should work closely together to develop a 
policy instructing police officers to report suspected child 
abductors to the missing children's registry.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All missing children reports should automatically be entered 
into the Canadian Police Information Centre, CPIC.  Although this 
already occurs to some extent, our missing children's registry is 
nowhere near as extensive as it should be in order to be truly 
effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within our own borders, child custody and abduction problems are 
extremely serious.  Outside our borders, however, we have almost 
no control over what happens once a child is abducted.  This must 
change if we are to give Canadian children the level of security 
and protection they are entitled to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, I would ask that all members vote in favour of the 
motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to speak to the motion today.  I compliment the 
hon. member for bringing it forth.  He has a long track record of 
dealing with issues that concern young people in Canada and 
around the world.  He deserves a lot of credit and recognition 
for his work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious to all members that young people are our most 
precious resource and that child abduction is reprehensible. 
Whether a child is abducted by a parent who does not have custody 
or by someone else, using children to accomplish one's own 
purposes is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We compliment the member for his work.  He has a long track 
record of bringing up issues with respect to young people and 
children.  He has taken an avid interest in adoption laws, 
especially issues surrounding immigration and international 
adoptions.  My party supports the motion and will be behind it 
all the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Hague convention on the civil aspects of international child 
abduction signed in 1983 was a multilateral treaty to protect 
children from the harmful effects of parental abduction and 
retention across international borders and boundaries.  The 
convention provides a procedure for attempting to bring about the 
prompt return of children.  Sixty-five countries have already 
signed the treaty, including Monaco, Canada, Ireland, Great 
Britain, France and the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The convention is one of three signed at the Hague with the aim 
of protecting children.  We think the motion, if successful and 
turned into policy by the government, would enhance and increase 
the protection provided by the convention.  That is one 
reason we support the motion and feel that it should be done 
through The Hague process.  The motion, if passed, would 
certainly ensure the rights of custody and protect children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Hague convention applies to children under the age of 16. 
How can children under 16 look after themselves if they do not 
have protection or a choice of where to go if someone abducts 
them?  The convention is certainly appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a parent believes a child has been removed or retained in 
breach of their custody rights, they can apply to a central 
authority under the convention.  The convention also details some 
exceptions to returning the child to his or her home state.  For 
example, if in returning the child it could cause further harm, 
then the child may be able to remain in the new state, which is 
again appropriate.  There is flexibility in the convention to 
protect children no matter what the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To facilitate the return of children, the Permanent Bureau of 
The Hague Conference on Private International Law has established 
the international child abduction database which makes accessible 
all judicial decisions taken around the world on the abduction 
convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 219 by the Bloc has three parts, and we support them 
all.  One, the federal government should take action to increase 
the number of signatory countries to the hague convention on the 
civil aspects of international child abduction. Sixty-five 
countries are signatories at present, and that is not enough.  We 
would certainly like to see more countries sign on. The federal 
government should take the initiative on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the wake of the fatal car crash in Ottawa involving a Russian 
diplomat, I have risen in the House on several occasions and 
asked the minister of foreign affairs to initiate a dialogue on 
changing the Vienna convention with respect to diplomatic 
immunity.  Although we brought it up time and time again, the 
government shows no interest in taking that initiative.  The same 
type of initiative could be taken with respect to the motion to 
bring more countries under The Hague convention. 
The government has an obligation to act and should act.  I hope 
it acts in both these cases.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part of the motion says that the federal government 
should show leadership 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—by signing bilateral treaties that include commitments to 
respect custody and access orders as originally handed down by 
the courts; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such treaties would be as important as the overall convention, 
and more powerful in many cases, because they would involve one 
country dealing directly with another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the federal government can show leadership by taking 
steps within its own borders to combat international child 
abduction.  The government can never do enough to protect 
children, yet its record leaves something to be desired.  More 
children live in poverty now than 12 years ago when the House 
passed a motion to eradicate child poverty by the year 2000. 
Years after the motion to eradicate child poverty, the government 
has still not addressed the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Liberal speeches from the throne, children's issues are 
mentioned.  However I am not sure anything concrete has been 
accomplished or that any tangible action has been taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party has been concerned with this issue for many years. 
When we were in power we spearheaded the missing children 
initiative.  In May 1980, before the convention was signed, a 
former colleague of mine, Mr. Benno Friesen, member for 
Surrey—White Rock—North Delta, tabled a private member's bill 
dealing with parental abduction and custody matters.  He had 
introduced it in 1976.  The bill received the support of the 
government of the day and its wording was quite close to that of 
government bills introduced in 1978. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote Mr. Friesen from <I>Hansard</I> in December 1980, 21 
years ago. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had many representations received in my office regarding 
this type of case.  These are cases involving virtually helpless 
parents who have had their children snatched from them by the 
other parent, usually, but not always, the father.  The parent 
with custody granted by the court becomes a helpless 
victim...There seems to be no elementary or emotional security 
for these children in their formative years.  They sometimes 
become scarred for life through such an experience. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was said in the House over 20 years ago and still applies 
today.  I mention it to show that was the case even before the 
Canada treaty entered into force on December 1, 1983. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party takes the issue very 
seriously.  Because of this, we support the motion and 
congratulate the hon. member for bringing it forth. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK12"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carole-Marie Allard (Laval East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, thank 
you for giving me the opportunity to speak to Motion no. 219, 
which deals with international child abduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's record in solving cases of international child 
abduction by the father or the mother is well known not only 
here but worldwide. Let us not forget that in countries that 
are not party to the Hague convention child abductions are 
treated on a case by case basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the desired outcome is generally the same, namely 
bringing the child or children back to Canada, each case must be 
dealt with based on its own particularities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main obstacles to the child's return may be related to the 
following: the relationship between the father and the mother 
and other close relatives; the marital status of the parents; 
the gender of the child or of the parent seeking the return of 
the child; family law and the religious system in the foreign 
country where the child is; and the nationality of the parents 
or of the abducted children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consular affairs bureau, which has a vast experience in 
dealing with child abduction cases in countries that are not 
party to the Hague convention, has succeeded in securing the 
return of children from foreign countries, including 
middle eastern countries such as Lebanon, Egypt, Kuwait, Syria 
and Iran. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These past few years the department has managed to reunite more 
than 30 children taken to non-signatory countries with their 
parents who had legal custody in Canada. 
No other country with a similar incidence of child abduction by 
the father or the mother has such a high success rate. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1200"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consular affairs bureau works in close co-operation with 
other agencies, particularly with the partners involved in the 
our missing children program, namely the passport office, the 
RCMP, Customs Canada and Immigration Canada. The high degree of 
co-operation between these bodies plays a critical role when 
disappeared or missing children must be rescued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there is no single or easy solution leading to success, 
some measures have, in a number of cases, helped the return of 
children, or helped maintain contact between children and the 
Canadian parent left behind. The measures taken by Canadian 
police forces to lay criminal charges against the parent who 
abducts a child are important ones. International search and 
rescue activities conducted abroad by police forces can be 
greatly facilitated when criminal charges are laid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there are the measures to maintain or facilitate contact 
and communication between the abducting parent, the children 
abducted and the parent left behind. Except for our consular 
agents, parents who are left behind often have no one to turn to 
in order to get information on their children and to maintain 
contact with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to these efforts, consular agents have managed to 
negotiate visiting rights for the parents left behind. Visiting 
rights can be essential to preserving the relationship between 
children and the Canadian parent during the years that it may 
take to settle such cases. These rights are also important to 
restore confidence between the parents, which can sometimes lead 
to a voluntary return of children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Patience also comes into play. Some cases were settled years 
after the abduction and in rare cases the abducted child 
sought consular assistance to come back to Canada when he was 
old enough to do so on his own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there are the representations made to foreign authorities. 
Consular agents contact authorities in foreign countries and 
closely co-operate with them to settle these cases. 
Since most countries that have not signed the Hague convention 
share with the signatories the desire to reduce the incidence of 
international child abduction, they are always disposed to 
support and discuss these cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other countries frequently find ways to help us, within the 
limitations of their own systems.  This approach has, for 
instance, been used by the Canadian department to negotiate two 
bilateral agreements with Egypt and Lebanon in order to 
facilitate the settlement of cases of children that have been 
abducted and taken to these countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the Hague convention, the bilateral agreements do not 
include any mandatory provisions relating to the return of 
abducted children. 
These agreements are not intended to replace the Hague 
convention, which is still the preferred means for handling 
international abduction cases, but they are one of the outcomes 
of the constructive co-operation shown by the governments of 
Egypt and Lebanon in consular affairs with the Government of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These agreements provide an official framework at the diplomatic 
level for discussion and information sharing on specific 
consular matters, including cases relating to child abduction 
and child custody.  The agreements set up joint advisory 
commissions comprised of representatives of the Egyptian or 
Lebanese departments of foreign affairs, justice and the 
interior, and representatives of the Department of Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade and of the RCMP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These bilateral agreements constitute a new approach that has 
been adopted by the Government of Canada to overcome the 
difficulties presented by international child abduction cases.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, far too many children are being abducted by 
parent.  When children are taken to other countries, the 
mechanisms that can be used to obtain their return to Canada are 
imperfect in that they depend, of necessity, on co-ordination 
between different national legal systems.  This is why the 
Government of Canada has put in place the most exhaustive 
measures even taken by any government to help the victims of 
international child abduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The challenge we must face, which reflects the commitment we 
have made to the public, consists in making these programs and 
interventions still more effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has always urged other countries to be party to the Hague 
convention which remains, as I said before, the only 
international instrument that can be used to prevent and solve 
international child abductions by fathers or mothers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, Canada is number one with regard to international efforts 
to ensure that the Hague convention is properly implemented by 
other countries. As mentioned by the member for Hull—Aylmer, 
Canada will be represented at the special commission which meets 
in March 2001 to have a look at the structure of the convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New supplementary agreements have been concluded, for example 
the 1996 Hague convention on protection of children. Canada 
provides significant assistance to Canadian parents who are 
dealing with abductions to countries where the Hague convention 
does not apply, always to ensure that the child is returned to 
Canada safe and sound. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To solve the problem of international child abductions by 
fathers or mothers, the government has come up with several 
measures, including bilateral conventions and agreements. I 
would even add that what Canada is doing now goes further than 
the proposals included in the Bloc Quebecois's motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of these initiatives have already been endorsed by the 
Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade, 
for instance, the 1998 report entitled “International Child 
Abduction: Issues for Reform”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that all these initiatives show that 
the Government of Canada has for some time made determined 
efforts to find ways to prevent international child abductions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK13"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is with pleasure that I support the motion moved by the 
member for Rosemont—Petite-Patrie.  This is something that I 
would have preferred we not have to do but, in the past five 
years almost 300 children in Canada have been abducted by a 
foreigner, which also shows that we have considerable difficulty 
recovering these children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened closely to the debate and followed the issue, since 
my colleague brought it to the public's attention.  Often 
refuge is taken behind the fact that there are agreements, 
conventions and so forth.  It is all very fine and well to sign 
agreements and conventions, but some means of enforcing them is 
also necessary.  That is the problem we are facing.  There is 
little that can actually be done to get these children back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Rosemont—Petite-Patrie knows whereof he speaks 
because his spouse went through such a situation. 
I believe he is probably the member of this House who knows 
the most about this sort of situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that the Liberal Party member seems more 
inclined to recite his briefing notes.  Furthermore, I wish to 
point out to him that this is not a Bloc Quebecois motion but a 
motion by a member which is being debated under private members' 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure all Bloc Quebecois members and most, if not all, 
other members of the House will be pleased to support the member 
for Rosemont—Petite-Patrie, so that measures are much more 
effective than they are right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened carefully to my colleague earlier when he said that 
from the outset people often have to wait too long before 
action is taken. 
Not only must the federal government take action but the police 
must also review the way they operate and there must be 
co-operation in the exchange of information.  Customs officials 
must also play a key role and their authority should be 
increased.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, we talked about measures as simple as issuing 
passports to children. There are very concrete actions. The 
rules could be tightened so that we would have an increased 
intervention capability that would help us prevent such 
incredible human tragedy where a parent is separated from his or 
her child. I do not need to make a long speech on this issue 
because everyone is aware of the negative and disruptive 
consequences that has on the child, on the parents and on the 
community. It is a human tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If only we could take measures limiting such tragedies because 
when we hear about a case in particular, we feel that it is very 
exceptional. 
I was very surprised to learn that there were around 60 
cases a year, on average. When I said that there were close 
to 300 cases in the last five years, it was way too much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have enough time to speak in detail to each of the 
measures. My colleague has done a much better job dealing with the issue. 
I invite all members to unanimously support the motion. 
I invite the government to go beyond statements of 
principle and to take measures that have more teeth than what 
we now have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate my colleague from 
Rosemont—Petite-Patrie and I assure him of my support, as no 
doubt all members of parliament will. 
Not everyone will get to speak but everyone will get the

important motion.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>SECOND READING 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 14 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-7, an act in respect of criminal justice for young 
persons and to amend and repeal other acts, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for 
Yorkton—Melville. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to rise today to speak to the legislation.  If the 
people out in the real world were listening earlier today, they 
would have noticed that time allocation has been forced on the 
House in regard to Bill C-7, a matter which is a foremost problem 
faced by myself, as a member of parliament, as it is I am sure 
for many other members in the House, since coming here in 1993. 
We are talking about the Young Offenders Act.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us just take a look at this.  For well over seven years the 
government has been working on or promising to introduce new 
legislation with regard to the Young Offenders Act.  For over 
seven years it has worked on this problem and this is the best it 
could come up with.  It has come up with a piece of legislation 
that absolutely does not address many areas of concern that out 
there in the public when it comes to young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only our party but other parties in the House were involved 
in committee hearings that went on across Canada.  We listened to 
different people and had witnesses come in with regard to this 
piece of legislation, yet the government has just about totally 
ignored most of these recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A government's first and foremost responsibility be to any 
country and to any of its citizens has to be safety and 
well-being.  That should be the foremost responsibility of any 
government.  This piece of legislation does not come anywhere 
close to addressing that.  We have a habit in this country of 
saying that children and our young people are precious gifts, 
which they are.  They are also our responsibility, not only in 
regard to their safety and well-being but their spiritual, 
physical and mental well-being.  That is our duty, as elected 
representatives, to them, to parents and to the rest of our 
citizens:  to try to protect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we have pieces of legislation such as this that are 
supposed to address the problems in our country facing young 
people today and when we go out and speak in schools, I listen to 
the young people in the schools and they tell me that the Young 
Offenders Act is a joke, a laugh.  These are young people who 
themselves are concerned about going to school, concerned about 
gang violence, concerned about losing their own personal property 
through theft or concerned about intimidation by their peers, by 
other young people.  When we ask them about the penalties that 
can be imposed, they look at what has happened in our court 
system and start to laugh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing out there to deter these young people—and 
there are a few of them but not a majority of them—out there 
committing these types of crimes.  They look upon our judicial 
system and how we handle them as a joke and, when we go through 
it all, it is a joke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the Young Offenders Act was incorporated, the violent acts 
of crime by youth have increased 100%.  That statistic alone 
should tell the government that there is something wrong with the 
legislation it has been introducing in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we hear people saying that the young offenders legislation 
should start taking in people from the age of 10 and up, we 
should be listening to them.  Instead, we turn away from them. 
The government has been told this by every party in the House 
except the Bloc, and even its own members agreed to this in 
committee, and yet in this piece of legislation it has refused to 
address this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that all crimes committed by young offenders 
should be treated in that strict a manner.  When we look at 
diversion or extrajudicial measures, which have been brought up, 
we see that they have been quite successful.  For those who do 
not know what that is, it is merely a program whereby the accused 
young offender admits guilt and agrees to be dealt with in an 
informal manner through some form of community based committee. 
The committee may be made up of citizens of the community, if the 
accused and perhaps the victim are so inclined. The committee 
will talk over the case.  The accused gets to acknowledge the 
damage and decides how best to show remorse and so on.  Community 
service may be decided on.  An apology may be written.  The 
offender may either pay the victim for the damages or work off 
the damages by assisting the victim in some other manner.  By 
successfully completing the program, the accused avoids a 
criminal record, which is good, and hopefully the community is 
satisfied with having been involved and with seeing how and why 
certain decisions were made.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all good, but the legislation was supposed to be for 
first time non-violent offenders.  Yet this piece of legislation 
is not limited to first time non-violent offenders.  That is why 
it is open to abuse.  There has to be concern about that.  There 
are some positive steps in the legislation, but it is extremely 
unfortunate that for the small steps it has taken forward there 
are still large loopholes left.  Therefore we in our party cannot 
support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberal members come to us and ask us why we cannot support it, 
telling us to look at the good in it, but when we look at it, it 
is like asking us to pay the full price for a loaf of bread that 
is three-quarters rotten in order to get four good slices.  It is 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet when amendments come forward from other parties in the House 
they are totally disregarded.  Instead of standing here and 
debating it, when a person can stand and talk for 20 minutes or a 
half hour and really get into the root causes, we are told there 
is time allocation on it.  Our real concerns are not addressed. 
We do not have time for proper debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at clause 2 regarding definitions.  A 
non-violent offence means an offence that does not cause or 
create a substantial risk of causing bodily harm.  Non-violence 
would appear to include:  drug offences such as trafficking; 
theft, including car theft; break and enter; perhaps even sexual 
touching; possession of child pornography; and fraud, just to 
name a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important definition because for these types of 
offences offenders will likely avoid custody.  In fact it is also 
presumed that extrajudicial measures are sufficient and they will 
not even gain a criminal record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to wonder what is going on here.  Presumptive offences 
include only five offences:  first degree murder, second degree 
murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, and aggravated assault. 
That includes serious violent offences for which an adult can be 
sentenced to imprisonment for more than two years, if at the time 
of the offence committed by the young person there have been at 
least two previous judicial proceedings where the judge has made 
a judicial determination that offences were serious violent 
offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at that we realize that the list does not include 
violent crimes in which a firearm has been used or sexual assault 
with a firearm or even a knife.  These can be quite traumatic to 
the victim, yet they are not included.  Why? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We leave these pieces of legislation open to interpretation and 
we all know what happens when we allow the courts to start 
interpreting what we are supposed to be doing here.  We run into 
a bigger mess than we already have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although there are some good parts to the legislation, much more 
has to be done before it would be a viable piece of legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
we have been saying all along, the Bloc Quebecois is totally 
against the bill introduced by the justice minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot agree to the rigid model she is proposing, because her 
bill goes against the values shared by all the people in Quebec 
and everyone working with children at risk. The government is 
ignoring years of efforts to implement programs to help young 
people facing violence in their daily lives. We are not about to 
backtrack on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is looking backwards by taking 
unnecessarily repressive measures without proposing acceptable 
alternatives to its strong action. To supervise and to punish 
seems to be the underlying principle of the bill but what 
about preventing and addressing the problems of our youth? The 
question remains unanswered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite what the justice minister says, what makes a bill good 
or bad has nothing to do with the government being reelected 
but rather with the bill being in touch with reality. The 
minister is ignoring Quebec's experience in this area. By 
turning young people into criminals, she is rejecting the Quebec 
model and its proven success based on rehabilitating young 
offenders. 
In doing that, she is compromising an effective approach in 
favour of considerations on which there is no consensus.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the minister being so hard on our young people who 
need to be supported and guided rather than punished? Why does 
she want to send our young people to crime school, which is what 
prison is? Why deprive them of any hope? Does she want to ruin 
their chances of getting back on the right track? Does she want 
to take away their future? These are the goals pursued by the 
Minister of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can a government get swept up in such a piece of 
legislation, the severity of which is totally pointless? 
According to recent statistics showing a drop in violent crimes 
in Canada, such an attitude on the part of the minister, which 
she insists on keeping despite all opposition, is absolutely 
unjustified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our young people should have a chance to tackle life with more 
confidence, with proper guidance and supervision, but the 
government wants to do the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill opens the door to consequences that the government has 
yet to measure. Young people, gobbled up by this repressive 
system, will find themselves with their backs to the wall, with 
no choice but to try to survive in the prison environment. Can 
we believe that the measures contained in the bill would really 
have a deterrent effect? Does the minister truly hope to do 
society a great service by treating this way young people in 
trouble? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are being pushed too far. They are left to fend for 
themselves. What other result can we expect but to turn these 
young people into future criminals? We must denounce the bill, 
which was drafted mainly to satisfy a visceral need for revenge 
which, in the long run, will do more harm than good to our 
justice system and, more to the point, to our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have repeatedly denounced all this during the many 
discussions and debates we have had regarding the bill. 
Despite our repeated representations, despite the statistics on 
youth crime—Quebec has the lowest youth crime rate in 
Canada—despite negative comments from people in the field, 
despite the success of the Quebec model, the government keeps on 
turning a deaf ear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice minister, confined in her ivory tower, has chosen to 
attack the bill's opponents instead of showing its possible 
benefits, which everyone is still trying to detect. The warning 
issued to the minister by the Bloc Quebecois failed to make her 
see the light, so strong is her determination to legislate at 
all cost in this field. We remain convinced that this 
legislation ignores Quebec's expertise in the matter and 
destroys everything that has been accomplished over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The implementation of this new legislation would create more 
problems than it would solve. We would have to start again from 
square one and rebuild from a basis whose future efficiency is 
doubtful. What the Minister is proposing is nothing short of a 
radical change in philosophy. Nothing justifies tightening up 
the current act, which has a proven track record and, I repeat, 
has produced the expected results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has failed to take into account the criticisms, the 
objections and, more important, the arguments presented to 
her. She has come up with a bill nearly identical to the one she 
introduced in the last parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few changes here and there—in the French version, the term 
“infliger” in relation to sentences becomes “imposer”, a 
fundamental nuance if there was ever one—some of the wording may 
be slightly different, a few scattered sentences, this is the 
kind of frivolous changes the minister has the nerve to call 
improvements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot see any significant change, any change of direction, 
any notable redesign, which means that the minister has not seen 
fit to rethink her bill in the light of everything that has been 
said or written on the matter. Her bill is based on a lack of 
maturity and the denial of principles dear to a majority of 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's reputation for tolerance, compassion and good judgement 
will not survive this new image that the minister is trying to

</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that the way that the government wants to go? Does it want to 
erode its reputation on the international scene by choosing a 
repressive approach over a preventive one? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois refuses to go down this path of an eye for an 
eye, a tooth for a tooth, and would rather rely on the law as it 
is applied in Quebec which, together with adequate resources and 
programs, is the best tool to solve the problems that the 
minister's bill claims to be resolving.

</I></B></P><P align=left>No, we will not go for this because, in its current form and in 
light of the actions taken, the system is achieving the desired 
results. These actions are not dependent on interest groups, but 
on needs this bill is not addressing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the minister not accept the arguments of all the 
stakeholders concerned? Does she not take their expertise into 
consideration? If she insists on going about it the wrong way, 
she will have to shoulder the blame for destroying something 
that is working well. She will have only herself to blame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I want to underline that the Bloc is still vigorously 
opposed to a bill that does not respect the public consensus in 
Quebec. 
The minister must not let the bill be used to promote the 
hateful agenda of a small number of people. I would advise her 
to re-examine her position and to think a little longer about the 
impacts of the bill on Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that, since it does not seem that the 
minister will let herself be guided by reason but by futile 
impulses, there is no doubt that she will go ahead as she has 
said she will in the last few days. She should at least consider 
giving Quebec an exemption allowing it to continue with the act 
as it is right now. I doubt that the minister will have enough 
goodwill and good faith to satisfy this demand, considering what 
she recently said on the Bloc and which all my colleagues and I 
still remember.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Pierrette Venne:</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly do read the bills 
before making any comments about them. I can even tell the House 
that I attended the hearings of the Standing Committee on 
Justice, where several witnesses, experts and lawyers, told me 
how incomprehensible this bill is. They told me that even 
lawyers who read their fair share of such legal documents all 
agree that people in the legal profession would have a tough 
time understanding this piece of legislation. Can you imagine 
how tough then it is for people who are not really used to this 
kind of legalese—which could be the case of the member opposite—to 
understand this bill? As far as I am concerned, I stand behind 
what I have said.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like her to tell us who are these serious stakeholders 
who have spoken out against the bill. I would be interested in

</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the Barreau du Québec appeared as a witness. We also 
heard from all the groups that are directly involved in this 
field. We heard from Cécile Toutant, a well known criminology 
professor at the Université de Montréal. She came to tell us how 
this bill would be harmful to our young people and that we 
should continue to apply the law as it is in Quebec. I think 
that was a unanimous opinion in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the member opposite has not heard those views but I think 
she will have the opportunity to hear them when the bill reaches

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
should like to address some deeply disturbing comments that were 
made when the bill was last before the House at second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard many comments from the benches opposite about the 
need for decorum and restraint in the House.  The line of 
parliamentary respectability was crossed when the member for 
Berthier—Montcalm singled out a particular official of the 
Department of Justice and attacked the individual personally. 
Perhaps he may not agree with the point of view of the 
individual, but he should not denigrate those who cannot stand in 
this place to defend themselves.  It lowers the level of debate 
in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member's arguments are so compelling against Bill C-7 on 
substance, let these arguments stand on their own.  His views 
should be considered on their own value.  We do not need to 
debase this place with personal recriminations.  The member for 
Berthier-Montcalm made comments that were extremely 
unparliamentary and the individual targeted had no opportunity to 
rebut those allegations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now address the youth criminal justice act.  One may ask 
why we need a new youth justice legislation?  The youth justice 
system under the Young Offenders Act is not working as well as it 
should for Canadians.  Too many young people are charged and 
often incarcerated with questionable results.  Procedural 
protections for young people are not adequate and too many youth 
end up serving custodial sentences with adults. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The overarching principles are unclear and conflicting.  There 
are disparities and unfairness in youth sentencing. Interventions 
are not appropriately targeted to the seriousness of the 
offences.  They are not adequately meaningful for individual 
offenders and victims or adequately supportive of rehabilitation 
and reintegration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed youth criminal justice act attempts to address 
these fundamental flaws.  First, with regard to targeting 
responses of the youth justice system to the seriousness of the 
offence, Canada's failure to target the most serious 
interventions to the most serious crimes has resulted in one of 
the highest youth incarceration rates in the world.  The proposed 
law would provide a statutory framework through principles, 
presumption, new sentencing and front end options, so that 
serious violent offenders are treated seriously and constructive 
measures are available for the vast majority of less serious 
offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The presumption in favour of an adult sentence for the offences 
of murder, attempted murder, manslaughter and aggravated sexual 
assault has been expanded to include repeat serious violent 
offences.  While an adult sentence could be applied to youth 14 
years old and above under the Young Offenders Act, the 
presumptions would now apply to them as well unless a province or 
territory opts for a higher age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Privacy protections currently do not apply to youth receiving 
adult sentences, and this would be continued.  Where a youth is 
convicted of one of the most serious presumptive offences and 
receives a youth sentence rather than an adult sentence, the 
privacy protections would not apply unless the judge ruled 
otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Enhanced options for police and crown discretion at the front 
end, together with statutory presumptions about when the formal 
court process and custody are not be used, will lead to 
meaningful, effective and faster resolutions of the majority of 
less serious offending behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The overall effect of this targeted youth justice system should 
be fewer young people being put through the formal justice system 
and receiving custody sentences for less serious offences and an 
overall reduction in our youth custody rates. 
It would also clarify the principles of the youth justice system.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed youth criminal justice act sets out the purpose of 
the youth justice system through its principles.  Unlike the 
Young Offenders Act, the principles of the new bill would provide 
clear direction, establish structure for the application of 
principles and thereby resolve inconsistencies.  The new 
principles would reinforce that the criminal justice system for 
youth is different from the one for adults.  It emphasizes 
preventing crime, ensuring meaningful consequences for offending 
behaviour, and rehabilitating and reintegrating the young person 
as the ways it would contribute to the protection of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would ensure fairness and proportionality in sentencing. The 
sentencing principles in the proposed law would provide a clear, 
consistent and coherent code for youth sentences.  They are 
intended to reduce disparity and reflect a fundamentally fairer 
approach to sentencing.  Unlike the Young Offenders Act, the new 
legislation states that the purpose of sentencing is to hold a 
young person accountable for the offence committed by imposing 
meaningful consequences and promoting the rehabilitation and 
reintegration of the young person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To reverse the current unfairness, the new law would provide 
that the punishment imposed on a young person must not be greater 
than what would be appropriate for an adult in similar 
circumstances. Given the significant disparity between what 
similarly situated youth receive for similar offences, principles 
of proportionality among youth sentences are included in the new 
legislation. Proportionality sets the framework or limits within 
which the needs of the young person committing the offence are to 
be addressed through the criminal justice system to achieve 
rehabilitation and reintegration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would respect and protect rights.  The Young Offenders Act 
does not adequately respect the rights of young people.  It would 
provide that a youth could be transferred to an adult court 
before conviction and lose age appropriate due process 
protections including privacy protections on the basis of an 
unproven charge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transfer proceedings have lasted as long as two years, which 
impedes access to a speedy trial.  Once transferred into the 
adult stream, youth as young as 14 could be required to serve 
their sentences in adult provincial or federal correctional 
facilities at the discretion of the judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed law would address these shortcomings by providing 
that all the proceedings against a youth take place in the youth 
court where age appropriate due process protections apply.  The 
hearing on the appropriateness of an adult sentence would only 
occur after a finding of guilt and all the evidence about the 
offence had been heard. The youth justice procedure for the most 
serious offences would be speedier, retain age appropriate due 
process protection and be more respectful of the presumption of 
innocence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-7 also includes the presumption that if under 18 a youth 
would serve an adult sentence in a youth facility. This is more 
consistent with the spirit of the United Nations convention on 
the rights of the child, which is expressly referenced in the 
preamble of the new legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would enable meaningful consequences aimed at rehabilitation. 
While youth may know that their behaviour is wrong, they may not 
fully understand the nature and consequences of their acts for 
themselves and for others.  Some young people lack the structure, 
guidance and support in their communities needed to change 
behavioural patterns and overcome damaging influences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the new provisions in the proposed youth criminal 
justice act would allow for individualized interventions that 
instruct the youth.  Police, crowns and judges would be given 
statutory authority to warn and caution young people that their 
behaviour was not acceptable and more serious consequences may 
follow if they repeat that behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conferencing is encouraged at many stages of the process, which 
could allow the young person to be a participant in a process 
with victims, family members and others to learn about the 
consequences of his or her behaviour and to develop ways to make 
amends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The range of sentencing options would be expanded.  In addition 
to sentences that allow the young person to attempt to repair 
some of the harm caused through restitution, compensation, 
community service orders, there would also be new sentences that 
provide for close supervision and support in the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changed behaviour in the community is key to addressing youth 
crime.  These sentences include attendance orders, intensive 
support, supervision orders, and deferred custody and supervision 
orders.  The proposed law would also provide a new sentence for 
the most violent and troubled youth stressing rehabilitation and 
support.  It is a serious commitment to the protection of society 
by making every effort to stop the recurrence of the most violent 
youth conduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would support reintegration after custody.  A major flaw of 
the Young Offenders Act is that it currently does not provide 
sufficient provisions for a safe, graduated reintegration into 
the community.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed law would include provisions to assist a young 
person's reintegration into the community, which protects the 
public by guarding against further crime.  It would provide that 
periods of incarceration will be followed by periods of 
supervision in the community through custody and supervision 
orders.  To ensure truth in sentencing and clarity for the young 
person, at the time of imposing a sentence, the judge would state 
in open court the portion of time that was to be served in 
custody and the portion to be served in the community.  Breaching 
conditions of the community supervision could result in the youth 
being returned to custody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Studies demonstrate that treatment is more effective if 
delivered in the community instead of in custody.  The 
reintegration provisions encourage continuity between the custody 
and the community portions of the sentence through increased 
reintegration planning, which takes into account the youth's 
needs throughout the whole sentence and, through reintegration, 
leaves for specific purposes of up to 30 days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would encourage an inclusive approach to youth crime. The 
youth justice system under the Young Offenders Act has been 
criticized for not appropriately involving victims, parents, 
family, community and representatives from other disciplines. 
Youth crime is often a complex phenomenon.  Involving others can 
improve understanding and provide support for the victims, 
youths, families and communities in responding constructively and 
meaningfully to the offending behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed law specifically encourages conferences at many 
stages of the proceedings, including those involving the police, 
sentencing judges and provincial directors.  Some conferences may 
involve bringing together professionals such as child care 
workers, school psychologists or others who are already involved 
with the youth to seek advice and verify continuity of services. 
Others may be in the nature of sentencing circles or family group 
conferences involving victims, offenders and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed law would also expand the possible mandates of 
youth justice committees.  These are committees of citizens who 
can assist in any aspect of the administration of the act or in 
any program or service for young people.  They can encourage 
community members and agencies to take an active role in 
supporting constructive resolutions to the victims, families, 
youth and others implicated by youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed youth criminal justice act corrects fundamental 
weaknesses of the Young Offenders Act and will result in a fair 
and more effective youth justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the time left, I would like to comment on some of the 
specific provisions of the bill as they relate to the publication 
of names.  This is a contentious element of youth justice policy, 
with some arguing for publication in all cases and some opposing 
it in all cases.  Some argue the public needs to know who the 
criminals are in order to protect itself from them.  They argue 
protection of society requires the press to publish the names of 
all those who commit an offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before accepting the argument, we should also ask ourselves how 
much additional protection society gets from the publication of 
names of adults.  Unless we know the person named, or the case is 
of such importance that it is in the paper for weeks or months, 
do we pay much attention when we read in the paper the name of a 
person prosecuted for or found guilty of a particular offence? I 
am not sure we do.  In most cases, a few minutes after reading 
it, we have already forgotten the name.  This hardly can be a 
factor contributing to the protection of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another argument against the ban of publication of names is that 
it is contrary to an open justice system and to the freedom of 
the press.  It is important to emphasize that the youth justice 
system is an open justice system.  Members of the public can 
attend and the press can report every detail of the case and the 
rendering of justice, except for information which would identify 
the youth.  I am sure that we all recognize that freedom of the 
press is an important element of a free and democratic society. 
It should only be limited by law and in a reasonable manner that 
can be justified in a free and democratic society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current legislation governing young offenders, the Young 
Offenders Act, prohibits publication in all cases where the youth 
is dealt with in the youth system.  The provisions prohibiting 
publication were challenged almost as soon as the Young Offenders 
Act came into force.  The courts have decided that the provisions 
were a reasonable limitation on the freedom of the press and 
therefore valid legislation.  The courts came to that conclusion 
because they recognized that the rehabilitation of the youth was 
an important enough societal objective to require balancing the 
right to the freedom of the press with this objective 
rehabilitation of the youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new legislation would continue to allow publication of 
offenders' names in all cases where a youth was sentenced to an 
adult penalty.  It would also continue to protect the names of 
the great majority of youth who commit offences and are sentenced 
to a youth penalty.  It will be an offence to publish their names 
even after they became adults, unless the youth court considers 
them to fall under two very exceptional circumstances.  First, if 
a youth is charged with a serious offence and is considered 
dangerous at large and publication is necessary to apprehend the 
youth, then the case publication would be allowed for five days.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the youth has asked to be able to publish and the court 
is convinced it would be in the best interests of the youth to 
publish information about his or her experience with the youth 
criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the first case the judge will authorize the police to publish 
for five days the name of the youth wanted.  In the second case 
the judge will authorize the youth who asked permission to do so 
to publish information or cause the information to be published 
on his or her being dealt with in the criminal justice system. 
Once the youth has made the information public it is no longer 
protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the proposed legislation the presumption in favour of 
privacy would not apply to a very small category of youth who 
receive youth sentences.  The names of youth who would be given a 
youth sentence for a presumptive office of murder, attempted 
murder, manslaughter, aggravated sexual assault or repeat violent 
offences could be published unless the judge prohibits 
publication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth court judge would prohibit publication in two 
instances.  First, when the youth or the crown applied for a 
publication ban and the judge considers it appropriate in light 
of the importance of rehabilitating the youth in the public 
interest.  Second, when the crown gave notice that even though it 
was a presumptive offence, the crown would not seek an adult 
penalty.  The crown would do so when it was convinced that the 
circumstances of the offence or of the offender did not warrant 
an adult penalty.  In that case the judge would impose a youth 
penalty would prohibit publication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation would not only protect the privacy of young 
offenders but also prohibit publication of names of youth who 
were victims of young offenders, and the names of youth who were 
witnesses in a young person's trial.  The youth victim or witness 
could only publish information on their role in the criminal 
justice system when they became an adult, with the permission of 
the court before that time, or with the consent of his or her 
parent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe these provisions strike an appropriate balance between 
the freedom of the press, which is a fundamental right in a 
democratic society, and the interest of society in protecting 
itself by the rehabilitation of young persons who have committed 
offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will address one other area on the issue of adult sentences. 
Under the Young Offenders Act, if a youth is 14 or older at the 
time of the alleged indictable offence, the provincial prosecutor 
can apply to have the youth transferred to adult court, as I have 
indicated.  In addition, the Young Offenders Act sets out a 
category of presumptive offences which includes murder, attempted 
murder, manslaughter and aggravated sexual assault.  It is 
presumed that the individuals charged with a presumptive offence 
who were 16 or 17 years old at the time the alleged offence 
occurred will be transferred to adult court and receive adult 
sentences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a youth is transferred to adult court, the rules applicable 
to adults apply to the youth and the special protections granted 
by the Young Offenders Act, including the ban on publication do 
not apply.  In addition, a transfer hearing which takes place 
before the trial begins can significantly delay the start of the 
trial.  Some transfer hearings, including appeals of the decision 
to transfer, have taken more than two years to complete.  Such 
delays can be problematic because for most young people the 
consequences that follow closely after the offending conduct 
prove to be much more meaningful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As under the Young Offenders Act, the proposed youth criminal 
justice act would allow prosecutors to seek to have an adult 
sentence imposed if a youth 14 or older were found guilty of an 
indictable offence.  The youth criminal justice act maintains the 
category of presumptive offences in the Young Offenders Act, but 
extends the presumption to youths 14 or 17 and to serious repeat 
violence offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A youth charged with a presumptive offence has an opportunity to 
demonstrate to the youth court judge that the presumption should 
not apply.  In addition, under the proposed youth criminal 
justice act, provincial prosecutors would have the discretion to 
waive the presumption in an individual case, in which case the 
judge must impose a youth sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Young Offenders Act the crown must make an application 
to waive the presumption and the decision rests with the judge. 
The provincial attorney general could also issue guidelines to 
prosecutors respecting the waiver of the presumption.  Finally, 
through an order in council a province could raise the age of the 
application of the presumption from 14 to 15 or 16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill eliminates the transfer to adult court and provides 
that all proceedings against a youth take place in youth court, 
where age appropriate due process protections apply, as I have 
already indicated.  Hearings to determine whether a youth 
sentence or an adult sentence should be imposed would be held 
only after the youth has been found guilty.  Therefore, the youth 
court judge would make the decision whether to impose a youth or 
adult sentence after all the evidence regarding the circumstances 
of the offence and the offender were put before the court.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the member dealt at length on the issue of naming young 
offenders.  We support the idea that a person who has done 
something wrong ought to confess to it, make it right and make 
restitution, if it is a property crime, and do everything he or 
she can do to restore and build their character. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to give us his rationale for including 
in this legislation that which has been practised in Canada for a 
number of years now.  I am speaking of hiding the identity of a 
person who has been charged and convicted.  It seems to me that 
it is part of accountability when someone admits that he or she 
did something wrong and asks for help.  If the community knows 
who that person is that person can then go on to make a good life 
for himself or herself.  That is what should be done.  I am 
puzzled by Liberal insistence on keeping identities of young 
offenders secret. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member comment on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I certainly agree with the 
preamble to the member's question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a certain stigmatization that goes with knowing the 
name of a young offender, especially when he or she has committed 
a minor crime.  That certainly counteracts rehabilitation and 
reintegration, not only within the youth's community but within 
school as well.  These people get targeted.  Little Johnny is a 
bad boy so we should not associate with him.  How can that help 
with the individual's reintegration into the community?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, if I 
might add to the comment made by the parliamentary secretary, I 
think he is quite right in what he said about stigmatization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must remember that youth are, by definition, in a protected 
category.  We do not assign to youth the same rights and 
responsibilities that we assign to other members of society. 
Children exist within families.  Releasing the name of one member 
of a family who is having difficulties stigmatizes the entire 
family.  The entire body of youth justice is built on the basis 
of rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the parliamentary secretary has indicated, it is true that 
there are circumstances in which youth who are determined to be a 
danger in the community may need to be identified.  However, that 
is an exception rather than the rule.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Kevin Sorenson (Crowfoot, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, before I proceed to speak to Bill C-7, the youth 
criminal justice act, I would like to take this opportunity to 
commend my colleague from Surrey North for his prompt and 
critical review of this rehashed piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a new member of parliament in this 37th parliament, I also 
want to commend him for the wealth of information that he made 
available to us, especially in the justice committee, and for the 
many times he has helped us out.  We appreciate that.  I would 
also like to commend him also for his diligent efforts over the 
last three years in holding the Liberal government accountable 
for its failure to bring about immediate and substantive changes 
to the young offenders act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My Alliance colleague lends credibility to this debate.  He 
turned a personal tragedy, the death of his son, into a crusade. 
Starting with the establishment of a new group called CRY, crime, 
responsibility and youth, the member for Surrey North succeeded 
in drawing attention to the inadequacies of the youth justice 
system and its failure to hold young people responsible for their 
criminal actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since his election to the House in 1997, he has utilized his 
wealth of information and exercised diplomacy while working with 
members of all sides of the House to amend bills, especially 
those bills that preceded Bill C-7.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also congratulate the member for Provencher for his election 
to the House and for his appointment as lead justice critic for 
the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former Manitoba attorney general's speech earlier this month 
clearly demonstrated his experience and knowledge regarding the 
Young Offenders Act.  I also appreciated his references to 
federal-provincial financial agreements and how they have come to 
play a part in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1997 the justice minister promised to make amending the 
Young Offenders Act a priority.  Nearly three and a half years 
later Canadians are still saddled with an ineffective law that 
has failed to adequately hold young people accountable for 
criminal behaviour.  In 1997 the minister realized the need to 
amend the act.  She said, and it was publicized, that it was 
clearly the most unpopular legislation in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than five years ago, following the 10th anniversary of the 
Young Offenders Act, the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal 
Affairs initiated a review of the justice system.  After months 
of cross country hearings, submissions and presentations by 
people with a vested interest in youth justice, and at a cost of 
almost half a million dollars, the committee tabled a report in 
April 1997.  The report contained a number of recommendations to 
amend the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In dissent, the Canadian Alliance presented a minority report 
which contained a number of recommendations we believed were 
important.  Unlike those of the committee, my party's 
recommendations dealt with and fell exclusively within federal 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately I do not have time to go into all the 
recommendations and details of our report.  However I will use my 
allotted time to deal with some of the more important or 
significant points of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important recommendation was to make the protection of 
society the guiding principle of the youth criminal justice act. 
We live in a time when individuals, boards, committees and 
businesses are all looking to come up with a mission statement or 
guiding principle which, as they focus on the direction they are 
taking, they can keep in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The top priority and guiding principle of Bill C-7 needs to be 
the protection of society.  Appearing before the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs in October 1996, Mr. 
Victor Doerkson, a member of the Alberta legislature for Red Deer 
South, said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In listening to Albertans, one lesson became very clear.  The 
protection of society should take priority over all other 
considerations and there must be accountability on the part of 
all offenders—Alberta also recommends that the declaration of 
principles within the act be amended to give the protection of 
society and offender accountability priority over all other 
considerations. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member of the legislature, who spoke on behalf of many 
Albertans, said the people were telling him that protection of 
society must be the guiding principle.  Bill C-7 does not do 
that.  It does not, as recommended by the Alberta MLA and many 
others who appeared before the standing committee, make 
protection of society the first and guiding principle of the 
youth justice act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the declaration of principles, safety and security 
of Canadians is secondary to the rehabilitation and reintegration 
of the offender back into society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Juvenile Delinquents Act came into effect in 1908.  It 
created an informal juvenile justice system that was separate 
from the adult system.  The guiding principles of the Child 
Welfare Act were that young offenders were not criminals but 
rather misguided children in “a condition of delinquency”. 
Because of that condition of delinquency they were not to be 
punished.  They were rather to be treated.  That was the guiding 
principle of the Juvenile Delinquents Act. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1350"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Juvenile Delinquents Act there was no specific 
sentencing and the judges had very significant discretion in 
dealing with young offenders.  This meant that in some 
jurisdictions judges handed out extremely stiff sentences, 
including periods of incarceration for fairly minor crimes, while 
in other jurisdictions light sentences of open custody were given 
to violent offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is unfair.  It is unfair to the offender.  It is unfair to 
the victim.  It is unfair to the public at large as there was no 
guarantee in the law that the offender would be incarcerated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recognizing that the exclusively welfare oriented focus of the 
Juvenile Delinquents Act was not appropriate and to reduce 
judicial discretion, the process of reforming the Juvenile 
Delinquents Act began in the 1960s.  It was not, however, until 
the early 1980s with the introduction of the famous charter of 
rights and freedoms that major juvenile delinquent reform became 
inevitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Juvenile Delinquents Act was inconsistent with the emphasis 
on due process that was in the charter.  In particular, it was 
considered to be contrary to section 15 of the charter of rights 
and freedoms which came into effect in 1985.  Section 15 
guaranteed equality before the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides failing to make the protection of society the guiding 
principle in the bill, it would also effectively enact the 
contentious portion of the Juvenile Delinquents Act that 
wrongfully promoted an inequitable application of criminal law, 
in that it would provide far too much discretion to the youth 
courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House do not accept the Liberal 
government's chequerboard approach to the justice that appears to 
be at the very crux of the youth criminal justice act.  We also 
do not accept the minister's outright rejection of what I 
consider to be the next two most important principles or 
recommendations of my party for amending the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has again refused to lower the age of criminality 
to encompass 10 and 11 year olds in limited circumstances.  She 
has rejected allowing for the publication of the names of all 
violent offenders.  The only way to ensure the safety of our 
children and grandchildren is to provide parents with the names 
of violent and dangerous offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have that right now.  I listened with great interest 
to speech of the parliamentary secretary as he elaborated on what 
may happen if we had those rights.  As parents, we need to know 
who in the school systems, for example, may be threatening our 
children or perhaps those in schools associating with our 
children that they need to be careful of.  The only way to ensure 
the safety of our children and grandchildren is to provide the 
names of these children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also the bill does not, and I believe it should, allow the names 
of drug dealers to be put on that list.  This category of 
offender has wrongly been missed in the new legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadian schools, including public schools, are faced with 
serious troubles.  We had representation from the school trustee 
boards that came around and visited with many members of 
parliament in the last week.  They expressed the need to know who 
the students are in the school systems that perhaps have been 
through violent offences or are in trouble with the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Drugs are a serious problem in schools.  According to a 1999 
special edition of the province in Burnaby, British Columbia, 
police are seeing 13 and 14 year old kids selling crack cocaine. 
The report went on as well to say that girls of the same age were 
trading sex for drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same report revealed that 75% of high school students in 
Coquitlam, B.C., experiment with drugs.  An estimated 10% of them 
misuse drugs on a regular basis and up to half of them have 
become addicted.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We as parents have the right to know who our children are 
associating with.  We have the right to know if a convicted drug 
dealer is attending school with our children.  We have the right 
to know if there is a violent young sex offender living three or 
four houses down the street. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the right to know.  We must have the right to protect 
our children.  That is why we on this side of the House believe 
that the names of violent offenders, including drug dealers, 
should be published. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to lowering the age of criminality to 10, Professor 
Nicholas Bala of Queen's University, who appeared before the 
standing committee on justice, summarized a Statistics Canada 
survey of 27 police forces in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The data indicated that offending behaviour by children under 
the age of 12 was very significant.  Despite this fact, 
authorities are powerless to hold these children legally 
responsible for their criminal actions.  Although a number of 
provinces have a child welfare system that can and does deal with 
these children adequately, many provinces do not have such a 
program.  Repeatedly witnesses came before the standing committee 
on justice and bore witness to the fact that violent offences 
with a welfare response was inappropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lowering the age to 10 does not mean that there will be a huge 
influx of 10 and 11 year olds into the system.  It does not mean 
that we will be inundated with 10 and 11 year olds as they are 
drawn into the justice system.  The system can divert most 
children of this age away from any formal response, particularly 
with the support of alternative measures or community based 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By amending the age we will in the very few cases of violent 
offenders have the means to provide these children with the 
rehabilitation they need.  As it stands now, the minister has 
abandoned 10 and 11 year olds who by committing criminal acts 
signal that they are in need of help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we researched a speech for an earlier debate in the House we 
noticed that many criminals were taking advantage of the fact 
that 10 and 11 year olds were not touched by the justice system. 
They were drawing them in to be drug runners in other ways.  If 
these people are falling through the cracks they need to be 
helped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Appearing before the standing committee during its indepth 
review of the Young Offenders Act, in reference to lowering the 
age, a representative from Citizens Against Violence said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Preferably I would like to see the age in the Young Offenders Act 
lowered to 10, because there's a mindset among today's youth who 
are becoming well educated in the criminal field that they cannot 
be touched under the age of 12—We would like to see the age 
lowered so that the kids themselves know they have to face 
responsibility for their actions. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last recommendation I should like to touch on today is the 
need to differentiate between non-violent crime and violent crime 
for the purpose of sentencing.  We on this side of the House 
recommend that the minister restrict the use of alternative 
measures or community based programs to non-violent offenders who 
pose no threat to society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We firmly believe that only through lengthy periods of 
incarceration, where there are effective rehabilitation programs 
including education, will violent offenders cease to be 
dangerous.

member for Saskatoon—Humboldt has just introduced a bill to cut 
the delivery of services in French on the grounds that doing so 
is a waste of money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, this bill is a clear illustration of just how far 
the Canadian Alliance is out of touch with the concerns of 
Canadians living in a minority situation in one of Canada's 
regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the francophone community of Toronto and its cultural 
survival. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are the French legal services currently being offered in 
Toronto and elsewhere in Ontario.

francophones in my riding to provide social and medical services 
to young people in their language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are the needs of French speaking immigrants requiring 
services in their mother tongue in order to be able to 
contribute to their new country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the issue of national unity.  I must conclude that this 
bill flies in the face of what underlies our spirit of 
bilingualism in Canada, and I am surprised at the lack of 
understanding it represents.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the owner of the Auberge Grand-Mère 
was turned down for a Business Development Bank loan because the 
inn was deemed a bad risk, but was later approved when the Prime 
Minister intervened.  In contrast, an inn in my riding was 
granted a BDC loan on its own merits with no political 
intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Auberge Grand-Mère missed 12 payments and the loan was not 
called.  The inn in my riding missed three payments on a low 
ratio BDC first mortgage during an exceptionally slow winter 
season and the loan was called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government's Business Development Bank so reluctant 
to take action in the Prime Minister's riding and yet so quick to 
take action in mine?  Obviously there are two standards, one for 
the Prime Minister and one for the rest of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other question that begs to be answered is why the Prime 
Minister interfered with the operation of a crown corporation to 
force it to provide a loan it judged unworthy of consideration. 
That question has been asked repeatedly, and although the true 
answer has not yet been given, the truth will come out. 
Unfortunately it may be too late for a small western inn that 
does not happen to be next door to a Prime Minister's golf 
course.

negotiating the sale of his golf club shares between 1996 and 
1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many potential buyers did the Prime Minister's agent 
approach before Louis Michaud Investments agreed to take the 
shares?  Were the shares shopped around for three years by the

sell these shares when the heat was turned on in 1999 and the

not want to understand.  From November 1, 1993, these shares

letter that was transmitted by Mr. Paquet to the Department of 
Industry last week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had no shares in any company of that nature, either golf

he had not been paid for his golf club shares, which he thought 
had been sold to Jonas Prince. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can he tell the House why the transaction fell through?  What

twice failed his law exams, so I will have to say this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 1, I sold my shares to Jonas Prince who signed a 
bill of sale, and after that there was a resolution according to 
the lawyers passed by the company accepting the fact that I had 
sold my shares.  After that I had no interest and there was 
nothing I could do about the shares that were not mine. They were 
Mr. Prince's.

something he could do very quickly and simply to confirm that and 
to clear this matter up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would be to release the income tax records for his company, 
J&AC holdings, which would clearly show a sale and a receipt of 
money for the shares at the time the Prime Minister said.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have asked the commissioner to release every document 
that he has to this effect.  He has looked into that.  He has 
stated carefully and clearly that the shares were not mine since 
November 1, 1993.  He stated that there was no connection between 
the golf course and the hotel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With your permission, Mr. Speaker, I would like to table a 
letter that I sent to the leader of the fifth party earlier 
today, explaining in detail all I can say on this that is 
pertinent.  With your permission I would like to table this in 
the House right away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The Prime Minister does not need permission 
to table a document in the House.  Any minister may do that at 
any time.

deserves more than a red herring.  I say to the Prime Minister 
again that if he has his own tax records available he does not 
need anyone else's permission to table them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax records would clearly show a sale of assets and receipt 
of money for those assets.  If the Prime Minister really wants to 
clear this up, if he really wants to come clean with Canadians, 
will he simply put those tax records for his company before the 
Canadian public and prove once and for all that his assertions he 
sold those shares are correct?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien:</B>  There is nothing I can do.  I 
gave him the authority to table the bill of sale and to table the 
resolution that was passed by the company on November 1, 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After I sold my shares I just tried to be paid the money that 
was owed to me.  As far as the auberge, in the letter that I gave

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

1996 Mr. Prince had not paid the shares so at that time we were 
not paid.  My lawyer, who is my trustee at the same time, took 
the steps that were necessary in discussion with Mr. Wilson, who 
said that in front of the committee last year.  The deputy prime 
minister informed the House last year too that they were working

speak to me, having been made aware of the allegations in the

information is completed, a letter will be sent in response to 
the ethics counsellor from whom the request came in the first

</I></B></P><P align=left>However let me say something.  There has not been one piece of

There is not one new piece of information.  Members opposite

to serve as a parking place to buy the Prime Minister time to 
sell his shares.

Mr. Speaker, there are numerous inconsistencies and

the Auberge Grand-Mère affair.  One thing the Prime Minister has 
said consistently is that he wanted to get paid for his shares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister simply inform the House what was the

appropriate will be conveyed to the ethics counsellor for his 
judgment as to their use.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker,

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>YOUTH CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK175">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-7, an 
act in respect of criminal justice for young persons and to amend 
and repeal other acts, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK176"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Kevin Sorenson (Crowfoot, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we were speaking to Bill C-7, the amendment to replace 
the Young Offenders Act with the youth criminal justice act.  We 
were speaking about the use of alternative measures or community 
based programs for non-violent offenders who pose no threat to 
society.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We firmly believe that only through lengthy periods of 
incarceration where there are effective rehabilitation programs 
including education would violent offenders cease to be 
dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are encouraged that the bill would make these educational and 
rehabilitation programs mandatory.  When and if young offenders 
are incarcerated, they would be forced to go through programs so 
that they could be integrated back into society thus making it a 
safer place to live.  Protection of society is the key guiding 
principle of the Young Offenders Act or of the youth criminal 
justice act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to an old Statistics Canada fact finder a very small 
percentage of violent offenders are incarcerated.  It means that 
a very small percentage of them are actually held in custody. 
They are unable to go through those programs while a 
disproportionate number of non-violent offenders are 
incarcerated, limiting the space and resources needed to 
rehabilitate the violent offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prison is not necessary for young persons who commit minor 
offences.  We are not asking that there be incarceration in that 
regard.  In many cases it may be detrimental to them.  They may 
be assaulted by other violent young offenders or they may also 
learn from the other ones in the prison system.  After their 
release, depending on how we look at it, the educational program 
may also allow them to progress to higher levels of crime or 
lower levels of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We fully support alternative measures but only for non-violent 
first time offenders.  In 1995, with the passage of Bill C-41, 
the Liberal government legislated conditional sentences and 
alternative measures.  My party fought adamantly but to no avail 
to amend the legislation limiting the use of conditional 
sentences to non-violent offences.  As a result of the 
government's failure to make such amendments, judges have 
repeatedly handed out conditional sentences throughout the 
country to persons convicted of serious crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one case that has been raised many times in the House. 
A man who abducted and viciously sodomized a young woman was 
given a conditional sentence.  The young woman was scarred for 
life.  She now lives with that in her memories and is plagued by 
that conditional sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few weeks ago in Ottawa, another case dealt with a woman who 
was convicted of attempting to hire a hit man to kill her parents 
and was given a conditional sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first and guiding principle of Canada's criminal law should 
be the protection of society.  Without strict limits placed on 
the use of alternative measures or conditional sentences, whether 
it be for violent adults or violent youth, the tenet for the 
protection of society would be violated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I urge the government to take the step to realize and 
to recognize the importance of dealing with the protection of 
society within Canada's criminal law.  Do we need changes to the 
Young Offenders Act?  Yes, we do.  We applaud the government and 
the minister for recognizing the inadequacies of the Young 
Offenders Act and for realizing that we need to make changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-7 falls short.  It is short of what is required for the 
protection of society.  We are dealing with our children.  The 
throne speech dealt with our children. The protection of our 
children and grandchildren is paramount. Bill C-7, although it 
moves in the right direction, falls short of giving the tools we 
need to help protect society and our children. 
<P><A NAME="LINK177"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
I congratulate my colleague from Crowfoot for his excellent 
speech in which he mentioned diversion programs that may be 
applicable to helping young offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know of one such program in my own riding, a young diversion 
program, in which the member for Surrey North even as a sitting 
member is still involved and shows great commitment to.  Could he 
indicate how youth diversion programs could be implemented?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Kevin Sorenson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we all recognize the 
fact that we need to be able to divert non-violent offenders. 
Diversion should not occur from the judicial system because that 
is where they enter the system when they commit crimes.  There 
are many community based programs, going back to the Juvenile 
Delinquents Act, that can be implemented for these young people. 
Some of them are probably living in the condition of delinquency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not believe that for violent offenders we should be 
looking at some alternative measures, that there should be some 
community programs for violent offences.  We believe that 
community based programs or alternate programs may be used for 
non-violent first time offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young people can make errors.  They get mixed up in the wrong 
crowd or hang out with people who have bad reputations.  They 
blend in and all of a sudden they find themselves involved in 
criminal activity on a first time offence.  We should see how our 
communities can bring them back in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned that there are already some community 
programs in place.  Other community programs are being considered 
where the community itself, understanding their young people and 
the needs of the community, could probably do two things.  They 
could educate them and help them integrate back into that 
community or for the safety of other young people could hold them 
in check. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not opposed to alternative measures, but we are opposed 
to those with third or fourth time offences going through 
alternative measures. We are opposed to violent criminal acts 
bypassing incarceration. They are placed in a community program 
where it is a slap on the wrist and we believe they should be 
incarcerated. 
<P><A NAME="LINK178"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I remember a little nine year old boy coming down 
the street into my backyard one day.  His pockets were bulging 
and overflowing with candy and stuff.  When I queried him about 
it and asked him if he had any money to pay for it, he said no, 
that he had just helped himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I did as a father was what any father should do with a 
child who has been caught shoplifting: I marched him back to the 
store.  I made him apologize to the owner and give back the 
candy.  Fortunately he had not started eating it so he was able 
to give it all back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not public disclosure of the things we do wrong one of the 
best ways for us to make sure it does not happen again?  Is it 
not true that most of the crime in the country occurs under the 
cover of darkness or takes place when other people cannot see 
what is going on because it is human nature to not want to get 
caught doing something that is wrong? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the public disclosure of names of children who 
have done something wrong, is it not common sense that if we 
published the names of these children a shame factor would come 
into play?  Would it help prevent them from doing it again, or 
has society gone so far away from the shame factor that it does 
not matter any more?  I would like the hon. member to comment on 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Kevin Sorenson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the publication of names 
does two things.  It helps to protect society.  I talked about 
that in my speech.  As a parent, the publication of names would 
allow me to be very careful whom my children hang around with. It 
would let me know about someone living down the street or close 
by in the community that I would not want my little girl or boy 
hanging around with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could then do one of two things.  I could be there all the 
time that my child is with that individual, or I could step in 
say that I do not want my child hanging around with those types 
of people.  The publication of names is a good idea. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1525"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fear of their name being publicized creates a deterrent as 
well.  If they commit a crime or are involved in a crime they do 
not want their community to know.  The hon. member is 100% right. 
It serves as a deterrent and a deterrent that we should not 
question.  Over and above that it give us another tool to protect 
society and our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to publish the names of all violent offenders such as 
the individual the hon. member came in contact with.  We are not 
asking for the publication of names of individuals who have 
shoplifted or stolen candy from a candy store.  That is not what 
we are asking for.  We are talking about violent offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The school boards said that they wanted to know the names of 
those involved in crime.  It was information they could use to 
educate.  It could also protect society.  Other members said 
names of violent offenders were already published but not to the 
extreme they would like to see.  Some information is provided to 
schools to a certain degree, but not to the community to the 
point where I as a parent would know that young Johnny who just 
moved in is a convicted drug dealer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole issue of drug dealing is not mentioned under violent 
offences.  We should look at what drug dealers are doing to the 
country.  That is another area that should be publicized.  It is 
ripping our country apart.  It is to a large degree driving young 
people into crime.  Parents have said that we need to know who 
the drug dealers are and who is convicted of drug dealing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK179"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have listened to the remarks of the hon. member. 
When he speaks of the issue of deterrence.  I agree that general 
and specific deterrents are an important part of the messaging in 
the criminal justice system.  It applies to youth as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having looked at the bill he would know that it attempts to draw 
a line in the sand between violent and non-violent offences. It 
sets up the impression in the public sphere that somehow the bill 
would enable more to be done in terms of early intervention. 
There would be more programming available by virtue of the bill. 
There would be more attempts made to be proactive in our criminal 
justice system.  All those things are certainly laudable goals. 
They are areas, he will agree, that we should be looking at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty that exists in the bill is that the federal 
government through the Department of Justice has given no 
undertaking whatsoever to increase its share of the costs of the 
administration of justice, particularly pertaining to the young 
offenders system.  As it currently exists in most provinces, the 
federal government is picking up less than half the cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the hon. member is quite simple.  If the new 
bill is raising expectations and putting in place mechanisms that 
put greater emphasis on early intervention and rehabilitation, 
goals that we should be trying to attain, yet at the same time is 
giving no commitment whatsoever to funding such programs, are we 
really not in some instances making things worse by dashing the 
hopes of dedicated people in probation and other dedicated 
workers who are trying to do more to help youth at risk? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Kevin Sorenson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is 
absolutely right.  As I read through Bill C-7 I did not 
understand the provincial jurisdiction and the federal 
jurisdiction.  A lot of what the hon. member is referring to is 
true.  Funding is definitely lacking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our lead critic from Provencher spoke about the provincial 
jurisdiction and the federal jurisdiction.  As a new member in 
the House I have gone through the bill, but I have not been privy 
to all the witnesses and all the committee meetings. I have heard 
concern that we are stepping into provincial jurisdiction and 
that we are putting expectations on the provinces.  We are not 
willing, as we used to say down on the farm, to put our money 
where our mouth is.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a huge problem when we download to provinces programs 
which perhaps they should be in charge of and there is no money 
available to help follow up.  The whole thing should be looked at 
as far as the federal portion of funding is concerned.  If they 
are willing to come with these programs, the government had 
better be willing to back it up with its wallet. 
<P><A NAME="LINK180"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will mention at the outset that I will be splitting my time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate by and large generates more heat than light and has, 
over the past seven years of these last three parliaments, 
generated a great deal of heat.  I do not know how much light we 
actually came to over the course of those three parliaments, but 
this occupied the 35th parliament.  The justice committee 
reported in May 1997 on this issue and that formed the basis for 
the 36th parliament's Bill C-68. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the course of dealing with Bill C-68, parliament was 
prorogued and that bill became Bill C-3.  In the course of 
dealing with Bill C-3, we in the justice committee had extensive 
hearings, as did the previous justice committee, hearings that 
were nationwide.  In the course of those hearings, we heard from 
pretty well every corner of the country and from every interested 
jurisdiction.  Bill C-3 has now become Bill C-7 and we are now in 
the 37th parliament and back to debating this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I have some discomfort at times about time allocation, 
there comes a time when time should be allocated.  I believe this 
is one of those occasions where we finally have to deal with the 
evidence we have heard, the testimony we have heard and the 
manner in which the government has put it forward in a bill after 
extensive hearings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I say that at the point where we were just about to get down 
to clause by clause in the justice committee, the Bloc Quebecois 
decided that would be a good time to filibuster.  The Bloc took 
up something in the order of 27 hours of the committee's time on 
a filibuster which ultimately had to be returned to the House, 
with the net result that the bill was not heard and not dealt 
with prior to the election in November 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that we are not going to make everybody happy.  There 
are times at which government just has to be government. 
Parliament does its thing and expresses its view because, after 
all, this is a talking shop.  We do talk and we do advise, but 
ultimately it is the government that makes decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to commend the Minister of Justice on her willingness to 
listen to evidence and to change significant portions of the bill 
based upon the evidence she heard at committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first change is in the area of the preamble and principles 
of the bill.  Members will notice that clause 3 has been changed. 
Again, this is as a direct result of what she heard at committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first statement of principle will now read as follows: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) the youth criminal justice system is intended to 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i) prevent crime by addressing the circumstances underlying a 
young person's offending behaviour, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(ii) rehabilitate young persons who commit offences and 
reintegrate them into society, and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(iii) ensure that a young person is subject to meaningful 
consequences for his or her offence— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I say, a number of people before the committee said that we 
had the principles in the preamble as a declaration of principle 
and that was not correct.  The Minister of Justice listened and 
the Minister of Justice has put that into the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the importance of timely intervention is recognized in 
the principles.  In some respects that may be stating the 
obvious, but in testimony after testimony we heard that a youth 
would commit an offence in May of one year and not be dealt with 
until a year or 18 months later.  At the best of times one has 
difficulty bringing together the consequences of one's activity 
with the punishment, and the result is that the youth loses all 
appreciation for the justice system, so the importance of timely 
intervention is right in the declaration of principle.  Again, 
the minister changed this. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1535"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another change.  A reference to the needs and level of 
development of the youth has been added to the principles. 
Subparagraph 3(1)(c)(iii) reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(iii) be meaningful for the individual young person given his or 
her needs and level of development and, where appropriate, 
involve the parents, the extended family— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are significant additions and, again, are based upon 
evidence we heard.  Again I have to commend the Minister of 
Justice.  She listened to the testimony.  The changes were made 
in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When she attempts to come before the committee members opposite 
filibuster.  I cannot quite see how that is being a responsible 
parliamentarian.  Members are forever saying that they have no 
impact on legislation.  Frankly, the justice committee did have 
an impact on this legislation.  Frankly, the justice committee 
spent a lot of time listening to the evidence.  Frankly, the 
minister reacted with significant amendments.  Yet members 
opposite say that we have to debate this some more and that 
members opposite are irrelevant and do not have any impact on 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With reference to the interests of victims, that was probably a 
flaw in the previous bill and has been referred to in the 
preamble of the bill where it has been incorporated by reference. 
It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian society should have a youth criminal justice system that 
commands respect, takes into account the interests of victims, 
fosters responsibility and ensures accountability— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what else can be said in terms of how to 
incorporate those kinds of principles into a bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard a great deal of testimony about how Canada treats its 
youth when they come in contact with the law.  What became clear 
in the course of listening to our evidence was that we overrely 
on incarceration, particularly on incarceration for aboriginal 
youth.  I can recall the testimony of one youth justice of the 
Northwest Territories who gave a rather sad commentary on our 
youth justice system.  He said that one of the reasons he puts 
aboriginal youth in jail is that he knows they have no real 
alternatives, that they either go back on the street to 
dysfunctional families or go back on the street to no families at 
all.  As a consequence, he saw it as his only option to put kids 
in jail.  That is a pretty sad commentary on our situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians would be interested to know that we incarcerate youth 
at twice the American rate.  That is a pretty shocking statistic 
and is frankly something I had not heard prior to becoming a 
parliamentarian.  That contrasts quite distinctly with the fact 
that Americans incarcerate adults at four times the rate 
Canadians do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point of interest that came up in testimony had to do 
with learning disabilities.  It became clear that a 
disproportionate number of youth offenders have learning 
disabilities.  The low estimate was something in the order of 
35%.  The higher estimate was something in the order of 80%. More 
than one out of every two young offenders cannot read.  In this 
society, people who cannot read will likely be marginalized. If 
they are marginalized, they are likely going to be hanging out 
with people they should not be hanging out with and doing things 
they should not be doing.  The consequence is that they will be 
involved in conflicts with the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also heard that young offenders drop out of school at twice 
the rate of their peers.  At some level this is not really news 
and at another level it is a profound recognition of societal 
failure, which brings us into conflict between the needs of 
criminal justice and the needs of social justice.  That is a kind 
of philosophical divide that we all straddle in some manner or 
another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the pieces of testimony that really caught my attention 
was that of professor Allan Leishfield of the University of 
Western Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know he is not from Queen's, Mr. Speaker, but he still 
probably has something to say in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is simply not enough evidence to support the notion that 
incapacitation through incarceration of relatively large numbers 
of youth is an effective way to promote community safety. 
The second is partly drawn from the first and that is that the 
cost of providing custody for large numbers of youth is 
considerable and not justified given the poor outcomes recorded 
in the vast majority of the programs that rely on incapacitation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite should know that it costs about $106,000 a year 
to keep a youth in jail, whereas referrals to other non-custodial 
situations cost somewhere in the order of about $9,500. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When something is costly and is not working, there is something 
wrong.  When we are faced with that situation we have to look at 
other alternatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respectfully submit that this bill has looked at other 
alternatives, that this has been completely and thoroughly 
debated by members opposite, and that it is time to deal with the 
issues that criminal justice presents to all of us. 
<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my colleague across the way for his 
intervention.  It is a pleasure to again be back on the justice 
committee with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one question with regard to the provisions for what is 
essentially parole for young offenders, that is, mandatory 
supervision, which would equate to half of the length of the 
incarceration period of the sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The initial idea was to mandate one-half the period.  In other 
words, if there were a three year sentence, one year of that 
would have to be under supervision as mandated.  There were some 
objections raised to that.  I can understand that.  I think we 
could all agree that for certain offenders, especially violent 
offenders, we would want to see some period of supervision after 
an incarceration period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, some objections were raised to that because it in 
effect reduced the incarceration period, which a lot of people 
were saying was too short as it was for violent offences.  The 
government in its wisdom has decided to give that discretion back 
to the judge, which in effect now takes away any form of 
mandatory supervision for the most violent offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member would comment on that.  What we 
would suggest is to increase the actual length of time of the 
sentence and impose the mandatory supervision.  To reduce the 
incarceration period and then take away the supervision for the 
offenders who probably need it the most does not seem like much 
of a solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John McKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I believe the hon. member is 
referring to the presumptive offences, an area that is actually a 
fairly significant change in the bill.  Now crown attorneys and 
defence attorneys will not argue as to whether a case should be 
tried or not tried in adult court.  The crown will simply ask for 
an adult sentence at the end of the presentation of the evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The interesting anomaly was raised in evidence as to whether 
this would in effect, if there were an imposition of an adult 
sentence, result in the reduction of incarceration time, the time 
actually in incarceration, and a period of supervision.  There 
was that anomaly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have a good answer for the hon. member's inquiry.  I 
think it is a legitimate issue to raise.  That was an area about 
which we all had some questions.  It was rather a pity that the 
last committee did not get down to debating significant issues 
such as the hon. member raises.  I am hoping that we do have the 
opportunity at the committee to raise that particular issue and 
arrive at a reasonable solution.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Paradis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today 
to try to correct some of the information that has been 
circulating on the opposition benches since Bill C-7 was tabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some are suggesting that Bill C-7 is too tough on young 
offenders, whereas others are criticizing it for being 
toothless. Bill C-7 is a departure from these two contradictory 
philosophical approaches and strikes a balance resting on three 
closely interconnected and complementary elements: first, crime 
prevention; second, accountability for young offenders; and 
third, the rehabilitation and reintegration of young offenders.

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been consistently hearing comments to the effect that 
Quebec has taken the approach of treating its young offenders 
well, an approach which would be jeopardized by the 
implementation of Bill C-7. This is not quite the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics show that Quebec tends to put its young offenders 
into custody even for minor offences. Statistics also show that 
between 1997 and 1998 Quebec was the province with the biggest 
increase in its incarceration rate, which jumped by 6%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everybody can benefit from Bill C-7. 
At the national level, our justice system's way of dealing with 
young offenders is such that our young people are detained in 
custody four times as often as adults and, at the international 
level, from 10 to 15 times as often as young Australians or 
Europeans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-7 recognizes the difficult times some of our young people 
are experiencing. Although criminal legislation by itself cannot 
be an appropriate response to their problems, it can provide the 
necessary tools to bring in both health and youth protection 
agencies, and remedy the underlying causes of juvenile 
delinquency. This is exactly what Bill C-7 does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth criminal justice act, Bill C-7, would allow the use of 
health professionals at any stage of the process to assess if 
the young person has health problems, physical or mental 
disorders, psychological problems, emotional problems or 
learning disabilities, or if he or she is mentally retarded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The diagnosis could then be used in sentencing or in determining 
extrajudicial measures to be applied. Bill C-7 even provides for 
a custody and supervision system that includes an intensive 
rehabilitation and reintegration program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would also enable a youth court to submit the case of a 
young offender to a youth protection agency so it could determine 
if he or she needed its services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, detention or custody cannot be used as a substitute for 
appropriate child protection, mental health or other social 
measures. 
Despite what some people say, putting young people in prison or 
in youth centres, even though it may sometimes be necessary, is 
not the only effective way of fighting crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We reject the statement that custody may be necessary to treat a 
young offender with problems even though the offence does not 
require such a strict penalty. Our response to that argument is 
threefold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it is not necessary to have a young person in custody to 
ensure that he or she receives appropriate treatment. Treatment 
is the responsibility of the health and welfare system or the 
youth protection system, but it is not the responsibility of the 
criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, detaining a young person just because his or her 
particular condition requires an action by the health or child 
protection system, in cases where the offence is a minor one, 
would be contrary to the principle of fairness and equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, this kind of approach would penalize a youth simply 
because of some unfortunate circumstances, not to mention the 
stigma of detention that could limit a young offender in his or 
her endeavours to become a productive citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-7 was criticized for being prejudicial to what Quebec 
took over 20 years to build. As an elected representative from 
Quebec and a former president of the Quebec Bar Association, I 
approve the criminal justice system for young persons set out in 
Bill C-7. The bill commands respect but also protects the 
interests of the victims, promotes responsibility by providing 
positive opportunities and focusing on rehabilitation, keeps 
harsh sentences for the most serious offences and limits 
detention for non violent young persons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, let me review some of the elements of the bill that 
would improve upon the current system and reinforce the strength 
of the Quebec model while enhancing its approach. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT51"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT51"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1550
<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In no specific order, these elements are the following. First, 
there is the exclusive jurisdiction of the youth justice court 
and the fact that young offenders would no longer be transferred 
to adult courts, as is currently done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, an adult sentence would only be imposed after a person is 
found guilty and the names have been published. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, in clause 4, the bill creates some kind of framework for 
the discretionary power of the youth workers on the front line. 
This is set out in clauses 4 to 12. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following point concerns the emphasis on diversion and the 
means available to stakeholders to use it effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point has to do with the notion of time, which is so 
important when correcting criminal behaviour.  The current 
legislation, I note, is silent on this point. All signs are that 
Quebec will improve its response time, or at least maintain it, 
when faced with the requirement to act rapidly and effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following point has to do with the distinction made between 
the majority of offenders, who commit non-violent crimes, and the 
minority, whose crimes are violent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point concerns the clarity of the objectives and general 
guidelines for each stakeholder in the system at all phases of 
the procedure, and the specific principles applicable to a 
particular stage or intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A wide array of measures is available to stakeholders, whether 
they be the police, the crown, judges or social workers, to 
help young offenders take responsibility and adopt behaviour 
that is consistent with the values of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following point has to do with the recognition given 
frontline workers for their contribution to the youth criminal 
justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of committees of citizens, to be called youth 
justice committees, on which the bill confers duties and powers 
of recommendation, supervision, support, information and advice, 
is another point contained in the bill, as is the possibility of 
convening conferences to deal with a specific case.  This 
possibility is given to a police officer, the crown and the 
judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a meeting would bring together the victim and his or her 
family, the young offender and his or her family, community 
organizations, school authorities, and other individuals 
concerned in determining specific solutions in a given case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also contains the principle of recognition of the 
victim and the obligation to forge partnerships with the 
community and the community organizations for a better 
understanding and resolution of the problems surrounding youth 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, let us keep in mind that, in support of the 
efforts to implement the youth criminal justice act, Quebec would 
receive a substantial portion of the budget allocated for this, 
as well as an increase in the federal government contribution to 
the administration of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently wrote an open letter in response to a letter from the 
president of the Junior Bar of Quebec.  I sent this open letter 
to <I>La Presse</I> and invite them to publish it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK183"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I have always respected the hon. member for Brome—Missisquoi but 
today I was both surprised and disappointed by his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He based part of his arguments on the fact that he is a former 
president of the Quebec Bar Association. Listening to him, I got 
the impression that he was talking more like a Liberal member 
trying to support a minister who finds herself in a rather 
awkward situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a Quebecer, he is well aware of. I know that he reads 
the newspapers. I was not surprised to see that <I>La Presse</I> did 
not publish his letter because <I>La Presse</I> must have realized 
that it did not reflect the consensus in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me ask the following question of this former president of 
the bar association. I think <I>La Presse</I> should have noted that the 
national assembly, of which his brother is a member, agrees that 
this bill makes no sense in Quebec. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT52"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT52"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1555
<A HREF="#LINKT53"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the organizations, the youth centres, the representatives of 
the young people and the CLSCs say so.  Everybody says so. 
There is a consensus, and the member for Berthier—Montcalm has 
shown this on a number of occasions.  I even did so in the 
previous parliament.  There was a very broad consensus among all 
the organizations concerned with young people in Quebec.  They 
say that this law makes no sense, that is was introduced simply 
to please a certain western lobby, which wants measures to be 
more severe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He surprises me especially where he expresses the statistics in 
national terms and notes increases in certain statistics.  At 
the same time, he speaks of a 6% increase in detentions in 
Quebec, finding that this is serious and significant. Yet, the 
rate of detention is low—that is the way to see it—in fact, it is 
lower in Quebec than elsewhere in Canada.  He said there was a 
slight increase and yet this is where there are the fewest 
detentions in Canada.  His making a point of saying “It 
increased by 6%” in order to justify his remarks, I find 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member aware of the list of all those opposing his bill? 
Could he list, by memory, those involved with young people in 
Quebec who agree with what he says?  Could he name a dozen 
organizations in Quebec that would agree?  Does he remember all 
those opposed, when in fact there is a consensus, which includes 
the Quebec National Assembly and his own brother? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Paradis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand that the member for 
Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière has a little trouble with 
shipbuilding in his riding, but in this case I think he is 
missing the boat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw the attention of the member for 
Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière and particularly of the member for 
Berthier—Montcalm to the bill before us.  Earlier, I spoke about 
correcting some of the misinformation our Bloc Quebecois friends 
are circulating right and left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge them to read the bill carefully.  Let us begin with the 
first page.  It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>WHEREAS members of society share a responsibility to address the 
developmental challenges and the needs of young persons and to 
guide them into adulthood; 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the first “Whereas”.  The second paragraph says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>WHEREAS communities, families, parents— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do they have against families and parents? 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—families, parents and others concerned with the development of 
young persons should, through multi-disciplinary approaches, take 
reasonable steps to prevent youth crime by addressing its 
underlying causes, to respond to the needs of young persons, and 
to provide guidance and support to those at risk of committing 
crimes; 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the second “Whereas”.  I could go on with the other 
paragraphs, which are along those lines. 
Members need to read the bill and to understand what is in 
the bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, before I begin, I want to thank our justice critic, the 
member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, for the work he has 
done on this which extends way beyond this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members well know, this bill has been introduced and 
reintroduced.  In fact, it goes back to three parliaments ago 
when it was originally brought in to update the Young Offenders 
Act, which we know has been a very troubled piece of legislation 
since its inception. 
I point out that the Young Offenders Act has gone beyond the life 
of young offenders.  It is 17 years old. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1600"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT53"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT53"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1600

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough pointed out on a 
number of occasions that the present Young Offenders Act does not 
deserve much of its present reputation.  The government could do 
a number of things to improve the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He pointed out that Bill C-7, the youth criminal justice act, 
from the outset looked very encouraging.  It talks about early 
intervention.  It talks about preventive measures on youth who 
could be embarking on a life of crime.  That is of course what we 
want to prevent.  A reversal of one's behaviour can come about 
only by interventionist activities on the part of professionals 
that can help steer young people in the right direction.  That is 
very commendable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However it is the shear complexity of the bill with which most 
of us have some major concerns.  The previous speaker had a copy 
of the bill in his hands.  The physical size of the bill is 
double the size and the complexity of the existing legislation, 
the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quoting from a previous speaker, the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, in remarks made in the House on 
February 14: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This particular bill in its current form is so complex, so 
convoluted and cumbersome that were it to be enacted it its 
current form, the delays, the interpretations, the legal jargon 
and the manipulations that would result would be astronomical. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He and other members have mentioned the convoluted nature of 
this piece of legislation.  That has been borne out by judges and 
others who have worked in the youth criminal justice system over 
the years.   A number of opinions have been rendered on that. 
They simply say that interpretation of the act would be very 
difficult for some of our most skilled members of the legal 
profession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have other examples of what we should do and how the bill 
could be reconstructed, but basically the problem we see is that 
the present government has refused to give to police the tools 
needed to do their jobs and the proper resources to effectively 
implement the present act, let alone any new act.  The 
government's failure to address the problem has allowed the Young 
Offenders Act to become synonymous with the problems involving 
youth crime in Canada.  There is a need to restore public 
confidence in the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, we have had over seven years of delay 
and numerous promises in regard to the bill.  Originally the 
government, back in the early nineties, introduced it as Bill 
C-3.  That was replaced with Bill C-68 in the last parliament. 
We are still talking but nothing is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was criticized by all parties, including the Liberal 
Party, and all youth justice experts around the country.  The 
reasons were that the bill was too long, too complex and too 
expensive for the provinces to implement.  If the provinces do 
not have the financial resources to implement the bill, what good 
would it be, despite its good intentions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the frustration of members of parliament in the 
last parliament during committee hearings on the bill, the member 
for Berthier—Montcalm filibustered for 27 hours in a determined 
effort to derail this particular bill. 
The bill to which we are speaking has only minor technical 
amendments.  Experts still think the bill is too long, too 
expensive and too complicated.

<A HREF="#LINKT53"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the models we often point to is the province of Quebec. 
Certainly in terms of the treatment of young offenders, it has a 
lot of which to be proud.  Quebec is certainly miles ahead of the 
rest of the provinces.  The bill attempts to reflect that but 
without giving the provinces the resources to do it.  It is going 
to complicate and exaggerate the differences between a province 
like Ontario with that of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-7 does not offer any real disincentive for youth 
criminals.  The Liberals say that crime rates are falling and 
that opposition parties are only fearmongering when speaking 
about the need to crack down on violent crime in Canada.  Last 
July Statistics Canada announced that crime rates had fallen to 
their lowest level in 20 years.  However, it did not mention 
youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The overall decline in crime masks a sharp increase in violent 
crime and a staggering rise in youth crime.  While less serious 
crimes have petered off, violent crime is actually up by 57% over 
the last 20 years and violent youth crime is up by over 77% in 10 
years.  It is quite obvious that this is not fearmongering.  It 
is a real problem when we look at an increase of 77% in 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not end there because the numbers get even more 
disturbing.  Violent crime by young girls has risen 127% since 
1988, with most of those statistics coming from categories such 
as murder and hostage taking.  Obviously we have read about 
stories like that.  There was one in the <I>National Post</I> on 
July 20, 2000, if anyone is interested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lack of accountability for the crimes committed by young 
offenders is no deterrent.  Even when young criminals are 
convicted, they are often given a custodial sentence which can 
often be served at home.  They are sentenced on average to a 
single month.  It is not much wonder that 40% of all young 
offenders are repeat offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Almost half of the convicted youths between the years 1998-99 
were simply placed on probation.  Seventy-five per cent of 
custody sentences were for three months or less, and 90% of those 
sentences were for six months or less.  Only 2% of these 
convicted offenders got more than a year.  We are talking about 
serious crime, not petty crimes.  Only 0.1% of youth crimes made 
it to adult court between 1998-99.  I believe the last point or 
the numbers are precise.  Forty-eight per cent of those convicted 
had at least one previous conviction.

<A HREF="#LINKT54"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we ask frontline police officers if things are getting 
easier, their answer is absolutely not.  They say so called minor 
youth crimes are not being reported due to an overworked police 
force that is stretched to deal with too much crime.  Too many 
young offenders are being dealt with through what they call extra 
judicial measures.  They do not become part of the government's 
statistics.  If it is not reported, it did not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frontline victim groups are upset that under Bill C-7 crimes 
such as common assault are not considered by the government to be 
violent in nature.  That would not be included in the violent 
crime statistics, thus helping to further massage the 
government's statistics to support its theory that violent crime 
is decreasing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard to believe that children under 12 years old are 
committing serious crimes and many of them are not being charged 
at all.  I would like to give the House an example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On August 23, 2000, Ms. Margaret Moore, an elderly woman in 
Calgary, was mugged and beaten at noon hour by two young girls 
aged 11 and 13.  The 13 year old faces one charge of robbery and 
the 11 year old is too young to be charged under the Young 
Offenders Act.  That is an important point to make.  It is 
obviously a flaw in the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is an 11 year old boy walked into an Edmonton 
bank in broad daylight a few weeks ago and proceeded to rob it. 
The young boy was wearing a ball cap, sunglasses and carried a 
knapsack.  He handed the teller a note demanding money.  Being 
only 11 years old, the system has no means of dealing with this 
young offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children under 12 and older youth are expected to be dealt with 
through provincially administered programs which are supposed to 
receive 50% of their funding from the federal government. 
Obviously they do not because every province, including my home 
province, is complaining about the lack of funds from Ottawa to 
help in rehabilitation.  Under the present government, the 
provinces have seen their 50% share drop to as little as 30%. 
This decreased funding equates to children not receiving the 
services they need and rehabilitation does not occur.  That is 
the key.  If we want to look to any part of the country where 
rehabilitation has worked we would obviously look to the province 
of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Victims of youth crime could give us stories behind these 
statistics.  They could give us stories about the lives that have 
been taken and the hurt that has been caused.  They could give us 
stories about the victims who have been left behind to fight for 
recognition from a Liberal justice system which is concerned more 
with the rights of the young offender than with the pain of the 
victims and the need to be accountable to the public, which is 
scared that these young offenders will continue to get off with a 
slap on the wrist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are not many weaknesses in Bill C-7.   However, if we are 
reintroducing or bringing in a new bill, we have to provide the 
provinces with the tools and resources to implement it.  The bill 
simply puts an impossible burden on the backs of the provinces, 
especially the poorer ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a couple of things that could happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, judges could be given more power to impose mandatory 
treatment or therapy for troubled youth.  The key is obviously 
treatment and therapy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, serious violent crime offences involving young offenders 
could be automatically transferred to adult courts. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1615"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we should enact a parental responsibility act to make the 
parents of young offenders financially responsible for the 
criminal acts of their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, we should lower the age of accountability to include 
violent criminals of all ages.  Currently, as we well know, 
violent offenders below the age of 12 face no punishment for 
their crimes.  At least in cases involving serious crime, the 
justice system should be able to bring a child under the age of 
12 into the youth justice system in the same manner that a young 
offender can be transferred into the adult system for serious 
crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party, although we risk being accused of this when we speak 
in such terms, does not intend to incarcerate youths in inhuman 
or cruel facilities.  None of us want that.  However we do 
support mandatory youth access to adult criminal rehabilitation 
resources and increased accountability for violent youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through such services we hope to prevent young adults from 
continuing a life of anti-social criminal activity.  We can make 
a positive change in the area of law enforcement by making a 
commitment to action in at least three areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we should reform the youth criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we should build safe communities through the promotion 
of anti-violence and by providing adult mentors for our young 
people, especially our youth at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we should give law enforcement agencies the resources 
they need to do their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last parliament, as the House is well aware, we put 
forward a number of amendments.  We will do the same in this 
parliament.  We put forth amendments to Bill C-3 and Bill C-68, 
and we plan to do the same for Bill C-11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill should be scrapped, but Liberal members are obviously 
unwilling to listen to the public.  We hope they will at least 
take a close look at our amendments which aim at improving this 
piece of legislation.

Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my friend opposite made a comment that there are not many 
weaknesses in Bill C-7.  I agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He refers to children 11 and under and says there are no 
repercussions.  Is he not aware that all provinces, to my 
knowledge, have youth protection agencies that intervene on a 
regular basis for those individuals?  Does he really want to jail 
a 10 year old? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His other point was about the frustration of our police 
officers.  Under the act our police officers will be the 
gatekeepers.  They will be at the front end.  Under the advice of 
crown attorneys they will be able to use their discretion.  Is 
that not good?  Will it not address some of the concerns of the 
police at this time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am aware of the point 
the member made.  However the point we are making, if one follows 
the points our justice critic has made on the bill over the past 
months, is that the bill is fine in a perfect world.  However 
nothing in the bill guarantees funding to allow provinces to 
encourage the counselling and mentoring of youths through various 
agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We truly believe that must be part of it.  If one thing has hurt 
our youth justice system more than anything else, it is the lack 
of funding.  If the corrective approach is prevention, 
counselling and identifying children at risk, the hon. member has 
made a good point.  However we must have the resources to do 
that.  Unless they are there it simply will not happen.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only are our police forces going flat out to do the best, 
but so are our counsellors.  I was a teacher at one time.  The 
school systems simply do not have the resources to help young 
children at risk.  If they did, it could make all the difference 
in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the bill goes through, I hope the money would flow through 
the provinces to make sure the bill could be enacted or enforced 
and that we could prevent youth crime from occurring in the first 
place.  If it did occur we would have the rehabilitation services 
to move those young people on to better things. 
<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the member for his comments.  Reflecting on the 
fact that the member was a school teacher, the association of 
school board trustees was here last week lobbying each and every 
one of us to do something about the notification provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear the member's comments on the desire of 
teachers and school administrators that it be mandatory or 
automatic that they be notified when there is a violent offender 
or sex offender in the classroom.  I would like to hear the 
member's comments on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have been out of the 
teaching profession more than 25 years but I know some things 
have not changed in the school system.  When there is a 
disruptive influence in the classroom everyone is hurt.  Unless 
we have the resources to deal with the individual causing the 
disruption, everyone suffers.  That has not changed.  I know 
teachers have concerns about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the issue of violence I know the member has 
spent a tremendous amount of time on the bill.  He is speaking 
from experience that none of us, thank goodness, have ever had to 
live through in terms of violence and youth crime and so on. 
However when we look at the shootings in various high schools and 
institutions over the last number of years, especially in the 
U.S. but also in Canada, the common theme is that they were done 
by troubled people who had no one to help them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without such help nothing changes because we have no idea, or we 
cannot say categorically, what kinds of homes those young people 
come from.  Obviously some come from what we consider good homes. 
What happens behind those walls none of us know.  I know parents 
do their best to deal with this, but teachers need professionals 
and support staff they can depend on.  That would avoid a lot of 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know some young people are the victims of teasing, taunting 
and peer groups and so on.  However putting up with young people 
who are subjected to that, and who then vent their emotions on an 
entire classroom, takes a lot out of a teacher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The teaching profession, unless I am wrong, would be very 
supportive of interventionist moneys or resources to help the 
problem.  Unless the problem is addressed and there is honest 
dialogue in terms of what is happening in the classroom, nothing 
will change.  We must pay attention to the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put resource people into the classroom.  Let us make the 
commitment to do that.  Such commitment means moneys from Ottawa. 
We must identify the problem and the federal government must 
finally stand up and say yes, we have the resources to help. That 
is what we want.  We want help in the classrooms of small towns, 
communities and cities across Canada.  We want something to 
happen.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to the hon. member's speech.  I 
note, in relation to the principles and purpose of youth 
sentencing, that subsection 38(1) asserts: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of sentencing under section 42 (youth sentences) is 
to contribute to the protection of society by holding a young 
person accountable for an offence through the imposition of just 
sanctions that have meaningful consequences for the young person 
and that promote his or her rehabilitation and reintegration into 
society. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member agree that this is a reasonable and 
sensible approach to the sentencing of youth criminals?  We are 
talking about people who have been convicted at this stage and 
are going on to sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, to sum up, we are in 
favour of rehabilitation and identifying youth at risk.  For the 
problem to end and violent crime to be addressed, a number of 
things must happen.  Problems must be identified before they 
happen.  There must be a sense of deterrent.  There must be 
financial resources to allow all provinces to have a solution 
that would work from one end of Canada to the other.  It would 
truly mean a financial commitment by the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the key to the entire problem is rehabilitation.  We 
must provide the resources to bring about rehabilitation in the 
classrooms, and we must provide police forces the tools with 
which to work.  Unfortunately it often comes down to financial 
resources, and that must be part and parcel of the package once 
the bill is passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to the bill today regarding youth criminal 
justice.  The bill will replace the Young Offenders Act.  It is a 
key part of the Government of Canada's youth justice renewal 
initiative, an initiative that is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had occasion recently to speak with a person involved in the 
issue of restorative justice.  We talked about the importance and 
the challenge of ensuring that justice is swift while at the same 
time guaranteeing the rights of an accused person.  That is a 
difficult balance.  We want to see matters brought to justice 
very quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for any person, but particularly young people, 
to understand there are consequences to a criminal act and to 
know what the consequences are.  It is important that such acts 
be dealt with swiftly.  Their consequences must be swift and the 
person responsible be held to account.  They must face the victim 
if that is appropriate.  They must face the community and 
confront the fact that their act has had a negative and terrible 
impact on the community.  That is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If young offenders are to overcome and get beyond what they have 
done, recognize they have done something wrong and grow and learn 
and change, they must be confronted fairly quickly with what has 
happened.  That is why restorative justice is a step in the right 
direction, and I am glad the Department of Justice is working on 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the other side of the challenge is that while justice 
must be swift we must ensure the rights of an accused person are 
protected.  As a judge said many years ago, it is better that ten 
guilty people go free than one innocent person be convicted. That 
is one of the golden threads of our legal justice system in 
Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT58"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new act will incorporate some very important new 
considerations.  It will incorporate the initiative's new 
approach to youth justice and it will form the backbone of a 
major restructuring of the youth justice system.  This 
restructuring has been going on since 1988.  Let us look at the 
key elements of the new bill and the principles it applies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preamble of the bill underlines the values, rights and 
responsibilities both of society and of young people in relation 
to youth crime.  Clearly we do have rights and responsibilities 
on both sides and our values are important.  What we are trying 
to do, obviously, is to teach or to inject those values, so to 
speak, into young people.  We are not always talking about people 
who are absolutely devoid of values.  Often we are talking about 
people who have strayed from those values, who have learned the 
basics but perhaps have made an important and fundamental error, 
in some cases a very serious error, and have strayed dramatically 
from those values.  However, in some cases, yes, they are people 
who do not appear to show any of the values that we think are 
important as a society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill sets out the most important objectives of the youth 
criminal justice system.  The objectives are to prevent crime, to 
rehabilitate and reintegrate offenders into society, and to 
ensure meaningful consequences for offences committed by young 
people so that they have the consequence of being confronted with 
their actions, of being brought to account to face the victim and 
recognize what they have done to someone, and also to face their 
community and recognize the impact on the community of what they 
have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I wish to advise you, by the way, that I will be 
splitting my time with the minister of state for youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principles of the bill recognize that these elements, 
pursued together, are the best way to protect the public and 
promote safer communities over the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk for a moment about the provisions of the bill 
regarding sentencing.  I mentioned a few minutes earlier, and I 
want to repeat, what subclause 38(1) of the bill says.  I think 
it is a very important provision of this bill.  It is important 
to understand what the bill is all about and what the idea of 
sentencing is all about within the new youth criminal justice 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Subclause 38(1) asserts that the purpose of imposing a youth 
sentence is: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—to contribute to the protection of society by holding a young 
person accountable for an offence through the imposition of just 
sanctions that have meaningful consequences for the young person 
and that promote his or her rehabilitation and reintegration into 
society. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is very important.  We have to consider that.  Those who 
feel, for example, that all people under the age of 18 who are 
convicted of a criminal act should be in adult institutions, in 
adult prisons, ought to consider the impact of that.  Surely if 
we put a 15 year old or a 14 year old or a 13 year old into an 
adult prison facility, what we are doing, in effect, is helping 
him or her to be trained to become a more proficient criminal. 
Surely that is not an objective we ought to be endorsing or 
embracing for our youth criminal justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As this legislation states, the key purpose of youth sentences 
is to hold young people accountable for their crimes.  That is 
vital.  It is vital that they be held accountable and have to 
confront what they have done.  If there is any chance for reform 
or rehabilitation, they must first confront and be confronted 
with what they have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other key purpose, of course, is to contribute to the 
protection of society.  How can this be achieved?  There are a 
number of goals that the bill sets out.  For instance, it sets 
out that we can achieve these goals through interventions that 
are just; there must be justice in these interventions.  This can 
be accomplished through community intervention, with 
incarceration for the most serious crimes.  Community 
intervention may work well in some cases.  I think it is 
important that we give it a try. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have already seen the idea of restorative justice, whereby 
young people are confronted by the community and particularly by 
the victims they have injured and are required to make 
restoration, not only to the victim but also to the community at 
large.  A crime is an attack not only on one person, on one 
family or on one resident, but is in effect an attack on our 
society and on the community in which the attack takes place. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1635"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT59"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important goal is that we ensure meaningful 
consequences.  Clearly the youth must recognize the severity of 
the crime, and the punishment should suit the crime.  These are 
very important objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it must promote rehabilitation and reintegration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that the bill goes a long way toward achieving 
those objectives.  Provisions in the bill will encourage 
community based sentences where appropriate, such as, for 
example, compensation for victims, community service and 
supervision in the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will allow the courts to impose adult sentences upon 
conviction when certain criteria are met.  It creates the 
presumption that adult sentences will be given to young people 14 
and older who are found guilty of murder, attempted murder, 
manslaughter or aggravated sexual assault or who are repeat 
serious violent offenders.  That is a very important provision, 
this presumption of an adult sentence, because it means that for 
serious crimes they will do serious time.  It means that young 
offenders can expect this if they are involved in serious violent 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, because we recognize that there are different 
situations in different parts of the country and we recognize 
that different provinces have had success with different models 
in relation to these issues, the provinces will have increased 
flexibility in regard to the age at which this presumption will 
apply within their jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly, it will create a new, intensive, rehabilitative custody 
and supervision sentence for the most violent high risk youth so 
that they get the treatment they need.  That is so important. Not 
only is it important that they be confronted with their actions 
but, particularly with the most violent youth, there is a real 
need for serious treatment.  These are people who obviously have 
severe problems and we have a great challenge in order to have a 
hope that people like this may at some point go back into 
society.  It is important that we find a way to give them good 
treatment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK189"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have a short question for my hon. colleague across the 
way.  He refers to clause 38 under “Sentencing, Purpose and 
Principles”.  I would ask the hon. member to explain to the 
House why we do not see any mention of deterrence or 
denunciation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Geoff Regan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have talked about justice 
and I have talked about meaningful consequences.  I think that 
when we talk about meaningful consequences, we talk about holding 
people to account and about the strong impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, a moment ago I mentioned something that relates 
directly to this.  I talked about adult sentences being given to 
people who are 14 years of age or older and who are found guilty 
of serious crimes. Clearly that is deterrence.  Clearly 
deterrence is part of this bill and part of what the provisions 
provide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the member does not find it in this particular phrase, 
but it talks about “holding a young person accountable for an 
offence through the imposition of just sanctions that have 
meaningful consequences for the young person” et cetera.  Those 
consequences are publicly known.  The fact that there are these 
consequences becomes public.  The person's peer group is 
certainly going to be aware of these consequences.  That is 
clearly a deterrent to further actions of this kind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, there not only needs to be deterrence but also 
treatment and rehabilitation.  There cannot be the imbalance of 
having one and not the other.  There has to be that combination. 
That is the challenge before us. 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the member for New Brunswick Southwest suggested to the House 
that there should be criminal sanctions to a parent for the 
offences of his or her child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member for Halifax West if he feels that 
punishing a bad parent is going to make him or her a good parent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Geoff Regan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it seems to me that this 
brings up a very interesting challenge for society, because how 
do we legislate good parenting?  On the other hand, how do we 
penalize parents who have maybe been good parents when, in spite 
of their best efforts, one of their children has engaged in 
criminal acts, particularly in violent criminal acts? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe that this permits simple solutions.  It might 
be attractive to say to throw the parent in jail or to penalize 
the parent in some severe way and that would solve the problem. I 
am not convinced that it will.  I am not convinced that this 
suggestion encompasses the reality that is out there, the reality 
of parents who have been good parents or of parents who have done 
their best but who may have limited ability, for whatever reason, 
because of their own background, to provide the parenting we 
would like to see them provide, to provide the level of parenting 
we would like to see ideally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that the idea of penalizing the parent is one 
that is not well founded.  At the same time, yes, we want to 
ensure that parents do a good job.  Perhaps there is some way 
that provinces could improve parenting training and perhaps there 
are other things that could be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly for children who are under the age of 12, where there 
are consequences under provincial laws, in some cases a child may 
be taken away from his or her parents because of this kind of 
situation.  However, to say that we can impose on one person a 
penalty for what someone else has done is so contrary to the 
fundamental principles of our justice system and of our legal 
system historically that I think it makes no sense.  I do not 
think we can we can go that far or accept that kind of a leap in 
that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this bill does provide a good balance between the 
challenge of bringing the youth to justice quickly and the 
challenge of making sure that the accused's rights are 
guaranteed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and 
Youth), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my honour and pleasure to 
speak today on the new youth criminal justice act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moderation is an ideal of virtue.  Aristotle is said to have 
defined virtue as the middle path between extremes of excess and 
deficiency.  It is the way of my party.  It is the middle path 
that we have chosen in placing the bill before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth criminal justice act replaces and improves upon the 
deficiencies of the Young Offenders Act.  It promotes what 
Canadians want to see in the youth justice system: 
accountability, respect, responsibility and fairness.  The act 
intends to promote these values by protecting the public and by 
preventing crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It ensures meaningful consequences for the full range of youth 
crime and, perhaps most important, ensures rehabilitating youth 
so that they can turn their lives around.  It represents what 
some would call a tougher but more just approach to tackling 
youth crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not an excessive bill.  It is a measured response to 
practical realities.  We have not caved in to the banal desires 
of the members of the parties opposite whose quick fix proposals 
to youth crime would be neither quick nor effective.  Might does 
not make right and justice should not be defined simply by 
whoever is strong enough to enforce it.  We have an obligation to 
look beyond an individual criminal act to seek solutions, to seek 
justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition, left to its own interests, would have us believe 
that compulsion is the only reason for obedience to authority, 
that jacking up sentences and restricting the youth justice 
process will lead to the reduction of youth crime.  The facts 
simply do not support their arguments.  If it were so, we would 
not have seen an overall reduction in crime rates in the last 
decade.  Canada's national crime rate fell by 5% in 1999, the 
eighth consecutive annual decline.  The youth crime rate is down 
4% from 1997-98 and down 13% from 1992-93. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While last year's overall crime rate was down by 4% in the 
Northwest Territories, youth crime is up, as it is in many parts 
of northern Canada. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1645"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT62"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT62"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1645

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These reductions have not resulted from tougher sanctions but 
from improvements made in education and in living conditions. The 
higher youth crime rates in the north and among aboriginal people 
poses a much more difficult issue.  Tougher sentences will not 
reduce the number of young aboriginal offenders.  There are other 
mitigating factors.  Many of them are social and others have to 
do with perhaps other disabilities that could be better addressed 
in another forum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Improving the living conditions of northerners, including our 
large aboriginal population, is the way to reduce poverty and 
crime rates.  It is a painful fact that aboriginal people 
represent an alarming 15% of the federal offender population but 
only 3% of the general population.  It is more alarming when one 
considers that the aboriginal offender population increased from 
1997 to 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tougher sentences will only ensure that aboriginal people will 
further increase their proportion of the federal inmate 
population.  That is not justice.  It is vindictive and 
ineffective.  We cannot just lock people away and hope that the 
problem will go away.  It has not worked, it does not work and it 
will not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why our party has taken a balanced approach.  We have 
adopted an aboriginal justice policy that tackles these issues 
directly.  Correctional Service Canada is working with aboriginal 
organizations to seek new ways to heal aboriginal offenders.  The 
legislation before us recognizes the unique needs of aboriginal 
young persons.  It recognizes the cultural differences of young 
aboriginal people, and that there are more effective ways to deal 
with young people than simply locking them up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Encouraging community involvement is one of the central 
components of our strategy.  We believe that community 
involvement is central to repatriating the justice system to 
aboriginal people, a system that for too long has been seen as a 
foreign system by many aboriginal youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some provincial correctional authorities report that aboriginal 
youth constitute 80% of the youth in their correctional 
facilities.  In my riding of the Northwest Territories it is 90%. 
The statistics are shameful.  However, the Leader of the 
Opposition's platform calls upon all Canadians to be treated 
equally regardless of race, sex, religion or ethnic origin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In building safer communities, the leader opposite also wants to 
play a leadership role internationally.  Can there be any better 
example of the ideological failure of that party and its 
platform?  Which country in the international community does that 
leader want to impress with these statistics? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not all.  He wants to get tougher on these aboriginal 
youth.  Clearly, there is another way.  It is found in the 
proposed legislation.  The proposed act would provide that 
measures should respect gender, ethnic, cultural and linguistic 
differences and respond to the needs of aboriginal young persons 
and young persons with special requirements.  Clearly there must 
be community involvement and we must try different approaches 
when dealing with young aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding justice committees have been established in 70% of 
our communities.  The act would encourage this practice.  These 
community committees would continue to play an important role in 
the development of extrajudicial measures that would be provided 
for in the new act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new act would encourage the use of non-custodial sentencing 
for youth.  This is in keeping with the Northwest Territories' 
commitment to apply a restorative justice approach.  These 
extrajudicial measures would be particularly appropriate when 
dealing with first-time offenders who commit minor offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new act would also provides for the use of conferencing 
which promotes community involvement in dealing with youth 
involved in the justice system.  We believe that the new act 
would respond to the needs of our justice system.  We believe the 
new act would be a marked improvement over the Young Offenders 
Act.  However, laws that provide a more effective framework for 
dealing with young offenders is only one small part of our 
government's approach to making Canada a better place for our 
young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have adopted an approach that cuts to the heart of the 
problem.  We have adopted a diverse and holistic approach to 
crime prevention, which attacks the social causes of crime. 
We are focusing on areas such as early childhood development, 
education and training for young people.  That is why we have 
supported the aboriginal headstart groups and developed 
multi-youth purpose centres for aboriginal people.  We are 
working to provide our youth with more opportunities so they will 
be less likely to come into conflict with the law.  We share the 
same goal; a society that is safe, secure and respectful of all 
citizens.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sad but a true commentary that the Leader of the 
Opposition spends more time on locking up young people than 
supporting entrepreneurs.  I had the opportunity to review the 
leader's aboriginal policies.  He talked about aboriginal 
policies on one page, maybe one-quarter or half a page.  That is 
all that was dedicated to aboriginal people.  He talked about 
equality for Canada's aboriginal people.  His definition of 
equality was as confused as his definition of justice.  The 
opposition leader believes that he must take away aboriginal 
rights and benefits to make aboriginal people equal.  What is 
more, this perverse logic is the cornerstone of that party's 
approach to social policy and the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It reminds me of one of the statements by the world renowned 
economist, John Kenneth Galbraith, who is to be recognized as an 
honorary officer of the Order of Canada next month.  In his book, 
the <I>Culture of Contentment</I>, Mr. Galbraith summed up the 
prevailing view of the contented middle class, and I believe the 
view of the party opposite: “To help the poor and middle 
classes, one must cut the taxes of the rich”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the party opposite wants to further help youth, 
aboriginal people and the poor by removing the public support 
system that is in place for them, including training and 
employment assistance.  That is not our way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe in a more holistic approach.  We believe that in 
addition to criminal sanction we must have a capacity and 
willingness to help young people when they get into trouble. Make 
no mistake, young people, including young aboriginal people, can 
continue to count on our government to help them obtain the tools 
and skills that will keep them out of the criminal justice system 
all together.  That is our way and that is the Canadian way.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. secretary of state, for 
whom I have a great deal of respect, for her heartfelt position 
on this and many other issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In her remarks she criticized the principle which guides the 
position of the Canadian Alliance with respect to the 
relationship between the Dominion of Canada and aboriginal 
peoples.  She suggested that equality is not an appropriate 
principle for those relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle of equality, which my party articulates in a 
classical small <I>l</I> liberal sense, is predicated on the 
ancient Liberal principle that ethnicity and race ought not to be 
a factor in a relationship between the state and the individual. 
This was a principle very strongly articulated by none other than 
the late right hon. Pierre Elliott Trudeau, and of course 
manifested in his 1971 white paper on Indian affairs, where he 
proposed a paradigm similar to the one articulated by the 
Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the minister reflect as to whether she thinks that Prime 
Minister Trudeau was wrong for advocating the same position?  She 
says that the Alliance simply wants to take rights away from 
aboriginal people when in fact what we want to do is for instance 
grant individual aboriginals property rights which in many cases 
they do not currently have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than a kind of confrontational approach, would she 
consider that there is some merit, certainly Pierre Trudeau saw 
it, in the kind of approach that we are advocating and perhaps a 
more constructive dialogue would be a better way to go forward? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is a world 
of difference between the definition that the right hon. Pierre 
Elliott Trudeau had for equality for this country under the 
constitution and the charter.  His definition was treating 
everyone the same does not equate to equality. 
Hence forthwith, Mr. Trudeau recognized that aboriginal people 
collectively had unique constitutional and legal rights and 
therefore recognized that in the constitution under section 
35(1).  Not only that but he took it one step further.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After a discussion at the constitutional conference and after 
listening and speaking to the great aboriginal leaders of this 
country such as George Erasmus, Jim Sinclair and David Ahenakew, 
Mr. Trudeau said that maybe they were right and that they should 
speak for themselves.  He suggested they be funded so they could 
have their own voice.  He therefore funded them.  Hence we have 
the National Indian Brotherhood of Canada and the Metis National 
Council of Canada. Those organizations were born with the will of 
the people and with the definition that man stood for, which is 
not the same as the member's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Treating people the same is not treating them equal.  If someone 
requires a wheelchair in order to get to the door, do we expect 
them to walk to the door if they do not have legs?  Do we expect 
people to perform the same?  They are equal with us.  Do we 
expect them to receive the same information if they cannot hear? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from the Atlantic is an expert on the disabled 
issue.  Treating them equally requires a different set of tools 
and mechanisms.  We cannot treat them equally under the law and 
in the institutions by giving them all the same things that 
everybody else has.  Perhaps there is a disadvantage.  Perhaps 
there is a gap in the barrier that they need to overcome which 
requires something extra special.  That is real equality. 
Equality is done with dignity and integrity.  It does not 
denigrate and is not premised on a negative motive.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Statistics Canada reported in 1998 that 106,984 youth aged 12 to 
17 were charged with a criminal code offence.  One in five youth 
were charged with a violent crime.  The rate of youth charged 
with violent crime is 77% higher than it was a decade ago.  By 
comparison, the increase for adults was only 6%.  Over the past 
decade the rate of female youth charged has increased twice as 
fast at 127% as compared with male youth which was 65%. 
Two-thirds of female youth were charged with common assault

be involved in more serious crimes such as robbery and major 
assaults than female youth.

“Students taking weapons to school are trying to protect 
themselves.  Nine percent of grade 7 to 12 students surveyed said 
they have taken a weapon to school”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In October 1999 an editorial in the Peterborough <I>Examiner</I> 
stated: “Adding to the already strict gun control laws is not 
going to achieve safer schools.  If laws aren't going to fix 
these problems what is?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statistics and the stories we read in our newspapers signal 
a dynamic societal change.  We see it but we do not know what to 
do so we pass more laws.  Instead of instilling in kids a sense 
of duty, we pass more laws restricting their freedom even more, 
which causes them to rebel even more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dramatic societal change such as illustrated in these news 
stories and statistics cannot be fixed only by legislation. 
Little of anything will be fixed by this particular piece of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was growing up this problem was non-existent.  The guns 
hung in the rack in the backroom and the kids knew exactly what 
the firearms were for.  We longed for the day when we would be 
old enough for our father to take us out in the bush to show us 
how to use the firearms safely.  We longed for the day when we 
would join our father and uncles in the hunt for birds and game 
for our table.

their neighbours' homes without being invited.  We played cops 
and robbers and cowboys and Indians and wore our cap pistols 
proudly on our hips, and none of us became homicidal maniacs. The 
only violence in our schools was a bit of fisticuffs and the 
penalty for brawling was a few licks of the strap from the 
principal.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It will take more than passing more laws to bring about the 
changes that the public is demanding.  Maybe we should be asking 
for the government to work with our communities and churches to 
develop programs to address the underlying reasons that are 
causing our young people to turn to violent crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of programs might that entail?  Studies have been done 
that show us the direction we must head.  There are even programs

I have the floor and I will tell them about them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A study conducted from 1993 to 1995 by the United States 
Department of Justice's office of juvenile justice and 
delinquency prevention tracked 4,000 male and female subjects 
aged 6 to 15 in Denver, Pittsburgh and Rochester. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the study's findings:  children who are given real guns by 
their parents don't commit gun crimes (zero percent); children 
who obtain guns illegally are likely to commit gun crimes (21 
percent); children who get guns from their parents are less 
likely to commit any kind of street crime (14 percent), children 
who have no gun in the house (24 percent), and are dramatically 
less likely to commit a crime than children who acquire an 
illegal gun (74 percent); boys who own legal firearms have much 
lower rates of delinquency and drug use than boys who obtain 
illegal guns, and are even slightly less delinquent than 
non-owners of guns.

part of a different crowd” as a result.  “It gives them 
pride”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gives them pride.  Would that not be something if we could 
give our young offenders back their pride? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I became a politician, I was a teacher.  One of my 
greatest accomplishments would be those occasions when I could 
instil one of my students with pride.  Hunting trips for troubled

hunts understands this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Randall Eaton, author of the book called <I>The Sacred Hunt:

only good for kids but it can also help rehabilitate young

food chain, and the food chain becomes a love chain when we 
participate directly in it”.

program in Idaho for wayward boys that teaches them the benefits 
of self-sufficiency.  Eaton said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know of three other such programs and I know they have turned 
around the lives of seriously aggressive young men.  Going out 
into the wilderness connects a youth with nature in a profound 
way and it also engenders respect for life, paradoxically enough 
by taking a life. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On <I>Canada AM</I> Eaton claimed that the Idaho program had an 
85% success rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a program worth looking at.  This is a program that 
every wildlife federation in every province would be willing to 
sponsor and manage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a true young offender program, one that sets kids back 
on the right course and one that brings about real change, 
societal change.  We should not only be thinking of passing more 
and more laws.  We have been going down that road for the last 30 
years and look where it has taken us.  We need to try some other 
things, things that work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After waiting seven years for a youth justice act, we finally 
have to ask:  Is this all we get?  I have offered a positive 
alternative that the government could incorporate in its 
legislation or practice.  The bill is too long, too complex and 
too expensive.  By following my suggestion, it could address all 
three of those problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I was listening to the government members as they 
argued in this debate that it was better to let 10 people go free 
than convict one innocent person.  I would like to propose that 
it is better to rehabilitate 10 young people than to cling to one 
ideological system that is not working.

Order 38 to inform the House that the questions to be raised

Vancouver Island North, the Environment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I sat and listened to the 
member opposite speak and I wondered in my own mind what it is 
with the reformed Alliance people that they love things American. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election we had members opposite talk about a two 
tier health system like the American system.  We knew they were 
going to strip away environmental protection laws, sort of like 
the Americans as well.  They would rip apart the judicial system. 
They would scrap our great charter of rights and freedoms.  They 
would go and rip apart the supply management system.  They would 
do all those kinds of things in the name of something great and 
good that is American.  I just do not understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have the audacity of the member opposite to somehow link 
our young people with guns.  I think what he actually said was 
that to set them back on the right road we should give them a 
gun.  We have to think about this for a minute.  We just saw not 
so long ago in California, not once but twice, kids walking into 
schools with guns.  As a former school teacher and a former head 
of the Waterloo Regional Police, this is not the Canadian way. 
This is not the way we should be going in terms of our young 
people, by giving them a gun.  It is outrageous and it is not in 
keeping with the values of our great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is simple.  Why is it that the reformed Alliance 
people always, and this member in particular, want to somehow 
connect American style guns with our justice system?  It does not 
make sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of

American style system?  Why would we go down that path?  Why 
would that member in particular and the Alliance in general 
want to advocate an American style system where kids walk into 
schools, pull guns and shoot other kids?  Why in God's name would 
they advocate that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know where 
the member was during my speech.  He completely misrepresented 
what I said.  I do not think his question merits an answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals would rather accept the violence growing in our 
society than take an idea that the opposition might offer, run 
with it and prove that it actually works, as has been proven in 
many parts of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would the Liberals want to mock a very good idea that really 
could reduce the violence in our society and help rehabilitate a 
lot of young people, by labelling it?  When we label something in 
an attempt to not engage in a decent discussion, it really smacks 
of—well, I will let you fill in the blanks there, Mr. Speaker, 
because I do not want to engage in the kind of debate where we 
just throw labels at each other and we do not debate the ideas 
that I have seriously put forward. 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
through you, I would just like to ask the member a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Your suggestion is, as I understand you— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I just want to remind the hon. member 
to please direct his question through the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Sorry, Mr. Speaker.  The member's 
suggestion, as I understood him, is that somehow gun control has 
taken away the ability for hunting trips to take place.  I think 
the idea of involving youth in hunting activities, target 
shooting or anything of that nature is really not much different 
than involving them in hockey or other activities in the 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am curious as to why the member would draw the parallel that 
somehow gun control prohibits young people from being involved in 
that kind of activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, again that is not what 
I said.  I would ask the member to check <I>Hansard</I> and read 
it very carefully.  A direct answer to what he just asked is that 
it is not the same as getting kids involved in hockey.  This a 
very different program.  I would ask the member to go and check 
the record because I do not have five minutes to re-explain it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Spencer (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to speak to the broader issue 
of dealing with youth rather than getting into the details of the 
amendment.  I will do that by asking at least four questions, to 
which I will give some answers.  I understand that in the House 
we do not always get answers to questions, so I will try to 
provide my own as I go through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first question is:  With whom are we dealing?  It sounds 
like a very simple question because obviously we know we are 
dealing with youth under 18 years of age.  We are not sure 
whether that should go down to 12 or 10 years but we are sure 
that it is youth under 18 years of age.  What does that mean? Who 
are these people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was severely shocked about 20 years ago when I walked out to 
my backyard in Regina and heard some kindergarten children and 
first graders using language that I had never heard in my youth 
all the way through high school.  I came from the sticks, as the 
House can tell, but I had never heard that kind of language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I realized was that we live in an age where the age of 
participation in violent and vulgar activities is becoming lower 
and lower. 
It is a declining age of awareness and involvement.  We are 
dealing with young people who are in that kind of time.

couple of years ago one offender in our town was up on his 85th 
car theft charge.  Something is wrong when we allow one young 
person to accumulate 85 car thefts charges in one lifetime in one 
town.  We are in an age of when these things are happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also dealing with young people who are in some cases 
basically rebelling against any authority in their lives. Perhaps 
they are out and making a laughing stock of police, teachers, 
parents or any authority figure in their lives.  That is going 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also young people out there who are crying out for 
some authority to be exercised in their lives.  They do not 
experience the restraint from teachers and parents that teenagers 
require to develop properly.  We are dealing with that kind of a 
young person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with young people who commit crimes against their 
communities.  We are also dealing with young people who have been 
victims of other young people's crimes.  Almost two-thirds of 
youth crime is committed against other youths.  We need to take a 
good look and get an understanding of what kind of person we are 
dealing with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go any further, let me also say who we are not dealing 
with.  We are not dealing with some of the finest young people 
who have ever been born, some very bright students, some keen 
personalities, some who have tremendous athletic ability and 
academic ability and who participate in many things.  We are told 
in our town that 80% of the youth crime is done by only 20% of 
the youths. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some tremendous young people in my riding.  I would like 
to call attention to a young lady named Brea Burgess, a key 
player in the Regina Lady Cougars basketball team for the 
University of Regina.  They won the national championship a 
couple of weeks ago.  She attended the Dr. Hanna School as a 
young elementary student where my wife teaches and then Thom 
Collegiate.  I know her parents Laurie and Spencer Burgess are 
very happy about this fine young lady who is not a young offender 
and who displays all this great talent.  I commend those proud 
parents for their wonderful daughter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just how are we dealing with the youth crime problem?  I believe 
that we insult their intelligence in the way we deal with the 
problem.  They understand much more than we give them credit for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have an eight year old grandson.  I have him come and visit us 
and stay with us about one weekend a month.  Every once in a 
while he puts on the front of being a baby.  He tries to convince 
me and his grandmother that he is a baby, and yet we know that he 
knows much more than that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that somehow the youth of the nation have been 
quite successful in duping adults into believing that they are 
not intelligent and that they are incapable of making adult 
decisions.  At the age of 11 or 12 my youngest son, who is now 
23, came to me and declared that he had known right from wrong 
ever since he was 10 years old or younger.  He said when they say 
they do not know what they are doing, they are not telling the 
truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have young offenders who certainly know how to work the 
system.  They are smart enough to know that.  Some years ago a 
man taught me how to finish concrete and he told me that learning 
to finish concrete was very simple.  He said there was only one 
thing required: to be just a little smarter than the concrete. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to making laws and dealing with young offenders, 
perhaps that would be a good guideline for us too: to be just a 
little smarter than young people to be able to figure out how to 
best help them.  I think we are failing them on that point. 
Lawmakers, enforcers, teachers and parents all need to be ahead 
of our young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We insult their intelligence.  I believe we also strip them of 
responsibility and accountability.  We take responsibility and 
accountability away from the parents.  We take it away from the 
teachers.  Then we take it away from our young people.  We tell 
little Johnny, if he is bad, that we will not tell anyone.  He 
will not be accountable.  We do not want him to feel badly about 
it.  We know he will grow out of it when he gets older.  We turn 
our heads away and forget that they need a sense of 
responsibility and accountability.  We simply pretend that they 
are innocent little kiddies, too little to understand, and that 
is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We take away their opportunity to experience positive peer 
pressure, leaving them subject only to the others around them who 
are encouraging their offending activity.  This is what I mean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If someone in the community knows what is happening with a young 
offender, if someone knows what is going on in his life and that 
young offender knows the person knows, there is peer pressure on 
him, some kind of community pressure.  If he knows the teacher 
knows, there is pressure on him.  If he knows the other students 
know what he is like, there is pressure on him.  It seems that we 
want to insulate him, protect him and keep him from having any 
kind of positive peer pressure, which only throws him to the 
negative peer pressure that is readily available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have in my hand some notes that were taken this past weekend 
as I met with some salvation army officers who had been flown to 
somewhere in southern Ontario to meet with the justice minister. 
There is a list of oppositions.  Let me quickly name three of 
them.  They oppose the legislation because there is no provision 
to make parents responsible.  It fails to address the root cause 
of youth crime.  There is no provision to reverse existing 
standards regarding rights.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened with some interest 
to the member opposite.  It seems to me that it was not unlike 
the usual position of the reform alliance, that it sees things in 
black and white instead of with all the nuances, especially in 
such an important area where there are incredible nuances when it 
comes to our young people and the protection of society and the 
security of our communities, our neighbourhoods, our provinces 
and our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind him, as I remind all members in the House, that not 
only is overall crime dropping but crime among our young people 
is declining. 
Why is that?  It is because we have in place and we continue as a 
government to put in place the kinds of measures that are 
appropriate given the circumstances of the 21st century.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing I do know is that our young people have enormous 
capability to rehabilitate.  Given the right circumstances and 
the right assistance, the kind of backing and crime prevention 
members of the government have put into place, we are on the 
right track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of making criminals out of young people as they would 
do, instead of dropping the age and making them pay and pay big, 
that real vengeance mentality which it seems only the reform 
alliance people have, and instead of trying to do those kinds of 
things in the most audacious fashion, we should be doing the 
things we are doing at present: rehabilitating with crime 
prevention and the kinds of programs necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would publishing names, for example, as they would do, embarrass 
the parents?  Would it embarrass siblings so that when they go to 
school they get it rubbed in their faces?  I do not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not our Canada.  It is not my Canada.  I do not believe 
it is most Canadians' Canada.  We want to ensure a good and 
balanced system.  We want an equilibrium kind of system and that 
is what the government is presenting today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the member's speech and his background, why do members of 
the reform alliance party in general want to fearmonger and scare 
Canadians into somehow believing that crime is out of control 
when it is not?  What do they hope to gain by that kind of 
nonsense? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I regret to interrupt but when the hon. member is asking 
questions with respect to the official opposition of Canada he 
always refers to it as the reform alliance.  He should address it 
by its proper name, the Canadian Alliance, so that at least he is 
referring to the right party in the spirit of asking the 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I do not think that is a point of 
order, but certainly I think everyone recognizes that each party 
should be called by its official name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Spencer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not sure the hon. 
member across understands.  I certainly am not a vengeful person. 
I am a grandfather and a father.  I have worked with youth in the 
community for years.  My wife is two years away from retirement 
as a school teacher.  Many of her friends and my friends are 
school teachers.  I hear what they say.  I hear what is going on 
in the school grounds and the school systems as they deal with 
young people.  I am friends with RCMP people and many others in 
my community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the consensus of the people I know that young people are 
not being done a favour by being allowed to operate under a veil 
of secrecy.  Peer pressure is very powerful in the life of a 
young person.  If we do this properly we will allow some positive 
community pressure to come to bear on the young person and on the 
family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the statistics, who is to say what the crime rates really 
are?  In our town if there is a near riot of young people outside 
my window, which happens many times, or there is fighting going 
on and an exchange of drugs, if we call the police they do not 
come because they know there is no use dealing with young people 
under the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last summer I was approached by four young people in my own 
front yard and threatened simply because I wrote down a licence 
number.  Night after night in that park there are drug exchanges 
and the police will not even bother because they know it involves 
young people and there is no use dealing with them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I would 
like to advise you that I will be sharing my time with the hon. 
member for Mississauga West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to speak to Bill C-7, especially since I have taken 
a keen interest in the debate surrounding the proposed reform of 
the youth criminal justice act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I got involved by reading and listening carefully to the 
concerns expressed by stakeholders in Quebec and by meeting with 
concerned stakeholders at the Centre jeunesse 
Chaudière—Appalaches last week. I am pleased to have been able 
to gather additional information on the substance of Bill C-7. I 
have thus been able to rectify some of the ideas which have been 
circulating regarding the scope of Bill C-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am now in a position to say that the bill, which builds on 
the strengths of the current act which Quebec has taken advantage 
of, has allowed the province not only to follow through with the 
elements of its approach which have proved successful, but also 
to improve on its approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To illustrate what I am saying I will review some of the 
fundamental principles underlying Bill C-7. In parallel I will 
highlight some of the opposition's criticisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Quebec coalition, this reform is not necessary. 
It suggests that the problem, if there is a problem, is the 
result of the Young Offenders Act not being properly implemented 
by some jurisdictions. Data from studies carried out over the 
last few years and extensive consultations with the provinces, 
territories and various specialists in the area have identified 
several problems in the way the current youth justice system is 
working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It bears reminding, among others, that Canada has the highest 
rate of young offenders in custody, the highest one in the 
industrialized countries, higher yet than in the U.S. It is also 
four times higher than that for adults. Average sentence length 
for minor offences is longer for young offenders than for adults. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of an approach which, in many regards, is consistent 
with the goals of Bill C-7, Quebec is not an exception to the 
rule with regard to the identified problems. 
Quebec has the second highest rate of custody for young persons 
found guilty of a first minor offence. The average custody 
sentence in Quebec is longer than the national average and the 
second longest in Canada. In fact, what is surprising is that 
the rate of participation in alternative measures is higher in 
western Canada than it is in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To solve these problems, Bill C-7 focuses on diversion measures 
that still aim at making young persons more responsible. 
Bill C-7 is based on experiments carried out in various European 
countries as well as in Australia and New Zealand, that show 
that informal measures focusing on responsibility for one's own 
actions and restitution have more impact than formal court 
proceedings not only on the level of responsibility the young 
person is ready to acknowledge but also on the recidivism rate, 
which is almost nil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government's main goal in its reform is to reduce 
the use of the formal system in order to fight youth crime. We 
are providing various options and better tools to the workers on 
the front line, so that minor offences can be dealt with 
responsibly outside the court system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that mean in real terms? The opposition argues that 
Quebec will no longer be able to take the appropriate measure at 
the appropriate time to fight early signs of delinquent 
behaviour. 
The opposition uses examples of young people committing multiple 
shoplifting offences saying that the only possible intervention 
by a police officer would be a warning, thereby ridiculing 
police intervention and leading people to believe that Bill C-7 
does not allow for effective intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most troubling thing about these remarks is that they are 
based on the assumption that custody can be used to rehabilitate 
young offenders and to turn them into responsible persons. This 
assumption goes against what can be learned from criminology 
research and what has been seen in other countries that have 
chosen less repressive measures to make their young offenders 
more responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill favours diversion measures. These may vary, but they 
must be aimed at turning the young offender into a responsible 
person, at repairing any harm done and at rehabilitating him or 
her, which means changing his or her criminal behaviour as soon 
as it emerges.

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of shoplifting, to use the same example as the 
opposition, a police officer can exercise discretion under Bill 
C-7, which is not the case under the current legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The police officer must first decide whether or not to make an 
arrest. If the decision is made to arrest the young offender, 
the police officer must then determine if the young offender 
qualifies for diversion measures or if he or she must be 
charged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If charges are brought, the police officer must choose between 
release and temporary custody. If he or she chooses release, he 
or she will have to determine the conditions of such release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the police officer decides to make the young person take 
responsibility through a diversion program, he can choose, based 
on the circumstances of the offence and on the young offender, 
between a warning, a caution, a referral to a specialized 
educational program—for example to learn behavioural skills—or a 
referral to a community organization that can help the young 
person not to commit other offences. What is meant here is 
community work and other measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a case of shoplifting, the police officer would probably give 
a warning or administer a caution after seeing that the goods 
were given back, to ensure that the young offender has taken 
responsibility and has made reparation. The warning or caution 
is given verbally and in writing, through a letter and a 
follow-up with the parents, to inform them of the young person's 
actions, of the measures taken and of the possible consequences 
should he commit other offences. This is the rehabilitation 
component. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Experience shows that the majority of young offenders who are 
subjected to this follow up do not commit other offences. Most 
parents take measures with regard to their young offender, thus 
increasing the chances for complete rehabilitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such measures will be compiled in an automated retrieval system 
that will be accessible by other police forces through an 
agreement on the exchange of information. A $9 million budget 
was allocated to the various jurisdictions to put in place or to 
improve the recording and management systems of automated files. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a young person commits other offences, the police officer can 
lay charges or resort to extrajudicial measures. 
These are more formal extrajudicial measures, ones that 
translate into structured programs customized to correct the 
delinquent behaviour, hold the young person accountable, and 
have him or her make amends for the harm caused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the police officer opts for the laying of charges, it is then 
up to the crown attorney to take the case before the court or to 
have a program of extrajudicial sanctions drawn up.  Once again, 
there will be follow up with the parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another presumption that is worrisome to opponents of Bill C-7 is 
the suggestion that making a young person accountable for his or 
her actions must of necessity involve diversion, a judge and 
cautions.  Such a presumption ignores the powers of front line 
interveners and the effectiveness of their interventions, and 
underestimates the community's capacity to correct criminal 
behaviours as soon as they first manifest themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-7 gives precedence to accountability outside of the formal 
system for less serious offences, because this is more effective 
and less costly, particularly since it allows intervention 
immediately after the offence has been committed and makes it 
possible for victims and communities to be involved in the 
process of healing and of social learning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, such an approach requires the introduction of new 
tools and new resources.  One might well believe that, with the 
$221 million offered to Quebec over five years under the youth 
justice services funding program, including over $25 million for 
implementation of the youth criminal justice act, Quebec would 
be in a position to establish customized programs to hold young 
offenders accountable, provide them with effective 
rehabilitation, and successfully reintegrate them into society.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member began his speech by saying that he had been at 
his local youth centre, the Maison des jeunes. Now that he has 
tried to tell us why he was opposed, I would like him to tell us 
why members of the Bloc Quebecois are not the only people in 
Quebec opposed to Bill C-7.  Many organizations are also opposed, 
such as the Association des maisons de jeunes du Québec, leading 
criminologists from the Université de Montréal, the Innu, the 
Jeune Barreau du Québec, the Association des avocats de la 
défense, as well as crown attorneys, the Quebec National 
Assembly—which, through a resolution unanimously supported by 
the Liberal and PQ members, opposed it—the Centres jeunesse du 
Québec, the Institut Pinel, the Centre de criminologie du Québec, 
the Association des policiers et des pompiers du Québec, and 
CLSCs from throughout Quebec, plus another 20 or so groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it that everyone has misunderstood and that he is right, or 
is there a difference between the two? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Drouin:</B> Mr. Speaker, first I want to point out that I 
made no mention of a nasty opposition.  That was certainly not 
my intention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I acknowledged in my remarks that the coalition 
representing all the groups mentioned by the hon. member was 
opposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, since the bill on young offenders was first tabled, the 
Liberal caucus has worked to improve it.  We have worked with 
the Minister of Justice and with the various stakeholders to 
ensure that our young people have the best means possible 
available to help salvage them in the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no doubt that Bill C-7 will prove indispensable.  We 
certainly do not think this bill is perfect.  Perfection does 
not exist. 
It will, however, improve the present system and enable people 
to salvage young people and make them better contributors to 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Beauce 
says that the Liberal caucus, particularly the Quebec Liberal 
caucus, clearly understood the objections of the individuals and 
associations that I mentioned earlier. They consulted in good 
faith and they amended the bill of the Minister of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the hon. member tell us if, after this long consultation 
process to introduce improvements and amendments, the coalition 
and the groups that I mentioned earlier are now in agreement 
with Bill C-7? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Drouin:</B> Mr. Speaker, this gives me an opportunity to 
make a correction by saying that I did not meet with the Maison 
des jeunes but, rather, with the Centres jeunesse de 
Chaudière—Appalaches— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</B> They are opposed to Bill C-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Drouin:</B> The member for Berthier—Montcalm is talking 
while I am giving my reply. If he will let me conclude, he will 
understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was saying that it is these Centres jeunesse that are 
responsible and they provided some arguments to the effect that 
there may be problems with Bill C-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we demonstrated, with statistics to back it up, that 
there was room for improvement and we are convinced that Bill 
C-7 will serve as a tool. 
I am convinced that Quebec will be able to make good use of it 
and remain a leader in certain areas, while improving the 
situation in others, since it is in last place or next to last 
place in certain areas. I think there is room for improvement 
when it comes to helping our young people.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
there are some critics from Quebec who feel that Bill C-7 is too 
tough.  On the other hand there is no hesitation in Quebec of 
utilizing the current transfer provisions under the Young 
Offenders Act to transfer young offenders from youth court to 
adult court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member for Beauce please explain this phenomenon and

C-7? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Claude Drouin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. 
Statistics for 1997-1998 show that Quebec and Manitoba were tied 
in first place for the number of transfers of young persons to 
adult courts, with 23. In 1998-1999, Quebec came in second, still 
with 23 transfers, behind Manitoba, while Ontario only had six. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some measures will provide alternatives to young persons to 
facilitate their reintegration into society with as little

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
there are a number of things that are obvious when we debate 
young offenders.  The summary of the bill suggests that we want 
to try to increase public confidence in the youth justice system. 
One of the difficulties with that is there are certain crimes 
that occur in society that we take greater offence with than 
others.  We had a debate in the House on the sex offender 
registry and there can be no crime more repugnant than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When young people get into trouble with the law, they cannot be 
named and they appear to get a slap on the wrist, headlines 
scream.  People get upset and the flames get fanned.  We get the 
impression that the Young Offenders Act, which the bill is 
designed to replace, will not solve the problems.  Young people 
will be running amok committing crimes, raping, pillaging, 
murdering and building a society that will fall apart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that the vast majority of young people who commit 
crimes do not commit rape, assault, aggravated assault, attempted 
murder or murder.  Surely to goodness we can arrive at an 
agreement on that.  The vast majority of young people who do 
commit crimes, commit crimes that need to be dealt with seriously 
but dealt with in some new creative way rather than just 
punishment.  We as a society should perhaps look at solutions on 
how to properly rehabilitate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A member opposite spoke about a young offender in western Canada 
who had been charged with 85 car thefts.  That is absurd and 
absolutely ridiculous.  We need to find out why that is 
happening.  We need to put a system in place that would allow 
society to address the problems that this young person is 
obviously having. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps we could agree that many of the people who commit youth 
crimes have other problems.  They may have been abused or they 
may have grown up in a less than supportive family.  There is no 
justification by any means, but perhaps there is an explanation 
as to why the young person went against the law.  That is not 
what we talk about in this place.  We talk about throwing away 
the key after three strikes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will check <I>Hansard</I> but I made notes on one of the 
speeches made by a member who quoted from a study.  It stated 
that kids did not shoot up schools before gun control.  He quoted 
another study that said that kids who have been taught how to use 
guns show more maturity and better attitudes.  The member went on 
to say that there are programs being recommended by himself and 
others that would teach our kids how to kill an animal.  They 
believe that it will somehow teach our young people the 
consequences of pulling the trigger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be clear here.  I have nothing against hunting 
whatsoever.  My oldest son, much to my amazement, hunts bears 
with a bow and arrow.  I do not know how in the world he ever got 
into that, but he loves it and he is a good sportsman.  He will 
go out with a gun with some friends and hunt for deer at the 
appropriate time. 
There is no background of that in my family, but that is his 
choice.  I have no difficulty whatsoever with that practice.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also recognize that hunting is an activity.  That was the 
point that I was trying to make for the hon. member.  It was the 
same issue as involving a young person in any organized activity. 
However, to suggest that gun control in some perverse way is 
preventing hunting clubs and other organizations from organizing 
hunting expeditions or taking young people out and teaching them 
how to target shoot is just absurd. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is what people in some parts of rural Canada want to do 
to get their children involved in an activity, by all means.  The 
difference is that under gun control they will be using a weapon 
that is registered.  Is that awful?  Maybe that would also teach 
them that it is no big deal and that maybe their parents should 
get over that fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard an hon. member say that he had heard some language that 
he could not imagine, that he had never heard before.  I am 
sitting here thinking, what could they have said?  We know all of 
the big bad words.  I raised three boys and, as a result of that, 
I had the wonderful opportunity and privilege of having young 
children around our house all the time.  We were involved in all 
the different activities in the community.  I am afraid I have to 
admit that the odd time we may have heard something a little 
stronger than ah, shucks come out of the mouths of some of these 
young competitive individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did any of them go astray?  We had young children come through 
our lives who got into trouble with the law, who may have been 
mixed up in some drugs.  Fortunately in most of the cases that I 
have seen the services have been there in the community.  Whether 
it was through the home, church, school, social services or 
working with the police, the services have been there in the 
community to help these young children get their lives back 
together again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I almost sit and marvel at the naiveté of some members who say 
they have never heard bad language like that.  The society our 
children have grown up in is dramatically different from our own. 
Times were fairly simple for those of us who grew up in the 50s 
and 60s compared to what these young children go through today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today everything is instantaneous.  There is instant 
gratification.  They watch the news at night or play video games 
and they see the violence.  These are realities.  Are we supposed 
to put our young people in cocoons and say that they will never 
be exposed to any of these kinds of problems?  Are we supposed to 
dwell on the fact, as one member opposite did, that somehow it 
was different in our day?  Of course it was different in our day. 
That is why we need to change the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If young offenders get charged with serious violent crimes, 
should we name them?  Should we put their picture on the front 
page?  I think not.  The bill would not allow that to happen. 
However, if they are convicted of a crime and they in turn 
receive an adult sentence, to be served in a youth facility, 
because there is absolutely no sense in putting young convicted 
criminals together with adult criminals as we would simply turn 
out an adult criminal, or if they have escaped and are considered 
dangerous, then their names could be publicized.  Simply throwing 
their names out, destroying their lives, and then finding out 
that they are innocent is not something that is based on justice 
at any age, and surely it is not based on justice in terms of 
Canada's youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many very positive points in the bill.  I wish we 
could talk about the positive stories of our young people instead 
of scaremongering and dwelling on the problems that are there. 
The bill will help fix many of these problems to ensure that 
young people who do run afoul of the law have an opportunity to 
get their lives back together again.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I could not help but notice from the lobby the member's 
speech.  He was saying that he did not want to restrict hunting 
and that he did not want to cause problems for hunters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if the hon. member owns firearms himself.  I will 
let him know that his government has spent in excess of $600 
million so far of taxpayer money.  If I divide that by 30 million 
people, that is $20 for every man, woman and child.  Not every 
man, woman and child owns a firearm.  Looking at the number of 
firearm owners, we could be looking at $100 per firearm owner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at what firearm owners are spending independently; 
looking at trigger locks the government is telling them they have 
to use; looking at a firearm's acquisition certificate, which is 
something I have applied for; and looking at the hunter education 
courses the government asks people to take, that is all money as 
well.  A person is looking at several hundred dollars for owning 
of one firearm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the hon. member to stand in the House and say that even 
though he wants to impose a restriction of several hundred 
dollars for any firearm owned, that somehow that is not a 
restriction is ludicrous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the same token, I will lay the blame at his feet for some of 
the criminal problems in the country.  His government dabbles 
around with criminal justice instead of coming up with a sex 
offender registry.  It does not go ahead and get rid of early 
parole for rapists and other types of offenders.  It does not 
change the law.  His own members in the House want to come up 
with consecutive sentences so that people who commit multiple 
crimes do not serve one single sentence but instead serve 
multiple criminal convictions one on top of the other for their 
offences.  When it will not act on some of the various criminal 
provisions, it in a sense creates a hothouse environment for 
criminals to breed in, to be attracted to.  Hence we see those 
types of people abusing those laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His government will not go ahead and crack down on child 
pornography and pedophilia.  It allows people to possess these 
things and to profit from keeping the avails of these types of 
activities.  It only encourages these types of activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could he say that several hundred dollars for owning one 
firearm is not a restriction?  How could he claim that he is 
doing a good job on criminal justice when all these other 
provisions for getting at the real problem of crime are let go by 
his government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is almost incredulous 
and astounding.  I thought we were dealing with the young 
offenders situation, the new bill for Canadian youth justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. friend's party's official name is the Canadian 
Conservative Reform Alliance Party or something like that.  I did 
not know we were dealing with their views on gun control.  How 
could a party with any credibility whatsoever stand up, speaker 
after speaker, to talk about all these issues as if they somehow 
cause youth crime? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could members in the House stand by statements made by a 
member that kids did not shoot up schools before gun control?  We 
are supposed to extrapolate from that twisted logic that somehow 
the minute we brought in gun control and Charlton Heston was busy 
writing their policy manuals, kids ran out and obtained guns 
because of gun control and started shooting their peers in class. 
That is just bizarre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It demonstrates the major difference between the government and 
the opposition.  If they want to lay the blame for gun control at 
my feet, they can lay it at my feet.  They can put it on my 
shoulders and I will stand truly tall and proud.  I will say that 
Canadians want and believe in gun control.  They do not believe 
in the American style system as espoused by Charlton Heston and 
other people like some members opposite.

the bill addresses many of the deficiencies in youth justice. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to 
participate in the debate on Bill C-7, the Liberal government's 
latest attempt to replace the Young Offenders Act with new youth 
criminal justice legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All my colleagues in the Canadian Alliance have tried hard to 
improve the youth criminal justice legislation.  In particular, I 
would commend my neighbour, the hon. member for Surrey North, for 
his contribution in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides principles, procedures and protections for the 
prosecution of young persons under criminal and other federal 
laws.  It is the third attempt by the government to bring forth 
young offenders legislation.  The bill, with very few changes, is 
the same as what has been introduced previously.  This version of 
the bill has been updated just to include over 160 technical 
amendments from the last government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some specifics.  The list of offences for which adult 
sentences may be imposed is severely limited.  The goal of 
sentencing is solely to contribute to the protection of society 
by having meaningful consequences for young persons which promote 
rehabilitation and reintegration, so the goal of protection of 
society is hardly a concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even for offences that could be treated in adult court, the 
judge must first consider the least restrictive sentence and only 
impose adult sentencing as a last resort.  Maximum sentencing has 
not changed for youth sentencing purposes.  It is still ten years 
for murder, with six years in custody and four years under 
supervision in the community; seven years for second degree 
murder, with four years in custody and three years under 
supervision; three years for any offence having an adult sentence 
of life imprisonment, with two years in custody and one year 
under supervision for all others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deterrent that society demands and needs to cause resistance 
to commit a crime is effectively not there.  Rather, the lack of 
serious consequences, commonly called the slap on the wrist, acts 
as a motivation for the youth to commit a crime or for the youth 
to be used to commit a crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read from the Canadian Alliance policy book, which of 
course is dictated by our grassroots membership, unlike the 
policies of any other political party in the House.  Sections 28 
and 30 state: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will make providing safety and security for Canadians, their 
families and their property the overriding objective of the 
criminal justice system.  We will support rehabilitation programs 
designed to safely restore offenders to society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will introduce measures to hold young lawbreakers accountable 
to their victims and the larger community.  We recognize that 
custody is not always the most effective way of dealing with 
young offenders.  Detention facilities for youth will be separate 
and emphasize skills training, responsibility, and community 
service.  Violent or serious repeat offenders 14 and over will be 
tried as adults, as will all offenders 16 and over. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In various ways this legislation seems to place the safety and 
security of Canadians behind the interest in rehabilitating and 
reintegrating the offenders back into society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have attempted to encourage the government to amend the bill 
to make it clear that protection of the public is to be the 
paramount principle behind this legislation, but the minister 
refuses. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1805"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT78"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT78"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1805

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation does not ensure that violent or serious repeat 
offenders will be tried as adults.  We have proposed amendments 
to previous portions of the bill to limit extrajudicial measures 
to first time non-violent offenders.  This means no court, no 
criminal record and community designed informal types of 
sanctions or punishment.  Again the minister refuses to accede to 
this request.  Repeat and violent offenders may never have to see 
court, be convicted and receive a criminal record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the justice committee and the Canadian Alliance through 
its former version, the Reform Party, that first endorsed 
alternative measures for first time non-violent offenders.  The 
minister claims credit, but she once again fails to restrict this 
form of conditional sentencing.  It is open to repeat offenders 
and it is open to violent offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list of presumptive offences for which an adult sentence may 
be imposed is severely restricted.  The list includes murder, 
attempted murder, manslaughter and aggravated sexual assault.  It 
does not include sexual assault with a weapon, hostage taking, 
aggravated assault, kidnapping and a host of other serious 
violent offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-7 the minister has further weakened the legislation by 
limiting presumptive offence procedure even more.  Through clause 
61, any province may decide that only 15 year old or even 16 year 
old offenders who commit offences such as murder could be 
transferred to adult court, while 10 year olds and 11 year olds 
would still not be held criminally responsible for their crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation will create a patchwork or checkerboard system 
of youth justice, as many of its provisions permit the provinces 
undue discretion in whether to seek adult sentencing, in 
publication of names and in access to records, to name just a 
few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation provides some movement toward victims' rights, 
but even they are not ensured and are still woefully inadequate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has not been open to change for any aspect of the 
legislation except for some technical amendments.  All of the 
opposition parties except the Bloc presented substantive 
amendments to the former bill, Bill C-3.  Those amendments did 
not receive debate in parliament and do not appear to have been 
considered by the government.  In fact, the government is not 
serious about discussion, so the Liberals are ignoring those 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces would be tasked to administer this legal 
nightmare, but the federal government does not seem to care.  The 
Liberals have promised $206 million over the first three years 
for the implementation of the bill, but this would not even come 
close to meeting the responsibility of providing 50% of the 
funding for the youth justice system.  The Liberals have allowed 
federal funding to slip to about 20%.  The provinces have to 
carry the can financially for these proposals, costs of which are 
going to dramatically rise through legal argument and procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An initial review of Bill C-7 indicates that the government has 
made it even weaker, likely to appease the Quebec government and 
the Bloc Quebecois.  For instance, the presumptive offence 
provision that moves youths 14 years of age and older 
automatically to adult court for murder, et cetera, now permits 
the provinces, Quebec in this case, to raise the age to restrict 
the transfer to only 15 year old or 16 year old offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Restrictions on naming of violent offenders are still not taken 
into consideration.  The bill still has an emphasis on attempting 
to understand the circumstances underlying the criminal behaviour 
and rehabilitation and reintegration.  Protection of the public 
takes second fiddle.  Denunciation and deterrence seem to be 
foreign words for the government.

cause horrendous delays.  The costs to our youth criminal justice 
process in legal bills will be phenomenal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion I would like to say that the official opposition 
carries on with its job of holding the flashlight and showing the 
Liberals their darkness.  We gave the Liberal members a chance to 
improve on the legislation.  They should look at our amendments 
through the lens of issues, not political stripes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like the member who spoke to perhaps expand a 
little on one of the recommendations the Canadian Alliance was 
bringing forward, and I certainly want to congratulate my 
seatmate, the member for Surrey North, for all the work he has 
done on the issue and for the expertise he brings to the table 
when we are discussing this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things we in our party want implemented is that we 
want to let Canadians know who the repeat violent offenders are 
who get charged under the new act.  We feel that Canadians and 
society in general have a right to know that.  We are saying that 
if it is a serious crime or if it is a repeat crime, we should be 
publishing the name of the offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would just like the member to expand a bit on that and to 
perhaps let the House know of some of the instances he is 
familiar with in his own riding where publishing the names has 
been something that Canadians have been asking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his excellent question.  We all hear some horrendous stories 
in our communities.  Unfortunately, youth are involved in many of 
them.  Not all youth are bad.  Many youth are very good and very 
well behaved and they understand what is good, what is bad, what 
is wrong and what is right.  However, some youth who are involved 
in those activities may be well known to the police or at least 
the community understands those instances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Surrey Central some time ago an old man who was a war veteran 
was beaten to death.  He had 104 stitches on his face and body 
and died of his injuries.  The police force did its job.  They 
got hold of the people responsible for the incident.  To my 
dismay, and to the dismay of many other members in the community, 
some youths were involved in the incident, youths who had already 
had dealings with the police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Young Offenders Act had been improved as suggested by my 
colleague and by us on this side of the House—we are trying our 
best to make improvements and to suggest amendments—then 
probably those offenders would have been known.  Those offenders 
would have had some sort of repercussions from or consequences of 
what they had done in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important issue.  We would like to see the 
government look through the lens of issues, as I said, and make 
those amendments and improvements to the bill and really make it 
an effective bill to protect society and our communities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on February 2, I asked the Minister 
of Health a question about the critical shortage of MRI scanners 
in Canada today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I referred to the example of Ontario where the wait lists have 
increased to 12,000 people per year.  In Ottawa hospitals alone 
the waiting list is 7,000 individuals.  This is but one example 
of the critical shortage of essential medical services available 
to Canadians today.  It is merely the tip of the iceberg of a 
much larger problem of the lack of access to health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a profound tragedy that today there is an expanding gap 
between the resources and the demand.  The situation is only 
getting worse.  For example, in my province of British Columbia 
between 1998 and 1999, the waiting lists for a knee replacement 
increased by 69% and for hip replacements by 90%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Across the board Canadians are not getting access to health 
care.  The reason is we have more expensive technologies and an 
aging population.  The population over the age of 65 will double 
in the next 20 years.  The outcome of this will be that the 
government will be forced to ration. 
As a result of that, the poor and middle class will pay the heavy 
price of the lack of access to essential health care services.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be fine for us to stick our heads in the sand and believe 
that we only have a small problem or to throw money at the 
situation and believe it will be resolved.  The absolute inaction 
of the government and its failure to work with the provinces is 
hurting the poor and middle class. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the hospital where I work, the waiting time to see an 
orthopaedic surgeon is three and a half years.  Imagine if we 
were the patients who needed a total knee replacement.  Imagine 
if we had twisted a knee or tore a ligament in our knee which 
required a scope.  Imagine having to wait three and a half years 
just to see the orthopaedic surgeon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to make some changes.  I am proposing that the 
government do the following.  For heaven's sake, act.  The 
government is not acting on this or having a rational debate on 
the most important issue affecting Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I beg the government to do the following.  Call together the 
public health care professionals, intellectuals and academics to 
build a plan to save our health care system, dealing not only 
with the issue of how we fund health care but also with the 
medical manpower crisis.  With respect to surgeons, 42% of them 
are over the age of 55.  With respect to gynaecologists and 
neurosurgeons, 40% of them are over the age of 55. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a critical lack of medical manpower in all medical 
specialities.  We will have a lack of 110,000 nurses in the next 
ten years.  This would be almost palatable if we saw action on 
resolving this issue. but unfortunately we do not see it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I plead with the government to pull together its 
provincial counterparts and sort these problems out now.  It 
could develop a plan of action to deal with the funding crisis. 
It could develop the best practices from around the world. 
Prevention could be looked at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could implement the national headstart program 
which the House passed in 1998.  It is a pragmatic solution that 
will save people's lives and a great deal of money.  It focuses 
on making sure the children have their basic needs met in the 
first six to eight years of life.  As a result there will be a 
massive decrease in the demands that we place on our health care 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would ask for the help of the Government of Canada 
to act on this issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to tell our colleague 
the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca that the government is 
fully aware that in some regions of the country access to 
medical equipment is a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the government created a $1 billion medical 
equipment fund last September, in order to enable the provinces 
and territories to buy and install diagnostic and treatment 
equipment. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These funds, which were allocated on an equal per capita basis, 
have been made available through a trust arrangement since 
October 23, 2000.  As of last week Ontario, Alberta, 
Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island, Manitoba and British Columbia 
have already withdrawn their full allocation, but not the other 
provinces. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judging by recent announcements made in Quebec, British Columbia 
and Ontario, it is quite clear that diagnostic equipment, 
including magnetic resonance imaging equipment, is a high 
priority for many provinces. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of the first minister's agreement in September 2000, 
governments committed to providing appropriate and timely access 
to diagnostic treatment services.  This $1 billion infusion of 
funds, specifically for medical equipment, is in addition to the 
substantial increase in cash transfers to the provinces and 
territories by more than $21 billion over the next five years. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the administration and delivery of health care services is 
clearly the responsibility of the provinces and territories, 
each government will determine its priorities with regard to 
investments in medical equipment. In keeping with the 
accountability provisions of the first ministers' agreement and 
of the trust fund, provinces will report publicly on the use of 
these funds. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada views timely access to needed 
diagnostic and treatment services as a high priority.

<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on Friday, March 2 I asked the 
Minister of the Environment an important question.  The minister 
was not here and neither was his junior minister which is 
unacceptable.  Here is the background to my original question, 
and I still want an answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 17 the minister unfairly compared the gas fired 
cogeneration plant in Campbell River on Vancouver Island with the 
proposed Sumas 2 plant in Washington state.  The minister 
incorrectly stated that the Vancouver Island plant was ten times 
as polluting per unit of power and that the province of B.C. 
should do better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister criticized the province as if he did not know that 
as part of a thorough environmental review, his own officials 
were part of the project approval.  I have the approval letter 
right here.  It is from Environment Canada, dated February 25, 
1998 and is addressed to the provincial environment office.  It 
says that: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—we would not disagree with...recommending they issue a project 
approval certificate for this project. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say that is a pretty strong endorsement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $220 million Campbell River plant was approved in 1998 and 
construction is now complete.  It is scheduled to go operational 
next month, and now the minister is criticizing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real facts are as follows.  The polluter label does not 
apply because this project will, in combination with boiler shut 
downs at the pulp mill, reduce overall nitrous oxides, sulphur 
dioxide and carbon monoxide from current levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new steam source means that Elk Falls can shut down two 
wood-oil fired burners and reduce the use of a gas fired boiler. 
This reduces the mill energy requirements and total emissions. In 
addition, sulphur emissions were originally projected based on a 
much higher sulphur content in the natural gas supply locally 
than has been demonstrated to be the actual case.  The Vancouver 
Island plant compares very favourably for sulphur dioxide 
emissions once this correct sulphur content is taken into 
account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is apparently totally unaware of this fact.  The 
$240 million project is environmentally sound, creates jobs and 
helps the economics of the pulp mill.  It is no wonder that it 
received great endorsements from all sectors, until these 
unfortunate statements by the minister which have outraged the 
mayor of Campbell River, baffled me and the provincial MLA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mayor wrote to the minister on February 19 consequent to the 
unwarranted criticisms the minister made a couple of days 
earlier.  It is now five weeks later and the minister has still 
not responded to this letter in any way.  The minister has done 
Vancouver Island a great disservice and particularly my 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the minister retract his unsubstantiated, incorrect 
and irresponsible criticisms of an enlightened energy project 
known as the island cogeneration project? 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Paradis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Environment Canada has 
no statutory decision making role for the island cogeneration 
project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This project was reviewed, assessed and approved in 1997-98 
under the provincial environmental assessment act.  Under that 
assessment process, Environment Canada officials provided review 
comments in relation to a number of issues in which the federal 
government has an interest, such as greenhouse gases that result 
in climate change.  Environment Canada was satisfied with the 
greenhouse gas aspects of the environmental review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Sumas 2 power plant proposed for Whatcom county, just south 
of the international border in the Fraser Valley, is a 
controversial project notwithstanding the proposed use of some of 
the cleanest air emission control technologies available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians have expressed their opposition to that proposed 
power plant, as has the Minister of the Environment, because of 
concerns about the effect of air pollution on human health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The island cogeneration project will have higher emissions of 
air pollutants that affect human health per unit of electrical 
production than the proposed Sumas 2 project.

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given this, U.S. businessmen, legislators and the media have 
begun to allege that Canadian opposition to the Sumas power plant 
project is hypocritical.  If we wish Canadian criticism of U.S. 
energy proposals such as Sumas 2 to be credible, the clean 
technologies available, such as those proposed for Sumas 2, will 
have to be adopted and used at Canadian facilities such as Island 
Cogeneration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the challenge the Minister of Environment has already 
put to the province of British Columbia and to the greater 
Vancouver regional district. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look around outside.  The air pollution is clearly visible.  The 
health effects are insidious and hidden but real nonetheless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pollution affects not only our major urban cities but many 
smaller communities, particularly those in the valleys—

now deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly this House stands
