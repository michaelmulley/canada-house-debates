	The House resumed from May 6 consideration of Bill C-12, an 
act respecting employment insurance in Canada, as reported (with 
amendments) from the committee; and Motions Nos. 7 and 8
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on Bill C-12, as 
amended. It is legislation which Canadian workers, Canadian 
businesses and the Canadian economy so badly need.
<P>
	Let me begin with a reminder. Bill C-12 introduces reforms that 
will remove some of the inequities of unemployment insurance and 
provide a more fair and balanced regime. However, while bearing 
in mind that employment insurance will provide temporary income 
for some 2.4 million unemployed workers this year, we should also 
remember that Bill C-12 has another aim, the fundamental aim of 
boosting job creation and economic growth.
<P>
	It is designed to help people get back to work. It is designed to 
reinforce the social safety net by ensuring adequate income for 
those who are most in need, while at the same time reducing costs 
and meeting the government's budgetary requirements. It retains 
the structural objectives arising out of the Canada-wide 
consultations on the social security review. It strengthens work 
incentives and the insurance aspect of income support. It ensures 
fairness. It reduces and stabilizes premiums. It provides a 
simplified administration for employers. It will achieve a net 
savings of $1.2 billion by the year 2001-02.
<P>
	The EI system is a vast improvement over the old unemployment 
insurance regime. Eligibility will be based on hours of work rather 
than weeks. Weeks are a poor measure of work, particularly for part 
time workers and  those who hold down more than one job or those 
who work intensely for short periods.
<P>
	There are higher entrance requirements for new entrants and 
re-entrants; a necessary provision to stop the cycle of dependency, 
particularly among young people, that the UI system tends to 
engender.
<P>
<B>(1015 )</B>
<P>
	The maximum duration of benefits is reduced from 50 to 45 
weeks. This is a realistic period since 67 per cent of all claimants 
find a job within the first 40 weeks of unemployment. Those who 
cannot find work within 45 weeks obviously need help that goes 
beyond income support, once again a need the EI system will be 
able to provide.
<P>
	An increased clawback of benefits for high income claimants, 
particularly those who collect benefits on a regular basis, will make 
the system much fairer and will more accurately reflect the 
insurance aspects of the benefits.
<P>
	The reduced maximum insurable earnings will be brought more 
into line with the average industrial wages. Premium reductions 
and an establishment of a reserve in the EI account will stimulate 
employment. Premium increases during the last recession were 
estimated to have killed more than 200,000 jobs in Canada.
<P>
	Most important, $800 million of savings achieved by the EI will 
be reinvested in active re-employment benefits. It will change the 
system from a passive income support system to an active program 
for re-employment of Canadian workers most in need of assistance.
<P>
	There are significant differences not only in the unemployment 
rate but in the labour market conditions from region to region in 
Canada. Bill C-12 is specifically designed to take these differences 
into account.
<P>
	The situation in Atlantic Canada is a case in point. Employment 
insurance will help unemployed Atlantic Canadians get back to 
work. The system is the product of two years of consultation with 
Atlantic Canadians. Now it has been fine tuned by the Standing 
Committee on Human Resource Development to ensure regional 
sensitivity and adaptability.
<P>
	The basis of the new system will help Atlantic Canada's 
workforce. The hours based system will make it easier for many to 
qualify for benefits because all hours worked are now insurable. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2598"> 2598 </A></B>
<P>
The fact is that in the Atlantic  provinces 86 per cent of UI 
claimants already work 35 hours or more per week. They will find 
it at least as easy and more often easier to qualify under the new EI.
<P>
	Seasonal workers, of whom there are many in Atlantic Canada, 
will benefit under the EI because of the fact that they tend to work 
long hours each week. Remember that it is the hours that count and 
not the weeks.
<P>
	Part time workers will no longer be hampered by the artificial 
barrier of having to work a minimum of 15 hours per week before 
their work is insurable. We have all heard of employers who restrict 
their workers to less than 15 hours in order to avoid paying 
premiums under the current UI.
<P>
	Multiple job holders too will benefit by having all their work 
insured regardless of how many or how few hours they put into 
each separate job. Atlantic Canadians will particularly benefit from 
changes which have been made to the legislation setting out how 
benefits will be determined.
<P>
	Workers will be able to look back 26 weeks to find the earnings 
necessary to maximize their benefits. This will be particularly 
beneficial to workers in industries where there are breaks between 
the periods of employment. In a high unemployment region people 
can have 12 weeks of no earnings without reducing their benefit 
levels.
<P>
	The average earnings calculation is done by looking at total 
earnings in the last 26 weeks and dividing that total by the factor or 
divisor. The minimum divisor applied is the equivalent of two 
weeks above the regional minimum entrance requirement or the 
number of weeks worked up to 26, whichever is greater. Weekly 
benefits are set at 55 per cent of the resulting average earnings.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	The divisor rule is equitable and responsive to changes in 
employment conditions right across the country. It is designed to be 
particularly beneficial to workers in high unemployment regions.
<P>
	For all EI claimants, work incentive is boosted by the intensity 
rule. Claimants with more than 20 weeks of benefits in the previous 
five years will have their benefit rate reduced by one percentage 
point for each 20 weeks of past benefits, to a maximum of the 50 
per cent level. The intensity rule will not apply however to 
claimants who receive family income support. Also claimants who 
work while they are receiving EI benefits will be able to earn work 
credits to reduce the impact of the intensity rule.
<P>
	About 42,000 EI claimants in Atlantic Canada receiving a family 
income supplement will be exempt from the intensity rule. In all, 
about 53,000 Atlantic Canada claimants in low income families 
earning less than $26,000 a year and with children will be eligible 
for a family income supplement. On average the supplement is 
worth some $800 per family. Of course, claimants will  be able to 
earn $50 a week or 25 per cent of their EI benefit, whichever is 
greater, without affecting the benefit. As a result anyone receiving 
less than $200 in EI will be able to earn more without reducing 
their benefits at all.
<P>
	Atlantic Canadians will benefit under EI in more ways than from 
the income support benefits. The reinvestment of $800 million of 
EI funds in employment benefits will greatly benefit Atlantic 
Canada. Distribution of reinvested funds will ensure a fair regional 
balance. EI will result in a reduction in total income support 
payments across the country. But these impacts will be reduced by 
a reinvestment in active measures which will be disproportionately 
allocated to provinces most affected by the changes to the 
insurance benefits. We must also take into account the three year 
$300 million transitional jobs fund which will create an estimated 
15,000 new jobs in high unemployment regions across Canada.
<P>
	Another fact is benefits will still exceed premium contributions 
in Atlantic Canada. More than 60 per cent of UI claimants in 
Atlantic Canada claim benefits regularly. Even when the EI 
reforms have been fully phased in in the year 2001-02, Atlantic 
Canadians will receive substantially more benefits than they pay in 
premiums. The benefits to contributions ratio for example in 
Newfoundland will be $2.73 to $1 compared to 76 cents to $1 for 
Ontario.
<P>
	Finally we should bear in mind that the implementation of EI 
will be closely monitored and adjustments will be made where 
necessary. Some communities in Atlantic Canada will be selected 
for in depth studies of the effects of the new system. In all, Atlantic 
Canadians should welcome the advent of this fair, balanced and 
effective system to support them when needed and further to 
provide for their future employment.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 10A</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-12, in Clause 5, be amended by replacing lines 15 and 39, on page

8, with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``9. The Unemployment Insurance Act is amended by deleting subsections 
28(1), 28(2), 28(3) and 28(4).''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to this group of 
motions including Motion No. 10A, which I proposed and which is 
intended to return the Unemployment Insurance Act to the state it 
was before the Conservatives amended it to prevent a person 
wanting to receive unemployment insurance benefits from leaving 
voluntarily.
<P>
	Furthermore, someone dismissed by an employer subsequent to 
this amendment by the Conservatives is no longer entitled to UI 
benefits, short of a series of exceptions. However, so long as this 
person gets no confirmation by the employment centre that he left 
his job for reasons provided in the act, he gets no UI benefits.
<P>
	And if someone leaves simply because they are too tired or 
cannot continue, they are not entitled to receive UI benefits.
<P>
	I recall this amendment to the act by the Conservative Party, 
because the Liberals, who were in opposition at the time, were 
literally tearing their hair out over this amendment proposal. They 
criticized it up one side and down the other. They spoke 
emotionally in this House against it.
<P>
	Allow me now to read extracts of a letter the current Prime 
Minister, who was then the Leader of the Opposition, sent to all 
groups and individuals protesting against the Conservatives' 
amendment.
<P>
	He said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Thank you for your fax expressing your opposition to the legislative 
measures taken by the government to amend the unemployment insurance 
system.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I assure you that the Liberal Party shares your concern over this blow to the 
unemployed. And we do not believe that the recent superficial amendments 
alter the basically unfair nature of these measures.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Liberals are dismayed at these measures. By cutting benefits and further 
penalizing those who voluntarily leave their jobs, the government has clearly 
little concern for the victims of the economic crisis. Instead of attacking the 
problem at its roots, it is going after the unemployed. These measures will have 
distressing consequences, because they will discourage workers from reporting 
cases of harassment and unacceptable working conditions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Finally, you may rest assured that the Liberals will continue to demand the 
Conservatives withdraw this unfair bill.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	Are we dreaming? That was March 26, 1993. What is the Prime 
Minister doing now that he is in power? What are the Liberal 
members and ministers doing? They are making the situation 
worse.
<P>
	They are making it worse in a way that is hard to imagine 
because, by moving to an hour-based system, by forcing people to 
work two jobs, they came up with a clause whose true meaning we 
tried to find out from senior officials. We could not believe our 
eyes or our ears, as what the clause really says is this: If someone 
who works two jobs and manages to accumulate the number of 
weeks of insurable employment needed to qualify for UI benefits 
quits one of his two jobs, he loses all the benefits accumulated and 
must start over.
<P>
	Someone may have taken a second part time job as a term 
position because he needed the money or thought he could manage 
it. If he leaves one of the two jobs voluntarily because he cannot 
take it any more, he loses all the benefits accumulated until then. 
He must then start over. This means that he must find a second job 
once again and accumulate the number of hours required depending 
on the part of the country he lives in and on the unemployment rate.
<P>
	Did we ever see a more inconsistent policy? From 1993 to 
December 1995 and to this day, May 10, have we ever seen a more 
inconsistent policy? Have we ever seen a more drastic shift? This 
unforgivable attitude comes on top of the many changes in 
direction effected by that party since it came to office.
<P>
	As a result of this, how many people will be forced to continue, 
for all kinds of reasons, to work two jobs? And how many people 
who cannot take it any more will find  themselves without any kind 
of protection and vulnerable to everything, including being laid off 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2600"> 2600 </A></B>
<P>
from their remaining job, without having accumulated the required 
number of hours to qualify for benefits?
<P>
	This bill makes no sense at all; it does not even provide basic 
justice. When I hear the speeches of my colleagues who have been 
led to believe that this bill is a good bill and who claim it is just 
what Canadians were hoping for, I am outraged.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	I am outraged because this bill dramatically reduces the level of 
protection. With this bill, many people who used to have some 
financial security, as minimal as it may have been, will lose 
whatever little security they had. Yet, this security is essential in a 
democratic and civilized country concerned with sparing those who 
do not have the good fortune of being wealthy-and they are legion 
in this country-from dire situations.
<P>
	This measure will affect every person who needs two jobs to 
make a living because his or her full time job does not pay well 
enough. The worst hit will be those who have a part time job and 
need a second job to supplement their income. To put it bluntly, this 
measure will make the shift from a system based on the number of 
weeks to a system based on the number of hours of work 
unbearable if it means trapping people as never before in a situation 
they will unable to get out of.
<P>
	Against all hope, I dare hope, still, that this government will see 
reason. This measure is but one of many measures that fly in the 
face of reason. There is not an ounce of common sense in this bill 
the people across the way are trying to sell using arguments that 
have nothing to do with the actual measures contained in this bill.
<P>
	I urge our Liberal friends opposite to recognize that, far from 
acting on the statements and commitments made when the 
Conservative amendment was debated, they are in fact doing an 
about-turn, changing their tune completely. Instead of improving 
on the bill and making the Unemployment Insurance Act better, 
they made the act worse by increasingly shrinking the ranks of 
those who will be eligible for these benefits, which are absolutely 
essential. Our friends will have to account to the people for that.
<P>
	I cannot wait to see their reaction when the act will take effect 
and they will start feeling the huge pinch that comes from being 
denied unemployment benefits altogether for having quit their 
secondary jobs because they are just overworked and cannot keep 
on working two jobs for any number of reasons not listed by the 
Conservatives in their bill, a list over which the Liberals tore out 
their hair time and time again.
<P>
	They said they could not wait to be in power so they could 
change this despicable legislation. They did change it, but for the 
worse. But they will have to live with that  and pay a political price 
for it. The worst of it all is that, for the ordinary people, women and 
young people who will have to live with this, it will mean having to 
pay premiums without having access to the lower benefits provided 
for by this bill. This is not up to the standards of what the Liberals 
had promised when they were in opposition.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	I must point this out, and really rub it in, because politics is a 
matter of commitment, not just a bunch of empty promises made to 
get elected, which are conveniently forgotten, like so many 
memory blanks, the day after the election, as are the voters to 
whom the promise was made to undo what the previous guys had 
done because it was so terrible.
<P>
	Once in office, all of a sudden, all those terrible things the others 
had done are not even enough. They are made worse yet. That is 
exactly what the Liberals are doing in this bill. I look forward to 
seeing them vote one after another to break the promise they made 
in 1993. Not only break their promise, but do even worse.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
surprised at the member's remark. She talked about throwing some 
fat on the fire. In my opinion the member jumped from the frying 
pan into the fire.
<P>
	I was hoping the member for Mercier would talk about her 
amendments instead of giving the usual rhetoric we heard from the 
Bloc Quebec during the full course of the committee hearings and 
debate.
<P>
	The member did not talk about her amendment. Maybe there is a 
reason for that. I would be embarrassed to talk about the 
amendment proposed in this section if I were her as well.
<P>
	I want to deal directly with that amendment. I want to address a 
couple of points the hon. member talked about. She quoted the 
letter from the Prime Minister of March 26, 1993, that ``the Liberal 
Party of Canada shares your concern''.
<P>
	The Prime Minister and this party do share the concerns. This is 
not the same old bill the Tories of the past brought in. The member 
is trying to mix apples and oranges.
<P>
	This bill is a major restructuring of UI to EI. It moves away from 
the kind of tactics of the past, a little patch here and a little patch 
there, in which we would raise premiums one time, shorten weeks 
another and move to some other provisions that usually ended up 
hurting workers.
<P>
	This is a major restructuring of the bill. It tries to bring better 
balance to the bill and maintain the insurance concepts. It tries to 
address the problems of those in low income areas, maintaining 
and targeting areas where there are seasonal industries so the 
program is there for  not only employees but employers. It tries to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2601"> 2601 </A></B>
<P>
maintain the economic restructuring that comes about as a result of 
EI as well.
<P>
	The member knows but does not want to admit this party and the 
committee, of which she was a member, went out and talked to 
people. The member from Carleton-Charlotte talked earlier about 
some of the provisions in the bill and some of the amendments 
Liberal members made to the bill which will improve it in terms of 
addressing the needs of regions and of workers.
<P>
	The members also should recognize this party and committee 
members in committee listened constructively to what Bloc 
members had to say. If they recall correctly we even adopted an 
amendment. It was the only one which you brought forward that 
seemed reasonable to us. You could have been more constructive in 
bringing forward amendments. However, you cannot deny that we 
adopted it.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would remind the hon. member that he 
has to put his remarks through the Chair. ``You'' has to refer to the 
Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Easter:</B> Mr. Speaker, my apologies. I was just trying to 
convince the member opposite that if she had been more 
constructive we might have been able to adopt more of her 
amendments. The kind of amendment that came forward from the 
hon. member for Mercier on this point, to us, did not make sense.
<P>
	The bill maintains the insurance features. It finds a better 
balance. It targets better low income. It brings more people in. It 
gets rid of the 15-hour job trap. With the amendments that have 
been put forward by several government members, the bill has been 
substantially improved. That is progress. That is what democratic 
debate is all about.
<P>
	Let me speak directly to the motion put forward by the hon. 
member for Mercier. It is an amendment which the member must 
be embarrassed to talk about because she did not address it in her 
remarks.
<P>
	The part of the motion that removes section 5 removes the whole 
financial footing on which coverage under the unemployment 
insurance program is based. The removed section defines the jobs 
on which premiums are to be paid and establishes that the coverage 
is for those who work as employees and thus cannot control their 
unemployment. I might remind the hon. member for Mercier that 
the removal of all penalties for quitting would require that every 
claimant be paid benefits even if the claimant deliberately caused 
his or her own unemployment by quitting to go skiing or by 
stealing from an employer and being fired.
<P>
	The motion ignores the basic premise that unemployment 
insurance is to provide income support to  those who are 
involuntarily unemployed. It is entirely against the insurance 
principle that benefit should be denied to an insured person who 
voluntarily causes the loss against which they are insured.
<P>
	The motion of the hon. member for Mercier is equivalent to 
paying fire insurance to the person who burned down his or her 
own house. That is ridiculous. Maybe that is why she was so 
embarrassed to talk about her amendment. Facts speak for 
themselves and that is the fact.
<P>
	The motion goes further than reversing the C-113 provisions for 
an indefinite denial of benefits for voluntarily quitting, it also will 
prevent any temporary disqualifications of seven to 12 weeks, as 
existed before 1993.
<P>
	I was told, on investigation, that before the changes were made 
that those who quit their jobs without just cause were taking over 
$1 billion out of the fund each year. I would like the hon. member 
for Mercier to try to justify taking $1 billion out of the system for 
those who abuse the system and cause their own problems.
<P>
	Simply put, if the government adopted the motion, persons who 
quit their jobs without just cause or who were fired for misconduct 
would not be subject to any penalty whatsoever. This kind of 
irresponsible motion will fail to score any points with Canadians, 
including hardworking Quebecers.
<P>
	As I said earlier, when we get reasonable motions that make 
sense, such as the one which came forward at committee, 
government members are willing to consider them and, in fact, 
adopt them which we did.
<P>
	This motion is so absurd that it flies in the face of the common 
sense provisions that have been part of the unemployment 
insurance program since it began 55 years ago. If the government 
adopted the motion, Canada would be one of the few countries, if 
not the only one, that allows people to quit their jobs and receive 
insurance benefits with impunity. Perhaps that is what the hon. 
member wants, or perhaps it was just thrown in for the sake of 
moving an amendment without giving it reasonable thought.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	The current UI program and the new employment insurance 
program are designed to help workers who lose their jobs through 
no fault of their own. That is why it is called insurance. As an 
employer, I see it as an extremely important program which makes 
it possible, in the industries and the region I am in, to ensure that 
we have skilled workers available for the busy season. It is a 
program that benefits not only employees but employers, and I 
certainly want to admit that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2602"> 2602 </A></B>
<P>
	If workers choose to quit their jobs or are fired for misconduct, 
there is no way that they should expect to collect benefits. The 
amendment proposed by the member for Mercier would allow that 
to happen.
<P>
	I have given their amendments serious thought but I have no 
choice because of the lack of thought given to this one than to say 
nay to that amendment. Maybe we will come to some others later 
that will make more sense, but certainly that one does not.
<P>
	I expect that is the real reason why the member for Mercier did 
not speak about the amendment that the member proposed. Instead 
she talked rhetoric, of things in the past. Again that rhetoric does 
not apply.
<P>
	What the member needs to admit is that this bill is a major 
restructuring and improvement of the situation for employees and 
employers right across the land. As the evidence becomes clear I 
am sure that eventually the member will want to admit that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on a number of 
occasions since the beginning of this debate, I have had the 
opportunity to speak after the hon. member for Malpeque when he 
had the chance or misfortune of speaking after the hon. member for 
Mercier. I listened to what he had to say.
<P>
	I believe the member for Malpeque has a reading and 
concentration problem. It is truly incredible to hear him say that 
what the member for Mercier proposes will be terrible, that it will 
take us back to the previously existing situation, when we were 
losing a billion dollars because people voluntarily quit their jobs.
<P>
	The member has a right to say what he thinks, but if he had 
listened carefully, if he had concentrated all his attention to the 
debate instead of being distracted by his parliamentary secretary, 
perhaps he would have understood that the member for Mercier 
was essentially stressing the fact that, in the March 26 letter he 
wrote at the time, his leader, the current Prime Minister, voiced his 
outrage at the Conservative government's plan to recognize fewer 
valid reasons for voluntarily leaving a job, including sexual 
harassment and harassment or abuse at any management level.
<P>
	The member forgot about that, saying-and this is what is so 
incredible-that these are words and things of the past. The 
member is effectively telling his leader that the kind of 
commitment he made on March 26, 1993 is a thing of the past, that 
it is not proper. I hope the Prime Minister is listening and will 
remember the comments of the member for Malpeque.
<P>
	This is incredible. We are essentially repeating today the views 
expressed by the current Prime Minister when he was Leader of the 
Opposition. Now, a member of his party is telling him that these 
views do not make sense, that Canadians would not accept them. 
But the Prime  Minister was elected to this House on the basis of 
his views, as were the other members here, including the member 
for Malpeque. It is difficult to believe what we hear these days, 
given what happened with the GST. The Prime Minister keeps 
referring to his red book, but he has a tendency to not recognize 
comments he made in the past, such as when he talked about 
scrapping the GST.
<P>
	However, in this case, he cannot claim not to have made these 
comments about UI reform. They are in a letter bearing his 
signature. I have a copy of it, and I could table it if the House gave 
its consent. But I am sure that it is not necessary. The Prime 
Minister surely remembers this letter, which he wrote when he was 
Leader of the Opposition.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	In the same vein, the hon. member for Malpeque adds that 
opposition members only propose negative things. They have a 
negative point of view. Let me remind the member of a small 
paragraph in a letter written by the current Prime Minister:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I can assure you that the Liberal Party shares your concern regarding this 
attack against the unemployed. We do not believe either that the recent 
superficial amendments will change the fundamentally unfair nature of these 
measures-</BLOCKQUOTE>
Unfair. These measures were unfair three years ago, but they have 
now become fair. This is a simple reminder to the member for 
Malpeque.
<P>
	The most recent figures on unemployment, which were released 
this morning, tell us that the unemployment rate has gone up in 
Canada, including in Quebec. The national rate is currently 9.4 per 
cent, compared to 9.3 per cent last month. In Quebec, the rate went 
from 10.9 per cent last month to 11.1 per cent now. Unemployment 
is on the rise.
<P>
	And if unemployment is on the rise, it means there will be more 
jobless and more unemployment insurance claims. But what does 
the government want to do? It wants to reduce unemployment 
insurance benefits. Is this a satisfactory solution? It makes no sense 
at all. They should in fact be increased, accessibility improved.
<P>
	In her amendment, the member for Mercier proposes to go back 
to an earlier system predating even the Conservative proposal, 
because the Liberals did not think it was fair at the time. It is 
normal to ask for something. As things stand now, with the system 
changing from weeks to hours, people will be forced to hold down 
more than one job in order to reach the required number of hours. 
They will have two part time jobs. We will then see impossible 
situations where an employee with two part time jobs will be told 
by one of his employers: ``I would like you to work a few more 
hours for me. I need you''. If he agrees, he loses the other job. It 
becomes a voluntary separation. Consequently his future rights to 
benefits will suffer.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2603"> 2603 </A></B>
<P>
	Does the member find this normal? When we told him this in 
committee, I recall that he shook his head. We raised another 
objection. Someone receiving benefits and subsequently 
incarcerated, for one reason or another that is not important, 
obviously loses his benefits while he is in jail. But when he gets 
out of jail, his rights have not suffered, because he picks up where 
he left off and is entitled to receive UI benefits, unlike the fellow 
who left one of his two McJobs. Is that fair?
<P>
	I appeal to hon. members across the way. Is that fair? That 
someone just out of jail has more rights than someone forced to 
leave a job by one of his two employers. The member for Malpeque 
is not reading the amendments or his bill properly.
<P>
	That is why we would have liked more time. I am certain the 
majority of the members opposite have not read all 190 clauses in 
this bill. If they were to read them carefully, they would be against 
them, as we are. I invite them to reread the Prime Minister's letter 
of March 26, 1993. Then they would understand.

	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Dauphin-Swan River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, during National Forest Week I would like to highlight the 
new science and technology network that the Canadian Forest 
Service has adopted.
<P>
	As many research organizations know, good research needs more 
than good science. It needs strategic alliances and partnerships. 
The Canadian Forest Service is committed to creating mutually 
beneficial relationships around policy issues and research 
priorities.
<P>
	This collaboration maximizes the use of scarce resources, 
bolsters research efforts and maintains Canada's reputation as a 
world leader in sustainable forest management.
<P>
	During National Forest Week I would like to recognize the town 
of Swan River in my riding of Dauphin-Swan River for having 
been chosen the forest capital of Canada for 1998. Congratulations 
Swan River.

	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
are now midway through National Forest Week, an event that has 
been celebrated for the past 70 years.
<P>
	For Canadians and Quebecers, forests represent both a natural 
resource and a treasure which has had much to do with shaping our 
lifestyle, our history and our traditions.
<P>
	How could it not, when forests cover half of Canada's area, 
providing 340,000 direct jobs and $19 billion of our gross domestic 
product? The economy and the life of Matapédia is centred on its 
forests, which provide a living to hundreds of families.
<P>
	National Forest Week reminds us that we are responsible for this 
precious resource, and that we must make sure it stays healthy, 
drawing upon it reasonably so that it will be there for our children.

	<B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin-Norfolk, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
``Compost: For the Love of the Earth'' is the theme of this year's 
national awareness composting week.
<P>
	During this week, May 6 to 12, the Composting Council of 
Canada supports activities in communities, schools and workplaces 
across Canada to celebrate the many benefits and uses of compost.
<P>
	Compost, familiar to gardeners as a valuable soil amendment, is 
also being used to assist in erosion control along roadsides and in 
strip mine reclamation.
<P>
	Here at the House of Commons an ambitious composting 
initiative is one of the many successes of the greening the Hill 
program. Since 1991 Food Services, in partnership with the Office 
of the Environment, has diverted more than 80 tonnes of organic 
waste from landfill. Currently all organic waste, including starch, 
dairy and meat products, is sent to a state of the art vessel 
composter located at national defence headquarters.
<P>
	I encourage all Canadians to get involved in composting.

	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the accomplishments of the Schep family in my riding are 
quite remarkable. The Schep's Thunder Bay Oak Cheese Farm 
utilizes the cheese making skills the family learned in its native 
Holland to operate Ontario's first and only Gouda cheese on-farm 
operation.
<P>
	Mrs. Schep comes from a long line of cheese makers near the 
city of Gouda, Holland. Her parents still make cheese. Since the 
Scheps moved to Canada in 1981 to take over a large dairy 
operation they have been making the occasional Gouda cheese. 
What was originally a hobby has become a full time operation.

spending in the other place appears to be out of control. To 
illustrate, the Senate spent more than $206,000 on a committee on 
euthanasia to produce a report that has been shelved. In addition, its 
Pearson airport committee ran up a bill of over $210,000.
<P>
	The Senate has an annual budget of over $40 million. Now, with 
no explanation, it wants another $4 million tax dollars to top up its 
budget.
<P>
	My motion, passed by the Standing Committee on Government 
Operations, will request the Senate's board of internal economy to 
appear before the committee to account for its expenses.

administrative staff of St. Stephen High School in New Brunswick 
celebrated Youth Canada Day.
<P>
	With their theme of national unity, these students, led by their 
student body representatives Heather Estey and Rob Driscoll, held 
a truly Canadian assembly marked by the harmony of our national 
anthem, Canadian declarations and the many Canadian flags lining 
the halls of this school.
<P>
	With our very large and diverse country, it is heart warming to 
see today's youth lead the way toward true Canadian unity, 
representing diversity and truly demonstrating what it means to be 
Canadian.

	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this week 
we grieve the passing of Austin Bastable, a Canadian who had two 
terrible battles to endure in recent months. His first battle, a 
hopeless one, was against the disease which finally led to his 
decision to choose death in order to put an end to his suffering.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	His second battle was against the government's lack of action to 
recognize people's right to die in peace and dignity at the time of 
their choosing. Unfortunately for him, and for all Canadians and 
Quebecers facing horrible deaths, his government did not heed 
him, nor would it even listen to what he had to say.
<P>
	This Canadian had to seek self-imposed exile in the U.S. in order 
to get the qualified medical assistance he needed to end his life. Mr. 
Bastable himself said, only a little while before his death:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``If it had been left to the Canadian government I would have 
suffered for much longer, perhaps indefinitely''.

today I congratulate Gavin Maxwell of Oakville who last Saturday 
won the single man canoe race at the hemispheric qualifier in 
Gainsville, Georgia.
<P>
	This convincing victory guarantees Gavin a trip to the Olympic 
Games in Atlanta this summer. The win was especially satisfying 
because two of the paddlers in the field, the American and the 
Mexican, had defeated him last fall at a pre-Olympic regatta.
<P>
	Gavin Maxwell is a fine young man who not only excels in 
athletics but is an outstanding example to the youth of our country. 
His hard work and integrity have made him a model ambassador 
for sport and for Canada.
<P>
	I know the people of my riding of Oakville-Milton are

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="LANDMINES">LAND MINES</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, more than 25,000 people worldwide are killed by land 
mines every year, and thousands more are injured.
<P>
	On Wednesday the Minister of Foreign Affairs said Canada is 
one of the few countries that have banned outright the use of 
anti-personnel land mines. This is simply not true.
<P>
	Earlier this year Canada declared a moratorium on the 
production, export and use of land mines. However, a moratorium 
is not a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2605"> 2605 </A></B>
<P>
ban. Although it is good, we need  Canada to take the lead by 
domestically banning the production, use and sale of these heinous 
silent killers.
<P>
	The minister was incorrect in his statement this week. Canada 
has long been one of leading voices in calling for a total ban. It is 
now the topic of discussion for a proposal which would establish a 
land mine free zone in the Americas, which Canada supports.
<P>
	It is time now for Canada to show bold leadership and send a 
clear signal to the international community by declaring a domestic 
ban on the import, use and production of land mines.

l'Outaouais announced the signing of an agreement of 
understanding to establish a partnership so Ottawa-Carleton and 
the Outaouais could bid on the 2001 Jeux de la Francophonie.
<P>
	There are two parts to these games, which have been held every 
four years since 1987: the sporting competitions and the cultural 
competitions. The games also include competitions for young 
people with a handicap.
<P>
	The host country welcomes some 2,700 athletes and artists from 
49 participating countries for a two-week period. The economic

disapproval of one of our budget measures aimed at reducing 
certain advantages accorded risk capital funds such as those of the 
FTQ or the CSN.
<P>
	The leader of the Bloc Quebecois wondered at the time how 
Ottawa could justify, and I quote: ``an attack against a tool as 
effective in creating and maintaining jobs''
<P>
	Yesterday the Quebec Minister of Finance vindicated us in this 
matter, because he decided to follow our lead and cut some of the 
advantages accorded these funds.
<P>

to stitch up their shirts. The federal and Quebec finance ministers

we rise today to wish a happy Mother's Day to all the mothers out

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Government of Quebec has announced it will balance its budget by 
the year 2000, joining the chorus of responsible provincial 
governments which have either balanced their budgets or 
announced a plan to do so.
<P>
	Why is the federal government conspicuously absent from the 
Team Canada initiative?
<P>
	If Canadians judge the strength of their governments and their 
finance ministers by their ability to stop going further into debt, 
this government and finance minister must be regarded as the most 
weak-kneed of the bunch.
<P>
	After two and a half years the federal government has failed to 
balance its budget as have provinces like Alberta, Saskatchewan, 
Manitoba and New Brunswick. It has not even announced a plan to 
eliminate the deficit, as have all the remaining provinces.
<P>
	On this basis it is now clear the federal government is the only 
distinct society in Canada. Even more leadership threatens the 
financial security of ordinary Canadians, other levels of 
government and future generations that will inherit a staggering 
debt.

<P>
	Canadians are wondering how many hospital beds, how many 
college classrooms, how many pensions could have been saved if 
these corporations and trusts had paid their taxes.
<P>
	Canadians ought to be told whether the government has launched 
any criminal investigations into tax evasion by Canadian

<P>
	I refer to Canadians suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome

<P>
	CFS can take a perfectly healthy person and create a totally 
dysfunctional individual. Young people are frequent victims; lost 
jobs, depression and sometimes suicide are often the effects.
<P>
	Yet Canada has no federal policy framework in place to ensure 
care and treatment for thousands of these individuals, nor does the

control.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EXPERIENCECANADAPROGRAM">EXPERIENCE CANADA PROGRAM</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Experience Canada is the newest Liberal brain wave for 
politically influencing Canada's young people. This Year 2000 
version of Katimavik proposes work experience, in a form not yet 
fully defined. The main cause of concern about this program is that 
the budget will be administered by the Council for Canadian Unity.
<P>
	How can the Minister for Human Resources Development 
explain that the administration of a $21 million program 
supposedly aimed at helping young people is being entrusted to a 
highly political and extremely partisan organization?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, without addressing all of the 
details in the hon. member's comments on the Council, allow me to 
point out that Experience Canada is a partnership. The bulk of the 
funds to be spent on helping young people everywhere in the 
country, young people in all provinces, comes from the private 
sector.
<P>
	Companies and stakeholders in the private sector are prepared to 
assume their responsibilities and to  contribute to the development 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2607"> 2607 </A></B>
<P>
of our youth throughout the country, through exchanges and 
workplace learning experiences. I trust that everyone will support a 
partnership of this type between the private sector, the 
governments, and our young people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this is a motherhood issue; of course we have nothing 
against partnerships. Quebec is, as the minister well knows, a 
pioneer in such arrangements. That was not the question.
<P>
	The federal government is telling us that it will be withdrawing 
from the manpower field. This was a commitment made in the 
throne speech, but in practice it is adding another player, the 
Council for Canadian Unity, a body that is not all that neutral, and 
one not generally involved in employment.
<P>
	How can the minister justify one more finger in the manpower 
pie? How can he justify this, except as an intention to use money 
earmarked to help our young people for political ends, because the 
Council for Canadian Unity is a propaganda machine, pure and 
simple?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, just the day before the 
announcement, which once again demonstrated the private sector's 
willingness to help young people everywhere in this country, who 
are having a really hard time finding work, one of the key 
stakeholders in the Council made some comments. What he said, in 
my opinion, ought to clearly demonstrate that there is a fairly wide 
range of opinions within the Council for Canadian Unity.
<P>
	Peter White was the person in question, and what he had to say 
demonstrates, in my opinion, the divergence of opinions about the 
future of the country and about what ought to done to ensure its 
survival.
<P>
	The entire Experience Canada exercise is focussed on young 
people, and I trust that all those who are interested in doing 
something to help young people will do so, whether in the private 
sector or in some coalition or other, and whether they share our 
vision of Canada or that of the hon. member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, granted there may be a whole range of opinions within the 
Council on Canadian Unity but, regardless of their differences, 
they are all playing the same tune. It is, after all, the Council for 
Canadian Unity. It is a body involved with Canadian unity, with the 
Constitution, it is as simple as that.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	I would like to ask the minister how the Council for Canadian 
Unity has suddenly acquired expertise in training young people. 
Let us face it, that is really a bit far fetched.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I hope the hon. member is not 
trying to tell us that in my department we ought-and it is the 
furthest thing from my mind-to go over all of the applications 
from all of the hon. members in this House, from all parts of 
Canada, with a magnifying glass. That we should scrutinize all 
requests to assist organizations working with young people, in 
order to find out whether these young people belong to a separatist 
organization or to some organization that is working for Canadian 
unity?
<P>
	I have sufficient respect for young people to allow them to do 
what they have to do, and to gain experience. I trust-and am not in 
the least hesitant to say so-that all of the young people, whether 
from Quebec or from elsewhere, will come to appreciate Canada, 
as so many have before them, for so many decades.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	The new federal government initiative called Experience Canada 
has not done much to eliminate the numerous cases of overlap in 
the area of manpower.
<P>
	How can the government justify the fact that millions of dollars 
officially set aside for training young people have in fact been used 
to indoctrinate them instead?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, although we managed this year 
to double the federal funds available to help young people, it was 
obviously not enough. The demand largely exceeds our resources.
<P>
	I should point out to the hon. member that, as a result of this 
initiative, which comes partly under the responsibility of the 
Council for Canadian Unity, we managed to double these funds in 
partnership with the private sector. I think the truth is that we 
receive many more applications than we have resources.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
instead of wasting public funds in this way or financing task forces 
that are not representative of young people, what is the government 
waiting for to settle the manpower training dispute between Canada 
and Quebec, which is the only way to give some real hope to 
Quebec's young people?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I agree with the hon. member 
that we must all work together to try to find a way to ensure that 
young people in Quebec and elsewhere have as many opportunities 
as possible to join the workforce.
<P>
	That is why I reiterate that we in the Government of Canada are 
developing a position which, I hope, will be acceptable to the 
Quebec government. We are currently drafting a proposal that, I 
<P>
<HR>

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, to get 
itself out of the GST mess the government has concocted an 
illusion that would put Doug Henning to shame. It said consumers 
would be getting a break with the new Liberal GST, but up one 
sleeve was a billion dollar payout and up the other was a whole 
arsenal of new tax powers that gave the provinces room to raise 
taxes in the future.
<P>
	The Minister of National Revenue said it would be revenue 
neutral. When is she going to admit that consumers in Atlantic 
Canada and across the country are going to be paying through the 
teeth for this broken Liberal promise?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question which we have heard over and over again. Maybe at some 
point members will hear loud and clear that what we have done is 
good for Canadians, good for consumers. The Atlantic provinces 
realize and businesses throughout the Atlantic provinces realize 
that a national harmonized tax as we proposed and as is being 
implemented is good for Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
tax grab and it is that simple.
<P>
	I want to ask the minister about her views on Quebec's plans to 
present the federal government with a $500 million bill for the 
costs incurred when Quebec harmonized its sales tax. It is Quebec's 
opinion that if the government can find a billion dollars for Atlantic 
Canada, then it can find half a billion dollars for it.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	My question is for the same minister. Is it the intention of the 
federal government to compensate Quebec for its harmonization 
costs?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows, because he 
has asked questions before about the formula of adjustment 
assistance, that it provides assistance to provinces that incur losses 
in excess of 5 per cent of their tax revenue under their existing PST. 
That formula applies across the country. That is the formula which 
has been applied in Atlantic Canada. It would result in adjustment 
assistance to some provinces and not others. It is a consistent 
formula.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
surprised the government is not planning to compensate Quebec, 
given how free it has been with taxpayers' money with respect to 
Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	The truth of this Liberal GST fiasco is that consumers are going 
to end up footing the bill. New Brunswick is planning to create a 
new business tax to make up for the harmonization shortfall. Nova 
Scotia has already boosted its corporate taxes. Newfoundland said 
that it plans to make up the revenue somehow.
<P>
	The government can saw it in half, can pull it out of a hat, can try 
to make it disappear, but the truth is that this harmonization plan is 
bad for consumers. When will the minister admit that it is not 
revenue neutral and it will cost billions in higher prices and higher 
taxes for Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am a little surprised at the hon. 
member's supplementary question. As members of the committee, 
his colleagues were with us on the road when Canadians said this is 
what they wanted to see, harmonized taxes, not two sales taxes in 
this country.
<P>

analogy for him is King Canute trying to roll back the waves.

questionable circumstances under which the army arrested 
Corporal Michel Purnelle to prevent him from making information 
available to the Somalia inquiry. A mere five hours after question

ignore basic rules about leaving their posts without authorization, 
there could be anarchy in the armed forces.

	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the

was troubled and strongly disappointed by the decision to detain

potential witnesses?

come forward to that commission. The government will not 
tolerate any intimidation toward any of those people''. These are 
fine words but Purnelle listened to the minister and is being 
punished for coming forward.

clarified so on Tuesday we asked the finance committee to put it on

there would not be a fee holiday for fishermen this year and then he 
said there would. While he is flip-flopping to protect his own

to the west what it did to the east. I do not know whether to laugh at

minister has done.
<P>
	Last week he went out there and met with groups, with all the 
people who had a stake in the salmon fishery. He met with some 
people again this week. As late as yesterday he issued some fine 
tuning points to his plan which will reflect the preoccupation of the

	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> All two of them, Mr.

<P>
	More than fine tuning is required to rejig this plan. The 
government wants B.C. fishermen to take hard medicine yet neither 
the minister nor the premier of B.C. are interested in saving fish. 
The minister is cutting the number of fishermen in half while the 
premier of B.C. is giving half of the resource away, adding up to no 
fish saved and fishermen's lives decimated.

<P>
	On behalf of my colleague, the MP for Provencher, who is

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr.

communities affected by disaster. Of that portion, Manitoba has 
received 20 per cent in the last 10 years, well over $50 million.
<P>
	The fact that the premier of Manitoba has been making 
comments to the contrary simply shows that he is not aware of how 
the agreement works or that he is not aware of the responsibilities

funding advertisements when, because of the postal monopoly, no

record straight and ensure that everyone is aware that there have 
been no appropriations of moneys from the federal government to 
Canada Post since 1988.
<P>
	We looked into the fact that Canada Post was advertising the sale 
of its stamps. It must promote its products because there is so much 
competition from E-mail, the Internet and many other modes of 
delivering messages. They compete with Canada Post. Therefore, it 
must continue to promote the services it provides to every region of 
the country, to every Canadian. It is a very good service. It is one 
that is very much needed.

people can get stamps is in the post office?
<P>
	The member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley asked this

all. Will the minister stop Canada Post advertising today?

<P>
	Yesterday morning the minister, appearing before the transport

by 25,000 cars and trucks.
<P>
	The deterioration of the bridge, including the part on which 
vehicles drive, is due mainly to car and truck traffic, and to using 
salt throughout the winter season to make it safer.

Speaker, we do not execute someone accused of murder and then

<P>
	The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans is executing his marine fee

post-mortem if the industry is dead? Has he learned nothing from 
what he has done to the Canadian fishing industry?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Secretary of State (Agriculture 
and Agri-Food, Fisheries and Oceans), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
impression should not be left that the minister went into this 
program of fees without first having studied the matter.
<P>
	A study was done by a company for the coast guard before the 
fee structure was considered. After we had met with the 
stakeholders from one coast to the other, we decided that we would 
go with the plan we put forward. This plan will certainly not have 
the effect on the  industry that the member opposite seems to think 
it will have.

question is for the government and has to do with the first 
ministers' conference that was announced yesterday, which the 
government finally got around to bringing together.
<P>
	Could the government inform us what will be the agenda of this 
meeting? Is it going to transfer manpower training? Is it going to 
pursue more devolution? Is it going to talk about economic union? 
Is it going to live up to the commitments it made during the 
referendum campaign? Since it has called a meeting, could it at 
least inform us and the premiers what the agenda will be?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member should know that the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Relations has had extensive consultations with 
all the provinces to determine what the agenda of the meeting 
should be, how we can come together on questions of the 
economic, social and political union to make this country work 
better.

	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the minister responsible for the status of women and 
public works to whom I have given notice.
<P>
	In the continuing saga of the harassment case of Ann Raney, the 
female engineer on the Peace Tower project and of Ray Wolf and 
his project workers who followed in sympathy and solidarity, we 
now see that Mr. Karmash, the offending supervisor, is back on the 
site. Yesterday Colonial, his employer, refused to sign an 
arbitration process to resolve matters.
<P>
	Since the government has failed in all of its efforts to apply 
ordinary commercial contract law to this situation, when will it 
apply the full force of the human rights clauses in the contract to 
resolve this ridiculous situation where Canadian human rights law 
is ignored by contractors right here on Parliament Hill?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is important that we 
clarify exactly what the cases are about.

Colonial has been resolved. All of the  parties have signed an 
agreement. That case has been set aside. There continues to be 
another dispute which we are working at facilitating. We hope it 
will be resolved in the near future.
<P>
	We are extremely concerned, especially in relation to the 
discrimination which did occur. We want to ensure that in future 
any of our contracts are structured in such a way that action can be 
taken very quickly to prevent a reoccurrence.

my question is for the Minister for International Trade. Export 
growth has been the key to much of job creation success since the 
government took office.
<P>
	Can the Minister for International Trade tell the House what the 
future holds for Canadian companies in new and emerging world 
markets with respect to trade?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as question period draws to a close, I am happy 
to bring some good news. Over the last three years since the 
government took office exports have increased by 40 per cent.
<P>
	Last year the trade surplus was some $28 billion. Trade has gone 
up from 26 per cent to 37 per cent of GDP in just four years. The 
future also indicates that there will continue to be big increases in 
export and trade investment.
<P>
	That means that the government is delivering on its promise of 
jobs and growth because for every billion dollars of new trade 
11,000 jobs are created for Canadians.

	A recent poll showed that a majority of Canadians would like to 
be able to buy private health care insurance and private medical 
services. Will the government do the right thing and allow 
Canadians to do this by amending the Canada Health Act 
forthwith?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member has failed to indicate that 
the same poll suggests that Canadians are overwhelmingly in 
favour of the Canadian health care system as it currently exists.
<P>
	There are enormous inconsistencies in the party position of the 
member on health care. One day its members insist that the one tier 
system is the best system and on another day they have a different 
position. Today must be that day.
<P>
	However, he should be aware, as all Canadians are, that the 
government will maintain the integrity of the system and make sure 
that it continues to provide the services required by Canadians 
everywhere on the same basis and not on a per pay basis.

	The minister has already clearly indicated to us that, despite 
projected financial cuts, the Institut Maurice-Lamontagne will 
continue to exist. However, it remains to be seen whether the 
minister will not make an empty shell out of it.
<P>
	How can the minister explain that he wants to reduce funds 
allocated to the Institut Maurice-Lamontagne, when we know the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans allocates only 9 per cent of its 
scientific research budget to Quebec and the situation will 
deteriorate further if the minister goes through with his plans?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Secretary of State (Agriculture

true that the Department of Fisheries and Oceans went through a 
review of all the programs it was providing and had to make certain 
adjustments.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="EMPLOYMENTINSURANCEACT">EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-12, an act respecting 
employment insurance in Canada, as reported (with amendment) 
from the committee; and on Motions No. 10 and 10A.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to enter the debate on Group No. 5. It is important to put these 
amendments in context.
<P>
	One of the problems we had in committee was with the 
opposition as it relates to amendments important for the 
improvement of the bill.
<P>
	One of the things we asked at the very beginning of the process 
was that if members of Parliament were serious about wanting to 
see improvements to the bill, that they were given ample 
opportunity not only in committee but in discussions individually 
with members and through the department to have their 
improvements put forward and vetted through the department. It 
would do an analysis and come up with recommendations about 
whether the amendment we are involved with would be appropriate 
under the circumstances.
<P>
	The amendment by the member for Mercier is a perfect example 
of the shenanigans going on in the opposition. Filibustering took 
place over the number of weeks as we tried as a government to 
co-operate with the opposition for it to be successful in bringing 
amendments forward.
<P>
	Instead of bringing amendments like this to the committee, we 
get a nonsensical amendment like the one we are debating today. 
This motion removes from Bill C-12 the whole clause 5, defining 
insurable employment, thus removing the foundation for EI 
coverage and premium payments completely.
<P>
	It also proposes to remove from the UI act all references to 
penalty or stoppage of benefits for quitting without just cause and 
being fired for misconduct.
<P>
	If we were to approve and accept this amendment it would 
totally put in chaos the unemployment insurance system as we 
know it today or as we are proposing under the new changes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2617"> 2617 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to make it very clear that we are debating a motion that 
is intended to filibuster the very important work of the House and 
waste the time of members. This motion should be completely out 
of order because it is nonsensical. If a member puts an amendment 
to a bill forward, at least put one that is reasonable and has some 
merit. Obviously this one does not.
<P>
	It does not surprise me. I refer to other statements the member 
for Mercier made on what the bill does or does not do.
<P>
	Not long ago in the House the member for Mercier claimed the 
bill does not promote job creation because it reduces inter-regional 
subsidization, that it will make the poor regions even poorer. When 
someone makes comments like that, it suggests somehow there is a 
diabolical scheme that will hurt the poorer provinces.
<P>
	I want to put on record today some facts as they relate to that 
issue to coincide with some of the other amendments the member is 
proposing to prove to all the people who are listening, particularly 
in Quebec, how ridiculous this situation has become.
<P>
	Look at the numbers. This is even before considering the 
allocation of the $800 million reinvestment in active measures. 
This relates to every dollar paid into the program in the years 
2001-02. Keep in mind it relates to promoting job creation and the 
inter-regional subsidization.
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	In the year 2000-01 for every dollar workers in Prince Edward 
Island put in they will receive $2.77 in benefits out of the program. 
Newfoundlanders will receive $2.73 for every dollar they put in. 
Nova Scotians will receive $1.52 for every dollar they put into the 
system. New Brunswickers will receive $1.59 for every dollar they 
put into the system. In Quebec, the province members are talking 
about as being so hard done by in this piece of legislation, workers 
will receive $1.32 for every dollar they put in.
<P>
	Keep that in mind because here is a member from Ontario 
speaking on behalf of his province. In Ontario workers will receive 
76 cents for every dollar they put in. As Ontarians, if we are not 
sharing with the other provinces, the ones I have mentioned, then 
what are we doing? If we are not distributing wealth, then what 
exactly are we doing when we look at the facts?
<P>
	Quite frankly, as a federalist I expect and accept that is what we 
are doing. That is the way we make the disparities in the regions 
disappear over time. We do it by helping the have not areas, by 
lifting them up, by putting them into a position where they can 
create employment, improve their training apparatus, get involved 
in giving people a helping hand so they can achieve their goals in 
those regions.
<P>
	When the member for Mercier says that we are attacking the 
poorer regions, it is not true, like so many of the other claims the 
hon. member has mentioned. I go back to the particular issue of 
section 5 which she basically wants to remove completely. When 
we look at that we have to ask ourselves what the rationale is for 
the opposition and what its motive is for making these very serious 
allegations that the government is not interested in helping 
Canadians.
<P>
	As my colleague from Malpeque has said on a number of 
occasions, which I want to emphasize in my remarks this 
afternoon, this is a significant overhaul of the unemployment 
insurance system in order to put us in a position to help working 
men and women in the years to come in the country called Canada. 
In essence this is its first major overhaul in over 25 years. The 
intent of it is to look at the areas where we believe men and women 
will be looking for employment in the future, the non-conventional 
areas.
<P>
	One of the major components of this bill is to bring part time 
workers into the EI system for the first time in history. As the 
House knows, part timers now account for 27 per cent of the 
workforce. That is a very serious problem which has to be 
addressed. They are individuals who until once this bill is passed 
have not been able to collect unemployment insurance. They have 
not been able to ask for help under the more active measures under 
part II, the five tools we have advocated under the $800 million 
which has been put forward, including the other billions of dollars 
we have had before. Up to $2.7 billion will be put toward part II 
and the tools that will be used to help Canadians get retrained and 
re-educated.
<P>
	Then we looked at something else which is very profound, 
something which shows that this government understands there is a 
changing environment in the workplace. We have now gone to first 
hour coverage, from weeks to hours.
<P>
	In a region like mine, northern Ontario, which is very similar to 
northern Quebec, many Canadians work in seasonal industries. 
That is the kind of environment, the kind of country that we live in. 
Those individuals, especially in the summertime and in the fall, do 
not work eight hours a day like people do in other industries such as 
the auto industry in southern Ontario. They work 12 to 16 hours a 
day.
<P>
	Under the old system it did not matter if people worked 70 hours 
a week or 35 hours a week, it only counted for one week. Now 
under the new system people are not going to be forced to work 
overtime. It is not called overtime in seasonal industries. It is called 
making a dollar when the sun shines, working when you can, 
making sure you make enough money in the period of four to six 
months to support your family.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2618"> 2618 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1220 )</B>
<P>
	For people to suggest that going from weeks to hours is driving 
people to work overtime, as you and I know, Mr. Speaker, it is 
obvious they have never visited northern Ontario or northern 
Quebec or places where people work in the mines, forestry and 
tourism. They are not in the labour force because they are 
unionized or non-unionized, they are there because that is where 
they make their living.
<P>
	For example, people who work at tourist camps work 16 hours a 
day, as they do when the tourist camps are open in my region. They 
start at 7 a.m., sometimes 6 a.m., to get the fishermen out fishing 
and all the activities going and they work until dark. You know this, 
Mr. Speaker, because you know northern Ontario very well, that it 
gets dark around 9 p.m. so people are working from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. 
Those are long hours.
<P>
	Now every single hour that those people work counts. They do 
not have to work 20 weeks; they may only have to work 10 weeks 
to qualify for EI. Whereas in the past they did not qualify at all, 
now they will qualify. If that is not an important structural change 
for the good of many Canadians, I do not know what is.
<P>
	What is frustrating me and many members on the government 
side is that the opposition continues to talk with rhetorical abandon 
about this bill without talking about the facts.
<P>
	There are women who have worked part time all their lives. I 
have a sister-in-law who has two jobs and has never in her life been 
able to collect UI simply because she always worked less than that 
15 hour ceiling. She would work 14 hours at the local grocery store 
and then another 14 hours or less in the same week at a local 
restaurant. Under these changes she will now have all the benefits 
whether they be maternity benefits, sick benefits, or regular UI 
benefits if she is laid off. That is a dramatic improvement.
<P>
	I take exception to some of the remarks made by the members 
opposite that this bill is somehow going to hurt people. We can 
look at the numbers, and I will speak later about those when we go 
to a different group. Just look at how many more people in each 
province are going to be getting into the system versus the 
argument the opposition is making that this will shrink the system 
significantly.
<P>
	As a labour unionist, I am very familiar with what the labour 
unions are saying. Quite frankly that is why they are so 
marginalized in this country. They cannot tell their membership 
something that is not factually correct. They have to tell them the 
absolute truth, whether they are of one political persuasion or 
another.
<P>
	Because members opposite have a particular vision of what 
Canada should look like at the end of the day, maybe they are 
coming at it from a different angle. I also take exception to some of 
the labour unionists who are  saying we are shrinking the system. In 
fact the numbers show that 52 per cent of people who are 
unemployed can get unemployment insurance now. With a 2 per 
cent or 3 per cent increase which is guaranteed in the next number 
of years we will back not too long from now to where as high as 60 
per cent of the people who end up unemployed will be able to get 
UI benefits. People, the media and the labour movement are saying 
it is down to 40 per cent and that is not factually correct.
<P>
	We have never had the opportunity in committee to see what the 
opposition would really like. We as a government held our hand out 
to all members. Members on the government side took us up on the 
offer and told us where they thought there were some weaknesses.
<P>
	One was in the divisor. We changed the divisor. It cost the 
government a significant amount of money. We looked at the gap 
which is a major problem for employees who work in seasonal 
industries. We changed the gap. It cost the government $265 
million to make that change. If that is not good work in the 
committee I do not know what is.
<P>
	My colleague from Toronto worked very hard looking at what 
would happen to people at the low end of the scale, poorer people. 
The recommendation came forward from her that we would exempt 
from the intensity rule people with under $26,000 of family 
income. This is a significant change and worth some $24 million to 
the poor people who cannot afford to be targeted.
<P>
	What kind of amendments did we get from the opposition? 
None. This place must work effectively and the government says it 
is willing to do business differently than in the past. I was here 
when the Tories were in power. When we went to committee we 
could forget it. We were there to obstruct; we were not there to put 
in amendments because we knew no one would ever take them 
seriously. However, with this bill amendments were put forward 
and they were accepted by this government.
<P>
	I want to reiterate that if the members are going to say things that 
are factually incorrect we on this side of the House are going to get 
up time and time again and give the people of Canada the facts. It is 
unfair. This is a complicated bill. There is no argument about that. 
A lot of people, even people in the press are saying that the bill is 
not getting much attention because quite frankly, most people do 
not understand it.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	However, the members who have been on the committee, like 
myself and the hon. member for Malpeque, have spent lots of time 
in order to understand the bill thoroughly. We will stand in this 
place to put the facts on the record. Members like the hon. member 
for Mercier will not get away with total rhetoric. We expect her to 
argue the points based on the facts. If they are not there, we will 
certainly call her on it.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean):</B> Mr. Speaker, since I 
got into politics, I have become aware of things I never noticed 
before. For instance, I have noticed to what extremes some people 
will go to pull the wool over people's eyes. They tell half-truths, 
until the public realizes in the end that not a word of what they have 
been told is true.
<P>
	A reporter in Quebec used to say: ``To tell the truth is a 
challenge, but the real challenge is to tell the whole truth''. I have 
been listening to my colleague opposite who is trying to say that, 
yes, this bill will be very good for Canada. Also, if we were to 
believe him, the Bloc Quebecois refused to do any work on this 
bill. Quite the contrary. We took part in consideration of this bill, 
but what we tried to do was to move amendments to improve the 
legislation.
<P>
	It is also important to note that the human resources 
development committee travelled throughout Canada to listen to 
what the public had to say about this bill. What did the government 
do? It turned a deaf ear. It travelled throughout Canada to show 
how democratic the whole process was, to show that, yes, the 
public had been consulted and that, yes, the bill is consistent and 
meets the expectations of Canadians.
<P>
	When I was appointed to this committee, I was disappointed to 
see that the government had held consultations, but had it really 
listened to what was said? Did the committee members travelled 
throughout Canada just for the sake of it? That is the impression I 
am left with.
<P>
	I think the problem here is that the public still does not know this 
bill well enough. When people finally understand, probably in 
May, when the act will be in effect and its effects will unfortunately 
have started being felt, when their pay cheques are cut, then the 
people will take to the streets. In fact, they have already started.
<P>
	For instance, people in Jonquière and Chicoutimi took part in a 
18- kilometre march recently. Do you think they did it for fun? Do 
you think people demonstrate just for fun or simply to protest? No, 
like the hon. member opposite said, in a region such as mine, 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, people march because they have to 
deal with certain realities, with seasonal work. This bill will have a 
negative impact on seasonal workers. The government would have 
us believe otherwise. Fascinating.
<P>
	There is another reality that I would like to mention, the one our 
young people are living in. The situation is clear enough. I have 
friends who are still in university and who will be working this 
summer. We know how hard it is to find a first job, but people are 
always hoping to find one.
<P>
	With this bill, which makes it even harder to qualify for UI 
benefits, we, the young, tell ourselves: ``UI is for  other people, for 
those who were part of the old system''. Again, young people are 
hit in the knees. At least, that is the impression I get.
<P>
	Another point the hon. member for Mercier mentioned this 
morning is something unbelievable that people are not well aware 
of, that is, the issue of double jobs. The hon. member said a little 
while ago that this bill will precisely benefit those who hold down 
two jobs. In a sense you always look good telling the truth, but it 
must be the whole truth.
<P>
	We know that this reform affects people who have two jobs, and 
we know full well that it is often young people who have two jobs, 
who have two McJobs. Those who have two jobs, let us say job A 
and job B-and I am telling you this because it is important-will 
have to accumulate a certain number of hours in order to become 
eligible. I once had two jobs, as a matter of fact, when I went to 
Alberta to learn English.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	I had two jobs at that time and I suddenly realized that it was too 
much for me, so I quit one. Today, if a person quits one of his two 
jobs, that person will be penalized in terms of the total number of 
hours and in terms of benefits. These are things that my colleague 
opposite has neglected to mention.
<P>
	Again, I would like it so much if people who are watching us 
would listen carefully to what I am saying and understand what is 
really going on. This bill is scary. It takes us back 20 years. What I 
find unfortunate is that the government still refuses to listen, 
saying, of course, that the opposition has done nothing to improve 
this bill. It is very disappointing, but we will see what happens. 
Time will prove us right.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville-Milton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
addressing Bill C-12, I want to emphasize the positive impact this 
legislation will have on the creation of jobs in the country. The 
government calculates that the change from unemployment 
insurance to employment insurance should create between 100,000 
and 150,000 new job opportunities.
<P>
	I would like to take a minute or two to describe how these figures 
were arrived at. First, the modernization of the system will have an 
impact. The central change in the EI system is in the way 
individuals qualify for benefits. Under the old system, an 
individual had to work a certain number of weeks, called a fixed 
period, at a minimum of 15 hours per week and had to earn a 
minimum amount per week in each one of those weeks to qualify. 
In high unemployment areas the minimum was 12 weeks and in 
low unemployment areas the minimum was 20 weeks.
<P>
	Once workers had the minimum number of weeks they could 
apply for benefits and the benefit was calculated at 55 per cent of 
the average weekly earnings up to a  maximum amount. It was also 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2620"> 2620 </A></B>
<P>
based on an average of the weekly earnings in the last 12 to 20 
weeks worked over a 52 week period.
<P>
	The problem was there was a built in disincentive to take any 
other work beyond the minimum weeks required to qualify, 
particularly if the extra work paid anything less than the person was 
earning in the previous 12 to 20 weeks. Taking any short term job 
that paid less would cut UI benefits if a claim was made. It would 
lower the average weekly earnings and, therefore, the benefit 
cheque would be less.
<P>
	If a person was laid off after having worked the minimum period 
at the rate of $600 per week, why would a person take a short term 
job for maybe two or three weeks that paid only $450 per week? Or 
why would the person search out a part time job or any other work 
if it meant that in the end he or she would receive lower benefits?
<P>
	I should also mention the amount of work that goes unreported in 
the underground economy. Some people who are unemployed and 
on claims take on informal work on which no premium is paid and 
no tax collected. This costs other workers in higher premiums and 
higher taxes. It also distorts the true picture of the amount of work 
that is actually available.
<P>
	These are some of the major disincentives to work in the old 
system. And not just for workers. Many employers also built their 
hiring and layoff practices around the rigid weeks worked 
component of the old system rather than basing their decisions on 
the needs of their marketplace.
<P>
	Also, in several areas many employers have real difficulty 
finding people to work because the unemployment insurance 
benefit payment is higher than the employer can afford to pay.
<P>
	To eliminate these disincentives the new employment insurance 
system is based on hours worked, not weeks. Under the new system 
every hour worked in the last 52 weeks counts in determining entry. 
Therefore, all work is insurable and all earnings over the last 26 
weeks count in calculating benefits.
<P>
	The disincentive to work for longer periods or to take on jobs 
that may pay less or to avoid reporting work and earnings will be 
reduced. To maximize benefit under the new system workers will 
require two more weeks of work beyond the minimum entrance 
requirement in each region.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	Since part time hours are now insurable, declaring them is to the 
claimant's advantage. It is especially advantageous for people with 
multiple jobs to declare earnings from each of them. Under the new 
system individuals can now count back 26 weeks to find the 
required hours of work when calculating average earnings for 
benefit purposes. The average is then divided by what is called the 
divisor which as a minimum is two weeks plus the minimum 
number of weeks required in an individual's region. That figure is 
now lower in high unemployment areas and higher in lower 
unemployment areas compared to Bill C-12. The two weeks are 
added to ensure that there is a continuing incentive for people to 
work the full period if work is available but at the same time to 
ensure that it is not overly harsh on those who have limited work 
opportunities.
<P>
	Another modernization feature of the new system which helps to 
create jobs is that people on benefits will be able to earn up to $50 
per week, or 25 per cent of their benefit, whichever is higher, 
without paying a penalty.
<P>
	Other features which encourage work are, one, the intensity rule, 
whereby repeat claimants receive slightly lower benefits and, two, 
higher hours for eligibility for new entrants and those who have 
been out of the workforce force for several years.
<P>
	All of these measures add up to about 150,000 more jobs. In 
addition, employment offices will have a greatly enhanced ability 
to link up people looking for work with job opportunities. Up to 
two million Canadians a year use information and advisory 
services available through the national employment service in the 
job search. A new computerized job matching system is now in 
place. It is called the electronic labour exchange. Located on the 
Internet, it matches jobs to people and people to jobs faster than 
any traditional method.
<P>
	People looking for work are also going to have access to a great 
deal more information on the qualifications required for different 
jobs, as well as things like group information sessions, job search 
clubs and other initiatives which will help them get back into the 
workforce.
<P>
	For example, in my riding of Oakville-Milton we have had the 
job search club for a year or so and we now have the statistics 
reported back as to the success rate. It is 80 percent. That is, 80 per 
cent who attended the job search club have now found work.
<P>
	There will also be appropriate counselling for people who need 
help finding work. People will get the kind of direct help they need 
to locate employment.
<P>
	A second change which is going to help create more jobs is the 
reduction in premiums and the reduction in the maximum 
allowable earnings. The combination of these two measures means 
that both employees and employers are going to save a 
considerable amount of money. For employers who have 
complained that payroll taxes hinder job creation, a modest 
reduction means that they will have money to invest in hiring more 
people. These 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2621"> 2621 </A></B>
<P>
changes will reduce premiums by $1.25 billion in  1996 and are 
predicted to create up to 20,000 new job opportunities.
<P>
	The third area of change which is going to create more jobs is the 
new active employment benefits. The government intends to work 
in concert with the provinces to help get people back to work. That 
means harmonizing the new employment benefits with provincial 
programs and making new delivery arrangements which could see 
provincial governments delivering federal programs. A series of 
federal-provincial agreements will be negotiated to work out the 
options.
<P>
	In reducing overlap and duplication, the government will be 
building a more efficient system that will provide better and more 
thorough support to unemployed Canadians. While the approaches 
may vary from province to province, the primary focus is on 
getting results, that is more people back into the workforce.
<P>
	The government is open to discussions on how best this can be 
put into place. It will be investing some $800 million of the savings 
that will be achieved with this legislation into active employment 
benefits. With the current $1.9 billion already budgeted for 
employment services this means now a total of $2.7 billion to 
actively help unemployed people get back to work.
<P>
	Upwards of 400,000 unemployed workers every year will 
qualify for a very flexible and innovative series of re-employment 
measures.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	Instead of getting off the shelf programs, people looking for 
work will be getting the kind of direct, personalized support 
tailored to get them into a job as quickly as possible. These 
methods have been tested and proven. We know they work because 
we have seen the results.
<P>
	Wage subsidies, for example, will encourage hiring and provide 
on the job experience. A claimant could arrange for a wage subsidy 
with a selected employer who will provide a job that will lead to 
long term employment or re-employment somewhere else. The 
wage subsidy will help thousands of people move into the 
workforce.
<P>
	For many people, getting off social assistance and 
unemployment benefits can be daunting, particularly when getting 
a job could mean a less secure income. There are also older 
workers facing the switch to a new industry and finding difficulty 
adjusting to it. That is why there will also be wage supplements to 
temporarily increase income for those who would otherwise find it 
difficult to take a lower paying job.
<P>
	People with the initiative and drive to start up their own 
businesses will be eligible for self-employment assistance. In most 
cases these new businesses employ the person starting up the 
business as well as one or two new employees.
<P>
	Skills loans and grants will be available for people who need to 
upgrade their employment qualifications. These will only be run in 
provinces which agree to have federal involvement. A series of 
community job partnerships will be undertaken to directly help 
people find work and experience while serving in their own 
communities.
<P>
	All these new measures will be in effect nationwide. As the 
components of the new EI system begin to serve workers across the 
country, the enthusiasm for the new program will grow.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
last week I rose in this House to appeal to my colleagues across the 
way. I told them we had brought out almost all the reasonable 
arguments that human reason could understand, and it seems that 
they still do not understood.
<P>
	I appealed to their hearts by telling them that workers in Canada 
and in Quebec want to work, that they are proud people who want 
to produce, but unfortunately they are not being given the chance. 
The motion proposes that someone who leaves his job voluntarily 
would be doubly penalized. This is a disgrace.
<P>
	It is very surprising to see these people, who were calling for 
exactly the opposite when they formed the opposition-I do not 
know on what planet or cloud they are living-today calling for 
measures that are truly insulting to the workers of Canada and 
Quebec.
<P>
	As proof, I offer what took place yesterday. A group of about a 
hundred people set out from my riding of Matapédia-Matane in 
the Gaspé Peninsula. These were people who are truly not rich. One 
of them told me he had had to sell his house, things were so bad.
<P>
	These people, who represented 35,000 others, came to the Hill to 
meet with the Prime Minister. They remembered that when he was 
in opposition-he was then reasonable, I would say-he wrote 
certain letters. So they said: ``At least, he will come and see us''.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	I was at the Langevin Building with them. Three people were 
asked to negotiate, if you will, a meeting with Mr. Chrétien. It 
appeared to be a huge favour to come and meet people from back 
home, who were representing 35,000 people.
<P>
	So three people from our region went to the office of Mr. 
Pelletier. They came back saying: ``Mr. Chrétien is meeting very 
important people today-''
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Am I right in understanding that the hon. 
member is quoting a letter or something that mentions the Prime 
Minister's name? Because, if it is not a quote, he must not use the 
Prime Minister's name, but rather refer to him as the Prime 
Minister, as the hon. member knows.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2622"> 2622 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Canuel:</B> Very well, Mr. Speaker. I stand corrected.
<P>
	These folks came to meet him. At that point, they were rudely 
told: ``You are not important''. People had the indecency to tell 
them: ``You do not count''. They were treated in a discourteous, ill 
mannered and disrespectful way.
<P>
	These people from back home said some things I would not 
repeat in this House, although they are very polite. They said: 
``Please tell your colleagues across the way that they have no 
manners''. The people from the Gaspé and from 
Matapédia-Matane call it poor manners when, after having 
travelled on the bus for 17 hours to meet Canada's first citizen, they 
get the brush off because, unfortunately, he does not particularly 
feel the need to exert himself since he will not necessarily find 
himself unemployed tomorrow. He will lose the next elections, but 
he will not necessarily be unemployed, because he has good 
connections. But the people where I come from rarely have 
connections.
<P>
	In addition to 17 hours on the road from the Gaspé via my riding, 
they put in another 18 on the return trip to make a total of 35 hours 
on the road-a solid work week. All that to come and see the Prime 
Minister, who did not even condescend to meet them.
<P>
	Since they could not see the Prime Minister, they thought they 
would ask to see Mr. Martin. Mr. Martin was not willing either.
<P>
	The first request they addressed to the Minister of Human 
Resources Development was refused with the words: ``It is a very 
important issue, but when people want to see me they have to ask 
me a week in advance''. People from back home are not used to 
doing that. Although they are very polite, they are not used to all 
this red tape, because they themselves earn a living by the sweat of 
their brows. They work day and night. There may be a few things 
they do not know, but they do know certain things. They know how 
to be polite; they know when one can or cannot be received.
<P>
	We asked the people from back home to be extremely polite. To 
which they replied: ``No problem. We are always polite. We know 
all about politeness''. There are, however, other people across the 
way, including the Prime Minister, who do not know about it.
<P>
	I am speaking on their behalf today. These people have been 
deeply hurt. I wish to thank my colleagues from Mercier, Lévis and 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup for their hard work. They went all 
the way. But the people from back home are also patient. Even 
though they are both polite and patient, they said: ``If the Prime 
Minister does not want to meet with us, what can we do? If the 
Minister of Finance does not want to meet with us, what is left for 
us to do?''
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development finally said: 
``Yes, I could perhaps meet with you''. So the people said: ``Look, 
we have been waiting for two hours. We still have a 18-hour trip 
back home to the Gaspé region''. Our leader met with them and 
told them: ``This is what the Bloc has done, what we wanted to 
do''. We tried in every possible way-by appealing to their minds 
and their hearts-to make those people understand all this, but they 
refuse to understand.
<P>
	Some people from my riding talked to me, including the mayor 
of Saint-Luc, who was representing a number of regional county 
municipalities. She said to me: ``What more can we do? Will other 
action have to be taken, like tabling petitions? You have given 120 
per cent, but they just will not listen''.
<P>
	The same people told me: ``We are calm, understanding people. 
But to want to use this insurance money that we have been paying 
for and that employers have been paying for to reduce the deficit, 
that we will never understand. We will never stand for it; it is just 
too cruel''. It is cruel, but not only for these people, who, on an 
individual basis, could probably wait a tad longer.
<P>
	In my community, often, in fairly large families, one spouse 
works away from home, while the other works, perhaps even 
harder, at home. In such cases, the family income is never very 
high, which means that the whole family is affected. Yesterday, a 
young couple told me: ``If we did not have four kids, it would not 
be so bad, we could remain calm a while longer, but we do not think 
we will be able to any longer''.
<P>
	I would like my hon. colleagues opposite to understand. There 
must be people who are having difficulties, people on 
unemployment in their ridings as well. I call upon my colleagues 
opposite and all members of this House to go out and talk to these 
people. I am sorry to have to put it this way, but people out there are 
disgusted. When I saw them off at the bus, they told me: ``We have 
had it''. And when they say they have had it, they mean they have 
had it up to here.

	<B>Mr. Nault:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. We have a member 
who is ready to speak. The Bloc just finished so I would assume it 
is our turn to start. Which motion is leading off?
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The parliamentary secretary is absolutely 
correct.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and 
Addington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to 
speak on Bill C-12 today, a bill that will help Canadians help 
themselves.
<P>
	I did not have the opportunity to speak on the previous motion 
put forward by the hon. member for Mercier, but I am sure the hon. 
member will be very glad, thinking back, when the motion is 
defeated. I expect her premier would be very annoyed. What would 
the motion do for anyone in the country?
<P>
	The recent budget of our neighbouring province was designed to 
help people and businesses. The motion would have cost our 
neighbouring province of Quebec hundreds of millions of dollars 
for businesses. It would have put us behind the eight ball, not 
counting the rest of the country.
<P>
	I heard great news in question period today. Exports are up by 
tens of billions of dollars. The Minister for International Trade 
shared with us that for every $1 billion in exports, 11,000 jobs are 
created, which is good news. It is what we need to hear. I see 
confidence being restored in communities across the country. 
Following this, investments are made.
<P>
	My riding of Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington is 
situated between Kingston and Belleville, Ontario. In the last 12 
months $1 billion has been invested. This is good news for our 
youth. Yet we share great concerns about our youth and future of 
the country.
<P>
	Where does the employment insurance bill leave youth? A major 
objective of employment insurance is to provide equal coverage to 
all workers, ensuring all hours of work are recognized. This is 
increasingly important in a world where more and more individuals 
have non-standard work patterns. Not only is the number of people 
who work part time increasing, but the number of individuals who 
earn a living through a number of small jobs is increasing.
<P>
	The new EI system will have minimal impact on the net income 
of young people but includes very important benefits for all part 
time workers which includes young people. The new EI system will 
reduce benefits by 8 per cent for youth under 25 years of age, 
versus 11 per cent for all Canadians, and we must consider 
investments made in communities.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2625"> 2625 </A></B>
<P>
	The previous speaker said no doubt we have problems and 
challenges with UI in our own ridings. We do. People come into 
our offices every day. The bill will help these people. The tools 
will be available for people who need them.
<P>
	Given the labour market characteristics of youth, various 
elements of the reform will impact differently on young Canadians 
than on other age groups. More stringent EI entrance requirements 
will affect young workers, which will prevent the development of 
dependency on insurance benefits early in their working lives and 
will encourage higher levels of employment. With youth as with 
other people, we can do more when we offer a hand up rather than a 
handout.
<P>
	The hours based entrance requirement and first dollar coverage 
will ensure every hour of work will contribute toward a claimant's 
eligibility. Today four out of ten part time workers are less than 25 
years old. The EI system will provide income protection for more 
young people if they work enough hours.
<P>
	Young people working less than 15 hours a week, mainly 
students, will be required to pay premiums for the first time under 
the EI system. The amount will be less than $3 a week for someone 
who works 14 hours at $7 an hour. There are advantages to this type 
of system. Insuring everyone who works, including working 
students, helps to ensure a level playing field in terms of premium 
payments and access to jobs.
<P>
	Making work by students insurable will give recognition to this 
labour market attachment once individuals enter the labour market 
on a permanent basis. After completing their formal studies, if they 
have sufficient work, attachment in their last year as students, for 
example 490 hours, they would not have to meet the more stringent 
910 hours entrance requirement if they faced difficulty finding 
stable employment.
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	Premiums will be refunded to approximately 625,000 young 
people under the premium refund program for individuals with 
earnings of $2,000 or less in any calendar year. This represents 48 
per cent of all individuals who will receive the refund. As well, 
400,000 or 31 per cent of those receiving the refund are full time 
students. That represents about 40 per cent of all full time students.
<P>
	It is recognized that under the first dollar coverage some 
employers who primarily employ part time workers will be 
required to pay more premiums. That is why it is being proposed 
that a two-year premium relief measure be put in place to offset 
some of the cost of the first dollar coverage for small business. As 
well, 300,000 small businesses will benefit from this measure.
<P>
	The youth unemployment rate is 16 per cent. It is a shameful 
number. It is over one and a half times the national average. Many 
young people attend school and  depend on summer and/or year 
round work to finance their education, as well as to obtain critical 
job experience.
<P>
	The government recognizes the particularly difficult situation 
facing youth and students. A number of initiatives have been 
announced to address these serious concerns. Youth will benefit 
from EI's active employment measures. Several of EI's 
employment tools will help unemployed young people get back to 
work. Targeted wage subsidies will help young people get the work 
experience they need to round out their résumés and to qualify for 
jobs. Job creation partnerships will bring government and 
community organizations together to give unemployed young 
people and others the opportunities they need to develop new, job 
ready skills.
<P>
	Youth will remain as a top priority for federal government 
programs funded from general revenues. In the 1996 budget, the 
government announced the reallocation of $315 million of budget 
savings to help create employment opportunities for young 
Canadians over the next three years. Funding for federal summer 
job placements will be doubled to $120 million in 1996-97. Most of 
the remaining funds are being directed to assist young people who 
have left school to find employment opportunities. It will be in 
addition to existing funding of $160 million annually for youth 
internship and youth service Canada.
<P>
	Many of these initiatives will be targeted to those with lower 
levels of education. They will also focus on providing employment 
opportunities in new and emerging sectors.
<P>
	Ontario is a diverse province. There is very high unemployment 
in northern Ontario. In my own riding along the south shores of 
Lake Ontario where $1 billion is invested there is a lower rate of 
unemployment. In the north part of my riding it is a much higher 
rate. Different parts of the province will have different entry levels 
for EI so we can treat the people fairly according to their area.
<P>
	Employment insurance will get unemployed workers back into 
jobs more quickly than before. Again, workers will be encouraged 
to help themselves.
<P>
	Ontario has had to deal with major adjustments to the emerging 
high tech economy. Many workers lost well-paying factory and 
office jobs and found themselves ill-equipped to move into new 
jobs with comparable wages. As a result, more Ontarians have 
faced longer periods of unemployment. More targeted, proactive 
re-employment measures will assist the workers to find and 
maintain employment and deal with this type of structural 
unemployment.
<P>
	Employment insurance means a workforce better prepared to 
meet the challenges of the rapidly changing job market in Ontario. 
The national employment service will offer higher quality job 
market information, on-line  job matching services and customized 
employment services. Helping Ontario get back to work more 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2626"> 2626 </A></B>
<P>
quickly means more competitive industries in Canada's economic 
heartland.
<P>
	I have heard people talk about these job kiosks and that they can 
be a positive or a negative according to where they are. My riding 
of Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington has more than 
5,000 miles of main road. The riding reaches from Lake Ontario to 
Algonquin Park. There cannot be an HRD office in all of these 
towns, yet throughout the riding there are job kiosks. This will save 
people driving 50 miles to find out what is available. Statistics 
prove that when people are encouraged to help themselves find 
work, they find work.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	I recently stopped at North Brook, Ontario. Even I could run the 
kiosk. I could punch the keys and bring up the jobs. If I could do it, 
I am sure anybody can run that computer. Often there are jobs 
listed. It is good for the people in local areas to find out what is 
available.
<P>
	The different parts of the EI legislation have to be addressed. We 
will have to watch to see that it does what we want it to do. The new 
system will be monitored. Across the country, we will be watching 
to see what happens. We want to help people because people are the 
most important part of our economy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I respect 
the hon. member, with whom I have been working for over two 
years, but I respectfully submit that he is deluding himself.
<P>
	Let us not kid ourselves. This bill will result in the loss of 
student jobs. Members of the Association des restaurateurs made it 
very clear when they came to my office. The government did not 
even deem appropriate to exempt students from having to pay 
contributions, at least those interested.
<P>
	Students already face all kinds of cost increases. Now, they will 
have to pay UI premiums and will only be repaid the following 
year, when they file their income tax returns. My fellow Bloc 
members will get back to this issue.
<P>
	This group includes the famous amendments to the first bill, 
which was so unacceptable that the government had to make 
changes as a result of the public outcry. At this point, I have 
something to tell members who keep saying that the opposition did 
not do its job because it did not move any amendments. 
Parliamentary procedure is such that a royal recommendation is 
required in order to make amendments affecting expenditures or 
revenues, whether in committee or in the House. So, do not tell us 
that we did not do our homework.
<P>
	I also want to say that, in 1993, Liberal members were 
thoroughly upset and demanded that the legislation be withdrawn. 
So, if your memory is failing, try at least to remember as far back 
as 1993.
<P>
	Let us take a look at the substance of these amendments, which 
are supposed to be beneficial not only for seasonal workers, but for 
all those who do not have stable jobs, jobs lasting the whole year. 
This includes those who work part time, who have odd jobs, who 
have contracts for a specific period, or who hold down one or two 
jobs.
<P>
	You will remember that the government had imposed a time 
period. This measure was obviously so bad that there was strong 
public protest, which resulted in a number of amendments being 
proposed. However, we have to be honest here. Instead of solving 
the problem of the majority, the legislation before us will facilitate 
things for some.
<P>
	A huge economic and social problem remains for most people. 
Why? Because the government continues to propose that earnings 
will be calculated over a period of only 26 weeks, out of 52. Worse 
still, the last version of the bill provides for a difference of two 
additional weeks in the length of unemployment period accepted, 
but it also provides that any week during which wages are earned 
will be included.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	This means that this will create an inflexibility not yet found in 
the provinces, in the regions where there is a lot of seasonal 
employment. This means that, from a strictly economic point of 
view-I am not even talking about individuals-people will only 
take work that gives them the weeks, the divisor they need. They 
will not want to work short weeks, because short weeks would 
decrease their earnings, and people are not crazy.
<P>
	What it means is that employers and workers will continue to act 
in an intelligent manner, in other words, they will work out 
agreements. And they will do this, however much you increase the 
penalties. You are upping the penalties, both in money and in time 
required for eligibility.
<P>
	You are in the process of creating a mindless mishmash. It makes 
no sense. You talk about flexibility, but you create rigid conditions 
and put people in the terrible situation of having to accept zero 
earnings or place themselves in the position of being found guilty 
of fraud and other awful things.
<P>
	We were told in committee that, with the amendments, workers 
would continue to accumulate hours in order to have decent weeks.
<P>
	Essentially, this amendment does not resolve anything. 
Employers who want to have employees will have to agree with 
them so that a work week makes sense. This will continue to create 
rigidity and, worse, many people  who were able to qualify will not 
be able 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2627"> 2627 </A></B>
<P>
to do so any more, because the 26 weeks are not always sufficient. 
That is true for people who work in the tourism sector, and not only 
in the regions.
<P>
	Indeed, there are many people in Montreal, Quebec, Vancouver 
and Victoria who are trying to get by and who can find term 
employment at the beginning of the year. If they do not qualify, 
they live from hand to mouth with their mother, their buddy or their 
girlfriend and then go look for another job. This provision does not 
make any sense.
<P>
	The government should understand there is no rush to introduce 
this reform that will mean a reduction in premiums of $1 billion for 
this year. What is the rush to reduce insurable maximum earnings? 
What is the rush to reduce benefits from a maximum of $445 to 
$413 and to further reduce to $140 or $120 benefits for people who 
barely get by with $200 per week? What is the rush?
<P>
	In the maritimes, the 1994 reform and the one presently on the 
table will mean $800 million less every year. Every year. Do not 
tell me the $300 million over three years will make up or 
compensate for that. That does not make any sense. This is not a 
policy that makes sense on the economic or the social level. I see 
many members smiling. People from the Gaspe Peninsula who 
came yesterday had despair written on their faces, and that is not 
funny.
<P>
	For many years, these people have been living in difficult 
conditions and having a hard time. They live through difficult and 
sometimes extreme climate conditions and, for many years, they 
have been accused of cheating, of milking the system; they cannot 
take it any more. So, when proposals such as these are made, they 
say they have had it up to here; they cannot take it any more.
<P>
	I wished their colourful accent alone would be sufficient to send 
us back to the drawing board. There is no rush to make a whole 
bunch of insecure by taking away from them the only pittance they 
can still count on, when it is feasible and possible.
<P>
	I am far from talking only for Quebec. I have talked many times 
for Canadians as a whole.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
some regret that I do not have the time in this grouping to do an 
analysis of the member's remarks.
<P>
	Most of us here know there needs to be a critical analysis done 
on those remarks. It really surprises me to hear the comments of the 
hon. member for Mercier on basically supporting restaurant owners 
who clearly do not want the current hour system in place because 
they like that 15 hour trap.
<P>
	As the member said and the restaurant owners are suggesting, 
students should be provided with an exemption for EI premiums 
because they will not qualify for benefits. Some students can 
qualify for EI. Those who lose a part time job may qualify if 
available for work during the same hours as before.
<P>
	Members opposite have complained about the entrance 
requirements. Work as a student can help someone meet new entry 
requirements when they enter the labour market on a permanent 
basis. Four hundred thousand full time students making $2,000 a 
year or less annually would have all premiums refunded. This 
represents about 40 per cent of full time students with earnings.
<P>
	The government is working in other ways to help create 
employment opportunities for youth, in part through the $315 
million announced in the budget.
<P>
	In this group of amendments in the course of my remarks I want 
to give the members opposite a challenge to support more openness 
and more decision making by MPs in government.
<P>
	As the member for Malpeque I have an amendment at this stage 
to improve the bill. Motion No. 23, if carried, will ensure that 
members of Parliament will be given greater control over future 
changes in the EI act. That is what democracy is all about. 
Members of Parliament can be involved more in the decision 
making process.
<P>
	The bill in clause 14(5) reads: ``For the purpose of achieving a 
uniformed divisor of 22 in subsection (2), the minister may, with 
the approval of the governor in council, by regulation amend the 
table in that subsection by increasing to a maximum of 22''. 
Subsections (6) to (12) give the rules of procedure in terms of how 
that would be done.
<P>
	My rationale for deleting those clauses of the bill are this. Under 
the current legislation the minister would bring forward an increase 
to the divisor on the basis of a report to the minister, not 
Parliament, which satisfies the minister, not Parliament, that 
individuals, communities and the economy have adequately 
adjusted to the changes contained in the act to the insurance and 
employment assistance programs and to the effectiveness of the 
employment benefits and support measures contained in the act.
<P>
	The terms and conditions of the report and the process by which 
is provided to Parliament are outlined in clause 3 of Bill C-12. 
However, in terms of examining clause 14, as written, there is no 
provision made that the minister must await a report from the 
appropriate parliamentary committee before the minister can bring 
forward the regulations increasing the divisor.
<P>
	I always worry about what the minister may or may not do. 
Increasingly the public is concerned about government by 
executive council rather than by the people's representatives. By 
deleting this section we  ensure any changes relative to the divisor 
will be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2628"> 2628 </A></B>
<P>
made after appropriate discussion and legislative change in the 
House.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	I agree with the concerns of the public of executive government 
and that decisions of the magnitude of increasing the divisor should 
be made only after serious debate by representatives of all parties 
in the House of Commons.
<P>
	There is no question there are some out there who are using that 
section of the act against us right now. There are some who are 
saying these are great amendments put forward, known as the 
Scott, Regan and Augustine amendments, but really they are saying 
these are just smoke and mirrors because after 1998 ``the minister 
may''.
<P>
	What this amendment will do is to ensure that those amendments 
made by my colleagues in the Liberal Party will remain intact. If 
further changes are to be made, they will be debated in the House 
prior to any such changes being made. The public will have a 
chance to have input.
<P>
	There are other good reasons for this amendment. I am sure the 
members opposite will enjoy this. On page 91 of the red book there 
is the following statement:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The most important asset of government is the confidence it enjoys of the 
citizens to whom it is accountable.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The people are irritated with governments that do not consult them, or that 
disregard their views, or that try to conduct key parts of the public business 
beyond closed doors.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This amendment ensures we meet that red book commitment and 
that debates are held in this place prior to important decisions being 
made.
<P>
	What will be required of the minister is that without the sections 
currently in the bill the minister will have to table in the House the 
appropriate legislation to increase the divisor. As a result of this the 
bill to increase the divisor will receive first and second reading, 
committee examination, report state and third reading, as all 
legislation currently does.
<P>
	As a result members of Parliament will have an opportunity of 
debating and, if required, amending the legislation on future 
divisors. The report provided to the minister under clause 3 will 
then have a key role to reform in providing the government and 
members with the justification for any future changes to the 
divisor.
<P>
	Most important, Canadians who will be directly affected by any 
changes in the future will have the opportunity of submitting their 
views to their MPs in a parliamentary committee.
<P>
	Taking power out of regulation, out of the bureaucracy and 
putting it into the hands of parliamentarians and the people they 
represent is improving democracy and improving openness in 
government.
<P>
	I expect members opposite as well would see the amendment as 
worthy of their support. This is a real opportunity for members 
opposite to support openness in government and I call on them to 
support this very important amendment.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to my colleagues 
across the floor speaking in support of this legislation. It amuses 
me, to say the least.
<P>
	We find these reforms supposedly made to the unemployment 
insurance act are really cosmetic changes that in essence centralize 
rather than decentralize.
<P>
	This whole reform to the unemployment insurance program will 
not help create any jobs. It will probably be instrumental in 
bringing job loss to the part time workforce.
<P>
	I would like to speak to the government's promise in the budget 
speech that it would not raise any taxes. I find that quite funny 
because here we have it adding a 7 per cent payroll tax through a 
change in the unemployment insurance program. This 7 per cent 
payroll tax will affect part time workers, the young people who are 
trying to enter the workforce in part time employment while they 
are going to school, many of whom are trying to help finance their 
education.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	This will be a great loss to them. It will also be a loss to part time 
workers who happen to be mothers trying to get some work 
experience to get back into the workforce when their children are 
old enough to go to school.
<P>
	For these young people and moms who work part time this 
change in the unemployment insurance act will reduce the number 
of jobs available to them. It will add a tax burden to the employers 
as well as to these part time workers. I find it a bit hypocritical that 
the government said in the budget it would not bring in any new 
taxes but then brings them in under program changes.
<P>
	This 7 per cent payroll tax is likely to affect about 2.23 million 
jobs. That is not a small number. It is a substantial number of first 
time jobs and part time jobs which will be affected by the 
legislation. Our party is very concerned about that.
<P>
	Our party is also very concerned about the lack of changes to 
maternity benefits. Presently there are two benefits, a maternity 
benefit for natural parents and a parental benefit for both natural 
and adoptive parents. Under the present system a natural parent 
may be eligible for both benefits up to 30 weeks, whereas an 
adoptive parent is eligible only for a minimum of 15 weeks.
<P>
	The Reform amendments to the legislation repeal both of these 
benefits and introduce one new child care benefit for which all 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2629"> 2629 </A></B>
<P>
parents, natural or adoptive, may  apply. This benefit is for a 
duration of a maximum of 15 weeks.
<P>
	We have heard adoptive parents tell us they feel very 
discriminated against under the present legislation because they are 
eligible for only 15 weeks where natural parents are eligible for 30 
weeks. We in the Reform Party believe there should not be any 
discrimination in government legislation. Therefore we would like 
to see this discrimination removed.
<P>
	The Reform child care benefit would eliminate any inequities or 
discrimination between these different types of parents. It would 
avoid making any value judgments as to whether natural or 
adoptive parents are more deserving of certain types of leave, 
longer leave, et cetera. Instead they would all be eligible for the 
same period of benefits, 15 weeks.
<P>
	These changes to the Unemployment Insurance Act are positive 
moves and something which should be supported by government 
members.
<P>
	We also find great difficulty in a promise by the government 
during the referendum debate of last fall when it promised it would 
transfer manpower training to the province. Under this legislation 
it is reneging on that promise and keeping control of manpower 
training at the federal level. The government has failed to meet this 
promise and that changes should be made to bring the dollars for 
manpower training under the jurisdiction and control of the 
provinces.
<P>
	The Reform Party believes that although there are changes which 
need to be made to the unemployment insurance programs, the 
government has fallen far short of meeting some of the great needs 
the country faces. We do not feel its changes have done anything 
but add more dollars to the coffers for the federal government to 
spend recklessly.
<P>
	It is undermining job creation. It is undermining young people in 
their attempts to enter the workforce. By not addressing 
discrimination of parental benefits and maternity in the legislation 
it is certainly continuing the discriminatory practice.
<P>
	I urge government members to consider the amendments placed 
before the House by the Reform Party and give them due 
consideration to improve the legislation they have put before the 
House.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank the 
hon. member for Fredericton-York-Sunbury and say that I also 
observe the rules that members must speak in turn.
<P>
	I heard the comments made by the Reform member. I share 
many of her views, especially about the broken promise concerning 
provincial repatriation of manpower training. But I am more 
critical of the hon. member for  Malpeque who, once again, decided 
to correct the facts given by the hon. member for Mercier. I think 
he got his figures all wrong when he said that the government 
announced a $315 million allocation for young people.
<P>
	As the critic for youth and training up to last month, I can say 
that, according to the press release issued by the Minister of 
Human Resources Development, the amount was rather $160 
million. I will not make an issue of it, but it is very important.
<P>
	I do commend the hon. member for one thing: his amendment 
should limit the power of the Minister of Human Resources 
Development by forcing him to report to the House. I recognize 
that as a good point. At the same time, this suggests a certain 
degree of mistrust in the overly centralized power of ministers of 
Human Resources Development, present and future.
<P>
	The hon. member referred once again to the red book, when he 
talked about transferring powers from bureaucrats to committees 
and to the House. He should not have mentioned that, since we 
were gagged in committee. For only the second time in this 
Parliament and the first time since Confederation, a committee got 
gagged by the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Easter:</B> It was a filibuster.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> There have been lots of filibusters on other 
occasions, but for the first time since Confederation and the second 
time in this Parliament, the government has curtailed the 
proceedings of a committee. So much for that promise. The hon. 
member for Malpeque was a member of that committee. He says 
that they will hold more consultations and that they will avoid 
holding consultations behind closed doors.
<P>
	I would remind the hon. member for Malpeque that we proposed 
that consultations on the Unemployment Insurance Act be held in 
the field, but the Liberal majority refused, preferring to hold them 
in Ottawa. However, they agreed to hear witnesses, but through 
video conference, not in the field. We asked the Liberal members if 
it was possible to hear several groups at a time through video 
conference. They said: ``No, only one group at a time, and only two 
people''. They do not want them to be in a room where people 
could hear and see, even though in the Gaspé peninsula and in 
many other areas people do not have access to the TV channel 
broadcasting committee proceedings.
<P>
	In spite of that objection, they said no and they curtailed debate. 
Was that the red book promise, to start holding consultations and 
then ask the House to first gag the committee, and second to limit 
debate at report stage and allow only one day of debate on third 
reading? We have to remember that second reading was skipped 
because we supposedly had had a pre-study in committee.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2630"> 2630 </A></B>
<P>
	I would rather judge people after what they do and not after 
what they say or even what they write. The red book was prepared 
three years ago, and it is only this year that things get done.
<P>
	In previous comments, I spoke about the unemployment rate. I 
have here a Canadian Press report published by the daily <I>La Presse</I>. 
Here is what it says: ``The unemployment rate is underestimated, 
Scotia says. A study by the Bank of Nova Scotia says that the real 
unemployment rate in Canada is higher that the official monthly 
figures. Two economists at the bank have estimated that the real 
unemployment rate in March was not the 9.3 per cent reported by 
Statistics Canada, but 13 per cent. The study offers a depressing 
view of an economy unable to generate enough jobs to keep up with 
the number of people capable of working''.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	It goes on to say: ``-the number of employed people has grown 
at only one-third the pace of people old enough to work during the 
1990s. Officially, the unemployment rate has dropped from 11.9 
per cent in 1992 to 9.3 per cent in March''.
<P>
	The study says that some people are now being left out of 
statistics. This is a serious study by the Bank of Nova Scotia.
<P>
	Since we are dealing with figures, let me point out another thing, 
that is the unemployment insurance fund surplus. When the 
government took office in 1993, the deficit for that year was of 
$1.208 billion. The following year, that is the first full year the 
government was in power, there were cuts-Bill C-17 was enacted 
and its effects are still being felt-and there was a $2.283 billion 
surplus.
<P>
	The preliminary data for 1995 show a $4.313 billion surplus. 
Because of the measures the government is expected to take, the 
surplus should reach $4.805 billion and we know it will go up to $5 
billion. As the hon. member for Mercier said, in a surplus situation, 
why was the government in such a hurry to go ahead with this 
initiative? Also, this year, we are forgoing something like a billion 
dollar in premiums. Why? What was the hurry?
<P>
	According to the government's own documents, the 
repercussions in each of the provinces are as follows: for 1997-98, 
we have 13 per cent less: $43 million for Newfoundland; for PEI, 
the province of the hon. member for Malpeque, it is 10 per cent 
less, $15 million; for Nova Scotia, 8 per cent less; for New 
Brunswick, $65 million, 11 per cent less; for Quebec, $400 million, 
8 per cent less; for Ontario, $300 million, 6 per cent less; for 
Manitoba, $30 million, 6 per cent less; for Saskatchewan, $20 
million, 6 per cent less; for Alberta, $80 million, 6 per cent less; for 
British Columbia, 9 per cent less.
<P>
	I would like to remind those who believe that some economic 
sectors will be winners that all of them will be losers, according to 
the figures of the Department of  Human Resources Development. 
In agriculture, it is 12 per cent less; in forestry, 14 per cent less; in 
mines, 7 per cent less; in manufacturing, 9 per cent less; in 
construction, 9 per cent less; in transports, 8 per cent less; in 
communications, 3 per cent less; in wholesale trade, 6 per cent 
less-and I am mentioning the highest only; in the hotel industry, 8 
per cent less; in other services, 7 per cent less; for an average of 8 
per cent less. All economic sectors will be losers according to the 
figures of the Department of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	Amendments were moved. The three would add up to $365 
million, of which $345 million will come supposedly from savings 
made because of a better fight against fraud by the government. It 
is hoped that $345 million will be recovered. Right now, fraud 
recovery is estimated at a total of $90 million. How can we recover 
four times that amount? We would need to catch four times as 
many cheaters to get that amount. That is what the bill is all about.
<P>
	I repeat, despite its name, this is not a reform aimed at creating 
employment opportunities, but a reform aimed at imposing more 
control on potential unemployed persons. As the hon. member for 
Malpeque said, the reform should be a reform aimed at eliminating 
bureaucratic errors. About $300 million were lost because of errors 
and three times out of four these errors are made by the Department 
of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	I would like to mention the administrative errors contained in the 
numbers given by the bureaucrats. The last evening of our work in 
committee, I myself spotted two errors in a computer produced 
table distributed by the government. One of them concerned 
Quebec and, listen to this, it was an error of $4 million made by the 
computers.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	It was the same thing for B.C. I cannot give you the total picture, 
but the real impact for Quebec was a loss of about 6 per cent of the 
total-and a loss is a loss. With the three Liberal amendments, 
there are possible savings of $365 million. I do not say that it would 
be the best solution, because the $2 billion in cuts will remain, but 
at least, it is not as bad.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Lévis for editing the reports 
which guided our deliberations late into the night.
<P>
	I would like to explain the amendments. In order to explain the 
need to make the amendments I want to put on the record why I 
personally believe the legislation was worthy of amendment rather 
than rejection. There are some good things in the bill that I want to 
bring to the attention of the House.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2631"> 2631 </A></B>
<P>
	The shift from weeks to hours as the method of calculating 
eligibility or the value of work is an improvement, in terms of 
accessibility, in terms of duration, and in terms of people who 
have multiple jobs, for 87 per cent of the labour force in the 
province of New Brunswick. Eighty-seven per cent of the people 
work more than 35 hours a week. If they work more than 35 hours 
a week they benefit from the new bill.
<P>
	People are entitled to employment benefits even after they have 
exhausted income benefits going back three years, or five years in 
the case of maternity or illness. That means all kinds of people who 
lost out on UI based programs in the past will now be eligible for 
up to three or five years of benefits, depending on the nature of 
their previous benefits.
<P>
	The people whose family income is less than $26,000 saw, even 
before the amendments to which I am about to speak, an average 
increase in benefits of 7 per cent.
<P>
	Finally, and this is very important, I support the clawback as it 
applies to people who draw on the system every year at the high 
income levels. Committee members from across the way were 
having difficulty with this, so I want to put it on the record. I do not 
think we can sustain the program politically if there are people 
making the minimum wage, working regular jobs and paying into 
the program when there are people making twice as much money 
and drawing every year, year over year. I just do not think that can 
be politically sustained. I am not talking about someone who lost 
their job; I am talking about someone who makes a large amount of 
money and draws every year. I do not think it is fair.
<P>
	Having said that, there are three major amendments. There are 
many amendments and I thank the hon. member for Malpeque for 
recognizing the need to amend the suggestion that would allow the 
government to move on its incremental shifts.
<P>
	There is the intensity rule. At the start we were talking about an 
intensity rule which would draw down the level of benefits from 55 
to 45 on 10 weeks. By the time the legislation was introduced in 
December it was drawn down from 55 to 50, depending on 20 week 
blocks. The amendment of the hon. member for 
Etobicoke-Lakeshore will protect low income families whose 
family incomes are under $26,000 from the intensity rule. That 
means that instead of increasing their benefits by 7 per cent, their 
benefits will be increased by 13 per cent. That is a 13 per cent 
average increase in benefits for people whose family incomes are 
less than $26,000.
<P>
	On the question of the divisor, when we originally started talking 
about it a year and a half ago we were talking about something in 
the neighbourhood of 26 weeks as a constant. By the time the 
legislation came forward it was 20 weeks. Then it was decided, to 
the credit of the former minister, that it should be done  
incrementally so as not to shock the system too much. It would be 
done over a period of time.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	Finally, the fourth time the divisor was changed via an 
amendment presented by the member for Halifax, the divisor 
became two weeks more than the amount one would need to get 
into the system. In my part of the country it is 12, 14, 15 or 16 
weeks, depending on the unemployment rate, plus 2. That is the 
improvement to the divisor. It is a significant improvement worth 
an enormous amount of money to people who cannot afford to lose 
in this program.
<P>
	Third, there is the gap. I am inexplicably linked to the gap on this 
issue. I have a hat. Every time the commercials come on American 
television my kids say that daddy's going to be on television, they 
are talking about the gap.
<P>
	When the shift was made from weeks to hours, the government 
had to come up with a mechanism to determine how much money a 
person would get in the new system. The original proposal was that 
from the time persons made their claim, they would go back the 
amount of weeks as defined by the divisor. Unfortunately, the 
language of the bill was that one would go back 14 weeks, or 15 
weeks or 16 weeks. There was no reference to work.
<P>
	Consequently, if claimants worked a period and were off for a 
period, then worked enough to get their claim, when they counted 
back consecutive weeks from their claim, there were many zeros. It 
was because people worked in industries where they might work in 
the spring and in the fall but might not work in the summer. It is 
very important to recognize that space.
<P>
	The amendment that I was proud to put forward states that if one 
does not work for up to 26 weeks, it does not count. One can go 
back from the time one lays a claim, not to weeks but to weeks of 
work. By doing that $246 million was put into the system which 
will go into the hands of people who are struggling to put enough 
weeks together to draw employment insurance. It is very important 
that Canadians understand exactly what this means. There is equity 
in the program.
<P>
	I would like to thank the two ministers, the present minister and 
his predecessor, for having engaged this place in a very extensive 
discussion. Anyone who says that this debate was closed down 
should have been with the committee in Whitehorse, Edmonton, 
Saskatoon, Victoria, Vancouver, Yellowknife, Iqaluit, all over the 
country. Over a couple of years it received approximately 600 
briefs.
<P>
	This was a very well debated issue. As a result, many changes 
were made. I remember the two-tier concept which we do not see 
anymore. There are various amendments I have talked about today. 
We went into this exercise with a twofold objective, to deal with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2632"> 2632 </A></B>
<P>
the  anomalies created by unemployment insurance of which there 
are many. That has been done.
<P>
	It is not over. It will never be over. It is an ongoing process to 
which improvements can always be found. I am beginning to 
identify some aspects of the system which need attention. On 
balance it is a significant improvement which constitutes very 
significant reform in the system.
<P>
	Again I thank both ministers, I thank all colleagues involved 
over the past two years in committees on this issue. It has been an 
incredible exercise. As I said a week ago during debate on this bill, 
the system, the committee and the process has served the nation 
well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, </B><B>BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on the motions in Group No. 
6. I believe they were moved by the Reform Party, the Liberal 
Party, the Bloc and the NDP.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	The Bloc motions seek to delete many clauses of the bill, namely 
clauses 12, 14, 25 and 27 to 61, which would make the bill 
inoperative as far as those clauses are concerned. As my colleague 
from Mercier said on several occasions, members will recall that 
this strategy was used ad nauseam by the current Minister of 
Human Resources Development when the Conservatives 
introduced the controversial GST legislation in this House. 
Members will also recall that the minister himself presented more 
than 60 amendments to neutralize one by one all the clauses of the 
bill on the GST.
<P>
	Following that, the Liberal government promised to 
``scrap''-of course, I am quoting here-the GST, and this promise 
resulted in the resignation of a member, a minister and, to some 
extent, in a loss of confidence of Canadians in this government.
<P>
	Along with the attempt to delete some clauses, other 
amendments were also moved. All that allowed us to point out and 
prove to the population that our fundamental option on this issue is 
a perfect match for what ought to be the population's best interests. 
Our main option is to have the bill withdrawn and to start all over 
from scratch.
<P>
	Why? Because this bill is utterly unfair. It will result in 
claimants receiving fewer benefits for shorter periods of time and 
therefore being forced to go on welfare much sooner.
<P>
	My colleague for Lévis earlier quoted new statistics from Scotia 
Bank indicating clearly that the unemployment rate quoted, the one 
given in the statistics, is not the real rate, because more and more 
people are not appearing in the statistics on unemployment or 
elsewhere. They have simply stopped  receiving benefits and are 
not yet getting welfare, although they are headed in that direction.
<P>
	The bill is also unfair because it will be increasingly difficult to 
obtain unemployment insurance and because the bill creates two 
categories of unemployed: the ordinary unemployed and the 
frequently unemployed, that is, seasonal workers who will not have 
quite the same rights.
<P>
	The bill is also somewhat regressive. There has been a lot of talk 
about the decrease in the maximum insurable earnings from 
$42,380 to $39,000. What does this mean in reality? It means that 
people earning over $39,000 will stop contributing. That is, people 
who earn over $39,000, before, it was $42,000, will contribute less, 
and the big companies employing them will also pay less. The 
difference in the amounts is estimated at $1 billion right now. This 
reduction in contributions will, to be compensated, be transferred 
to the base of the pyramid, to the lowliest folks, those hardest up 
and those who work very infrequently. They will be taxed. Their 
contributions will have to be paid the first hour they work.
<P>
	So $1 billion from the upper class and the most profitable 
companies will be transferred to the class of people earning the 
least and to small and medium size businesses, which are the only 
ones that create jobs. Therefore, this bill is anti-employment, 
because employers who have workers earning more than $39,000 
and who need people to work 10 per cent overtime will, instead of 
hiring people who will pay premiums as soon as they start working, 
prefer to ask those already employed to work overtime. This means 
there will be no incentive to share work.
<P>
	From a fiscal or bookkeeping point of view, the surplus of $5 
billion will, as we have so often said, show up on the books as 
government assets when, in actual fact, it is as though the 
government were garnisheeing wages to artificially reduce its 
deficit.
<P>
	Each and every time they address the bill before us, the 
government has been trying to find a scapegoat.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	We all remember what the Prime Minister himself said at least 
twice in the House. It was two years ago, I think. When asked why 
public finances were in such a mess, he answered it was the 
beer-guzzling couch potatoes that were to blame. This made the 
headlines for a while, but he had just singled out those in the 
system who were to be targeted by the cuts and let on that they 
should been ashamed.
<P>
	Furthermore, my Liberal colleague for Malpeque said this 
morning, among other things, since he spoke several times, that it 
would be like encouraging some people to burn down their own 
houses, to torch the system. But we all know that those who are 
torching the system are not  those at the bottom of the social scale. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2633"> 2633 </A></B>
<P>
They are not on UI benefits. The auditor general has just identified 
them.
<P>
	I will just take a few minutes to read an article on what was just 
found by the auditor general. It made the news for only one day, but 
I hope there will be more reports on this topic, because it is the tip 
of a gigantic iceberg. The auditor tells us: ``We have examined two 
advance rulings concerning transfers to the United States of assets 
worth at least $2 billion held by family trusts in Canada. In our 
opinion, the transactions these decisions were about''- listen to 
what the auditor has to say, he is the epitome of diplomac -``have 
thwarted the legislator's intent''-this means that the law was not 
abided by, but it is put in very kinds terms-``with regard to taxing 
capital gains''.
<P>
	This means that $2 billion were transferred from a Canadian 
family trust to the United States. This case was under review. By 
making this decision, the government created a precedent, and 
now, if the decision is not rescinded, everybody will take advantage 
of it.
<P>
	Today we put a question to the minister on this very issue. I will 
repeat the question: The minister has the authority to rescind 
decisions by Revenue Canada and collect hundreds of millions, if 
not billions, of dollars in taxes owed to the federal government. Is 
she going to take action? Her answer was that she had taken action. 
She was reviewing the case.
<P>
	In the meantime, billions of dollars are going south and the 
unemployed, who have hardly any means of support, are being 
pointed out as parasites. I think it is a case of mistaking identity: 
the ones who are torching the system are not the ones we think. As 
a matter of fact, the auditor is not the only one to raise this issue. I 
will remind the House that he is not a member of the Bloc 
Quebecois nor the Parti Quebecois, of course.
<P>
	Yesterday, the <I>Financial Post</I> came out with some astonishing 
news based on material it obtained, apparently, from Revenue 
Canada, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A federal government report points to news of offshore tax 
havens by Canadian corporations and says up to 20 per cent of 
international transactions that should be reported are hidden from 
Revenue Canada. Who is the problem in this country?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We should not be singling out the unemployed. We should start 
by collecting the taxes that companies do not pay. I continue.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The study suggests as much as $60 billion-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We hear figures of $500 million, $200 million. We are singling 
out the unemployed as one of the biggest  problems in Canada. We 
spend a whole week talking about that and, meanwhile, $60 billion 
have left the country. We have set precedents which will allow this 
practice to continue. We put questions to the minister and she tells 
us that she is studying the matter.
<P>
	People whose unemployment insurance will be cut-and it will 
come pretty fast-should remember that if they are targeted for 
cuts, if the government is appropriating the surplus of the 
unemployment insurance fund to reduce the deficit, it is because 
billions are leaving the country without any taxes being paid and 
nothing is being done to prevent it.
<P>
	I will just read a little bit more:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Total international transactions by banks and trust companies 
soared to $84 billion in 1991 from $52 billion in the previous year.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Thus there is a constant upward trend. Since coming to the 
House, from the very first weeks in fact, the Bloc Quebecois has 
been asking for an exhaustive study of the Canadian taxation 
system, family trusts and tax havens. What did we get? We have 
absolutely no idea how many family trusts there are. We have no 
idea how much money there is in those trusts. However, we know 
that billions of dollars leave Canada while the unemployed are 
being used as scapegoats.
<P>
<B>(1400)</B>
<P>
	As far as tax havens are concerned, we are told the issue will be 
examined in a few months by people who are the chief users of 
such tax havens. You can easily understand that we are not 
enthused about supporting an unemployment insurance reform in 
such circumstances.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, because of the 
difficult economic context of the past few years, most people must 
now question how long their jobs will last and how secure they are. 
Because of the economic context, even someone who has been in 
the same job for the last 10, 15 or 20 years can no longer be sure of 
how long he will be able to keep it.
<P>
	Recent examples have shown how bad the situation is. The most 
recent one is the Kenworth plant, where workers whose jobs had 
seemed secure for many years suddenly learned the plant was 
closing. In this kind of context, people must be much more 
provident than before in preparing for what could almost be called 
the whims of fate. No one today knows whether they will be able to 
keep their jobs.
<P>
	As a result, all the plans people were making to buy things like 
houses, trips or cars have become uncertain. People can no longer 
make long term plans because they feel insecure. In the old days, 
their relative job security allowed them to spend or at least to think: 
``If I ever lose my job because of economic conditions, I can still  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2634"> 2634 </A></B>
<P>
count on unemployment insurance to keep me at the same income 
level for a certain time while I look for a new job''.
<P>
	People had much more confidence in the unemployment 
insurance system, which was then a true insurance policy. It was 
aimed at providing a degree of security for workers; it was a 
cushion protecting them against job loss. People could still afford 
to buy a house on the grounds that, if they lost their jobs and were 
without a salary for a few months, UI would make up the 
difference. With the help of lending institutions such as banks and 
credit unions, they could hope to pull through.
<P>
	In the last two years in my riding office I have had the 
opportunity to meet with and talk to hundreds of people having 
problems with the UI system. The economic context being as I 
described earlier, more and more people have trouble seeing the UI 
system as a real insurance policy in case of job loss.
<P>
	Not only did the unemployment insurance fund show a deficit 
during those years, but the administrative process became heavier 
and the claims system became more complicated to a point where 
people in need were not even sure if they would qualify for 
unemployment insurance.
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	Here are a few examples. First, let us look at people who have a 
business and who have a family, who have children. The first 
people they hire are their children, which is quite normal.
<P>
	Let us suppose I own an asphalt paving company. You know that, 
in Canada, at least in Quebec and I think in most provinces, asphalt 
paving is a summer industry. It is rather difficult to pave streets, 
driveways, and so on, in the winter.
<P>
	Let us suppose I own an asphalt paving company and I hire my 
two sons to work for me. They work all summer but, unfortunately, 
I have to tell them in November: ``I no longer have work for you. 
There is no paving work done in driveways and in the streets 
because snow is coming. The government has stopped all highway 
construction work for the winter''.
<P>
	Therefore, I advise my sons, who paid unemployment insurance 
premiums during the whole period, to apply for UI benefits for the 
winter. But now people at the UI office question the validity of 
their claims. They think there is something fishy because they are 
the owner's sons. There were no questions asked when it came time 
to take the premiums, to deduct the premiums from their salary, but 
now when they come to claim benefits, there is a great concern 
over whether the owner's son was really in an employer-employee 
relationship or whether it was not more of a father-son relationship.
<P>
	All the while the UI inspectors carry out their investigation, the 
kids have no income. They too, in turn,  must deprive their own 
children of the necessities of life because when you have no 
income, the whole family suffers.
<P>
	While UI is carrying out its investigation, these citizens who 
paid UI premiums do not receive benefits, until it is established 
beyond all doubt that they are indeed entitled to them, until it is 
established beyond all doubt that if these kids had not done the 
work, their father would have had to hire other people to do it.
<P>
	This is the kind of thing that, in my opinion, is very unfair to 
people paying for a service. If there was a desire to improve things, 
instead of assuming from the outset that people were dishonest and 
taking advantage of a situation, why not trust them and assume 
from the outset that, in these cases, since their premiums were 
accepted, they will be considered eligible for unemployment 
insurance and receive the benefits claimed? If investigations are 
needed, let themm be done afterward; if false claims are 
discovered, people will be penalized accordingly. But taxpayers 
who have made contributions cannot be made to wait for months 
until an investigation is over.
<P>
	That is the first example of how Bill C-12, as it stands, does not 
make unemployment insurance any better.
<P>
	My second example involves availability, which we would have 
liked to have seen improved by Bill C-12. Someone on UI would 
often like to take training, so as to improve his chances in today's 
competitive atmosphere. His idea is: if I am having trouble making 
a living with the knowledge, experience, skills and training I have 
at present, I will try to improve my situation by taking some 
upgrading courses and learning something new. This is a 
completely normal reaction, and one many people have.
<P>
<B>(1410)</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, when a person is receiving unemployment 
insurance, he does not have the luxury of doing this, for anyone 
who enrols in a course is considered by unemployment insurance 
officials to be no longer available for work. In other words, if you 
get off your backside and take the initiative to do something, you 
will get your UI cut off as no longer available for work. Not very 
encouraging to those trying to help themselves.
<P>
	We might have hoped that Bill C-12 would have done something 
to help these people improve their situation, but no. And what is 
worse yet, when there were openings for people to take courses, 
they were even told: ``Sir or Madam, you have too much education 
already, you have plenty of training, you are quite self-sufficient 
enough, so you do not need this course. So just keep on waiting 
until we find some way to help you''.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I see you are indicating that my time is up. I hope to 
be able to continue sometime this afternoon, so as to get across my 
entire message on this matter.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
enter this debate and speak on part II.
<P>
	It is important to talk about part II because there has been a 
significant amount of contradiction by the opposition. The Bloc has 
been claiming on a number of fronts in the last weeks as we have 
debated this bill both in the House and in committee that it is a do 
nothing bill, that it is intended to reduce costs, that it does not 
create employment or that it is not intended to help create jobs. On 
the reverse of that, which is the intriguing part of this, the Bloc then 
criticizes the bill for having active measures to help people get jobs 
and the clear job creating measures it contains.
<P>
	We all know and have heard this on numerous occasions. The 
member for Mercier has asked when the Minister of Human 
Resources Development is going to help people get back to work. 
He has asked when certain things are going to be done as far as the 
active measures are concerned. Then opposition members stand 
during this debate and say there are no measures to help people get 
back to work.
<P>
	With the contradictions and the compounding of the confusion 
the member for Mercier is putting out to the public, I thought I 
would take the last 10 minutes I have today to set the record 
straight.
<P>
	The confusion the members have is hurting their credibility and 
God only knows in this place we certainly do not need members' 
credibility to be affected by making contradictions. As an example 
there is the claim by the member for Drummond who said on May 
6 at page 2374 in <I>Hansard</I>: ``There is no concrete measure for job 
creation in this unemployment insurance reform''. Then there is the 
member for Châteauguay who said on May 6 that this was an 
anti-employment measure because it has the audacity to cut a 
payroll tax that we know affects job creation.
<P>
	How then do opposition members describe the job creation 
partnerships that are provided in the bill? How do they describe the 
transitional jobs fund of $300 million that will go to work to create 
some 15,000 jobs which, once this bill finally passes the House, 
will be available in the higher unemployment regions? Some of 
those areas are Quebec, northern Ontario and Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	I can safely say that many of us in this place are waiting for that 
transitional fund to kick in so we can help people find employment. 
How do opposition members explain the fact that this bill will 
result in some 75,000 to 100,000 new job opportunities once it is 
fully implemented?
<P>
	Again those are contradictions members continue to dismiss as 
irrelevant in their debate. They say that no jobs are being created, 
that there is no help for anybody. At  the same time they argue 
asking why we are entering into provincial jurisdiction and why 
there are these five employment measures. There are all kinds of 
these arguments which for some unknown reason we cannot square 
no matter how hard we try.
<P>
	The simple fact is that employment insurance is about jobs. It 
focuses on helping people get back to work with the right kind of 
support, whether the help is financial through income benefits or 
through employment benefits which is part II of the bill.
<P>
<B>(1415)</B>
<P>
	Let me quote the contradiction that pops up with the BQ again. 
The member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot instructs the government 
to ensure that people who find themselves in this unfortunate 
situation are able, in the short or medium term, to re-enter the job 
market with lasting results. He is absolutely right. That is exactly 
what the government is attempting to do with part II of this EI 
reform.
<P>
	That is the point that members have been trying to make. Bloc 
members are contradicting themselves again. Active measures are 
a way to keep insurance costs down by keeping people employed 
and employment up. That is the whole intent of transferring 
another $800 million into active programs, to help people get 
retrained and get back into the workforce. At the same time, added 
to that is another $300 million, which is a transition fund to help 
those high unemployment areas adjust to a very large behavioural 
structural change of EI.
<P>
	I want to mention something to members because we are having 
great difficulty with this issue. The Government of Canada has 
recognized that labour market training is the responsibility of 
provincial governments and linked to the responsibility for 
education. We have said this over and over again in the House but 
for some unknown reason it is not to the benefit of the Bloc to say 
its members have heard what we are saying.
<P>
	In Bill C-12 it states very bluntly that these measures, which 
include wage subsidies, income supplements, support for 
self-employment, partnerships for job creation and skills loans and 
grants, are all in line with the government's commitment on 
training. Skills loans and grants will only be implemented with the 
consent of the provinces concerned. In fact, we have said over and 
over again that we will get the consent of the provinces to enter into 
areas that we know are within their jurisdiction. However, our 
number one objective in part II is to help people through these 
kinds of programs to get right back into the workforce. If it is a 
training component other than getting people back to the workforce 
very quickly the government has to get the consent of the 
provinces. I think the Bloc finally recognizes that that commitment 
is a solid commitment.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2636"> 2636 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to stress that point because the BQ members have 
claimed that the government is still in the training field. The Prime 
Minister, the minister and Liberal members have said over and 
over that the federal government is getting out of labour market 
training. I want to continue to focus on that particular point.
<P>
	Let me add to this murky mix the Bloc position on expanding 
eligibility for employment benefits. Let me quote again from the 
member for Châteauguay: ``Not only does the federal government 
interfere in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction''-which we 
have said we are not willing to do-``such as manpower and social 
assistance, but it does so with money collected as UI premiums''. 
Can anyone imagine this? That comment would have made good 
sense if it had come from a member of the Reform Party. However, 
members have to agree that the federal government, if it does not 
do anything to help people who have slipped from unemployment 
insurance to welfare, then what is the point?
<P>
	A significant portion of this bill deals with helping people. It is 
estimated that 45 per cent of the people who are on welfare or 
social assistance can apply for the five major components under 
part II of employment insurance. The Bloc members, who are the 
great defenders of the poor so they tell us, are objecting to that. 
They say that should not be the case. The federal government 
should not try to help people who are on social assistance. It should 
get its nose out of it and not help those people get back into the 
workforce.
<P>
	The Bloc members are the authors of their own contradictions. 
They demand that the government create jobs. They demand that 
we follow a do nothing course on employment insurance that 
would prevent us from achieving the first goal. They also demand 
that the government do less for people on social assistance, the 
most vulnerable in our labour market. I want to disappoint the 
Bloc.
<P>
<B>(1420 )</B>
<P>
	We are going to meet the very important obligation that was 
made in the speech from the throne by the Prime Minister and the 
Minister of Human Resources Development. Part II of the bill 
contains clear job creating measures. Those measures will be 
consistent with the policy that has been part of this program since 
the very beginning. The measures are linked to our specific area of 
jurisdiction and bring in a new level of collaboration. They expand 
eligibility for benefits to a wider group of people. The result of part 
II will be that people will get back to work.
<P>
	All the juggling of claims by the opposition cannot ignore those 
essential facts. The most enjoyable part for the hon. member for 
Malpeque and myself is that we have had the pleasure of dealing 
with the contradictions which Bloc members have brought to this 
place in the last number of days as we have debated the report stage  
motions. They criticize us for not doing anything, but they do not 
want to talk about part II and the importance of helping people get
<P>
back to work. Whenever we do that the only message they want to 
send to their constituents is that we are entering into provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	Again we lay the facts on the table for my friends in the Bloc 
who desperately need to understand that this will be a structural 
change for which Canadians will thank us.
<P>
	A witness who appeared before the committee a number of 
weeks ago has a reputation for being an individual with vision. His 
name is Alice Nakamura. He said that our children will thank us for 
these behavioural changes and the restructuring of this program 
because they are the most far-reaching behavioural changes which 
the country has ever seen. The changes are being made because of 
the new marketplace in which we find ourselves. Quite frankly, I 
feel very comfortable standing in this place and saying that I agree 
with Alice. When we look at the changes in the years to come 
through the monitoring system we will be proven correct.
