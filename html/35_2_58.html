	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government provide a greater measure

Rights to read:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``1. Subject to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be

	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to 
introduce my private members' motion today for the first hour of 
debate.
<P>
	The purpose of my motion is very basic. It proposes to 
strengthen and protect individuals' property rights. Motion M-205 
reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government provide a greater measure 
of protection for individual property rights by amending the Canadian Bill of 
Rights to read:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``1. Subject to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be

<BLOCKQUOTE>2. Any person whose rights, as set out in section 1, have been infringed or 
denied may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain such remedy as

	In brief, the motion asks the government to amend the Canadian 
Bill of Rights by adding two sections. The first section would allow 
citizens the right to their property unless the person receives a fair 
hearing in accordance with principles of fundamental justice. The 
second section gives individual property owners the right to fair 
compensation for their property within a reasonable amount of 
time.
<P>
	Canadians are fortunate to have an abundance of rights in this 
country. Many of our rights are guaranteed in the Constitution. Our 
Constitution guarantees language rights, native rights, women's 
rights; however, it does not cover property rights.
<P>
	Section 7 of the charter of rights and freedoms provides that 
everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and 
the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the 
principles of fundamental justice. Life, liberty and security of the 
person are clearly basic values fundamental to all Canadians; 
however, the protection of individual property rights is also of 
major importance to Canadians. It affects all of us and is a 
fundamental part of Canadian law and society.
<P>
	Canadians believe in a free and democratic society. They believe 
in fundamental justice and in the necessity for fairness. These are 
values that unite Canadians. Most believe that property rights are 
also among those basic rights in Canada. Yet property rights is one 
value that does not have protection.
<P>
	The protection of property is an important guarantee of freedom. 
This right must be protected so that government cannot infringe on 
that right without due process and without providing compensation 
for the property. There is simply no reason that government should 
have the freedom to expropriate private property without fair, just 
and timely compensation. Yet there is no requirement in Canadian 
constitutional law that removal of private property be covered by a 
fair procedure to deal with compensation to the owner. There  is no 
guarantee of fair treatment by the courts, tribunals or officials who 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3528"> 3528 </A></B>
<P>
have the power over individuals or corporations. Motion M-205 
addresses these concerns.
<P>
	In the past there have been many attempts to deal with property 
rights concerns. In 1960 John Diefenbaker introduced and passed 
the Canadian Bill of Rights. The bill of rights includes property 
rights, yet the guarantee of protection is only marginal at best.
<P>
	Section 1(a) of the Canadian Bill of Rights states: ``The right of 
the individual to life, liberty, security of the person and enjoyment 
of property, and the right not to be deprived thereof except by due 
process of law''. As well, section 2(e) provides that no federal law 
is to be construed or applied so as to deprive a person of the right to 
a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental 
justice for the determination of his rights or obligations. In short, 
property rights are given very marginal protection under the 
Canadian Bill of Rights.
<P>
	I am talking about two documents. There is the Canadian Bill of 
Rights and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
Members should pay attention to the one I am talking about 
because each has a different application in law.
<P>
	There is no guarantee that private property will not be removed 
for public use and there is no provision that government must pay 
just compensation when it expropriates property. Without rights of 
due process and fair compensation, individual property rights are 
quite meaningless.
<P>
	There have also been attempts to entrench property rights in the 
charter of rights and freedoms. Prime Minister Trudeau argued 
vigorously and repeatedly for inclusion of property rights in the 
charter of rights and freedoms. When Mr. Trudeau was justice 
minister in 1968 he tabled a Canadian charter of human rights 
which included the protection of property rights. The next year, as 
prime minister, Trudeau wrote that the charter should protect the 
right of the individual to the enjoyment of property. Then in 1978, 
Trudeau's constitutional amendment bill included a clause 
representing fundamentally the same protection he had suggested 
10 years earlier. In 1980 Trudeau attempted to include a property 
rights clause in the proposed charter.
<P>
<B>(1110 )</B>
<P>
	In addition, as Minister of Justice, our current Prime Minister 
supported Trudeau's attempts to include property rights in the 
charter of rights and freedoms. The Prime Minister described 
property rights as ``a central value of our society and an essential 
ingredient for the charter, a right which all Canadians should have 
regardless of where they live in our country''. I hope the Prime 
Minister will stand by his words and give full support to this 
motion.
<P>
	Finally in 1981 Pierre Trudeau made a last gasp attempt to 
include property rights in the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms. In the end, after 13 long and frustrating years, property 
rights were left out of the charter and Canadians were denied 
property rights when the Constitution was repatriated in 1982.
<P>
	The issue did not end there. In 1988 the House voted 
overwhelmingly to support a motion that proposed the 1982 
Constitution Act be amended in order to recognize the right of 
enjoyment of property and the right not to be deprived thereof, 
except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice and 
in keeping with the tradition of the usual federal-provincial 
consultative process. This was passed in this House with a majority 
of 108 who supported the motion versus 16 members who opposed 
it. Property rights were subsequently proposed for inclusion in the 
revamped charter of rights and freedoms in 1992.
<P>
	The government proposed amendments to the charter to 
guarantee property rights and to ensure that individual Canadians 
were allowed to own and hold property and not have it taken away 
without due process of law and without fair compensation. Yet we 
were again denied justice when property rights were removed from 
the Charlottetown accord against the wishes of many Canadians. 
The Charlottetown accord, as we all know, subsequently failed to 
pass.
<P>
	All of these attempts to entrench property rights in the charter 
failed. The reason for their failure is that property rights are 
considered by many to be a provincial responsibility. Legislation of 
ownership of property is a civil matter and is the responsibility of 
provincial governments.
<P>
	In response, several provinces objected to entrenching property 
rights in the charter as they felt it would step on areas of provincial 
jurisdiction. Provinces such as Saskatchewan, New Brunswick and 
Prince Edward Island objected to federal intrusion into provincial 
jurisdiction over property and civil rights granted to them in the 
BNA Act. These provinces feared it would limit their power to 
make decisions and the cost of fair and just compensation to 
individuals may have prohibited or restricted provincial decision 
making power. I am talking about the charter here; my bill would 
amend the bill of rights.
<P>
	Provinces such as Prince Edward Island voiced concerns that if 
they were forced to compensate individuals for their property to 
build a road, a municipal park, expand a building or perhaps build a 
casino as was the case in Ontario, then the costs of fair 
compensation to the person who owns the land may limit the 
government's ability to act.
<P>
	However there is a silver lining. The good news is that Motion 
M-205 avoids concerns about federal interference and 
interprovincial jurisdiction because it applies to federal law and 
operations of the federal government. It binds only the federal 
government and holds it to a reasonable standard of fair and just 
compensation in  exchange for personal property. By amending the 
Canadian Bill of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3529"> 3529 </A></B>
<P>
Rights as opposed to the charter which applies only to federal law, 
matters of provincial jurisdiction remain untouched.
<P>
	Most provinces however support entrenchment of property 
rights. Provinces such as British Columbia, Ontario and New 
Brunswick have passed resolutions supporting inclusion of 
property rights in the charter.
<P>
	A 1987 Gallup poll showed 87 per cent support for increased 
property rights protection. Canadians considered the right to own 
and enjoy property of all kinds a fundamental right that should be 
entrenched in law. In the poll, property rights were considered 
equally as important as the right to life, liberty and security of the 
person.
<P>
	I am confident that if we conducted a poll today it would show 
national support for guaranteed property rights protection at levels 
at least as strong as they were nine years ago. Canadians have 
grown more aware and have been more concerned for their rights in 
the past few years than ever before.
<P>
	As well many national organizations have also come out in 
favour of greater protection of property rights. These organizations 
include the Canadian Bar Association, the Canadian Chamber of 
Commerce and the Canadian Real Estate Association, to name but 
a few.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	In addition, the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, signed by Canada in 1948, commits Canada to protection of 
property rights. Article 17 reads: ``Every one has the right to own 
property alone, as well as in association with others. No one shall 
be arbitrarily deprived of his or her property''.
<P>
	Obviously property rights are fundamental to good government. 
When people are treated fairly in accordance with principles of 
fundamental justice and are fairly compensated for their property 
when it is taken for the common good, then Canadians should 
receive the respect and dignity fundamental to good government.
<P>
	A number of other democratic countries, including the United 
States, Germany, Italy and Finland have already taken the lead in 
property rights legislation. For example, the fifth amendment to the 
United States constitution adopted in 1791 provides that the federal 
government cannot deprive anyone of life, liberty or property 
without due process of law. It also stipulates that private property 
cannot be taken for public use without just compensation. The 14th 
amendment to the U.S. constitution adopted in 1868 extended these 
restrictions to state governments.
<P>
	Canada is one of many countries with a high percentage of home 
owners and land owners, yet Canada alone among the 
industrialized nations does not grant some form of constitutional 
protection to property ownership. The time has come for Canadians 
to be afforded the protection agreed to almost 50 years ago in the 
UN. Individual Canadians must be allowed to own and hold 
property and not have it confiscated without due process of law and 
without fair compensation.
<P>
	Property rights are not just some kind of abstract idea for debate 
on the floor of this House. Property rights for many in rural areas 
means holding on to the family farm. When government 
expropriates property from individuals, owners must have the right 
to be compensated at fair market value.
<P>
	Motion No. 205 considers giving Canadians the security that 
their home and their possessions are theirs and theirs alone. This 
motion is about giving Canadians the rightful protection of their 
own property. As it stands, these rights are only protected by 
common law. However, common law can be superseded by a 
statute at any time. The government can easily pass a law requiring 
certain lands or houses or goods to be surrendered to the state and 
that no compensation be paid. If one owned one of these properties, 
one would have no recourse if the government were to take it away.
<P>
	Any valid statute can expressly say that no compensation is 
payable when property is expropriated. This is wrong. There is no 
constitutional guarantee for compensation and the power of 
government in this area is absolutely unlimited. As it stands, the 
rights of the individual are secondary to the powers of the state and 
that is wrong.
<P>
	Without the guarantees provided in my motion, the law gives 
governments the right to pass legislation which removes private 
property without providing compensation in return. The 
fundamental protection of property and contract rights must take 
precedence over government powers. Federal laws must not 
override individual property rights. The government must not be 
able to compensate for private property without fair compensation.
<P>
	In circumstances where it is necessary for an individual to 
surrender property, this motion would ensure that property could 
not be taken except in accordance with the principles of 
fundamental justice.
<P>
	It is my hope that the provinces will take responsibility within 
their jurisdictions to guarantee Canadians living within their 
borders the rights and freedoms that I am offering at the federal 
level. Canadians can rest assured that this motion will strengthen 
individual property protection.
<P>
	Motion No. 205 will not diminish rights Canadians already have 
or prevent the government from carrying out its duties for the 
common good of the nation. Government is supposed to be there to 
serve the people. Too often the reverse is the case and people are 
put in the position of serving government. My motion sets right  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3530"> 3530 </A></B>
<P>
this wrong to ensure that individual rights are there and they are 
protected.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	Government has the ability to protect people, but often the will 
to protect those people is not there. It is long overdue for this 
government to set the record set and put the individual Canadian 
first.
<P>
	The right to hold and enjoy property provides one of these 
checks against undue concentration of power in government at any 
level. Government must defend the rights of the people, not take 
them away.
<P>
	Motion No. 205 would not protect individuals from 
expropriation. However, it would guarantee that expropriation 
would be carried out in a fair and reasonable manner. It would 
protect against government deciding arbitrarily what compensation 
should be paid, if any.
<P>
	With my motion, implementation of property rights' protection 
would be straightforward. It would give Canadians their rights and 
protection without requiring a formal constitutional amendment. 
Amending the charter of rights and freedoms would require the 
support of two-thirds of the provinces and 50 per cent of the 
population, which is clearly tough. However, by amending the 
Canadian Bill of Rights it could be done right here in this House.
<P>
	As we have said in the past, property rights cross all party lines 
and are represented on all sides of the House as a value to be 
cherished and to be protected. Protection of these rights have been 
supported by all sides of the House. Canadians are concerned now 
more than ever that their individual property rights must be 
protected.
<P>
	In conclusion, the protection of individual property rights is a 
fundamental freedom which must be protected. This is not a 
partisan issue but a matter of fundamental justice. It is my hope 
that members of the House will give representation to their 
constituents when they vote for this motion and vote for property 
rights.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this motion 
brought forward by the hon. member for Comox-Alberni.
<P>
	The motion proposes that the Canadian Bill of Rights be changed 
by modifying the existing provisions on property rights. The 
Canadian Bill of Rights currently contains provisions protecting 
property rights. Section 1 recognizes the right of the individual to 
life, liberty, security of the person, the enjoyment of property and 
the right not to be deprived thereof except by due process of law.
<P>
	This right is already protected by the Canadian Bill of Rights. It 
is also protected at the federal level by statute and common law. It 
is important to remember that the  Canadian Bill of Rights applies 
only to the federal government, unlike the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms which applies to all levels of government.
<P>
	It is also important to remember that the Constitution assigns 
much of the responsibility for regulating property to the provinces. 
In fact, section 92(13) of the Constitution Act provides that the 
provinces may exclusively make laws relating to property and civil 
rights in the province.
<P>
	That is not to say that the federal government cannot legislate in 
ways that affect property, but its jurisdiction is limited in these 
respects. Federal statutes do not regulate the disposition of 
property. However, these statutes have been designed to ensure that 
people are treated fairly. These laws provide for fair procedures 
and for fair compensation where property rights are affected.
<P>
	In addition, common law provides innumerable protections for 
property rights. Property rights are a fundamental part of our legal 
system and the law provides, in many ways, for their recognition.
<P>
	For example, there is the common law presumption of 
compensation where someone is deprived of property. On the 
whole, the average person in Canada enjoys a very high level of 
protection for property rights under the statutes and common law 
applicable at the federal level, including the provisions of the 
Canadian Bill of Rights. I venture to say that this is generally true 
at the provincial level as well.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	In support of the motion, the hon. member for Comox-Alberni 
mentioned that in the protection of property rights one would be 
protecting the family farm and one's home, but these are clearly 
areas that would be regulated by provincial legislation, as is done at 
this time.
<P>
	All this protection of property rights reflects the value that 
Canadians place on property rights. The right to own a home, a car, 
other possessions is very basic to our way of life. The right to use 
and dispose of property is also fundamental, although we recognize 
these are not unlimited rights, something I will come back to later.
<P>
	Property rights are ingrained in our legal system. In fact, one of 
the premises of our legal system is the right to own and dispose of 
property. Our laws, whether legislated or judge made, are replete 
with examples of rules concerning the ownership and use of 
property. For example, laws concerning real property, that is lands 
and buildings, contain many rules protecting both purchasers and 
vendors. In most provinces these rules have been built into statutes 
regulating the purchase and sale of property.
<P>
	When I consider the broad range of legislation and judicial 
precedent that protects property rights, it is not clear to me that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3531"> 3531 </A></B>
<P>
further protections are necessary in the Canadian Bill of the Rights. 
Taking that into account, it is important to reflect on what the 
proposed amendment would actually do.
<P>
	It would single out property rights from all other rights in the 
Canadian Bill of Rights for special protection. It would only amend 
the property rights provision, not the other rights protected in the 
Canadian Bill of Rights. I do not understand why we would want to 
do this, why we would want special protection for one set of rights 
and not for others that are also basic to life in Canada.
<P>
	It would establish a hierarchy of rights in the Canadian Bill of 
Rights which I do not think would be appropriate. Each of the 
rights in the Canadian Bill of Rights is of equal importance.
<P>
	The Canadian Bill of Rights is historically significant. It 
represents one of the first steps toward a constitutionally 
entrenched bill of rights. Just over 20 years after the Canadian Bill 
of Rights was enacted constitutional protections were provided in 
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Since then our 
energies have been focused on it.
<P>
	I do not think we should be revisiting the Canadian Bill of 
Rights. If we do we would be inviting all other kinds of 
amendments. We spent a great deal of time debating the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms. We saw fit to adopt the charter 
and I do not think we should let ourselves be drawn back into these 
debates in the context of the Canadian Bill of Rights.
<P>
	The charter has had significant impact on Canadian society and 
will continue to do so. We should continue to focus our energies on 
the charter and its implementation.
<P>
	I spoke earlier about how the right to own and dispose of 
property is not an unlimited right. I also mentioned that we have 
many laws that regulate the ownership and use of property in 
Canadian society. Municipal laws, environmental laws, laws 
regulating incorporation and the operation of limited companies, 
laws regulating the division of family property, succession and 
estate planning laws, personal property security laws are just some 
of the myriad of laws that affect either the ownership or the use of 
property.
<P>
	It is difficult to think of laws that do not affect or touch on 
property in one way or the other. When we realize this it is 
incumbent on us to think carefully about the implications of 
amending the property rights protection in a general human rights 
document.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	The United States has had considerable experience with property 
rights. Its early experience was not very good. Constitutional 
property rights were used to prevent socially useful legislation such 
as laws regulating the hours of work.
<P>
	Later the courts adopted a more enlightened view. Still, attempts 
to regulate the environment, trade in endangered birds and land use 
have met with court challenges based on a conflict with property 
rights and their bill of rights. This sort of general provision 
complicated the regulation of a whole variety of areas very 
germane and necessary to the public interest.
<P>
	Another problem we can identify from the American context and 
experience is that American courts have extended the concept of 
property to embrace things not conceived of when property rights 
were adopted.
<P>
	It seems licences and government jobs are interpreted as forms 
of property to which property rights provisions of the U.S. Bill of 
Rights apply. Of course, Canadian courts have demonstrated they 
will go their own way in interpreting the provisions of the charter 
and are other human rights laws.
<P>
	This is evident by many rulings of our courts across the land in 
conjunction to applying the charter of rights and freedoms to the 
Criminal Code and other statutes. It is apparent the Canadian courts 
have taken a distinctly Canadian approach to the charter and basic 
human rights laws.
<P>
	However, the proposed amendments would leave us with 
uncertainty about the meaning of property rights as they are 
presently put forward by the member for Comox-Alberni and the 
effect on a wide variety of laws that touch on property in one way 
or the other.
<P>
	At the federal level we have environmental laws, land use laws, 
laws providing for establishment and operation of corporations and 
the ownership and disposition of shares, laws on banking, laws on 
bankruptcy and copyright laws.
<P>
	Each of these laws touches in some way on the ownership and 
use of property. Each of these laws serves an important public 
purpose. I am concerned about what effect a general and broad 
provision for property rights may have on these laws. I am 
concerned that socially important legislation may be challenged in 
the courts. If these are issues about design and the operation of such 
legislation, they should be addressed by Parliament.
<P>
	I recognize the good intentions behind this motion. Like the hon. 
member for Comox-Alberni, I feel strongly about the importance 
of property rights in our society and legal system.
<P>
	However, as far as I am concerned we have more than adequate 
protections in our statute law and in the common law for property 
rights. I do not see the necessity for the proposed amendments 
specifically to the Canadian Bill of Rights. Rather, I am concerned 
about its impact.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3532"> 3532 </A></B>
<P>
	In light of the American experience, it is not clear how it 
would be interpreted. It is far better that we continue to rely 
on the extensive protections of property rights that already exist 
in our law.
<P>
	For reasons I have stated, whether it be concern of how a very 
broad or loosely worded statement of rights would be interpreted 
by the courts, whether it is the other concerns I have mentioned, I 
respectfully disagree with this motion, although in general I share 
the concern and support for property rights.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to speak to this motion put 
forward by the hon. member for Comox-Alberni, which deals 
with property rights, essentially demanding that these rights be 
included in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	Before getting into the substance of this motion, I will say that I 
am somewhat surprised to see our colleagues from the Reform 
Party bring back this debate for the second time in this House. Not 
that the debate on property rights or the rights themselves are not 
important, quite the contrary. I will get back to this. In a way, this 
motion shows the priorities of the so-called Reform Party, which 
would deny the right of individuals to be what they are, be they 
black or gay, as we saw during the debate on Bill C-33.
<P>
	Denying this right would, for example, make it impossible for 
some individuals recognized as gay or lesbian to work or cause 
them to lose their jobs. Yet, if this gay individual manages to work 
without anyone knowing his or her sexual orientation and to own 
some property, our friends in the Reform Party will move heaven 
and earth so that his or her property rights are recognized and 
defended in the face of all opposition. So I am somewhat puzzled 
as to that party's priorities.
<P>
	That said, the property rights referred to in the motion are, of 
course, important rights that have been recognized for centuries, I 
would say, in our society. They lie at the very foundation of how 
our society works in several areas, if one considers, among other 
things, property taxes or the fact that the right to vote in school 
council elections is linked to property rights, which have been 
recognized and set out, again for several decades, in the laws 
enacted by provincial legislatures. However, before we include 
these rights in the charter of rights and freedoms, there are 
questions we must ask. We must question the real intentions, the 
motives behind this proposal.
<P>
	If we include property rights in the charter of rights and if these 
rights become immutable, it would not be a step forward but rather 
a setback for our society. It would, in a way, bring us back to the 
mentality prevailing in the last century, when property rights could 
be used  to thwart social progress or to prevent most members of a 
group or population from moving forward.
<P>
	I am convinced these property rights were demanded on several 
occasions by wealthy landowners in South America and elsewhere 
in the world. In three or four countries, most of the land was owned 
by these people. I guess that, when the people in those countries or 
regions rose up against this situation, landowners used their 
property rights to argue that they had to keep the lands they owned, 
thus forestalling any social progress for these groups of people.
<P>
	Like my colleague from the Liberal Party, I pointed out that 
property rights are important, basic rights that must be preserved 
and which are indeed protected under our current legislation.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	Take expropriation, for instance. Our provincial legislation 
provides a mechanism governing expropriation. Under this 
mechanism, the government is required to give sufficient notice to 
those being expropriated so they can assert their right to a fair and 
equitable assessment of their property-this decision can be 
challenged before the courts-and thus obtain fair compensation. 
These are precisely the considerations set out in the motion put 
forward by the hon. member for Comox-Alberni. All this already 
exists, is already being done.
<P>
	I have not seen, in my riding or in Quebec, anyone take to the 
streets or what not to ask for the property right to be strengthened.
<P>
	As I said at the beginning of my speech, to oppose or compare 
the property right to other fundamental rights enshrined in the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, such as the freedom of 
conscience and religion, the freedom of expression, the freedom of 
association, the right to dissent, the right to vote, the right to life, 
the right to equality, which are all rights designed to protect the 
identity of individuals, is not really sound and valid.
<P>
	How is a person's identity affected by the property right per se? 
Does the fact of having property, or how much this property is 
worth, give someone's identity greater value? I think distinctions 
ought to be made between these fundamental rights.
<P>
	I would also like to mention out that, as our friend from the 
Reform Party pointed out, this idea of including the property right 
in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom was raised on 
several occasions in the past. In 1968, the former Prime Minister of 
Canada, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, had made it his thing. In 1978, the 
idea resurfaced when a motion pertaining to Bill C-60 at the time 
was defeated.
<P>
	Again, in 1980, the federal government tried to introduce a new 
guarantee regarding the property right.  Once again, objections 
were raised, which remain perfectly valid today. I am referring, of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3533"> 3533 </A></B>
<P>
course, to the objections raised by the provinces. The fact of the 
matter is that all provinces are opposed to incorporating the 
property right in the charter of rights and freedoms, since this 
would considerably restrict their capability to legislate in this area.
<P>
	Take, for example, the environment: How could a provincial 
government legislate in the environment sector if property rights 
are enshrined in the Constitution? This would greatly impede 
provincial action in this area. There are already enough 
constitutional, administrative and federal-provincial hurdles as it 
is. The Reform Party regularly raises these issues. I do not see the 
need to add to this by passing such a motion.
<P>
	Including property rights in the charter of rights could also have 
enormous consequences on the legislation concerning marriage, as 
was pointed out during a debate in this House two years ago.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	For example, what would happen in the case of a divorce if the 
man went before the courts to have his property rights enforced, 
thus going against Quebec's legislation which stipulates that, in the 
case of a separation, the goods must be divided equally between the 
man and the woman? Various applications of such a provision 
could considerably affect the way our society currently operates.
<P>
	These are, in short, the reasons why, two years ago, the official 
opposition opposed the motion then tabled before this House, and 
why we will again vote against this motion today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are here today to debate and ideally to support and pass 
Motion No. 205 respecting individual property rights.
<P>
	While this is not a novel undertaking, its time may have come, 
given that Canadian parliamentarians and others have been trying 
to entrench a property rights amendment in the bill of rights and/or 
in the charter of rights and freedoms going back to at least 1968.
<P>
	While I find it difficult to follow in the footsteps of Pierre 
Trudeau, it is not difficult to support what is the logical extension 
of the bill of rights by amending it and providing a greater measure 
of protection for individual property rights.
<P>
	I can see no logical reason not to support the motion. Quite 
simply, it transcends partisan politics. The history behind the 
motion speaks to its non-partisan, apolitical past.
<P>
	As it now stands there is little protection for a person's right to 
own, use and enjoy property. What little protection there is can be 
found in the Canadian Bill of Rights, Mr. Diefenbaker's historic 
document.
<P>
	The beauty of this motion is that it does not threaten some 
provinces and special interest groups which argue against including 
property rights in the charter of rights and freedoms because they 
feel it intrudes into areas which are the exclusive jurisdiction of the 
provinces. By using the bill of rights this issue is avoided and 
provincial concerns are assuaged.
<P>
	It is time to raise this issue from its dormancy, remove the fears 
of some, particularly the New Democratic Party which can 
extrapolate concerns where there are none, and give Canadians a 
basic protection which for far too long has eluded us.
<P>
	Pierre Trudeau tried several times to include property rights in 
the bill of rights, then again in the proposed charter of human 
rights, and then again he proposed them in a constitutional 
amendment bill. This was all followed by a motion introduced in 
the House of Commons by Tory MP John Reimer in 1987 on 
property rights which the House supported in a major way with a 
vote of 108 to 16.
<P>
	In 1982 a property rights resolution was passed unanimously by 
the B.C. legislature, followed by very similar support with a 
resolution in the New Brunswick legislature in 1983 and the 
Ontario legislature in 1986.
<P>
	In 1987 the Canadian Real Estate Association commissioned a 
poll which found that 81 per cent of Canadians considered property 
rights were either very or fairly important. In a follow-up paper in 
1991 the real estate association called for an amendment to the 
charter to include property rights.
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	The deficiency in the bill of rights, let alone the charter, is 
glowing in its lack of recognition of property rights. If we compare 
this with the fifth amendment to the United States constitution 
which calls for due process of the law and compensation with 
respect to private property, we are primitive in Canada and sadly 
unconscious of this basic fundamental right. Why we have 
deprived Canadians of this inherent right confounds many 
observers, among them constitutionalists and the courts.
<P>
	If our concern is generated by a lack of a definition of property 
we could only go to the Canadian law dictionary to help define it 
for us. The dictionary breaks property into two forms: real 
property, lands, tenements or any interest in buildings erected or 
affixed to the land; and personal property, goods, chattels, effects 
and the like.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3534"> 3534 </A></B>
<P>
	As it now stands, the government's power to pass legislation 
through which it takes private property without providing 
compensation is unlimited.  Government can arbitrarily step in to 
take private property without any kind of compensation. This is 
outright scary in a country like Canada.
<P>
	This has come home to roost twice in recent times, specifically 
Bill C-22, now called Bill C-28, the Pearson airport debacle, and 
Bill C-68, the firearms act. These two examples of trampling on 
personal property rights would never have seen the light of day if 
we had a property rights amendment.
<P>
	It is inherently one's right to enjoy one's personal and real 
property and the right not to be deprived of it unless the person is 
accorded a fair hearing and is paid fair compensation for it. This is 
hardly a radical concept, and should these two elements be 
infringed it is not too much to ensure remedy through the courts.
<P>
	This would be a check and balance against the tyranny of 
concentrated power in government. There is a fundamental 
interdependence between personal rights and liberties and the 
personal rights in property. Property rights are a cornerstone of any 
civilized society, the notion that you own yourself and your labour.
<P>
	This motion will enrich Canadian society, protect individual 
freedoms and protect the environment. People protect the 
environment around them, their personal property. Governments 
weigh political benefits of protecting the environment and 
consequently personal property. It seems so patently unfair to 
deprive Canadians of this fundamental premise in life. Let us not 
allow this opportunity to slide by once again.
<P>
	It is so fundamental an issue that it is difficult not to get 
repetitive in debate on this issue. The opponents of entrenching 
property rights will extrapolate potential scenarios unreasonably to 
make their case. The crucial issue is to define property in a 
practical working definition.
<P>
	The fifth amendment to the constitution of the United States 
specifically protects private property. Americans have lived with 
this definition for over 200 years and it has stood the test of time.
<P>
	Canada has every opportunity to define private property in a 
Canadian context to bring us up to the same standard of protection 
of private property as other western democracies. There is no 
requirement in Canadian constitutional law that compulsory taking 
of property be effected by a fair procedure or that it be 
accompanied by fair compensation to the owner.
<P>
	This motion would have the effect of extending private property 
rights to non-natural persons such as corporations. For the federal 
government to pass legislation such as the Pearson airport package, 
which has the effect of nullifying contracts and agreements without 
compensation, would require a vote of at least two-thirds of the 
members of the House of Commons. The net effect would be that 
the Liberal government could not single handedly achieve this 
Pearson bill without other  parties' support. This is an enlightened 
provision on so fundamental an issue.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	In summary, I quote words presented in October 1995 to the 
Canadian Real Estate Association. Mr. Speaker, you may recognize 
the words because they are yours, the member for Edmonton 
Southeast:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In countries where such rights are weak or non-existent, the arbitrary power 
and special privileges of the elite increase and the power of the common man or 
woman is diminished. Without the protection of due process, the ordinary 
citizen is powerless in the face of a state that exists only to perpetuate and 
strengthen it and/or its elite.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the Soviet Union, for example, the individual can never say to the state or 
its officers `this is mine and you cannot take it away from me'. Due process and 
fundamental justice are but dreams to the residents of the U.S.S.R.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We know there has been a passage of time since that statement 
was made. However, I think this is a very essential bill. There is a 
reason the Reform Party has brought this up more than once.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak to this motion. The hon. 
member for Comox-Alberni has proposed a motion that provides 
for a greater measure of protection for individual property rights 
with an amendment to the Canadian Bill of Rights. We should 
acknowledge the Canadian Bill of Rights is part of Canada's 
longstanding commitment to human rights.
<P>
	The bill of rights already protects an individual's right to the 
enjoyment of property. Origins of Canada's human rights 
movement can be traced to the desire to ensure that the atrocities 
that occurred to millions of Jews, members of ethnic minorities, 
political dissidents, people with mental and physical disabilities 
and homosexuals could not occur in Canada.
<P>
	People were stripped of their property rights, ghettoized, 
imprisoned, forced into labour camps and murdered by the Nazis. 
These terrible events had a profound impact on the social 
conscience of the world and Canadians in particular. In response, 
the United Nations drafted the UN Declaration of Human Rights 
and the Parliament of the day enacted the Canadian Bill of Rights.
<P>
	The Canadian Bill of Rights is a statute that has a 
quasi-constitutional status. Many of the provisions of the bill have 
been overtaken by specific provisions of the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms. As the charter does not have an explicit 
section on property rights it can therefore be argued this provision 
of the bill of rights still operates to protect property rights.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3535"> 3535 </A></B>
<P>
	The Canadian Bill of Rights states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is hereby recognized and declared that in Canada there have existed and 
shall continue to exist without discrimination by reason race, national origin, 
colour, religion or sex, the following human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
namely:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) the right of the individual to life, liberty, security of the person and 
enjoyment of property, and the right not to be deprived thereof except by due 
process of law.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It can be argued this provision provides the protection the hon. 
member seeks. An individual cannot be deprived of property rights 
except by due process of law. It should be remembered the bill of 
rights applies only to federal laws. Unlike the charter, it does not 
apply to provincial laws.
<P>
	In addition to the protections offered to property rights through 
the bill of rights, we have developed elaborate laws regulating and 
protecting the ownership and enjoyment of property. For example, 
real and personal property laws regulate the acquisition and 
disposition of all kinds of property. These laws protect individuals 
from fraud and other mistakes that may result in loss of property.
<P>
	Over the years there has been an evolution in the definition of 
property and in the protection of the right of the individual to enjoy 
property. The federal Divorce Act and provincial and territorial 
family law acts ensure that women are not deprived of their right to 
a fair share of matrimonial property and assets regardless of who 
has legal title.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	The term ``property'' has taken on many meanings. In the United 
States the constitutional right to the enjoyment of property has 
been defined to include academic tenure, a driver's licence and 
disability benefits. I am concerned that defining further individual 
property rights could affect social benefits and the division of 
assets under the Divorce Act.
<P>
	Of course like all other rights the right to enjoy property is 
subject to some limitations in our society. It is limited by laws that 
regulate the use of property in the public interest. Land use, 
planning and zoning laws may limit the type of building that can be 
placed on residential lots. Environmental laws regulate everything 
from the disposal of hazardous waste to the removal of trees. Laws 
regulate the ownership of transactions in shares in limited 
companies. Other laws regulate bankruptcy and the ownership of 
land by non-Canadians, and the list goes on.
<P>
	All of those laws impose real limits on the ownership and the use 
of property and no one disputes that these are necessary limits. 
These restrictions on the enjoyment of property must be kept in 
mind when we look at amending the Canadian Bill of Rights.
<P>
	The notion of property is far broader than real property. Given 
the broad meaning that can be applied to real personal property, we 
must be careful in considering an amendment to the existing 
protection for property rights in a quasi-constitutional document.
<P>
	The Americans, we know, have had some unfortunate 
experiences with property rights in the context of their 
Constitution. It should also be noted that women's advocacy groups 
have had a number of concerns with the further entrenchment of 
property rights. The notion that a man's home is his castle is a 
disturbing concept to many women who have been denied their 
share of family assets. It has only been a few years since a woman 
was denied a share of the family farm she worked on for many 
years.
<P>
	We have moved beyond this case in providing statutory 
protection for women, but we live in a complex society with many 
interests and competing rights. From the division of the 
matrimonial home to environmental and zoning bylaws, we must 
recognize that rights are not absolute.
<P>
	To conclude, I believe that property rights are adequately 
protected in Canada in the Canadian Bill of Rights, in other statutes 
and in the common law. There are more pressing challenges facing 
the government than the need to provide additional protection for 
property rights.
<P>
	The government is committed to protecting our social safety net, 
including the renewal of our health system while reducing the 
deficit. It is working on opportunities for youth who are our future. 
We are concerned with barriers that aboriginal people and people 
with disabilities are facing. Let us concentrate on the more pressing 
problems we are facing.
<P>
	Yes property rights are important, but I believe they are 
sufficiently protected in existing legislation, particularly in the 
Canadian Bill of Rights. I cannot support this motion.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There is one minute remaining if there is 
an hon. member from the Reform Party who wishes to speak.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
realize there is only one minute left. It is difficult to summarize 
today's discussion.
<P>
	The inclusion of property rights has been a bone of contention 
for the Reform Party since its inception. We believe that people do 
have the right to own property and to enjoy it in a peaceful way. It 
was one reason many people asked those who put together the 
Charlottetown accord to please consider the rights of law-abiding 
citizens to enjoy and use their own property without being deprived 
of it without due process of law.
<P>
	Members should consider what it means not just to be the master 
of their own house but the owner of that house, that when they are 
sitting in their living rooms or cottages, whatever the case may be, 
to know that they  have the right to do that, the right to enjoy their 
property and the right to own it.
<P>

	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (for the Minister of Justice and 
Attorney General of Canada, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-17, an act 
to amend the Criminal Code and certain other acts be read the 
second time and referred to the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Legal affairs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am very pleased to introduce second reading debate on Bill C-17.
<P>
	Bill C-17 was originally introduced as Bill C-118 on December 
14, 1995. At that time it was pointed out that it completed a series 
of significant criminal law reforms begun in June 1994 with the 
introduction of a similar bill, Bill C-42. Most of Bill C-42, now the 
Criminal Law Amendment Act 1994, was brought into force on 
February 15, 1995 with the remainder on April 1, 1995.
<P>
	Historically, bills containing general Criminal Code 
amendments were introduced on a regular basis. However when 
Bill C-42 was being debated, it was noted that the last such bill was 
introduced in 1985. Therefore a commitment was given on behalf 
of the Minister of Justice at the time by the hon. member for 
London West to return to the previous pattern of periodically 
updating the criminal law. Bill C-17 is a product of that 
commitment.
<P>
	Bill C-42 was well received and the Minister of Justice was 
asked by his provincial and territorial colleagues as recently as 
earlier this month at the annual meeting of federal, provincial and 
territorial Ministers of Justice to get on with producing the follow 
up bill to continue the development begun with Bill C-42.
<P>
	This follow up bill which, if passed, would be known as the 
criminal law improvement act, 1996, focuses mainly on the 
Criminal Code. It also contains amendments to the Canada 
Evidence Act, the National Defence Act, the Seized Property 
Management Act and the Supreme Court Act.
<P>
	The summary of the bill indicates that in developing this bill we 
have taken great care to obtain the input of those who have the 
greatest knowledge and hands on experience with our criminal 
justice system. The amendments in the bill originate from 
proposals made by the criminal law section of the Uniform Law 
Conference of Canada, from the former Law Reform Commission 
of Canada, from numerous judges of provincial and federal courts, 
from members of the bar, from the Canadian Association of Chiefs 
of Police, from the Canadian Police Association, the frontline 
officers, and from federal and provincial justice departments and 
officials.
<P>
	There are also amendments which were suggested by other 
sources. For example in a letter to the Minister of Justice, Child 
Find Canada noted that authorizations for wiretaps cannot be 
obtained for certain abduction offences. As a result Bill C-17 will 
amend the definitions of offence in section 183 of the Criminal 
Code to include these abduction offences. Wiretaps will then be 
available.
<P>
	The Federation of Canadian Municipalities adopted a resolution 
aimed at making it easier for police to enforce the offence of 
obstructing persons in public places by loitering. As a result Bill 
C-17 will amend section 175(2) of the Criminal Code to make it 
easier for police to provide evidence in relation to loiterers who 
obstruct persons in public places.
<P>
	The Canadian Bankers Association wrote the Minister of Justice 
indicating its concerns regarding the increasing number of high 
tech crimes involving credit cards and computers. The Insurance 
Bureau of Canada along with the Canadian police community 
pointed out that passengers in automobiles taken without the 
owner's consent could not be charged with joy riding as the code is 
currently drafted.
<P>
	We appreciate it when concerned citizens tell me the problems 
they have identified with our criminal law. We are pleased to be 
able to address some of these concerns in this bill. Responding to 
the problems pointed out by the criminal justice professionals and 
the Canadian public can only enhance confidence in our criminal 
justice system. Indeed enhancing public confidence in our criminal 
justice system is one of the principal objectives of this initiative 
and of this government.
<P>
	In Bill C-17 we also seek to make the Criminal Code provisions 
more cost-effective and more efficient, to implement or achieve 
compliance with court decisions, fill perceived gaps in the 
Criminal Code, to take advantage of advances in computer 
communications and video technology, to improve court 
procedures and to ensure greater fairness to the participants in the 
procedural process.
<P>
<B>(1210 )</B>
<P>
	I am confident these proposals will result in a more cost effective 
system of criminal justice, without detracting from the fundamen-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3537"> 3537 </A></B>
<P>
tal fairness of our criminal  justice system. Modernizing and 
streamlining our criminal law is particularly important in these 
times of fiscal restraint. We are all being asked to do more with 
less. This requires that scarce court resources be allocated wisely. It 
requires that available resources be devoted only to procedures that 
serve useful purposes.
<P>
	We must do what we can to reduce pressures on justice budgets. 
This applies not just to the costs that police, prosecutors and the 
courts must bear, but to the legal costs associated with defending 
criminal charges whether these costs are paid by the accused 
persons or by legal aid.
<P>
	In short, we are aiming at a smaller, more focused criminal 
justice system. The improvements proposed in this bill will take us 
a long way toward that goal.
<P>
	One of the ways to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of 
the Criminal Code is to modernize certain in court and out of court 
procedures. For example, as it stands now, a peace officer who 
gives a notice or serves a document on an accused person or 
witness has to seek out a commissioner for taking oaths in order to 
swear out an affidavit. The only alternative, and it is even worse, is 
for the officer to appear as a witness in court to testify to that 
routine procedure. This is necessary, notwithstanding that the 
action is almost always uncontested in court.
<P>
	With the amendment proposed in clause 2 of the bill, the peace 
officer would be able to prove the notice or service simply by 
making a statement in writing that he or she served the document or 
gave the notice. One province estimates that this simple 
amendment may save up to half a million dollars. More important, 
scarce police resources will be kept out of the court houses so that 
more time can be spent keeping our homes and streets safe.
<P>
	Other amendments seek to take advantage of modern 
technology. For example, we will permit more court proceedings to 
be carried out using video conferencing technology. For bail 
hearings and non-testimonial portions of preliminary inquiries and 
trials, we will permit the proceedings to be conducted using closed 
circuit television between the place of confinement of the accused 
and the court.
<P>
	Bill C-17 also seeks to improve trial procedure. Continual 
interruptions of the trial to resolve procedural issues can disrupt the 
orderly flow of evidence. In this age of court TV and all-news 
networks, most of us know what sidebars are. We know how 
tedious it can be to send out the jury while the lawyers wrangle 
with the judge.
<P>
	Amendments to Bill C-17 will encourage lawyers to sort out 
more issues at pretrial conferences. For example, clause 73 
proposes an amendment to section 625(1) of the Criminal Code to 
authorize a judge to hold a conference to deal with matters that, to 
promote a fair and expeditious hearing, would be better decided 
before  the start of the proceedings and to make arrangements for 
decisions on those matters.
<P>
	What might these matters be? This amendment reflects a 
recommendation made by the former Law Reform Commission of 
Canada in a study called ``Trial within a Reasonable Time''. The 
study stated that using the pretrial conference to allow the court to 
exercise control at an early stage would have clear benefits for 
bringing cases to trial within a reasonable time.
<P>
	It suggested that many issues could be dealt with before trial. 
These included: whether the accused or the prosecutor intended to 
raise any matter capable of being dealt with by way of pretrial 
motions and arrangements for determining these motions; whether 
any party intended to raise any matter that would normally be dealt 
with in the absence of a jury and arrangements for hearing and 
determination of these matters; and whether an agreed statement of 
facts could be prepared or whether either party was prepared to 
make any admissions. These are examples of things that if sorted 
out as early as possible would expedite the trial.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	Another amendment proposed by the Law Reform Commission 
would explicitly provide authority for the trial judge to confer with 
the prosecution and defence on matters that should be explained to 
the jury and the instructions that should be given to assist the jury 
in its deliberations. The Law Reform Commission noted there is 
nothing to prevent judges from doing this now, but it has not been 
common practice.
<P>
	Three reasons were given for this proposal. First, it would enable 
counsel to fully inform the judge of its views of the facts and the 
law. Second, it would permit counsel to prepare its arguments 
based on the legal principles on which the jury would be instructed. 
Third and perhaps most important, it would reduce counsel's 
objections to the charge, thereby reducing objections after the fact 
both at trial and on appeal. This change would accelerate the trend 
to develop standard jury instructions, which many believe will 
reduce the number of successful appeals.
<P>
	Bill C-17 contains another amendment relating to jury trials. 
Jury trials are becoming lengthier and more complex. If during a 
trial a juror becomes indisposed or for any other reason is unable to 
continue, the code provides that the trail can continue as long as the 
number of jurors does not fall below 10.
<P>
	What happens if a juror becomes indisposed or otherwise is 
unable to continue before the trial, that is before the jury has begun 
to hear evidence? Presently the only options are to stop the 
proceedings and hold another trial or to continue the trial and hope 
the other jurors do not become indisposed. This bill will provide a 
welcomed alternative. It will permit the replacement of a juror as 
long as the jury has not begun to hear evidence.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3538"> 3538 </A></B>
<P>
	Bill C-42 made some changes aimed at improving efficiency 
through the use of technology. This bill continues that trend. I have 
already mentioned that provisions which will broaden the use of 
closed circuit television or similar technology on other proposed 
amendments take advantage of modern technology by permitting 
more warrants to be obtained using telephone or fax machine. It 
will also be possible for peace officers to lay informations by fax, 
and fax copies such as summons, warrants or subpoenas will be 
admissible as if they were the originals.
<P>
	More changes of this kind are anticipated. My officials are 
working with provincial officials to determine what changes are 
needed to allow cases to be processed as much as possible outside 
the courtroom and to permit procedural functions to be carried out 
in a less labour intensive fashion.
<P>
	A number of proposals in Bill C-17 relate to arrest, pretrial 
release and other matters involving police practices and 
procedures. These will enable the police to make better use of our 
shrinking police and court resources. For instance, we will permit 
police to release an arrested person on certain conditions relating to 
firearms, alcohol and drug use and reporting. If the police believe 
these conditions are needed the accused must be detained in 
custody until a hearing before the justice of the peace can be 
arranged. However, there is often agreement between the 
prosecutor and defence counsel on conditions, and the justice 
simply affirms the conditions accepted by the accused.
<P>
	There is another extension of amendments adopted in Bill C-42 
which permitted the release of an accused who was prepared to 
abide by certain other conditions. The earlier changes have reduced 
unnecessary pretrial custody for many accused persons. Police are 
able to spend more time on the beat preventing crime or detecting 
offenders rather than waiting in the corridors of courtrooms or 
police station lock-ups.
<P>
	Court costs and legal aid costs have also been reduced. However, 
it has been observed that Bill C-42 provisions are not being used as 
often as they could be due to the absence of the three conditions 
now being proposed.
<P>
	Another kind of change that will lead to a more effective, more 
efficient and less expensive criminal justice system is directed at 
trial procedures applicable to certain offences.
<P>
	Presently the offences of unlawful confinement, break and enter 
of a non-dwelling house, being unlawfully in a dwelling house, 
forgery and uttering a forged document are indictable offences 
solely. This means that regardless of the seriousness of the offence 
or the circumstances of the offence the case will be tried in a 
superior court. It means that a preliminary inquiry will be held. It 
means a police officer will have to appear not only for the trial but 
for the preliminary hearing. It means witnesses will have to appear 
twice. As a result, the time and expense of  dealing with these 
offences frequently are completely out of line with the severity of 
the offence.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	For example, forgery could involve merely a forgery of a $50 
cheque. Nevertheless, to convict the accused, the system permits a 
preliminary inquiry and makes all the related demands on the 
police and witnesses. As a result, the police tell us they expend 
huge resources to deal with minor offences. Therefore, in light of 
their need to allocate resources wisely these offences may not even 
be pursued.
<P>
	In Bill C-17 the choice of trial procedure, summary conviction 
or indictable, would be given to the crown for these offences. With 
this change the crown will be able to select a procedure more in 
tune with the likely sanction. This will keep more cases in 
provincial courts and relieve court congestion in the superior 
courts. Witnesses, particularly victims, will have to testify only 
once. The time needed to deal with these cases should be reduced, 
which is important in order to adhere to the requirements of the 
charter of rights and freedoms which mandates a trial within a 
reasonable time.
<P>
	The sentences given in most cases for convictions of these 
offences are well within the summary conviction range. For 
example, 18 months for an unlawful confinement offence and 6 
months for the others. Although the present maximum term of 
imprisonment for forgery offences will be reduced from 14 to 10 
years, we do not anticipate that any of these changes will reduce the 
sentences for these offences. It is our view that having a statutory 
maximum sentence more in line with the sentences actually 
imposed increases the respect for the judicial system because it 
reduces the feelings of the convicted that they have gotten away 
with something after receiving a sentence so far removed from the 
maximum available.
<P>
	A number of proposed amendments have to do with searches and 
seizures. With the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms the 
courts are increasingly scrutinizing actions by law enforcement 
personnel in investigations relating to offences. Perhaps the area 
most subject to attention relates to searches and seizures. Often 
whether a conviction or an acquittal will result depends on whether 
the court will admit evidence seized in a search. The charter 
guarantees everyone the right to be secure against unreasonable 
search and seizure.
<P>
	With these amendments in Bill C-17 we seek to ensure that the 
police are able to do their jobs in a way which will conform to the 
charter. Some proposals would adjust provisions applicable to the 
property seized under a warrant or other statutory or common law 
authority. These are aimed at reducing the administrative burden on 
law enforcement agencies and persons from whom property has 
been seized.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3539"> 3539 </A></B>
<P>
	Other proposals clarify that warrants for searches of computer 
systems can be obtained. They are modelled after provisions found 
in other statutes which explicitly deal with searches in relation to 
computers.
<P>
	As mentioned already, other proposals would make it possible to 
obtain warrants using fax or telephone communications.
<P>
	There are other proposals codifying the circumstances under 
which police and others performing statutory duties can search and 
seize without a warrant. For example, where exigent circumstances 
clearly exist, evidence of criminal activity in the plain view of 
police and others with law enforcement responsibility carrying out 
their lawful functions would also be subject to seizure and control 
under the criminal code.
<P>
	When it would be necessary to execute a search warrant at night 
the justice would be able to authorize this only when satisfied there 
are reasonable grounds to do so. A justice would also have the 
authority to permit the sale or destruction of perishables or other 
things which depreciate rapidly.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	Finally, a warrant would be available to obtain any handprint, 
fingerprint, footprint, foot impression, teeth impression or other 
print or impression provided that the criteria generally needed to 
obtain a search warrant exist and that it would be in the best 
interests of the administration of justice to do so. This provision 
fills in a gap between the warrant for tangible evidence and the 
DNA warrant provided for in Bill C-104, which was enacted last 
session.
<P>
	Obviously this bill is very wide ranging. It covers a wider range 
of matters than I have indicated in these remarks. Over 140 clauses 
of this bill contain many provisions that are technical and may not 
attract attention in the course of this debate, but along with those 
outlined they are all aimed at improving the administration of 
criminal justice in Canada and the confidence the public must have 
in our criminal law.
<P>
	This bill has very broad support, including the provinces and 
territories, the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police, the 
Canadian Police Association. It implements recommendations 
brought to the attention of the Minister of Justice by many 
disparate groups of Canadians, including judges, child care 
authorities and the Uniform Law Conference of Canada.
<P>
	Therefore I call on all parties in the House to support Bill C-17 to 
improve the administration of criminal justice in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, right off the bat I am going to make a liar of all those who 
say that the opposition is here for the sole purpose of criticizing and 
tearing apart the government's bills because, on the whole, the 
official opposition is in agreement with the amendments made to 
Bill C-17.
<P>
	In effect, this bill amends the Criminal Code and several related 
acts, such as the Canada Evidence Act, the Customs Act, the Excise 
Act, the Food and Drugs Act, the Foreign Extraterritorial Measures 
Act, the Narcotic Control Act, the National Defence Act, the 
Seized Property Management Act and the Supreme Court Act. 
Clearly, this is an extremely broad bill, a bill that brings a breath of 
fresh air to a number of the aforementioned acts.
<P>
	The proposed amendments range from a minor correction to the 
creation of new offences, particularly with respect to fraudulently 
using credit cards or fraudulently obtaining computer services. 
They complete the update of the Criminal Code undertaken by Bill 
C-42, passed on December 15, 1994.
<P>
	Other measures are designed to modernize the legal system, by 
allowing general use, under certain conditions, of modern means of 
communication, such as closed circuit television, the telephone and 
the telecopier or fax machine. They will also help to reduce the cost 
of justice and increase the effectiveness of the courts by making it 
unnecessary to move inmates around, for example, or by making it 
easier to obtain search warrants.
<P>
	This bill, as I have already said, creates mixed or hybrid charges, 
that is to say ones which could involve either summary conviction 
or indictment. These new hybrids are: break and enter into a place 
other than a dwelling-house, forceable confinement, unlawful 
presence in a dwelling house, forgery and uttering. This will have 
the effect of eliminating the necessity of a preliminary 
investigation prior to the hearing, when the Attorney General's 
prosecutor has opted to proceed via summary conviction. This will 
result in substantial savings of time and money, particularly legal 
aid fees. Pre-trial delays will also be reduced.
<P>
	I feel that these are amendments which will be welcomed by all 
Canadian and Quebec taxpayers, since it is obvious that the longer 
a procedure takes, the more it will cost. The purpose of this bill is 
to shorten these delays.
<P>
	As well, the indictment approach will be reserved for only the 
most serious crimes, as decided by the crown prosecutor. Thus, 
jury trials will be less common and the process will be shortened 
for cases deemed to be of lesser severity.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	Some of the proposals, however, immediately raise some 
questions, but I must point out immediately that these criticisms do 
not jeopardize our support of this bill, they merely raise certain 
legitimate concerns. It is, for instance, proposed to amend the 
provisions of the Criminal Code concerning impaired driving, in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3540"> 3540 </A></B>
<P>
order to  make it harder to use a defence that contests breathalyser 
readings.
<P>
	From now on, if the amendment is passed by this House, the 
defence will have to produce evidence to show that the blood 
alcohol levels of the accused at the time the offence was alleged to 
have been committed did not exceed 80 milligrams of alcohol in 
one hundred millilitres of blood. In other words, the reversal of 
proof as we now know it. This amendment would put the onus on 
the accused to prove his innocence. This position raises questions 
about the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. In his effort to 
prevent people from driving with a alcohol reading over 80 
milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, is the minister not 
running the risk of having innocent people charged?
<P>
	It may be impossible for someone charged to establish that his 
blood alcohol level was below 8o milligrams and thus avoid the 
consequences of conviction, such as the loss of his driver's permit 
for a year, as is the case in most provinces. Here again, is this 
amendment justified?
<P>
	This provision would certainly be contested in the courts, right 
up to the Supreme Court, because the consequences are extremely 
serious. We have only to look at the number of court cases and legal 
challenges to this provision. If the past is any indication of the 
future, clearly there will be cases in the lower courts that will go as 
high as the Supreme Court for clarification of this provision of the 
bill, if the bill is passed as it stands, of course. Rest assured that we 
will follow the consequences in law of this amendment with great 
interest.
<P>
	Another provision proposed would increase the number of 
people detained. The court may order an accused to be held during 
proceedings on additional grounds. It will now be permissible to 
detain an accused for just cause, when detention is necessary, so as 
not to undermine the public's confidence in the administration of 
justice. At the moment, detention pending the end of proceedings is 
permissible only to ensure the accused's presence in court or to 
protect the public. As we are trying to keep as few people as 
possible in prison, I raise the question: Is it warranted to add these 
additional grounds?
<P>
	Furthermore, it is up to us members to decide the grounds for 
detention. The expression ``just cause'' in the bill, like ``public 
interest'', opens the door to court interpretation, to a hundred 
uncertainties that will not be resolved until the Supreme Court 
establishes the meaning of these expressions. So, why, with this bill 
before us, not establish more guidelines to limit interpretation and 
achieve the objective we are aiming for with this bill?
<P>
	Another proposed amendment will give police forces additional 
tools to find out who committed a crime by making it possible to 
get a warrant allowing a peace officer to obtain any handprint, 
fingerprint, footprint, foot impression, teeth impression or other 
print or  impression of the body in respect of the person, provided, 
of course, that certain conditions are met.
<P>
	The law already allows police to take samples of a bodily 
substance from someone for genetic analysis. These provisions 
also make it possible for an individual to prove that he or she is 
innocent. I think this amendment can help the accused prove his or 
her innocence just as much as it can help the prosecutor.
<P>
	We suggest that this provision should be improved by making it 
possible to photograph a person or part of his or her body. This 
would help establish whether or not, for example, an accused has a 
tattoo or other distinguishing marks. In a recent sexual assault 
case-which, I am sure, hon. members remember-some children 
claimed that their assailant had certain marks on his body.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	One simple way to verify if these children were telling the truth 
would have been to obtain a warrant to photograph part of the 
accused's body. This would have made it possible to determine if 
the young people's accusations were justified and, as I said earlier, 
it would have helped the accused as much as the prosecutor if the 
information given by the children in this sexual assault case turned 
out to be false.
<P>
	Another amendment in this bill is aimed at making it easier to 
prove that someone helped launder the proceeds from crime. I must 
say right away that this is a step forward. We in the opposition have 
sought and continue to seek a major change, or at least a tougher 
attitude, in this regard, given that several countries consider 
Canada as an ideal place to launder money. I think this amendment 
is a step forward, but we will still need to look very seriously into 
this issue at some point in time, to ensure that Canada does not 
keep this unenviable title of crime money laundering paradise.
<P>
	For the time being however, as far as the bill before us, Bill 
C-17, is concerned, we suggest adding to the list of ways of 
participating in the laundering of proceeds of crime the fact that a 
person accepts that money be deposited in an account under his or 
her name, while knowing or believing this money was derived from 
a designated offence.
<P>
	Recently, several people have received letters requesting 
permission to deposit certain amounts in their banks accounts. 
Again, this is a current concern. There was a piece on this in 
<I>L'Actualité</I> a few months ago. Those who accepted later found 
their bank accounts to have been emptied out. Certainly, there is 
an element of voluntary blindness in accepting money from 
some unknown source abroad, under the mere promise of an 
eventual profit. But it did not pay off in the end, as the defrauder, 
who had deposited money in their bank accounts, then took it 
out, along with all their savings. This may be one of the means 
used to hide and launder  proceeds from crime and, as I said, I 
think it should be provided for and included in Bill C-17.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3541"> 3541 </A></B>
<P>
	Other provisions complement existing provisions regarding 
credit card forgery and unlawfully obtaining computer services. 
For instance, it will now be illegal to possess or use a computer 
password to unlawfully obtain computer services. We must keep up 
with our times, and I think that the Criminal Code was in great need 
of updating, from a legal point of view, to be in step with new 
technologies, such as computer services.
<P>
	Bill C-17 includes many amendments affecting existing acts. It 
goes without saying that I cannot discuss all of them in the time 
allotted to me, but I want to mention the main ones.
<P>
	If the bill goes through, peace officers will be allowed to release 
a person arrested with or without a warrant by imposing conditions 
such as to abstain from possessing a firearm, to report at the times 
specified in the undertaking to a peace officer or other person, and 
to abstain from consuming alcohol or other intoxicating 
substances. These conditions would be in addition to those which 
peace officers may already impose. This provision will make it 
possible to release more quickly people who normally had to be 
taken before a justice of the peace within 24 hours, but who often 
ended up spending the weekend in jail in areas where justices of the 
peace and Crown attorneys are not readily available on weekends.
<P>
	This is a fair measure which will benefit people living in regions, 
including my riding of Berthier-Montcalm. I was a lawyer before 
becoming a member of Parliament and I know that people in 
regions are sometimes penalized in that regard. Bill C-17 will 
improve the situation regarding weekend court appearances in the 
regions.
<P>
	These increased powers for peace officers should almost 
eliminate the need for justices of the peace and Crown attorneys to 
hold court appearances on weekends for the release of people, 
when imposing usual conditions would ensure adequate protection 
of the public.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	This will be greatly appreciated by the justiciable, but also by 
taxpayers since, in the end, they are the ones paying for the costs 
related to the legal system.
<P>
	Another good amendment included in the bill would allow an 
expert to testify by submitting a report, along with an affidavit or a 
solemn declaration. This exception to the rule prohibiting written 
testimonies will certainly be welcomed by expert witnesses, who 
have a busy schedule and who may even have to testify in two 
different places at the same time.
<P>
	It will also be welcomed by taxpayers, given that an expert 
witness if often asked to testify at a certain place and time and that, 
for some reasons, the trial is  postponed. The expert witness then 
has to come back again, thus increasing costs. Thanks to this 
amendment, experts will be allowed to submit their report, along 
with an affidavit, thus saving time and money.
<P>
	The bill also includes a provision that will please an accused who 
fails to appear at the time and place stated in a notice for the 
purposes of the Identification of Criminals Act. From now on, a 
justice will be allowed to issue a warrant indicating a period during 
which proceedings are suspended, to allow the accused to 
voluntarily appear before a judge, thus avoiding arrest and 
detention until his or her appearance before a justice of the peace.
<P>
	This procedure should also apply when an accused fails to 
appear before the court at any stage of the proceedings. Courts 
currently take the warrant under advisement when the absence of 
an accused seems justifiable or the situation could easily be 
corrected. But the legality of this measure of suspending an order is 
debatable and has the disadvantage that only the judge who ordered 
the suspension may take the final decision.
<P>
	Therefore, you can see that on the whole the official opposition 
supports Bill C-17 now before us. But we have some concerns 
about a few minor points. I think that in this bill the government 
has shown itself to be open minded, that it has listened to those who 
said the Criminal Code should be modernized.
<P>
	Since we have gone this far, we could perhaps clarify the points 
raised in order to prevent too broad an interpretation of the wording 
used, among other things, so that accused cannot take their case to 
higher courts, and even all the way to the Supreme Court, claiming 
Charter violations, as I mentioned earlier. For all these reasons, the 
official opposition will support the bill at this stage.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
address Bill C-17 and I must oppose this bill. Bill C-17 contains a 
significant number of updates and improvements to the 
administration of law which are long overdue and the Reform Party 
supports this portion of the bill.
<P>
	The efficiency of peace officers and courts would be aided 
through a number of the amendments contained within Bill C-17. 
Subclauses 4(6) and (7) of Bill C-17 will allow a peace officer to 
provide a statement of service without having to seek out a justice 
of the peace or notary to have the service sworn. This change will 
improve police officers' efficiency and reduce the workload of 
justices of the peace and redirect their expertise to where it is 
needed.
<P>
	Similarly subclause 145(5) and a number of subsequent clauses 
of Bill C-17 will permit any peace officer to release an accused on 
recognizance. Currently only the officer in charge can do so. This 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3542"> 3542 </A></B>
<P>
amendment improves police efficiency by negating the necessity to 
bring in the officer in charge for a mere procedural action.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	Reform members support the changes in this bill that would 
enhance the way the police and the courts would be able to conduct 
their business. We also support the portion of the bill which 
strengthens the proceeds of crime legislation by ensuring that 
criminals do not retain the profits of their crimes, but we cannot 
support Bill C-17.
<P>
	We do not support Bill C-17 because we are vehemently opposed 
to that portion of the bill which lessens the penalty for certain 
offences. That the justice minister felt it was necessary to slip this 
into an otherwise supportable bill is very regrettable in my eyes.
<P>
	We oppose Bill C-17 because it places Canadians at risk through 
continued Liberal leniency. The Reform Party will only support a 
judicial system, and changes within that system, that places the 
punishment of crime and the protection of law-abiding citizens and 
their property ahead of all other objectives and considerations.
<P>
	The justice minister has been less than forthright with Canadians 
about the full impact of Bill C-17. The minister has touted the 
merits of this bill in that it modernizes the law and streamlines 
court proceedings, but he has been noticeably silent about the 
reduction in penalties for certain very serious offences.
<P>
	Although Reform supports the administrative changes contained 
within Bill C-17, I would be remiss if I did not say that this bill is a 
nebulous, inconsequential piece of legislation to the vast majority 
of Canadians because it will be of little significance to the 
enhancement of the safety of Canadians, their children and their 
property.
<P>
	Canadians are very concerned about their personal security and 
that of their families. These administrative changes will do nothing 
to protect Canadians from the murderers, rapists and other sadistic 
criminals that roam our streets and enter our homes.
<P>
	Bill C-17 will not stop serial child killer Clifford Olson from 
applying for early release. Only a bill repealing section 745 of the 
Criminal Code will keep Olson locked up where he belongs but the 
minister has not brought in a bill of this nature.
<P>
	Bill C-17 will not stop Robert Noyes from sexually molesting 
another child. The former Ashcroft teacher admitted to abusing 
more than 60 children. As a dangerous offender, he was sentenced 
to an indefinite period of incarceration on 19 sex related charges 
and now the justice system is turning him loose. The National 
Parole Board has granted Noyes escorted temporary leave and if 
this goes well, in nine months he will be eligible for unescorted 
leave with day parole following. Only a bill like the one proposed 
by my colleague from Surrey-White Rock-South Langley 
requiring the examination of sex offenders by two psychiatrists will 
keep people like this locked up where they belong.
<P>
	Bill C-17 will not alleviate Canadian parents' fears that their 
children could be abducted, sexually molested or killed in any one 
of our communities or on our streets. The justice minister's news 
release at the time of the introduction of this bill stated these 
amendments illustrate further progress on the government's safe 
home, safe streets agenda. That is absolute nonsense. It is simply 
not true. How do you make safer streets and safer homes by 
reducing the penalties for crimes such as the forcible confinement 
of individuals and being unlawfully in their homes? I simply do not 
see it.
<P>
	Canadians want substantive change within the justice system. 
They want legislation that effectively enhances public safety. They 
want legislation that sends a clear message to criminals that if you 
are going to commit the crime you must serve the time. Canadians 
want this legislation in the hope that it will deter ruthless thieves 
from entering and destroying the sanctity of their homes. 
Canadians want a bill which repeals section 745 of the Criminal 
Code. They want the Minister of Justice to vote in favour of victims 
and victims' rights. They do not want a minister that upholds and 
protects the rights of criminals to the detriment of the law-abiding, 
peace loving citizen.
<P>
	Last year the minister voted against private member's Bill C-26, 
which would have extinguished the right of first degree murderers 
to a parole eligibility hearing after serving only 15 years of a life 
sentence. Canadians do not want the minister giving killers this 
so-called glimmer of hope. They want killers behind bars and they 
want them there for a minimum of 25 years as the law originally 
intended; not 15 years and not 20 years. Canadians 
overwhelmingly want murderers behind bars for the full length of 
their life sentences.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	What is the value of a human life to the justice minister, the 
Prime Minister, the Liberal government? Is it just 15 years? That is 
what they are telling the people of Canada. They are telling 
Canadians their laws are enhancing public safety. Nothing could be 
further from the truth.
<P>
	August 12, the day Clifford Olson is eligible to apply for a parole 
eligibility hearing, is rapidly approaching and the minister still has 
not introduced a bill which will deny this serial child killer the right 
of appeal after serving just 15 years of a life sentence. That is how 
this justice minister is getting tough on crime. That is how he is 
making our streets and our homes safer.
<P>
	Olson is not the only murderer with a glimmer of hope to get out 
before serving his full sentence. Ralph Ernest Malcolm Power is 
eligible July 10 to apply for early parole on his first degree murder 
conviction. In 1981, 28-year old Power, an ex-con out on 
mandatory  supervision, beat 20-year old Sheryl Gardner's face to a 
bloody 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3543"> 3543 </A></B>
<P>
pulp with a hammer. He confessed that he was attempting to stun 
her just a little so he could rape her. Power was arrested for the 
murder of Sheryl after attempting to kill another woman.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice should have brought in a bill that would 
keep Clifford Olson, Ralph Power and many others behind bars. 
Why is the Minister of Justice not listening to the victims of 
violence and the Canadian Police Association? Why has the 
minister not repealed section 45 of the Criminal Code? The 
Minister of Justice should be dealing with crime first and then 
administrative matters, not vice versa.
<P>
	In the wake of the horrific crimes against Leslie Mahaffy and 
Kristen French, capital punishment is resurfacing as a major issue 
with Canadians. The evidence is growing that if Canadians were 
given the opportunity to vote in a binding referendum on capital 
punishment, an initiative supported by the Reform Party, 
Canadians would choose to sentence our most ruthless and sadistic 
killers, like Paul Bernardo and Clifford Olson, to death. The 
Liberal government refuses to give Canadians this right and this 
opportunity.
<P>
	Canadians also want the Minister of Justice to bring in 
dangerous offender legislation. They want the minister to end 
statutory release. They want the minister to end the automatic 
release of prisoners after serving only two-thirds of their sentences 
even when signs indicate these people will commit further crimes. 
Melanie Carpenter who was kidnapped, raped and murdered is one 
of the latest victims of this kind of Liberal thinking and mentality.
<P>
	The minister has promised to bring in an omnibus bill which will 
encompass these two initiatives, initiatives which would 
significantly enhance public safety, but we have yet to see the bill. 
Instead, all we have been given in the last year is Bill C-2 and Bill 
C-42 which amend the Judges Act, Bill C-9 which reinstituted the 
law commission, and now Bill C-17.
<P>
	Bill C-27, which we support because it deals with child 
prostitution and stalking, should have pre-empted all of these bills. 
All Bills C-2, C-42, C-9 and now C-17 do is make life a little easier 
for those involved in the justice system. They do not and will not 
make Canadians safer.
<P>
	In fact, Bill C-17 will give Canadians more reason to be 
concerned about home invasions because the Liberal government, 
through Bill C-17, has lessened the punishment for this Criminal 
Code offence. Bill C-17 reduces maximum sentences and changes 
strictly indictable offences to dual procedure offences.
<P>
	The redesignation of offences from indictable to dual procedure 
permits and encourages judges to consider those offences as less 
serious and therefore permissive of lesser punishment to include 
mere financial penalties. While most of these offences are 
non-violent, with the exception of forcible confinement, they 
involve intrusion into the sanctity of our homes and forgery which 
may deprive our most vulnerable citizens, our seniors, of valuable 
financial assets.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	According to Statistics Canada, in 1994 break and enter 
accounted for 15 per cent of all Criminal Code offences while 25 
per cent of all Criminal Code offences were for property offences. 
Eighty-one per cent of break and enters involved forced entry. 
Property was damaged in 71 per cent of the cases and property was 
stolen in 81 per cent of cases.
<P>
	Instead of expressing concern and outrage over these figures, the 
Liberal government is now saying these offences deserve a lesser 
penalty. These offences, which infringe on the financial and mental 
security of Canadian citizens, are going to be dealt with more 
leniently because of Bill C-17.
<P>
	Unbeknownst to Canadians, the Liberal government has been 
slowly moving in this direction over the course of its mandate, a 
direction we are opposed to because not only has it not been 
sanctioned by Canadians, it may very well lead to an increase in 
crime, not a reduction, which is what we in this party, as most 
Canadians, seek.
<P>
	A shift of this magnitude in how we punish-or should I say in a 
politically correct manner, how we hold criminals accountable for 
their actions-should be reviewed and then approved by the public. 
Bill C-41 which passed a year ago introduced alternative to 
incarceration. This portion of Bill C-41 was overshadowed by the 
hate crime part of the bill which gave an added protection under the 
law to a category of citizens, including those classified by sexual 
orientation.
<P>
	If asked today I am confident very few Canadians would known 
that the Liberal government has provided the means for a whole 
host of criminals, including sex and other violent offenders, to do 
community work rather than spend time in jail.
<P>
	It is most unfortunate Canadians were not aware of the full scope 
of Bill C-41 which was described by the Canadian Police 
Association in the following manner: ``Bill C-41 with few 
exceptions is unwieldy, complicated, internally self-contradictory, 
duplicitous and what is worse in all of it, completely unnecessary 
for anyone of any knowledge of or use for the common law heritage 
of Canada''.
<P>
	The police went on to say: ``While it would attempt to codify 
basic sentencing principles, eliminating this most basic judicial 
discretion at that the same time it would bestow huge new 
discretionary powers to a whole range of persons within the justice 
system. The common thread in those new powers is that all are to 
the benefit of the offender in the sense of non-custodial 
consequences for criminal actions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3544"> 3544 </A></B>
<P>
	``Where sentencing reform calls for protection this bill offers 
platitudes, where it calls for clarity it offers confusion and outright 
hypocrisy. It will almost certainly cause the already skyrocketing 
criminal justice budget to expand further still.''
<P>
	That was a statement made to the standing committee on Bill 
C-41. I could not have better summarized this Liberal justice bill 
nor the mentality or thinking behind it which is reflected again in 
Bill C-17. What better words to use than those of the Canadian 
Police Association, an authority to which the justice minister 
readily turned to add credence to his gun registration bill.
<P>
	Section 717 of Bill C-41, the Liberal's response to the 
overcrowding in Canadian prisons, was the most contentious part 
of the bill. Rather than attempt to reduce or prevent crime by 
dealing with the causes of crime, something Reform has been 
urging the government to do, the Liberals have decided to turn 
prisoners loose, a sentiment which has been echoed by the former 
head of corrections services, Mr. John Edwards and the head of the 
parole board, Mr. Willie Gibbs.
<P>
	We would not have objected so vehemently to this section of Bill 
C-41 if the government had specified which offences may be 
applicable to alternative measures. We could support the use of 
alternative measures for specific non-violent offences to reduce 
expensive court proceedings and incarceration. However, no such 
specifications appeared in Bill C-41.
<P>
	The Canadian Police Association and the Victims of Violence 
recommended section 717 be amended to ``restrict the availability 
of the program to persons who have committed less serious 
offences and first time offenders''. Specifically reflecting the 
opinions expressed by these witnesses, the Reform Party 
introduced an amendment during the clause by clause 
consideration of that bill to limit the use of alternative measures to 
non-violent offences. Our amendment was defeated by the Liberal 
majority on that committee.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	Alternative measures have been used for years by police officers 
in this country. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms has 
cautioned the police to restrictively use their discretion in dealing 
with offenders.
<P>
	Fearing they could be violating an offender's right, the police are 
strictly playing by the book in many cases in arresting, charging 
and finally convicting an offender, whereas before if they picked 
someone up for a minor violation, they may have dealt with the 
matter informally, providing only a stern warning and exposing to 
them the threat of being charged the next time should they violate 
the law again.
<P>
	I agree with the Canadian Police Association. We cannot limit 
police discretion in this area by creating an expensive unnecessary 
bureaucracy, such as that imposed by Bill C-41, which will 
potentially allow violent offenders to go free under the guise of 
alternatives to incarceration.
<P>
	We cannot lessen the penalty for criminal offences as proposed 
by the justice minister in Bill C-17 and say to the people we are 
getting tougher on crime.
<P>
	I draw to the attention of the House the sections of Bill C-17 
which make it impossible for Reform to support this bill, a very 
small portion of an otherwise supportable bill.
<P>
	The existing laws dealing with forceful confinement of a human 
being makes this offence an indictable offence with a maximum 
sentence of 10 years which classifies this as a very serious offence. 
If Bill C-17 passes unamended the severity of this offence will be 
lowered significantly. The maximum penalty will still be 10 years. 
However, it will become a dual procedure offence which may be 
processed by either indictment or summary conviction.
<P>
	This means that under a summary conviction procedure this 
offence can be reduced to a maximum sentence of 18 months or 
only a fine of up to $2,000. The criminals who held in confinement 
a B.C. woman who was nine months pregnant could receive as little 
as a fine under this new amendment.
<P>
	Is this making our streets and communities safer? I do not see it. 
I do not understand how. This Criminal Code amendment clearly 
signals to the courts this type of offence is to be treated in a less 
severe manner than is currently the case.
<P>
	Admittedly, the Liberals may argue, the decision on whether to 
proceed by indictment or by summary conviction is made by the 
crown. The courts will undoubtedly be influenced by this 
downward trend in sentencing.
<P>
	Section 348(1)(e) of the Criminal Code regarding breaking and 
entering for places other than a dwelling house will also be changed 
to a dual procedure offence. The maximum sentence will be 
reduced from 14 years to 10 years under indictment. Not only that, 
it can be tried by summary conviction with a maximum penalty of 
18 months or simply a fine. What does this say to society? What 
does it say to the criminal element?
<P>
	The offence of being unlawfully in a dwelling house, Criminal 
Code section 349(1), has also been changed to dual procedure with 
imprisonment up to 10 years or processed by summary conviction, 
again with a maximum penalty of 18 months or simply a fine.
<P>
	Currently unlawfully being in a dwelling house is an indictable 
offence with a maximum imprisonment of up to 10 years. This is 
another downward trend in sentencing and flies in the face of the 
statement made by the justice minister that he is getting tough on 
crime.
<P>
	Similarly, section 367 of the code regarding forgery and section 
368(1), uttering forged documents, will be  amended to dual 
procedure offences with imprisonment of up to 10 years or 
processed by summary conviction whereas the current punishment 
is indictable only with the imprisonment of up to 14 years. This is 
another unacceptable downward trend in sentencing that lessens 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3545"> 3545 </A></B>
<P>
the penalty for serious crime which will not be lost on those who 
prey on innocent people.
<P>
	Canada is faced with rising crime rates, particularly violent 
crime, rising fears regarding personal safety, escalating costs to 
administer justice and to house prisoners and, to top it all off, a 
growing debt which severely limits spending. The task of the 
federal Minister of Justice to deal with these problems in unison 
will be difficult but not insurmountable.
<P>
	Bill C-17 is not at this time part of the answer. It does not address 
the increase in crime in Canada and it does absolutely nothing to 
confront the cause of crime.
<P>
	Bill C-17 if enacted unamended will lend itself to an increase, 
not a decrease, in crime thereby threatening, not enhancing, public 
safety.
<P>
	Bill C-17 is living proof the justice minister does not-I say this 
with respect-seem to know what he is doing. On one hand he 
states he will get tougher on crime, that he will make our streets 
and homes safer when what he is actually doing is making it easier 
on criminals by reducing penalties. I cannot do anything other than 
oppose Bill C-17.

	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (for the Minister of Justice)</B> moved that 
Bill C-27, an act to amend the Criminal Code (Child prostitution, 
child sex tourism, criminal harassment and female genital 
mutilation) be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak on Bill C-27.
<P>
	In addition to the provisions of Bill C-119, which died on the 
Order Paper when the last session was prorogued, this bill includes 
provisions with respect to child sex tourism.
<P>
	The government continues to have concerns regarding violence 
against women and children. These concerns have led us to present 
the amendments proposed in Bill C-27 addressing child 
prostitution, criminal harassment and female genital mutilation.
<P>
	At the ninth U.N. conference on the prevention of crime and the 
treatment of offenders in Cairo in 1995, member states were urged 
to adopt effective measures against practices harmful to women 
and children.
<P>
	In 1993 the United Nations declaration on the elimination of 
violence against women and the 1995 platform for action for the 
fourth world conference on women recognized that violence 
against women violates their human rights and fundamental 
freedoms.
<P>
	Canada has ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights 
of the Child. This bill will help to fulfil our commitment as set out 
in the convention to protect children from all forms of sexual 
exploitation and unlawful sexual practices. These concerns extend 
to the prostitution of children, whether in or outside Canada.
<P>
	The improvements proposed in Bill C-27 are a first step in the 
federal response to the joint federal-provincial-territorial 
consultation on prostitution. While this consultation is still 
ongoing, the need to deal with the prostitution of children, that is 
persons under 18 years of age, has become increasingly apparent.
<P>
	Our communities are alarmed at the growing number of young 
people involved in prostitution. Most adult prostitutes state they 
entered prostitution as youths. Both sex trade workers and 
professionals suggest the average age of entry is 14. There have 
been cases of children as young as 8 or 9 being sexually procured.
<P>
	There have been extensive consultations on the subject of 
prostitution. There is a general feeling that the involvement of 
young persons in prostitution is the issue which most urgently 
needs to be dealt with.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	The preamble of Bill C-27 stresses the particular vulnerability of 
young people and their need for protection. It also stresses how 
reprehensible it is to involve youth in prostitution related activities 
and that the sexual exploitation of children is to be treated 
extremely seriously, including in the sentencing of such crimes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3546"> 3546 </A></B>
<P>
	The changes proposed in the bill are aimed at protecting 
children from adult predators who seek children for sexual 
services or to exploit young prostitutes for economic gain. They 
would make it easier to apprehend customers of young prostitutes 
by modifying a Criminal Code provision to make it illegal to 
attempt to procure the sexual services of a person the offender 
believes is under the age of 18. The evidentiary presumption has 
specifically been proposed to facilitate the proof of this belief.
<P>
	One of the main points of discussion during consultations was 
that traditional policing methods are not appropriate for the 
enforcement of current Criminal Code provisions and that these 
provisions have not been very successful in allowing police to 
bring customers and procurers to justice in many jurisdictions.
<P>
	These provisions work only when a prostitute gives evidence 
against a procurer, but in most cases child prostitutes do not wish to 
appear as witnesses against their pimps.
<P>
	For the most part, the Criminal Code is enforceable only when 
the customer is caught in the act of obtaining sexual services from a 
young person for consideration. The proposed change in the 
wording of the relevant sections and the addition of a presumption 
would greatly assist the enforcement of these provisions. A new 
offence of aggravated procuring would carry a five year minimum 
sentence. It would also be created for those who for their own profit 
and while living on the avails of child prostitution use violence or 
intimidation in carrying out prostitution related activities.
<P>
	It is our view society should denounce such a crime in strong 
terms and send a signal of the community's abhorrence of this type 
of crime by imposing a sentence commensurate with the gravity of 
the offence. Both public protection and the expression of public 
revulsion for such conduct would appear to require that a minimum 
time served in the correctional system be subject to legislative 
rather than judicial and administrative control.
<P>
	Some persons believe prostitution is a victimless crime, that 
youths involved in prostitution are all on the street by choice. This 
perception might be exacerbated by the fact that only some 
prostitution related activities, as opposed to prostitution as a whole, 
constitute crime. This perception is wrong.
<P>
	It is important to send a strong message of social disapproval 
with respect to the prostitution of young people. The creation of a 
mandatory minimum sentence will send the strong message that 
while procuring youth is never acceptable, as evidenced by the high 
sentences already included in the Criminal Code, procuring youth 
with these added serious circumstances is even less tolerable and is 
to be punished by severe sentences.
<P>
	The creation of a separate aggravated offence assists in the 
fulfilling of the spirit of the red book commitment to toughen laws 
against pimps. Special protections to ease the burden for young 
persons testifying in court will be made available to child 
prostitutes testifying against their exploiters. These protections 
involve testimony from behind a screen and other methods of 
testifying that are less intimidating than a courtroom testimony 
such as videotaped evidence or the use of a closed circuit television 
system. Young prostitutes would have the same protection in this 
respect as other victims of child sexual abuse.
<P>
	The bill also proposes to extend the use of devices such as a 
screen, closed circuit television or videotaped evidence to young 
victims of child pornography or assault.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	Bill C-27 also proposes to allow the courts to make an order 
restricting the publication or broadcast of the identity of a 
complainant or witness in a prostitution related case. This will 
encourage prostitutes, particularly young prostitutes, to testify in 
these cases.
<P>
	In addition to the legislative amendments of Bill C-27, efforts 
are being made to increase the awareness of justice system 
personnel regarding the exploitation and victimization resulting 
from prostitution. These include: developing models to provide 
training for police, prosecutors, judges, social workers who are 
involved with young prostitutes; encouraging provinces and 
territories to create strong police, crown and child welfare 
partnerships to deal with prostitution cases involving children; in 
co-operation with the provinces, developing an enforcement guide 
for the use of police and prosecutors in child prostitution cases; and 
encouraging provincial authorities to dedicate resources to fight 
child prostitution vigorously and to rigorously enforce the Criminal 
Code provisions focusing on pimps and customers of child 
prostitutes.
<P>
	Bill C-27 also acts on the commitment made by this government 
in the February throne speech, namely the protection of the rights 
of children as a Canadian priority.
<P>
	This bill proposes further amendments to the Criminal Code to 
enable criminal prosecution in Canada of Canadian citizens and 
permanent residents who travel abroad to engage in the sexual 
exploitation of children for money and other considerations. This 
practice, which is sometimes referred to as sex tourism, can only be 
stopped by international commitments and collaboration. Bill C-27 
recognizes this commitment and sends a very strong message 
internationally about Canada's intolerance of such practices. With 
this amendment Canada will join 11 other countries: Sweden, 
Norway, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Belgium, France, Germany, 
Australia, New Zealand and the United States which have already 
enacted similar legislative measures.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3547"> 3547 </A></B>
<P>
	The federal government has made a strong commitment to 
address the serious problem of violence against women and 
children. Bill C-27 proposes to strengthen the existing Criminal 
Code prohibition of criminal harassment or stalking as it is 
sometimes referred to. These amendments will serve to provide 
increased protection to women and children who are the primary 
victims of criminal harassment from such conduct.
<P>
	These proposals also respond to an earlier commitment the 
Minister of Justice made in response to recommendations made by 
the federal, provincial and territorial ministers responsible for 
justice and by other partners in the criminal justice system.
<P>
	Bill C-27 proposes that a person who commits murder while 
stalking in circumstances where he or she intended to make the 
victim fear for their safety or the safety of others, for example the 
victim's children, can be found guilty of first degree murder 
whether or not it can be proved that the murder itself was planned 
and deliberate.
<P>
	First degree murder carries a mandatory penalty of life 
imprisonment with no eligibility for parole for 25 years. This 
amendment clearly indicates that murder committed in the course 
of stalking a victim is an exceptionally serious crime and will be 
treated as such.
<P>
	Bill C-27 further proposes that a court imposing a sentence on a 
person who is convicted of stalking while under a restraining order 
or peace bond shall treat that as an aggravating factor for 
sentencing purposes.
<P>
	Another proposal in this bill concerns the practice of female 
genital mutilation which involves excising or mutilating the 
genitals of female infants or children. This practice can cause 
severe and irreversible health problems. The Department of Justice 
is currently collaborating with Health Canada, the Status of 
Women, Canadian Heritage, and Citizenship and Immigration 
Canada on the development of public legal, health and cultural 
education and information materials on female genital mutilation.
<P>
	It has been the government's position, and still is, that female 
genital mutilation is already covered by the Criminal Code. We are 
nevertheless proposing an amendment to clarify this prohibition so 
that it will be very clear that no form of female genital mutilation is 
permitted by Canadian law. I am confident this clarification 
together with our collaborative efforts on public education and 
information will play an important role in protecting Canadian 
children from the practice of female genital mutilation.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	Finally, Bill C-27 contains minor amendments to some 
prostitution offences with a view to removing archaic 
terminologies such as references to ``house of assignation'' or a 
``person of known immoral character''.
<P>
	As I have said, our Canadian youth matter a great deal. We are 
demonstrating our leadership by squarely addressing several issues 
where young people in particular are vulnerable: juvenile 
prostitution, child sex tourism, female genital mutilation. It is 
important to send a strong message of social disapproval with 
respect to the abuse, exploitation and prostitution of young people. 
Young people deserve our respect. Young people need our 
protection.
<P>
	In Bill C-27 we are dealing with the important issue of criminal 
harassment. Women and children are more frequent victims of 
stalking. They should be protected. This bill is important for all 
Canadians. It is in keeping with the ideals of Canadian society, a 
society which does not tolerate violence against women and 
children. Bill C-27 will help curb the problem of abuse and 
violence against women and children.
<P>
	I would particularly like to commend the efforts of the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Justice. Both have worked 
very hard in these regards and both very strongly, precisely and 
ably have spoken out to protect those who are most vulnerable in 
our society.
<P>
	I seek the support of the House for swift passage of this bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill 
C-27 addresses a number of issues, including female genital 
mutilation, criminal harassment, child sex tourism, testimony by 
children and procuring.
<P>
	I will deal first with child sex tourism, and then female genital 
mutilation. Both are problems I feel a particular concern about, 
having initiated the related bills. I will conclude by discussing the 
three other aspects of the bill.
<P>
	First of all, I will look at child sex tourism. I will begin by telling 
you a story reported in the November 1993 <I>Reader's Digest</I>.
<P>
	In 1992, near the border of Thailand, a young girl of 14 was 
walking toward the rice fields where her parents were working. 
Suddenly, a truck stopped in front of her and the driver forced her 
to get in. She was illegally confined in a brothel in Bangkok and 
raped ten times a day. When she cried out, she was beaten. She was 
robbed of her youth.
<P>
	In another country, Sri Lanka, men from London, Stuttgart, and 
San Francisco tan on the beach. Not far away, young Ceylonese 
boys lie on the sand. A middle-aged German accosts a ten-year old. 
He asks his name and, without any further ado, orders him to 
accompany him to his hotel. This is how they contribute to the 
country's economy, it is said.
<P>
	These are just two of hundreds of cases reported by journalists 
and others who have looked into child sex tourism. These two 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3548"> 3548 </A></B>
<P>
examples are a good illustration of  the terrible reality behind the 
sexual exploitation of children.
<P>
	As I have just said, this is a terrible reality, because we have here 
one of mankind's most reprehensible behaviours, the exploitation 
and victimization of children for sexual reward.
<P>
	What makes child sex tourism particularly terrible is that the 
children that are its victims are already disadvantaged. They are 
poor and come from developing countries where people's basic 
needs are not always met, far from it.
<P>
	In the name of the almighty dollar, these children are kidnapped, 
held in brothels, beaten, humiliated and continually exposed to the 
worst diseases, from which they will eventually die in their early 
twenties, just when our children are entering adulthood and setting 
out on a life full of promise. That is the ``local'' aspect of the 
operation.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	Then there is the customer, who comes from a rich country and is 
personally well off. This person can afford trips to exotic countries 
for the purpose, sometimes the sole purpose, of purchasing the 
sexual services of children.
<P>
	Let us not fool ourselves, this customer knows full well that he is 
committing a criminal act. He knows full well that involvement in 
the same activity in his own country would put him at risk of 
landing in jail for several years. This very morning, our newspapers 
were reporting that an Ontario man had been sentenced to three 
years in prison for having been found guilty of sexual relations 
with children between the ages of 9 and 14.
<P>
	Just because this is taking place elsewhere is not a reason not be 
concerned by it. As I was saying, the customer knows full well that 
this is one of the behaviours his society tolerates least. Why then 
should he feel so free to go abroad to take advantage of children in 
other countries?
<P>
	Some of these homosexual pedophiles claim to feel great love 
for their victims, and claim that the children feel the same way 
about them. They also claim that our laws are prohibitive and ought 
to acknowledge the possibility of supposedly affectionate relations 
between adults and children.
<P>
	I would remind you that these children are often no more than 10 
years old, sometimes even younger. This is an absolutely fallacious 
argument. How can anyone believe that a child forced to prostitute 
himself with strangers, sometimes horrifying numbers of them in 
one day, can feel any sort of affection whatsoever for his 
aggressors? The answer to this question is so obvious as to not even 
merit a reply.
<P>
	Another argument these tourists raise is the matter of cultural 
differences. They claim that in the countries  where they go to 
purchase the services of children there is a different mentality, that 
these youngsters are love children, that sexual morality is different 
there, that sexual relations between children and adults are 
perceived differently, are part of the mores of the country. What 
nonsense.
<P>
	We need only listen to the testimony of these poor children to 
know that this argument is, at the very least, misleading 
propaganda and, at most, a totally abusive justification of attacks 
on defenceless victims who are totally at the mercy of their 
tormenters.
<P>
	What is more, how could these same people explain that these 
same foreign countries themselves have legislation against juvenile 
prostitution? Are not the laws of a country supposed to reflect the 
morality of its people?
<P>
	While it appears true that, in certain countries, the laws on child 
prostitution are not being applied as fully as they ought, we must 
not rule out poverty based corruption as an explanation. It is in no 
way a matter of different sexual morals.
<P>
	Our society does not tolerate the purchase of sexual services 
from children, whether at home or abroad. Our society does not 
tolerate the kidnapping of children, who are mistreated in order to 
provide thrills for certain adults. This practice flies in the face of all 
the rights accorded children globally, nationally or internationally. 
A child's right to safety, health and life is sacred. All our laws are 
aimed at protecting them. Our criminal code, our charters, our laws 
on child protection all have only one aim, which is to ensure that all 
children live in safety, free from exploitation and mistreatment. 
Regardless of sexual tourists' fine words, their degrading 
behaviour violates the fundamental rights of their victims. These 
tourists are intolerable; they are criminals.
<P>
	This brings us to Bill C-27, which contains a provision making it 
easier to arrest and prosecute the clientele of children involved in 
prostitution in Canada and abroad.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	This breaks new legal ground, because of the extraterritorial 
scope accorded the Criminal Code. With this new legislation, the 
authorities will now be able to prosecute Canadian nationals 
buying the sexual services of children abroad.
<P>
	I am delighted by this government initiative. I am particularly 
happy because this is an area that concerns me a lot and that was 
the focus of a private member's bill I introduced in this House over 
a year ago. I was contacted after introducing it by organizations and 
people thanking me and encouraging me to continue to help protect 
defenceless children.
<P>
	As a member of Parliament, I can only be happy to make a 
contribution, however modest it may be, to this cause untiringly 
fought for out there by many people  who care about defending 
children and who, in some cases, put their own lives at risk. I thank 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3549"> 3549 </A></B>
<P>
the Hon. Minister of Justice for recognizing the importance of 
legislating in this area.
<P>
	I, however, have a few comments to make regarding the kind of 
action taken by the minister in this matter. I think that two 
important elements are missing from this bill. I am speaking of the 
impact of this bill in terms of quality and of the role it is playing in 
the commission of a crime. Let me explain.
<P>
	First of all, Bill C-27 provides only for the prosecution of 
Canadian citizens and landed immigrants. I think this category is 
too narrow and I intend to propose, during committee 
consideration, that the minister expand the classes of people who 
can be prosecuted. I think it is important that any individual, 
regardless of his or her legal status in Canada, be subject to 
prosecution if he or she commits this crime. I think the bill is too 
restrictive in this regard.
<P>
	Second, I think this bill must specifically target not only the 
customers but also all the people and companies directly or 
indirectly involved in this kind of sex tourism. The law should 
explicitly prohibit travel agencies and carriers from participating in 
or promoting this trade.
<P>
	I think the culpability of promoters and carriers must be 
recognized since these people benefit from and promote sex 
tourism just to make money. This is another amendment we should 
consider.
<P>
	I would now like to move on to the second part of Bill C-27, 
which deals with female genital mutilation. As in the case of sex 
tourism, I am pleased to note that the Minister of Justice has seen 
fit to take action to amend the Criminal Code for the purpose of 
naming and prohibiting the practice of female genital mutilation.
<P>
	Both these practices deny children's right to personal security 
and, in some cases, their right to life. They are therefore very 
important. In September 1994, I introduced at first reading a bill 
that would prohibit the practice of female genital mutilation and 
provide for the prosecution of those involved. That bill is now at 
the committee stage.
<P>
	My bill attracted the attention of many people and organizations 
in both Quebec and Canada. I noticed how seriously groups dealing 
with health and social issues, groups involved in putting an end to 
violence against women got together to examine the situation and 
try to remedy it.
<P>
	As in the case of child sex tourism, there is a consensus not only 
internationally, but also nationally and locally, around the fact that 
genital mutilation should be eradicated. Mutilation violates 
women's right to life and security of the person and, as such, 
cannot be tolerated.
<P>
	I spoke at length about this subject in the House. Now the time 
has come to stop talking and start acting. Once a consensus has 
been achieved, we must look at what can be done.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	I also noted, much to my relief, the climate of respect and 
sensitivity in which the debates on this subject take place. Every 
conversation I have had, every discussion meeting I have attended 
and every study I have read have all been stamped with profound 
respect for the person, whether the victim or those close to them. 
The consensus is that this practice must end, but the means 
developed to achieve this goal show great respect for those 
concerned.
<P>
	For instance, there is much talk about educating affected 
communities and about the difference between respecting a cultural 
practice and respecting basic human rights. I think we are on the 
right track and I am convinced that it is not by denigrating 
individuals that we will succeed in getting them to give up certain 
practices.
<P>
	Having said that, even if education and information are the basic 
tools of the fight against genital mutilation, the fact remains that 
penalties must be provided for in the legislation for those who 
knowingly carry on a practice violating human rights. In that sense, 
the minister's initiative addresses my concerns and those of every 
person concerned about mutilation.
<P>
	I commend this initiative, even though, as I said, it has its flaws. 
Before looking at these flaws, I must insist on the importance of 
having a common goal. I know that we all have the same goal, 
which will ensure that the best possible legislation will be passed.
<P>
	As for the flaws of this legislation, I want to say a word on the 
approach used by the minister to prohibit female genital mutilation. 
Contrary to my bill, which established a new offence, Bill C-27 
merely points out that female genital mutilation is a form of 
aggravated assault.
<P>
	In other words, the bill only makes the definition more clear. 
This way of doing things will not enable us to reach our objective. 
Through readings and conversations, I have learned that members 
of the communities still practising genital mutilation are not at all 
aware of the fact that they are actually taking part in a form of 
aggravated assault. In fact, most of these people would take 
exception to such a view.
<P>
	Therefore, since these people feel the operation is merely a 
cultural practice, in fact a necessary one, it should be dissociated 
from the usual notion of aggravated assault. The Criminal Code 
must include a provision dealing exclusively with female genital 
mutilation, to make people aware of the fact that this specific 
practice is illegal.
<P>
	There is another flaw in Bill C-27 regarding the persons 
associated with this practice. Indeed, the  prohibition only applies 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3550"> 3550 </A></B>
<P>
to those actually performing the surgical procedure. This is an 
essential first step. However, as I said on numerous occasions, it is 
also important, if we are to reach our goal of eradicating this 
practice, that all those involved be sued, whether it is a family 
member giving the authorization, a person looking after the travel 
arrangements of the victim to the country of origin, or of the 
midwife to Canada, or a person who, for example, puts parents in 
contact with someone prepared to perform the operation.
<P>
	Why charge everyone involved? Because this is a cultural 
practice, it is of primary importance for concerned members of the 
community to feel answerable to the law. In order to eradicate a 
practice, all those involved must be made to feel responsible. They 
must be made to know that, like any other act that is deemed to be 
criminal, any form of participation in the commission of that act is 
punishable. Thus, if each individual involved is aware that his role 
contributes to the commission of a criminal act, the chance of the 
operation being done successfully are reduced accordingly.
<P>
	If one link in the chain is missing, the chain is likely to be 
broken, and that is what we want. We want to see the chain broken 
so that the physical integrity of women and young girls is 
respected.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	Since, by definition, genital mutilation require a very young 
victim, obviously a person in authority must give authorization. It 
is said that some six million women yearly undergo excision. 
Obviously, the person who does this must be recruited by someone. 
It also seems that, in many cases, the child is taken out of the 
country to undergo the operation.
<P>
	She does not get there alone. If one of the people involved did 
not fulfil his or her role, the operation would not take place. It is 
important, therefore, to include in a legal text that these persons are 
committing a criminal act by playing their role in it. It is important 
that they know that they will be punished. The practice will be 
ended if all of the bases are covered.
<P>
	As well, since we know that the operation on Canadian nationals 
is often carried out outside the country, I am suggesting that the 
minister do as he has done in the case of child sex tourism and 
include extraterritoriality in the section pertaining to female genital 
mutilation. This would allow Canadian prosecution of persons 
taking a child abroad or organizing such a trip for the purpose of 
this operation. This extraterritoriality would make it possible to 
stop people from continuing to work around the law and would 
protect the children more effectively, which is, I say again, the 
purpose of the bill.
<P>
	Third, I would like to again question the exception for 
supposedly ``necessary'' surgical procedures. Discussions I have 
had with a representative of Canada's obstetricians and 
gynaecologists and the positions taken  by physicians' associations 
have convinced me that there is absolutely no need for such an 
exception and that, in fact, its effect might be the opposite of that 
intended by the law.
<P>
	In fact, I wonder whether such an exception might not lead to 
operations on the grounds they are necessary for a woman's health. 
From the information I received, physicians do not need legislation 
to know when a medical intervention is necessary. As they do not 
consider female genital mutilation a medical intervention, there is 
no need for its mention in the text of a law. I consider therefore that 
this exception should be eliminated.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to debate the possibility provided in Bill 
C-27 of an adult's consenting to a form of genital mutilation. I 
reject this possibility as strongly as I possibly can, because it runs 
completely counter to the intended objective, which is eradicating 
female genital mutilation.
<P>
	In the name of what principle exactly can the text of a law 
provide that an individual may consent to being mutilated? How do 
we expect to put an end to a centuries old cultural practice widely 
followed in certain cultures by permitting its being done to adults? 
How can we lose sight of the fact that family and social pressure 
may force women to agree to the operation when they reach age 18, 
the age of majority?
<P>
	I cannot accept our protecting women before they reach the age 
of majority and subsequently leaving them unprotected. Female 
genital mutilation, like the sexual exploitation of children, must be 
stopped. I will be happy to co-operate with the Minister of Justice 
to come up with the best possible legislation on these two aspects 
of the government bill.
<P>
	As the House knows, Bill C-27 addresses other key issues in 
protecting women and children. I would like to take a quick look at 
them, although I expect some of my colleagues to do a more 
in-depth analysis. Criminal harassment is a relatively recent 
offence in the history of our criminal law. In fact, it was only in 
1991 that the government finally bowed to the arguments made by 
women, who had for a long time demanded protection against 
criminal harassment.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	Criminal harassment is an insidious form of violence against 
women. It shows the possessive jealously some men feel toward 
their wives. This feeling causes them to take some very specific 
actions against their victims such as spying on everything they do, 
making threats and trying to intimidate them.
<P>
	A criminal harassment victim is not free and never feels safe. 
Her whole life and that of other people around her is affected to a 
significant degree by the harasser's behaviour and the fears it 
arouses.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3551"> 3551 </A></B>
<P>
	Apparently, women have not won this battle yet, given the 
judicial system's anemic response to the 1991 legislative 
initiative. That is why we now find in Bill C-27 a new provision 
that would give some teeth to those already in place. We agree.
<P>
	The effort to eliminate violence against women must be taken 
seriously by all stakeholders, be they police officers, Crown 
prosecutors or judges. How many women killed by their former 
husbands were harassed by them long before and right until they 
died? How many women fruitlessly appealed for help until it was 
too late?
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois strongly supports any measure to protect the 
lives of women and save them from the most pernicious kind of 
violence, the kind perpetrated by a spouse or former spouse.
<P>
	Bill C-27 also addresses another crime: child prostitution. More 
adults exploiting children for sexual purposes or for the purpose of 
gain. In fact, what pimps are doing with their victims is a form of 
modern-day slavery which is, still today, condemned by the 
International Labour Office. Data issued by the office show that 
tens of millions of children have been enslaved, and a great many 
of them in the sex industry. That is what the papers were reporting 
this morning.
<P>
	As we know, often pimps do not only exploit their victims, they 
also abuse them. It is a hellish situation young prostitutes. both 
boys and girls, have the greatest difficulty getting out of. Those 
who succeed need years to piece their lives back together.
<P>
	Léon Bernier and Jean Trépanier, two Quebec researchers who 
looked into the issue of juvenile prostitution, have compiled a list 
of problems related to prostitution. This list includes sexually 
transmitted diseases, emotional disturbances and socio-affective 
disorders, violence, delinquency and drug use.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois agrees with imposing stiffer sentences on 
pimps who use violence and live off the proceeds of the 
exploitation of youngsters.
<P>
	As far as the provision on agents provocateurs is concerned, 
however, we think perhaps further consideration is required, in the 
context where it may not necessarily be the role of the state to trip 
up individual citizens. We therefore urge the minister to think this 
over.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to assure the justice minister of the Bloc 
Quebecois' support for those provisions that will help young 
prostitutes come out and testify against their pimps. By allowing 
special measures to extend to the testimony of young victims of 
violence or procuring as well as of witnesses under the age of 18 in 
such matters, the government is seeking to reduce procuring 
through the conviction of those who commit a crime which, in my 
sense, is the most blameworthy of all crimes: child abuse.
<P>
	Any society that respects itself and wishes to survive protects its 
children. We will support any measure geared to achieving this 
objective while not violating basic human rights.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak on Bill C-27. This is one of the few 
times the Minister of Justice has put together legislation that goes 
somewhat in the right direction.
<P>
	Looking back over the last few years, much from the Department 
of Justice was based on the bleeding heart mentality of the 
Liberals. One might say they had no sense of direction and no sense 
of putting public safety as the number one priority, certainly not a 
reflection of mainstream Canadian values.
<P>
	With Bill C-37, which amends the Young Offenders Act, the 
minister was too lenient, providing more rights it seems to the 
offender than to victim. The minister had an opportunity to lower 
the age limit in the Young Offenders Act, something the majority of 
Canadians were pressing for, but he left the age alone simply to 
perhaps please the bleeding hearts. Now we have more committee 
study.
<P>
	With Bill C-68, an act respecting firearms and other weapons, 
the minister could not demonstrate that a ban on guns would put a 
stop to crime. Time will tell how this bill did nothing to curb 
violent crime involving weapons. Certainly this will be the 
minister's legacy, much about disruptive cost, very little to do with 
public safety.
<P>
	Bills C-41 and C-33, the two bills which included the term 
sexual orientation into both the Criminal Code and the Canadian 
Human Rights Act, prove the minister is all for giving special 
status to certain groups instead of providing equal protection for 
all.
<P>
	I am talking about the track record in the context of this bill. The 
track record of this minister is enough to single handedly perhaps 
undermine Canada's justice system. Where are we going? When I 
am back in my riding one of the comments I often hear is ``do not 
let the justice minister get away with the softening of crime''.
<P>
	People are generally afraid in their communities. They are afraid 
that criminals seem to have more rights than the average Canadian 
citizen. They are afraid knowing that sections of the Criminal Code 
like 745 are giving mass murderers like Clifford Olson at least a 
glimmer of hope of being released before their sentence is up.
<P>
	Specifically on this bill today, the government could have 
repealed section 745 but it did not. One of the markers of this minor 
criminal justice bill is significantly what is not in it and what could 
have been in it rather than what is.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3552"> 3552 </A></B>
<P>
	Many Canadians have written to the minister and have 
submitted countless petitions asking for the repeal of section 745, 
yet nothing has been done because the minority of bleeding hearts 
in this country are maybe supporting the Liberals. They know they 
are tied to special interest. Therefore because of political 
manoeuvring and expediency, the safety of Canadians is 
continuing to be put in jeopardy.
<P>
	I think we should expect more from our justice minister, after all 
he is the justice minister for our whole country. We look to him for 
guidance in being able to put a climate of laws in place to protect 
the community. We should expect him to represent the grassroots 
of ordinary communities and not special interests.
<P>
	The minister says he does respect the grassroots, except his 
legislation he almost always proves the opposite to be true. In view 
of what is not in this bill, who then does have the ear of the justice 
minister? It certainly does not appear to be the ordinary Canadian.
<P>
	Yes, I did say almost always. In my riding of New 
Westminster-Burnaby, for example, prostitution is a serious 
problem, as is the case in most of the larger Canadian cities. 
Prostitutes gather for a time in one given area until a group of 
concerned citizens pushes them away. Except they do not really go 
away, they simply move to the other side of the tracks or another 
part of town.
<P>
	While Bill C-27 goes in the right direction in this matter and 
respects some of the wishes of the grassroots, it again, in the 
typical pattern I have pointed out, does not go far enough. Like 
most Liberal bills, stricter penalties are frowned on. Sadly this is 
what communities really want.
<P>
	In concert with helping programs, we need a climate of legal 
control so they can operate successfully. It is all a matter of balance 
and the courage to act. This bill deals with prostitution as a 
problem but it does not go far enough.
<P>
	In September 1994, I recall when New Westminster activist Neil 
Douglas put together a group of neighbours who were frustrated 
with finding used condoms and needles lying around in his 
community, not to mention the indecent acts that were happening 
right in the middle of the street. This group set up a campaign to 
stop the Johns from picking up prostitutes in their local area. They 
would set up all night vigilance in areas frequented by prostitutes in 
an effort to shame the Johns, and the campaign did work. It was 
citizen action, not certainly will the help of our legal climate, 
except for one problem. When the New Westminster group drive 
the prostitutes out of their area, the prostitutes migrate over to my 
neighbouring city Burnaby. Then a Burnaby watch group does a 
similar action, takes over and drives the prostitutes back to New 
Westminster. This is going on back and forth.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	Citizens are understandably frustrated. Unfortunately the lack of 
resources from local police and the lack of the appropriate legal 
climate makes residents take matters into their own hands. This is 
when the whole issue becomes much more serious. This is why the 
Criminal Code needs to be changed to reflect the needs of society.
<P>
	In March of this year I introduced a private member's bill, Bill 
C-248, which would make changes to section 213 of the Criminal 
Code. The way it currently stands every person who in a public 
place or any place open to public view stops or attempts to stop a 
motor vehicle, impedes the free flow of pedestrian or vehicular 
traffic or stops any person for the purposes to communicate to 
engage in prostitution is guilty of an offence punishable on 
summary conviction.
<P>
	Since my community is plagued with this problem, I went to it to 
ask for possible solutions. One that came up time after time was to 
stiffen the penalty. I proposed that in my private member's bill. It 
would make the penalty for communicating an indictable offence 
liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or guilty 
of an offence punishable on summary conviction.
<P>
	This would allow the judge greater freedom from the current 
penalty of simply applying a summary conviction offence. It makes 
the offences electable and permits greater latitude for police 
discretion to arrest and to identify.
<P>
	In March 1995 a consultation paper was prepared by the working 
group on prostitution, a group established in 1992 by the federal, 
provincial and territorial deputy ministers responsible for justice. 
The report suggested exactly what I proposed in Bill C-248 and 
suggested making section 213 of the Criminal Code a dual 
procedure or hybrid offence.
<P>
	I want to read what the committee said for the reasons for such a 
suggestion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This option would give the crown the choice of proceeding by way of 
summary conviction or on indictment if prostitutes or their customers were 
arrested under section 213. It would provide a higher maximum penalty if the 
crown chose to proceed by indictment and would also allow fingerprints and 
photographs to be taken upon arrest. Being able to take fingerprints upon arrest 
would help the police and the courts enforce the legislation by minimizing the 
use of false identity especially by repeat offenders.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Prostitutes, particularly youths and runaways who could be identified, could 
be assisted in leaving the sex trade. This option might help programs for 
deterring street prostitution when those programs depend on knowing the 
identities of people in the sex trade.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	On November 27, 1989 Superintendent Jim Clark of the morality 
bureau of Metropolitan Toronto Police testified at a House of 
Commons justice standing committee: ``Being able to fingerprint 
and photograph suspects would help police locate out of town 
runaways age 13 to 15 who are engaged in prostitution and to clear  
the large backlog of outstanding arrest warrants against prostitutes 
who have been able to use false identities with impunity''.

	<B>Mr. Tony Ianno (Trinity-Spadina, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
week across the country Canadians of Portuguese origin have 
hosted Portugal Week, a festival of celebration and cheer.
<P>
	The highlight of this week is today, June 10, the Portuguese 
National Day, a celebration of many accomplishments of the 
Portuguese-Canadian community. This day has historic 
significance as well, for it is the anniversary of the death of the 
great Portuguese poet Luis Vaz de Camoes.
<P>
	In my riding of Trinity-Spadina this week's festivities are 
organized by the Alliance of Portuguese Clubs and Associations of 
Ontario. Among the events scheduled are a soccer tournament, an 
art exhibit, a parade, as well as numerous concerts featuring 
internationally recognized Portuguese entertainers.
<P>
	I salute Canadians of Portuguese origin in my riding for their 
contribution to the cultural life of Toronto and Canada during this

<P>
	This $6 million investment seeks to promote research in the

pollution-free energy.

the project, who is also the director of the institute, Tapan K. Bose.

message to the Senate requesting that the chair of the Senate board 
of internal economy appear before the Standing Committee on 
Government Operations to account for Senate expenses. We have 
heard nothing from the Senate.
<P>
	How can an unelected, unaccountable public institution not 
justify its expenses to the public? It is simply unacceptable. If $40 
million cannot be justified, members should reduce spending to 
more reasonable levels. A $10 million reduction to bring spending 
down to $30 million may be more appropriate.
<P>
	Canadians simply cannot continue to write a blank cheque for 
the Senate. It is time for the Senate to respect modern democratic 
principles of accountability and justify its spending to taxpayers.

<P>
	Mr. Allen made a tremendous contribution to his community and 
to aboriginal people throughout Canada. He served as chair of the 
Council for Yukon Indians from 1975 to 1985. He was also the 
former northern regional vice-chief of the Assembly of First 
Nations where with great integrity he served aboriginal peoples 
across this country. In August 1995 he was elected Grand Chief of 
the Council of Yukon First Nations.
<P>
	He was a member of the Champagne Aishiak Band. His 
traditional home was Klukshu. He was a great leader to all of us in 
the Yukon and across this country.

<P>
	As residents of Scarborough, we are very proud of our heritage 
and our city. Scarborough's roots date back to the late 1700s. In 
1793 Elizabeth Simcoe, wife of the first Lieutenant Governor of 
Upper Canada, named Scarborough after the town of the same 
name in England. Six years later in 1799, David and Mary 
Thomson became the first European settlers in Scarborough. Today 
in 1996, we are a diverse and dynamic community of more than 
half a million people.
<P>
	Bicentennial celebrations have been under way in Scarborough 
since January and will continue through to December. In fact, June 
10 to June 16 has officially been declared Scarborough Week.
<P>
	The city of Scarborough has made an invaluable contribution to 
the social, economic, political and cultural development of our 
country. Today Scarborough is the sum of its citizens and the fruits 
of a rich history spanning 200 years.

member for Brome-Missisquoi said, in reference to the 
unemployment insurance reform, that the number of employees 
who will remain at the Cowansville employment centre was 
determined by taking into account the size of the area served, as 
opposed to the size of the population, which is the usual criterion.
<P>
	Why is it that, with a population twice that of the Cowansville 
region, the employment centre in Granby will have proportionally 
only half the number of employees to serve its taxpayers?
<P>
	I would like the Minister of Human Resources Development to 
explain to the people in the riding of Shefford how he determined 
the number of employees remaining at the Cowansville 
employment centre, compared to that of Granby.
<P>
	I would like the minister to explain to the people in the riding of 
Shefford why he violated the principles of fairness toward 
taxpayers by sacrificing the Granby employment centre for the one 
in Cowansville. Is it because the member for Brome-Missisquoi 
happens to be a Liberal like him?

Canadians are the ever increasing cost of gasoline and the high 
interest rates on credit cards. On numerous occasions I have stood 
in this House urging the government to intervene on behalf of the 
millions of Canadians who are being ripped off by the banking 
institutions and oil companies.
<P>
	While I reject the explanation given by oil companies to justify 
their blatant price gouging of Canadians, I cannot understand why 
this government will not put its foot down. While Ontarians are 
angry for having to pay 60 cents a litre, Quebecers should be livid 
for having to pay 67 cents a litre.
<P>
	What Canadians want is not another inquiry but a permanent 
commission established with the mandate to investigate price 
gouging and the power to roll back prices. If this government is 
really interested in giving Canadians a break at the gas pumps, then 
I suggest a business partnership with the government of Iraq. Its oil 
could be exchanged for our food for the thousands of innocent 
children-

	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was pleased to learn over the weekend about the third 
party's new-found belief in equality for Canadians. For Reformers, 
these are fine words but they require action. So let us look at some 
of the actions of Reformers.
<P>
	Within minutes of approving a resolution in favour of equality, 
Reformers applauded a member of Parliament who said his views 
about sending minority workers to the back of the shop were 
consistent with the resolution. What kind of equality is that?
<P>
	At the same assembly, members spoke in favour of abolishing 
the charter of rights or amending it. Now, that is equality. The only 
reason the third party chose amending rather than abolishing it is of 
course political expediency. Most voters in Canada support the 
charter of rights and freedoms as a way of protecting rights for all 
Canadians.
<P>
	Reformers speak of national unity and are critical of separatists, 
but they in turn want to emasculate the federal government.
<P>
	I think it is time for the Reform Party to go back to school.

	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Reform tried to put on a new face this weekend but it is 
more like new make-up over an old face. Canadians will not be 
fooled. Reformers' vision of a new Canada for the 21st century in 
reality is a return to a Canada of the 19th century. It is an old vision 
dressed up in code language.
<P>
	Reformers talk about maintaining our health care system, but 
they plan a two tier system. They focus on personalizing social 
programs, but that is just code language for dismantling them and 
returning to a survival of the fittest society. For them equality is a 
question of using the right language and avoiding attack by the 
media. Reform equality is equality of the jungle.
<P>
	Eliminating the GST means incorporating it into a new FST. 
Reformers are proposing tax cuts. It sounds attractive and that is 
why they are doing it. They have not told Canadians how they plan 
to eliminate the deficit, cut taxes, create jobs and install a flat tax

intention of intervening in support of Mr. Libman and indicate the 
reason for its intervention?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is premature for us to take a 
position on that question. Naturally, any time the constitutionality 
of legislation is an issue, it is a matter of interest.
<P>
	At this point, although leave has been granted to the appellant, 
the court has yet to formulate the constitutional questions it will be 
considering. When those questions have been formulated by the 
court, we will examine them and determine whether there is any 
way the Attorney General of Canada can assist the court in dealing 
with the constitutional issues that arise.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, will the Minister of Justice confirm that his real intention, 
in intervening in the Libman case, because we know he would like 
to, is to come to the defence of those Liberal members and 
members of his organization who are accused by the Directeur 
général des élections du Québec of spending illegally in support of 
the great rally in Montreal for the no side during the Quebec 
referendum campaign?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, no, that is not the point. We have 
been monitoring this case and its progress in the courts since long 
before that issue arose. Our interest is in the attention the Supreme 
Court of Canada, the highest court in the country, will pay to 
questions of constitutionality.
<P>
	I stress for the hon. member and for the House that we have 
made no decision on the question of whether to intervene. Our 
decision will only be made after the court has formulated the 
relevant questions and after we have had an opportunity to examine 
them in relation to the issues that the court will consider.

[<I>Translation</I>]

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, how does the Minister of Justice explain the fact that, 
after the government's attempt to change the rules of democracy in 
Quebec, after its alliance with Guy Bertrand to prevent Quebecers 
from voting again on their future, after expressing its intention to 
decide the referendum question, the government now wants to join 
with Robert Libman in attacking the Quebec Referendum Act, a 
tool Quebec of democracy has given itself, which it does not want 
affected by the federal government's intervention?
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I would first point out that no 
decision has been made regarding Mr. Libman's case. As I said, we 
are currently waiting to hear how the questions will be put by the 
Supreme Court of Canada.
<P>
	As regards Mr. Bertrand's case, I would also like to say that we 
are not involved in this case because we want to support Mr. 
Bertrand. We intervened because of the position taken by the 
attorney general of Quebec. When he said clearly that the process 
of Quebec's move to sovereignty was beyond the sway of both the 
Constitution and the courts of Canada, the Attorney General of 
Canada had to get involved to counter this statement. It is not true.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the Libman case, it is not even the Constitution that is 
involved, it is the Quebec referendum legislation. What the 
Minister of Justice is telling us is pretty unbelievable.
<P>
	I am asking the Prime Minister whether he is aware that for 
months his government, he and his Minister of Justice, have been 
killing themselves to bring up the constitutional question at every 
possible occasion, so as to go at Quebec democracy hammer and 
tongs at every opportunity, and to constantly assail Quebecers' 
democratic progress toward sovereignty.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the only thing we want is to see democracy respected in 
Canada. There have been two referenda, and Canada won both 
times. We are not interested in seeing this continued. It is the Bloc 
Quebecois and the Quebec separatists who want to see it continued, 
while most of the people of Quebec and of Canada have had

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the Prime Minister does not wish to continue, I must say 
he is experiencing difficulty in restraining himself, since in the 
Bertrand case and in the Libman case, finding allies in Quebec 
takes some doing.
<P>
	Could the Prime Minister admit that, when it comes down to it, 
the reason for his wishing to intervene in the Libman case is that he 
wants to see more than one pro-federalist referendum committee 
created, maybe because he no longer trusts his Quebec federalist 
allies such as Daniel Johnson, and because he wants to see no more 
barriers restricting the number of millions his financial allies, some 
of them with family trusts behind them, are prepared to pour into 
Quebec, as they did in the last referendum with the Montreal rally?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there are all kinds of accusations within this question 
which are not factual. We have respected all of the laws involved. I 
believe that the fact that some Canadians decided to travel to 
Montreal in this the freest  country in the world, a country which 
allows separatist MPs within the Parliament of Canada, that MPs 
and other citizens of Canada wanted to go to tell Quebecers that 
they must remain in Canada, shows a respect for freedom of 
speech, which is entrenched in Canada's Charter of rights.
<P>

<P>

	The first charter respecting the right of all citizens to freedom of

Canadians concerning the future of their country.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
weekend thousands of passionate grassroots Canadians rallied to 
demand some action on Canadian unity. They want the federal 
government to drive the unity issue to resolution now before there 
is another crisis and they want and deserve more than lip service 
from the Prime Minister.
<P>
	What Canadians expect from the government are some signs of 
willingness to change, even if it breaks their Liberal hearts to have 
a smaller federal role in a decentralized but unified country. People 
realize that the status quo is not working and they want to see a 
fresh start.
<P>
	After last year's referendum, the Prime Minister struck a cabinet 
committee to come up with the answers on national unity. Is this 
national unity committee still meeting? When can we expect to see 
the report for the Canadian people?
<P>
<B>(1425 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am happy to see that at long last, the Reform Party is 
interested in the future of Canada. When I stood in the House and 
told everyone that it was not possible to break up a country with a 
one-vote majority, I well remember the members of the Reform 
Party sided with the Bloc Quebecois on that issue.
<P>
	I hope the Reform Party wakes up some day and reads the speech 
from the throne in which the program for national unity was very 
well stated. A big part of it will be completed after the meeting of 
the first ministers Thursday and Friday of next week.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government has done nothing to reassure Canadians that it has the 
solutions to keep this great country together.
<P>
	It has touted the national unity dream team but half of that team 
is benched and the other half is silent. It stated that distinct society 
status would solve the problem but it has been rejected time and 
time again. Now, according to  the polls, apparently more 
Quebecers than ever feel that Quebec may separate. The 
government has no plan and no team. The 10,000 patriots who were 
here on the weekend have begged the Prime Minister to finally 
show some leadership.
<P>
	The unity minister said that we will have anarchy if the 
separatists win another referendum.
<P>
	What is the government's plan to prevent that from happening 
and when will it announce it so that Canadians can have some 
reassurance that the government has a handle on the national unity 
situation?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, all the people who came to the Hill yesterday would be 
very delighted to know that the Reform Party supports bilingualism 
in Canada. The people who came yesterday were from Montreal, 
Quebec, Pontiac and so on. Many of them were anglophones from 
Quebec who are in favour of the bilingualism policy of Canada 
which the Reform Party has always rejected.
<P>
	A moment ago, the hon. member referred to distinct society. 
Again the contribution of the Reform Party was to vote against 
distinct society. I hope that some day the Reform Party will wake 
up. However, if we waited to have the support of the Reform Party 
in order to solve this Canadian problem we would have no solution. 
I guess we will have to solve the problem despite the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
only we had some plan from the Prime Minister. The government is 
so far behind on this issue that it thinks it is first, but it has been 
lapped by the Canadian people.
<P>
	The truth is that the government is navel gazing over distinct 
society and constitutional vetoes, ideas that went out of favour 30 
years ago. Canadians know that the realignment of 
federal-provincial power is a major consideration that will help to 
bind the country together. Quebecers are not the problem. The 
regions are not the problem. Ottawa's government is the problem.
<P>
	Since the provinces refused to meet with the Prime Minister to 
discuss constitutional change, will the federal government move 
now and promise to give back to the provinces those areas of 
jurisdiction which the Constitution states are theirs to administer?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member has a copy of the speech from the throne 
on his desk. Everything he has asked can be found in it.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development, for example, 
has moved on the labour management situation. We made 
propositions to the provinces in many fields in the speech from the 
throne. We hope to rebalance the federation. We want to clarify 
jurisdictions. We want to eliminate duplication. However, the

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of National Revenue would like us to believe 
that, by suspending the issuance of new advanced tax rulings 
similar to the case of the $2 billion in family trusts transferred to 
the U.S. tax free, she was closing the gaping tax loophole 
denounced by the auditor general. Nothing could be further from 
the truth. The ruling made by Revenue Canada in December 1991 
is still in effect and constitutes a precedent that anyone can use to 
avoid paying taxes.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister 
admit that his revenue minister's inaction and his government's 
refusal to investigate this scandal leaves wide open a loophole that 
can still be used by owners of family trusts or by any millionaire?

finance for advice and for information to come back to the minister 
for his consideration.
<P>
	This is nuts because quite frankly the committee is doing a very 
expeditious job hearing witnesses from across the country on this 
very important aspect of the Income Tax Act and we do look

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr.

That is why it is trying to sidestep the issue at the Standing 
Committee on Finance. That is what is happening.

	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	On March 27 the minister stated that employment insurance 
premium surpluses must have an upper limit. The surplus is now 
estimated to be $5 billion for this year alone. A majority of 
Canadian pension fund managers recently stated that the primary 
reason job creation in our country is stagnant is due to payroll 
taxes.
<P>
	Will the minister tell the Canadian people when enough is 
enough and when the job destroying employment insurance payroll 
tax will be reduced?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Finance and 
myself have said on a number of occasions that we are aware that 
through a series of events we are now moving to a surplus position 
in the EI account.
<P>
	My hon. friend would know that a year ago, two years ago, three 
years ago quite the opposite was the situation. The last thing that 
the hon. member would want is to have a repeat situation of when 
we were in a recession with very high levels of unemployment and 
we were then faced with increases in the rate for premiums.
<P>
	We are trying to make sure that we can set a level for a surplus in 
the EI fund that is consistent with the historical trends in that fund. 
We will be paying close attention to it.
<P>
	I am sure that we will be able to satisfy the hon. member's 
concern about making sure that we have a sufficient reserve in the 
fund but also be able to address the whole question of payroll taxes, 
including premiums for employment insurance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> In that 
case, Mr. Speaker, I take it that the minister would work toward 
making the EI fund self-sustaining and actuarially sound. Had it 
been actuarially sound previously we would not have to dip in so 
deep this time. That is the major problem with the EI program. It 
should be insurance.
<P>
	The minister knows that chronic high unemployment and under 
employment of Canada's youth is really a national disgrace. It robs 
youth of self-respect, hope and a stake in our common good and our 
common future.
<P>
	If payroll taxes such as employment insurance and Canada 
pension fund premiums affect the lowest paid and the most 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3560"> 3560 </A></B>
<P>
vulnerable first and most, why does the government continue to put 
such a high reliance on job destroying payroll taxes to generate 
revenue?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is difficult to have it both 
ways. If the employment insurance fund is to be self-sustaining, 
which in fact it is, because when it falls into deficit the government 
is required to cover that deficit. The government and the taxpayers 
are repaid as the employment insurance fund recovers. That has 
been the case over the last year where the deficit was finally 
cleaned up and now we are moving to a surplus position.
<P>
<B>(1435 )</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, neither actuaries, governments, the private sector 
nor labour, for that matter, can predict exactly the requirements of 
the employment insurance fund. It depends on the situation that 
prevails in the economy at any given time.
<P>
	The only thing we can do is try to be prudent. I understand the 
hon. member's point with respect to the surplus. We have to be 
careful not to let it increase beyond reasonable proportions.
<P>
	As I indicated in my answer to his first question, I do not think 
the hon. member or anyone else would like to see us go back to a 
situation where in a recession, in addition to having a major drain 
on the employment insurance fund, the government would have to 
increase the premiums to try to reduce that deficit position.
<P>
	It is always difficult to find a balance but as usual we will try to 
do the best we can.

Liberal government is doing in the matter of family trusts is 
outrageous, going as far as muzzling the public accounts

can avoid paying taxes. All the while, the key players in this matter 
are still holding positions in the public service.
<P>
	While hundreds of millions of dollars are at stake and the public

	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr.

<P>
	On receipt of the report of the auditor general we acted that 
very day and sent his concerns to the committees of this 
Parliament, committees made up of members of this House that 
represent Canadians, to look at very important aspects of the 
Income Tax Act.
<P>
	It is my understanding that the finance committee will review 
those aspects of the Income Tax Act. I understand it has been 
agreed at the public accounts committee to begin to review other 
aspects, sure to be required, on return from the summer recess.

	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans,

confirmed the auditor general's statement and that the Minister of 
Revenue failed to introduce effective measures, why is the

looking at squeezing one group more than another. The whole idea

mandatory RRSPs. That would be the big squeeze.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it seems the

The budget says that on top of normal taxation middle income

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it has 
been revealed the immigration minister granted more than 1,500 
special entry permits to dangerous criminals last year. Rapists, 
suspected terrorists, murderers and drunk drivers who were 
initially denied entry into Canada or who were ordered deported 
now live here with the minister's personal blessing.
<P>
	Front line immigration officers advised against admitting 
criminals into Canada and the previous immigration minister 
refused to listen.
<P>
	What assurances will the minister give to Canadians that there 
will not be repeat violations of the act and that criminals will be 
shut out of the country?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration and Acting Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as you know, this is not a new question, because each 
year the citizenship and immigration minister must table an annual 
report here in the House regarding ministerial permits issued.
<P>
	I would like to point out that, since 1990, there was a 73 per cent 
drop in the number of ministerial permits issued by various 
immigration officials and that they are issued only after a very 
serious case study has been carried out, and for various reasons.
<P>
	For example, it can be for strictly technical reasons, medical 
reasons, or because an individual has committed a reprehensible 
act several years earlier, but we are confident the person will not do 
so in Canada. In short, with each passing year, we have become 
more restrictive, and it is very clear that each time a decision is 
made, it is for humanitarian reasons.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians want input into immigration policy. Instead they get 
another minister with her head buried in the sand and an 
immigration policy designed and driven by special interests.
<P>
	In addition to the 1,500 special entry passes granted to criminals, 
44 permits were issued to people previously deported, 10 more 
were given to individuals suspected of terrorism and another 395 
passes were granted to those who posed a health risk to others.
<P>
	By issuing the permits, the minister has violated section 19 of 
the Immigration Act. Why did the minister violate the Immigration 
Act, thereby compromising the internal security and the public 
health of Canadians?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration and Acting Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, again, I repeat, these permits are issued on a 
temporary basis for humanitarian reasons. I wonder who is burying 
its head in the sand, when members of the Reform Party are writing 
almost weekly requesting that people be admitted.
<P>
	I have examples here. The member for Beaver River and the 
member for Okanagan are asking us to admit to Canada people not 
eligible under our legislation. But in Canada, we are very humane, 
very welcoming, contrary to what the Reform member is saying.

	<B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville-Milton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	In response to a request from the Standing Committee on 
Industry, the Canadian Bankers Association has now provided a 
report on the relationship between the banks and small and medium 
size enterprises.
<P>
	How will this report assist our government to make sure small 
businesses have the financial services they need in order to 
flourish, to grow and to create new jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, since the time of the election the government has 
identified small and medium size businesses as the sector of the 
economy where most of the potential job growth lies. It has been 
very important to deal with the issues the small business 
community has been bringing to us. I suppose at the top of that list 
would be access to financing.
<P>
<B>(1455)</B>
<P>
	Repeatedly we have heard it needs access to financing not only 
from governments but particularly from Canada's chartered banks. 
The industry committee asked for the Canadian Bankers 
Association to come forward with a baseline study which will 
enable us to understand exactly what that relationship looks like 
today and begin to pursue the policies that will ensure that in the 
future the small and medium size businesses of Canada have the 
level of capital they need, both debt and equity, in order to create 
the jobs Canadians are looking for.

	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of the Environment.
<P>
	The second attempt at refloating the <I>Irving Whale</I> has now 
begun. It is essential, in case a spill occurs, that the company have 
adequate insurance to cover the cost of environmental damage. But 
on page 43 of the last environmental assessment report, dated 
March 1996, one reads that, as of now, the company's insurance 
policy does not cover PCBs.
<P>
	Can the minister certify that insurance contracts have been 
revised and now cover PCBs. If so, can the minister table these 
contracts in the House as soon as possible to reassure the public?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canadian public opinion overwhelmingly has requested 
the <I>Irving Whale</I> be lifted because it proposes the lesser of the 
various risk options. It must be said that no option is without its 
risks.
<P>
	The province of Quebec and its minister of the environment have 
given a green light to the raising of the <I>Irving Whale</I>. There have 
been four careful technical assessments done incorporating public 
participation throughout. This morning the court has allowed and 
approved the raising of the <I>Irving Whale</I>.
<P>
	We are taking every precaution possible. I ask for the support of 
the hon. member's party.

	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, nets will be set 
in protest on Wednesday morning if the minister does not act to end 
the racially segregated fishery in the Alberni Inlet. The minister 
should not be surprised at further protests from fishermen if he is 
planning similar fisheries on the Fraser River later this summer.
<P>
	Will the minister not recognize that racially segregated fisheries 
can only lead to confrontation and deep six the policy?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
will be aware that the Federal Court of Canada last week indicated 
the fisheries complained of do not represent any harm to 
commercial fisheries. The hon. member will be aware of that 
because an injunction was refused to him.
<P>
	The fisheries in question are part of the aboriginal fisheries 
strategy which is enjoined upon the Government of Canada by 
section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.
<P>
	The catch allocation is modest, less than 10 per cent of the 
expected returns, and under the terms of the agreement all net 
profits from any fish sold are to be used for fisheries management 
projects jointly agreed to by the department and by the First 
Nations.

question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Women from every province and territory are marching against 
poverty and are demanding in one strong voice that the Liberal 
government keep its promise of a national child care program.
<P>
	This weekend we saw the federal funds for child care cut by over 
100 per cent from the original commitment. The Minister of 
Finance has said he will not raise corporate taxes to help pay for 
programs such as child care.
<P>
	Why has the government made it a priority to please 
corporations rather than look to the welfare of Canada's children?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we had a program and we submitted a proposal to the 
provinces. It was very clear that it was to be a cost shared program. 
We discussed it with the provinces, but the provinces were not 
interested in participating in an expanded program for child care.
<P>
	As it is within provincial authority, and it was written that it had 
to be a joint program, and as the provinces did not want to move on 
it, we respected their jurisdiction and we did not move. We 
respected the constitutional responsibilities of the provinces as 
well as the national responsibilities.

	On June 7 the federal government hosted a forum to discuss 
world hunger and food security with groups from across Canada.

<P>
	Canada is now in the process of putting together a position paper 
to represent the views of Canadians. On June 7 representatives of 
the agricultural, forestry and fisheries sectors were involved in 
consultations on that paper together with representatives of the 
provinces.

Treasury Board's official languages report shows that anglophones 
hold 5 per cent of federal government jobs in Quebec. The report 
concludes that this number remains unsatisfactory.
<P>
	The Canadian heritage report says nothing about this situation 
and reveals the government accepts a French only policy in Quebec 
which discriminates against the English community while 
practising enforced bilingualism in the rest of Canada.
<P>
	What will the heritage minister do to increase the representation 
of Quebec anglophones in federal government jobs within that 
province?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration and Acting Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I think the jurisdictions of the various levels of 
government should not be confused. This government's 
responsibility is to help minorities of either official language 
throughout Canada. Consequently, we give substantial help to the 
French speaking population living in a minority situation, and to 
the English speaking population in Quebec.
<P>
	But employment practices at the provincial level are strictly a 
provincial matter and are not within the purview of the 
Government of Canada.

	He said: Madam Speaker, as was said, this bill is an act 
respecting the establishment and award of a Canadian volunteer 
service medal and clasp for United Nations peacekeeping to 
Canadians serving with a United Nations peacekeeping force.
<P>
	This bill is introduced to correct a present oversight. The United 
Nations now issues medals to Canadians who serve on 
peacekeeping activities. Some time later, the Governor General 
declares that United Nations medal to be a Canadian medal.

	However, many of our peacekeepers do not accept this as 
appropriate Canadian recognition, and desire that such service be 
properly recognized by the award of a purely Canadian volunteer 
service medal for peacekeeping.

recognition of the great honour that was bestowed on Canada by 
our peacekeepers when they won the Nobel peace award on

	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
Question No. 19 will be answered today.
<P>
[<I>Text</I>] 
<P>
Question No. 19-<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the past five years, has there existed-within the Privy Council, the 
Department of the Solicitor General of Canada, or elsewhere in the federal 
government-an emergency measures co-ordinating unit; if so, who and what 
are its past and present members, budget, meeting dates, and subjects of 
discussion at each meeting; has this unit drawn up plans for emergency 
situations or not and, if so, what are those plans?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Under the provisions of the Emergency 
Preparedness Act (1988), all ministers of the crown are assigned 
responsibility for emergency preparedness within their functional 
areas. All departments of the federal government have an 
emergency preparedness capability as required by the Emergencies 
Act, also passed in 1988. Overall co-ordination is vested in the 
minister responsible for emergency preparedness (MREP), the 
Minister of  National Defence. Emergency Preparedness Canada 
(EPC) is that element of the public service charged with 
implementing the minister's responsibilities in this regard.
<P>
	EPC has been in existence in one form or another since 1939. 
Most recently, and prior to 1992, EPC was identified by the 
Emergency Preparedness Act as a separate branch of government 
with its head, the executive director, reporting directly to the 
MREP. Following the 1992 budget, the Emergency Preparedness 
Act was amended to make EPC part of the Department of National 
Defence and it is now a division within the deputy chief of defence 
staff (DCDS) group in national defence headquarters.
<P>
	EPC administers the Emergencies Act. That legislation sets out 
the types of emergency for which the agency has co-ordinating 
responsibility within the federal government as well as the roles of 
cabinet and Parliament. The emergencies defined in the act are: 
public emergency; public order emergency; international 
emergency; and, war emergency. The legislation therefore covers a 
range of situations from, for example, flood relief to war and it is 
the responsibility of EPC to ensure that planning for the range of 
possible emergencies has been undertaken. Consequently, it works 
closely with federal departments and agencies as well as with 
provincial authorities.
<P>
	EPC executes its co-ordination role in a number of ways 
including direct liaison with other government departments and 
through a number of interdepartmental committees. The senior 
committee is the Emergency Preparedness Advisory Committee 
(EPAC), chaired by the DCDS, with membership at the assistant 
deputy minister level. The EPAC oversees the annual program of 
work of the federal emergency preparedness community; provides 
guidance; and advises the MREP as necessary.
<P>
	EPC is a small organization of 89 full time employees (FTEs) 
and an annual budget of approximately $15.5M (96/97). In addition 
to its headquarters in Ottawa, EPC administers the Canadian 
Emergency Preparedness College in Arnprior, Ontario and 
maintains small regional offices in each provincial capital to 
provide liaison with counterpart provincial emergency measures 
organizations.
<P>
	In amplification of Emergency Preparedness Act, ``a federal 
policy emergencies'', revised in 1995, provides detailed taskings to 
the legislated ministerial responsibilities for emergency 
preparedness and, where appropriate, designates individual federal 
ministers as the ``lead'' for planning for specific types of 
emergency. Examples of such lead roles include, the Solicitor 
General for the national counterterrorism plan (NCTP); Health 
Canada for the federal nuclear emergency response plan (FNERP); 
and Emergency Preparedness Canada for the national earthquake 
support plan  (NESP). There is a broad spectrum of federal 
emergency plans; 
<P>

<B><A NAME="3569"> 3569 </A></B>
<P>
some narrow and sectoral in scope; and others such as those 
exemplified above, of a broad, multi-sectoral nature. EPC 
maintains a co-ordinated listing of all such plans and, in the case of 
the latter, co-ordinates the development of periodic exercises to test 
and evaluate their effectiveness.
<P>
	To elaborate on the NCTP, the Solicitor General is the lead 
minister for dealing with the management of terrorist incidents in 
Canada. As the minister responsible for the RCMP and the 
Canadian Security Intelligence Service, his secretariat maintains 
the NCTP. That plan sets out how the government will respond to 
an incident with respect to, for instance, operational management 
of the incident, communications, and the role of local and 
provincial governments. Those who administer the plan are 
responsible for ensuring that the government response to a terrorist 
incident is co-ordinated and coherent.
<P>
	In addition to co-ordination units with a national focus, the 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade maintains a 
capacity to respond to incidents abroad involving Canadians or 
Canadian interests.

	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
if Question No. 2 could be made an Order for Return, this return 
would be tabled immediately.

Question No. 2-<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For each of the last five calendar years, how many claims have been made by 
federal prisoners against the Government of Canada for injuries or damages 
suffered while the prisoners were under the government's care in federal 
penitentiaries, (<I>a</I>) how many of these claims have been settled, withdrawn or are 
still pending, and (<I>b</I>) what is the amount of the initial claim and the amount of 
the settlement in each case that has been settled?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Return tabled.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> I rise on a point of 
order, Madam Speaker. I would like to draw your attention for the 
third time to the fact that, on March 11, that is three months ago, I 
put four questions on the Order Paper, Questions Nos. 20, 21, 22 
and 23, and requested, pursuant to the Standing Orders, that these 
questions be answered within 45 days. That will be three months 
ago tomorrow.
<P>
	These questions deal with the transfer of the human resources 
development department's regional management centre from 
Trois-Rivières to Shawinigan. These questions were put in the 
public interest, in the interest of the constituents of Trois-Rivières 
and the whole region.
<P>
	These questions come from a member of Parliament who, 
according to our rules, has the right to question the executive 
branch of government, who, in turn, has the responsibility to 
answer these kinds of questions asked in the public interest.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	I therefore count on you, Madam Speaker, to make the necessary 
representations with the executive so these questions get a proper, 
honest and quick answer.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-27, 
an act to amend the Criminal Code (child prostitution, child sex 
tourism, criminal harassment and female genital mutilation) be 
read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre):</B> Madam Speaker, on 
a point of order. I think there would be unanimous agreement to 
allow me to speak in place of the hon. member for New 
Westminster-Burnaby. He would resume his remarks after.
<P>
	There are international visitors in town today and I would like to 
make a presentation on this bill, which we are sponsoring. The 
courtesy of the hon. member and of other members has been 
agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Is there 
unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, let me again repeat my appreciation especially to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3570"> 3570 </A></B>
<P>
the hon. member for New Westminster-Burnaby and other 
members of the House in allowing me to speak on the importance 
of the bill. I want to speak in particular to the amendments under 
Bill  C-27 that relate to the sexual exploitation of children abroad.
<P>
	Members will recall that during the throne speech we made a 
commitment as a government to work toward international 
consensus dealing with the exploitation of children in the whole 
area of labour, standards and rights.
<P>
	One of the most tragic and vicious aspects of that whole problem 
is there has been a burgeoning and growing sex industry of tourism 
being sponsored abroad in which tourism operators and others 
organize various initiatives and ventures in which people will leave 
their home country and go to foreign countries to sexually exploit 
or molest young children.
<P>
	This has been a matter of deep concern since we had the 
convention on the rights of the child. I believe about 185 countries 
have specifically ratified the convention, but as yet there has not 
been an attempt to find a full fledged international answer to the 
problem.
<P>
	Instead what has taken place is that a number of individual 
countries have now taken the initiative to extend the opportunity of 
their own legal system where there is consent by the country 
involved to take legal action against residents or citizens of their 
own country in this kind of transgression.
<P>
	I am convinced the amendments brought forward today are one 
of the strongest signals we can send internationally to expose the 
full force of the Canadian criminal law with our own citizens in 
order to specifically prohibit the use of children for sexual 
purposes.
<P>
	There has been overwhelming evidence these kind of offences 
are growing in number. It has been documented by national 
revenue that Canadian citizens go abroad to take advantage of 
children in other countries. The Sri Lanka and Philippine 
governments have reported arrests of Canadian residents in relation 
to such offences. During foreign investigations Canadians have 
been identified as being members of international pedophile 
networks. As a result we think it is very important that Canada take 
some responsibility for these kinds of actions.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Passing legislation that makes sexual tourism involving children 
a criminal act sends a clear message that this activity is neither 
tolerable nor acceptable.
<P>
	Canada is not alone in its efforts. In fact, the international 
community is united in supporting the passing of such legislation.
<P>
	There are important precedents. I am thinking here of the United 
Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Canada has 
ratified; I am thinking of the work started by the international 
community, such as that initiated by the Human Rights 
Commission; and, finally, I am thinking of some 10 nations that 
have already passed such legislation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	One of the questions that has emerged by certain critics or 
commentaries is can such things work. Clearly we are breaking 
some new ground.
<P>
	Other countries such as Australia and New Zealand now have 
this law on the books, as does the United States and several 
European countries. By use of modern technologies such as video 
conferencing and taping it is possible to take evidence abroad and 
use it within our courts with minimum difficulty. What we 
discovered is that there already have been some prosecutions.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	What is important is the deterrent effect it has, knowing there is 
a law on the books, a possibility to prosecute. In many countries of 
a developing nature there is not the same effective force of a legal 
system as we have providing a strong and effective message that 
they should not do it, they cannot do it and they will be punished if 
they do it. The legislation not only gives children that kind of 
protection but provides for a higher standard and level of activity.
<P>
	Canada intends to participate actively in the conference on 
commercial sexual exploitation being held in Sweden at the end of 
the summer. This international meeting will bring together for the 
first time government representatives, UN agencies, police 
enforcement officers, academic institutions, health professionals 
and representatives of the tourism industry to see whether they can 
do this on a unilateral basis, country by country, and get the support 
for an international convention adopted by all countries.
<P>
	We hope by having this legislation passed now when we go to the 
conference in Sweden we can stand up as Canadians and say we are 
part of a vanguard to take real issue, to take a real stand against one 
of the most vicious and venal kinds of exploitation, that of helpless 
children living in dire straits and in serious circumstances.
<P>
	Once again I thank the House for its courtesy and its indulgence. 
I hope this gives me an opportunity to say there is a chance for 
Canadians to show internationally that we are prepared to take real, 
specific efforts to protect children right around the world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, it is good to hear the minister make some rare 
comments on justice matters.
<P>
	It is rumoured he is one of those in cabinet who stands in the way 
of more actively tightening the Criminal Code. I am pleased now to 
hear he supports some Criminal Code activism. Even when the 
outcome is not entirely certain, we can be bold in these kinds of 
matters. That is to be encouraged.
<P>
	Related to the content of the bill before the House, the justice 
minister knows my private members' bill has been introduced. I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3571"> 3571 </A></B>
<P>
think he would agree that by  strengthening the punishment in 
section 213 of the code we would strengthen the attack on the 
sex trade.
<P>
	The minister is hesitant on the proposal. I suggest he talk to his 
colleague in cabinet, the Minister for International Trade. In 1989 
when the minister was the mayor of Toronto he appeared before the 
Standing Committee on Justice.
<P>
	For argument's sake it would be beneficial to he read the former 
mayor's comments on section 213: ``I support these changes as 
well as other recommendations our police are putting forward to 
help us once again regain control of our streets, namely that this 
offence be changed from a summary offence to a hybrid offence, 
requiring that those arrested be fingerprinted and photographed, 
which is important in dealing with runaways who can change their 
identities and their names and with others who are trying to avoid 
prosecution, and that it remain in addition to that within the 
absolute jurisdiction of a provincial court judge''.
<P>
	Certainly there is consensus with the provincial attorneys 
general that section 213 should become a hybrid offence. If the 
minister is willing, I would be more than happy to withdraw my bill 
on the condition that such an amendment would be added to Bill 
C-27 at committee stage, as it directly relates to the content of the 
bill.
<P>
	The minister and other members of the House should understand 
Reformers are not here to continuously oppose government 
legislation. Rather, we are here to offer constructive criticism and 
valid suggestions.
<P>
	I hope the minister gives my offer some serious consideration 
not only for my benefit or for his but for the benefit of Canadian 
communities like mine, New Westminster-Burnaby, and his, 
Etobicoke Centre. In other words, create the right legal climate and 
we will see positive change emerge for safer communities.
<P>
	In 1991-92 the Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics completed 
studies in Ontario and Alberta revealing what type of sentences 
were handed down to those communicating for the purposes of 
prostitution.
<P>
	In Ontario it was found that 44 per cent of charges against 
women, mainly prostitution charges, resulted in prison terms 
followed by probation at 26 per cent, fines at 22 per cent and 
absolute discharges at 8 per cent. Of the sentences imposed, the 
medium prison term was only 10 days. Of those who received 
fines, the medium fine amounted to a mere $150.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	Alternatively in Alberta, fines were the most frequent 
dispositions for communicating convictions among women, who 
were mainly prostitutes. Sixty-six per cent of charges against 
women resulted in fines, followed by prison terms at 19 per cent, 
probation at 15 per cent and absolute discharges at 2 per cent. Of 
those who were  imprisoned, the median prison term was just 30 
days. Of those who received fines, the median fine amounted to 
about $200.
<P>
	Any way we look at these statistics, it tells us that the penalties 
associated with prostitution are too weak. The sex trade flourishes. 
The Criminal Code needs to be strengthened. Reformers have been 
telling the minister this for years. It is good to see he has finally 
listened and is at least willing to deal with the subject in law rather 
than just endless study after study.
<P>
	I commend the minister for the changes he made to section 
212(4). The section now reads: ``Every person who, in any place, 
obtains or attempts to obtain for consideration the sexual services 
of a person who is under the age of 18 years or who that person 
believes is under the age of 18 years is guilty of an indictable 
offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five 
years''.
<P>
	There is a real problem with prostitutes under the age of 18 
years. The widely known Badgley committee report on sexual 
offences against children and youth done in 1984 discovered that 
approximately one-half of prostitutes interviewed entered the 
prostitution trade when they were under the age of 16. Further, 
almost 96 per cent of those interviewed said that they had become 
prostitutes before the age of 18.
<P>
	It is the ease of entry into the trade via the street that facilitates 
the young to become involved. When prostitutes are asked to 
describe street life, all they give are negative assessments. In fact I 
would guarantee that if most had their lives to live over again, 
every one of them would not choose the sex trade lifestyle.
<P>
	J. Lowman from the School of Criminology at Simon Fraser 
University found that most prostitutes would advise a young person 
not to get involved in the life. Lowman found that for many street 
prostitutes it is the fact that prostitution provides money at all that 
is the necessary condition of both their turning out and their 
remaining in the business. If this were not the case it is difficult to 
see why so many prostitutes stay in the business when they offer 
such thoroughly negative appraisals of it. It is a trap that is a wide 
open entry to life on the street. It is a downward spiral where 
alternatives to change become very hard to find.
<P>
	A local reporter in my riding did a story on prostitution a couple 
of years ago. While researching it he approached a prostitute and 
the response was: ``I am under age. Don't take my picture. Put my 
picture in your paper and my parents will sue you''. I thought that 
was rather interesting. Here she was performing an illegal act and 
she was talking about suing the reporter for wanting to take her 
picture for a story. I guess she knew the justice system better at 17 
years of age than most people will ever begin to know it in their 
lifetime.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3572"> 3572 </A></B>
<P>
	The same can be said about the Young Offenders Act. The 
11-year old who repeatedly steals cars knows full well the police 
cannot touch him until he is 12. Like the prostitutes on the street, 
the young offenders know exactly what they can get away with. 
Capacity creates its own demand.
<P>
	I want to touch on another subject in Bill C-27 and perhaps add 
some comments on the issue of the sex trade overseas. Clause 1 of 
the bill adds a new section to the Criminal Code dealing with those 
who obtain sexual services from minors outside of Canada. This is 
an abhorrent practice which must be outlawed not only in Canada 
but throughout the rest of the world. There are countries in the 
world whose laws are much more liberal or lenient than those here 
in Canada. It is in these countries that law breakers are finding their 
profits.
<P>
	The preamble to this bill states: ``Whereas, by ratifying the 
United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, Canada has 
undertaken to protect children from all forms of sexual exploitation 
and sexual abuse, and to take measures to prevent the exploitative 
use of children in prostitution or other unlawful sexual practices''.
<P>
	In Thailand with a population of 56 million, 2.8 million are said 
to be prostitutes. Incredible. Of those 2.8 million, over 800,000 are 
said to be under 16 years of age. A July 1994 report for the Good 
Shepherd Sisters, a Thailand drop-in centre, said that a great 
number of the country's five million tourists per year are travellers 
on organized sex tours from Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Australia, 
Europe and the United States. Although Canada was not included 
on that list, I find it hard to believe that such activity is not being 
orchestrated from this country as well.
<P>
	According to those who have researched this entire area of the 
sex trade, articles on child prostitution overseas regularly appear in 
pedophile newspapers. One article that appeared in the newsletter 
of the North American Man/Boy Love Association rhapsodised 
about a 12-year old Asian boy who truly loved his work. The writer 
of the article went on to say: ``Weigh the pros and cons of 
becoming involved yourself in sex tourism overseas. Seek and find 
love from American boys on a platonic, purely emotional level. For 
sexual satisfaction, travel once or twice yearly overseas. You might 
get arrested overseas for patronizing a boy prostitute. But the legal 
consequences of being caught patronizing a boy prostitute in a 
friendly place overseas will be less severe''.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	A pedophile was advised by friends to go to Asia where 
thousands of kids were there just for the picking. He attended a 
NAMBLA meeting and afterward confided to a member that he 
wanted to go to Thailand but he did not know how to set it up. He 
was told it was no problem, that he would be given a contact and he 
could  arrange everything. A few weeks later he was with one of 
those who were there for the picking.
<P>
	A convicted child molester, after his release from prison, 
enjoyed telling children in his neighbourhood that the boys he had 
hired in Thailand charged only $8 or $9. He was considering 
moving there, shortly before he disappeared, to take advantage of 
that country's ``more mature cultural attitudes''.
<P>
	Australia, Germany, Norway, Sweden and the United States all 
have laws now that allow prosecution of child sex tourists upon 
their return home. However some critics from these countries are 
sceptical that the law will be effective. One law professor from 
Australia stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The enactment of such legislation will be an important symbolic and 
polit-ical statement. However, there is real danger that, if the legislation isnot accompanied by effective enforcement measures at the national and 
international level, its promises could turn out to be rather 
hollow-.Prosecuting a sexual offence where a child has been the victim is a 
difficult enough task in any event; when it is further complicated by the 
problems of obtaining evidence in a foreign country, ensuring the willingness of 
witnesses to testify in that country where proceedings are conducted in a foreign 
language, that task becomes even more onerous. Furthermore, the reasons for 
the lack of effective enforcement of local laws in certain countries may also 
result in a lack of the close law enforcement co-operation needed to put together 
a case of this sort.</BLOCKQUOTE>
This statement has a great deal of weight and attention should be 
paid to it.
<P>
	The section of Bill C-27 dealing with child sex tourism sounds 
good but the bill itself does not outline how the government is 
going to enforce it. Perhaps someone from the government side 
will be able to explain this further in today's ensuing debate. I look 
forward to hearing their reasoning. It is the Canadian government's 
duty to make certain that it does not only follow through on 
international agreements but that it also be a leader by its actions. 
As we all know, it is actions and not words that put a stop to crime.
<P>
	Bill C-27 is a helpful bill but it is not a great bill. A great bill 
would have made changes to section 213 of the Criminal Code. 
However, the minister is well aware of my private member's bill, 
Bill C-248. I believe he realizes that to properly curb prostitution 
this section needs to be amended. He knows that changes to section 
213 would assist the police, allowing fingerprinting and easier 
search access to take place.
<P>
	This bill could have repealed section 745 or any number of other 
things.
<P>
	In summary, the bill has more to do with optics rather than 
substance. It is not just the justice minister and his Liberal 
philosophy which fall short; it is his cabinet colleagues and the 
Prime Minister who failed to give the justice minister the latitude 
he needs to bring in appropriate adjustments to the Criminal Code. 
The government's failure to legislate on criminal justice matters 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3573"> 3573 </A></B>
<P>
has to do with an old style attitude of being a system defender 
rather than a system changer.
<P>
	Canadians in general have little confidence or praise for the 
results which come from our criminal courts. Since it is largely a 
Liberal system, Canadians can understand why this government 
will never be known as the law and order group or the government 
that has the courage to govern on behalf of ordinary Canadians and 
provide safer streets.
<P>
	The bill before the House today does so little when so much 
needs to be done. I call on the minister to quickly and 
comprehensively deal with the subjects that are only lightly 
touched upon in this bill.
<P>
	I will be supporting Bill C-27. I hope my hon. friends across the 
floor will also be considerate when Reformers submit amendments 
to make this bill a better bill and more reflective of mainstream 
Canadian values.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I take part in 
this debate. First, I want to thank my colleague, the hon. member 
for Québec, for giving me the chance to speak on the matter, since 
she put forward her own motions and private member's bills on this 
issue in 1994 and 1995.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	I commend her and pay tribute to her because it is thanks to her 
work and interventions that the government was sensitized to this 
subject and finally decided to act by introducing Bill C-27 we have 
before us today.
<P>
	So, as the hon. member for Québec mentioned, the official 
opposition will support this bill because it is a step in the right 
direction, although amendments should be passed not only to 
improve its content, but also to ensure its objectives can be reached 
be more efficiently.
<P>
	I want to take a few minutes to deal with the sex tourism aspect 
of this bill. Obviously, when we think of sex tourism, we 
immediately think of the moral issue. Personally, I find it 
unacceptable that adults-mostly men, but I am told that some 
women are also into this practice-go to foreign countries where 
the economic situation is always extremely bad and take advantage 
of it-as I will demonstrate in my intervention-to sexually abuse 
children aged 10 or even younger sometimes. Again, these are boys 
as well as girls.
<P>
	This practice is obviously unacceptable. We must strongly 
denounce it without beating about the bush. Adults seeking such 
services must know that Canadians, and Quebecers of course, as 
well as their representatives do not condone those activities, and 
this is why, I am sure of it, a vast majority of the members of the 
House will support this bill.
<P>
	But beyond the moral issue, there is also an issue of economic 
rights. We must ask the following question: How is it that in these 
countries where child sex tourism is practised, the common 
characteristic is the extreme poverty of the people? Asian and 
African countries as well as South American and Central American 
countries and Indonesia all have in common an unacceptable, 
terrible economic situation where people live naturally under 
inhuman conditions. I will come back to this in order to link this 
situation to the bill before us and to measures the government 
should take in this regard.
<P>
	I would also like to raise the following issues.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	On the subject of sex tourism, I would like to explain what is 
meant by that, to say who practices that kind of tourism, why it 
exists and how, finally, we can put an end to it. Bill C-27 gives an 
answer to the last question by making sure Canadian residents and 
Canadian citizens will run the risk, with the passing of this bill, of 
being prosecuted for having taken part in sex tourism activities 
outside Canada.
<P>
	I know that the critic for the Bloc Quebecois will propose 
amendments to make sure that the bill will apply to every person in 
Canada because, according to the analysis that we, the official 
opposition, make of it, some categories of citizens could escape the 
application of the act. It could be the case of political refugees and 
citizens awaiting permanent resident status or Canadian 
citizenship. So, my colleague will move amendments.
<P>
	But let us go back to my first question: What is sexual tourism? 
As I already said, it is the practice consisting in going out of 
Canada-of course, it could also be inside Canada-to sexually 
abuse boys and girls who are generally under the age of 10. I have 
been told about children aged 6, 7 or 8, which is totally 
unacceptable according to the moral code we have in Canada, and 
also according to our Criminal Code.
<P>
	Who practices sexual tourism? I would say that no particular 
category of people can be excluded automatically. However, we 
can easily identify two categories of sexual tourists. First, there are 
men in general. I am convinced that if data were available or if we 
could make a precise study of people who practice sexual tourism, 
we would discover that the great majority are men. I do not 
challenge this in the least, but it would also seem that there are also 
a few women.
<P>
	There is another category of people that is singled out: the 
paedophiles. When we hear about paedophilia, we have a tendency 
to associate it with homosexuality. We saw it during the debate on 
Bill C-33; several members, particularly Reform members and a 
number of Liberal members, made this connection without any 
restraint to serve their political cause. Yet we know full well, and I 
think it is particularly true in the case of sex tourism, that the 
victims are, once again, mostly young girls.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3574"> 3574 </A></B>
<P>
	All the reports I have personally seen on television, heard on 
the radio or read in newspapers or trade journals lead to the 
conclusion that the victims are mostly girls.
<P>
	It does not matter whether the victim of child sexual abuse 
happens to be a boy or a girl, it is totally unacceptable in both 
cases. However, I wanted to make this distinction since it is easy, 
specially for some of our colleagues, to make this connection and 
to lead the public to believe that pedophilia is practised only by 
homosexuals when it is absolutely not the case.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	Why does sex tourism exist? It is, I think, the basic question we 
have to ask ourselves. First, I will look at it from the perspective of 
the client. It has been mentioned that people who practice that kind 
of tourism in other countries do it knowing full well that our laws 
prohibit such activities here, in Canada. The Criminal Code is very 
clear on that. People who do it outside Canada are perfectly aware 
that it is against our laws and that it is contrary to the moral 
standards adhered to in Canada. This is also true in most European 
countries.
<P>
	They do it because many of these people consider that, since 
they are in a country where the culture is different from ours, the 
moral standards are more liberal. I think of a Radio-Canada 
television report we saw a few weeks ago precisely on sex tourism.
<P>
	In that report, a French national was interviewed by a reporter 
who asked him: ``Why are you, a French citizen, fully aware of the 
fact that you could not do in your country what you are doing 
here''-they were in Dominican Republic-``taking advantage of 
young girls of 16, 15, 14 years of age and sometimes even 
younger?'' He gave a direct and very blunt answer, saying: ``Yes, I 
am perfectly aware that I could not do the same thing in my 
country, but here, usage and customs are different and we can do 
this sort of thing''.
<P>
	It is awful to see people who, I am sure, are intelligent, who are 
perfectly aware of the moral code and who would deem 
unacceptable such practices for themselves or their fellow citizens 
in their own country, thinking that this is acceptable when they are 
in Dominican Republic simply because they are abroad, and have 
concluded that customs, usage and attitudes are different.
<P>
	If I presented the case of a French citizen, it was not to chastize 
our friends in France, but because it was a French national who was 
interviewed in the report I am referring to. He could have been 
from Canada, Germany or anywhere else in the world. It is 
completely unacceptable.
<P>
	I truly believe that, before he leaves our country, such a bill will 
send the client a clear message to the effect that such practices are 
intolerable both in our country and throughout the world. We will 
not accept that, anywhere in the world, children be used for 
purposes of child sex tourism or the sex trade.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	I said at the beginning of my remarks that another problem needs 
to be identified. Even if this bill were to be passed and even if, 
overnight, we started to prosecute individuals who engage in this 
sort of activity, I am convinced that the problem will not 
automatically be resolved. It will be only partially solved. This bill 
will allow prosecution of individuals, to set an example and to send 
a message, as I said earlier, to the public, so that individuals will 
think twice before engaging in this sort of activity, and prosecution 
of organizations as well.
<P>
	When one talks about procurers, one refers to individuals whose 
commercial activities involve promoting, directing customers to 
countries where child sex tourism is possible. These people will be 
prosecuted. We shall be certainly effective to a degree, but the 
problem will be far from resolved. If in some countries, children 
are sexually abused, it is not a matter of customs or morals, it is 
essentially and basically for economic reasons.
<P>
	I can give examples. In <I>La Presse</I>, this morning, there was an 
article which mentioned that 73 million children in the world work. 
I am not saying that 73 million children are sexually abused, but 
that 73 million children are victims of what comes close to forced 
labour, slavery. Many of these children are, of course, forced to 
submit to sexual acts. Most of the countries where children work 
and where there is sexual tourism are located in Africa, Asia and 
Latin America. For example, if you compare Burkina Faso, where 
51 per cent of children work, to Italy, since it is on our list, where 
0.3 per cent of children aged 10 to 14 work, you can see there is a 
significant difference.
<P>
	The point is that even if we do adopt this bill, with which I agree 
wholeheartedly and which I will support, the Canadian government 
must realize that to solve the problem, we will have to help these 
populations and their governments, whenever possible, to improve 
their financial situation. These children could be our own, they are 
not even 14 or 15 yet, not even 10 in some cases, and more often 
than not they are homeless, with no one to turn to for help, and they 
have no choice but to do anything they can to survive and eat. This 
is the type of situation where children become slaves, work in 
shops for almost no salary at all and find themselves on the streets 
where they are easy prey for sexual tourists.
<P>
	This is what I had to say. I say yes, we must adopt this bill, but 
we must also take other measures.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to make a couple of comments on what my Bloc 
colleague just said regarding the whole problem of sexual tourism, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3575"> 3575 </A></B>
<P>
which is one of the aspects  Bill C-27 deals with. I know he is quite 
sensitive, given his responsibilities on the Standing Committee on 
Human Rights.
<P>
	We are going to vote in favour of this bill; and I see that my 
colleague agrees that it should be amended. I concur with him-I 
said it this morning already, but I would like to say it again-the 
categories of people liable to be prosecuted should be broadened to 
include all those contributing to the transportation of tourists, such 
as travel agencies promoting this kind of tourism.
<P>
	As my colleague mentioned earlier, even if we have a piece of 
legislation here, we must also discourage agencies from promoting 
sexual tourism abroad; they are a real plague.
<P>
	We were given a vivid picture of the social status and living 
conditions of these young children. They are cheated of their 
childhood, of their youth, on the pretext-I have heard this 
often-of contributing to the economy in developing countries. I 
believe there are others ways to go about it.
<P>
	Passing this bill is a step in the right direction, and I really 
appreciate it, but I would like the minister to consider certain 
amendments to give it more teeth. As I said before, this part of Bill 
C-27 deals with sexual tourism.
<P>
	I thank my colleague for speaking on this subject today, given 
that he sits on the Standing Committee on Human Rights which 
include the rights of children and their physical integrity. The Bloc 
Quebecois is deeply committed to protecting these rights, and it 
does so daily.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead): </B>Madam 
Speaker, my colleague from Quebec was absolutely right to say 
that, as my party's human rights critic, I had to intervene in this 
debate. I would like to add a few points to her comments.
<P>
	The human rights standing committee has been discussing and is 
still discussing the issue of human rights outside Canada. Canada 
being a country with a good international reputation, we have the 
responsibility to also give a clear message about human rights 
around the world.
<P>
	I had the opportunity on several occasions to condemn the 
current government's policy, particularly the one of our Prime 
Minister, who is showing laxness about human rights. More often 
than not, human rights are used as a bargaining chip in international 
trade. That is not the policy that should be followed. Of course, we 
must be open to international trade with all nations. I consider that, 
very often, boycotts are totally useless, but a clear message must 
also be sent regarding respect for human rights.
<P>
	This issue allows us to take action in that direction, first, by 
sending a clear message to our own fellow citizens, telling them we 
will not accept that they go  outside Canada to abuse young people. 
The second message is, we must be concerned about these victims, 
because, as I said earlier, we must be aware that even the best 
legislation will not be enforced perfectly. So, the best way to solve 
this problem is to ensure these people, who are in an unacceptable 
and terrible economic situation, can improve their lot.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	We will do this, first, by supporting economic initiatives, but 
also by asking these countries to adopt democratic rules, that is, to 
allow their people in general to express themselves in free 
elections, since, very often, they find themselves in systems where 
democracy is totally disregarded, and by providing services to their 
people.
<P>
	I said earlier and I repeat, and this seems fundamental to me, if 
the children we are talking about today, who are abused everywhere 
in the world, were in school, in other words, if they were in the 
same situation as our own children here in Canada, if the families 
of these children could take care of them, provide food and shelter, 
ensure they go to school, take them in hand and keep an eye on 
them, we would not be discussing this problem, at least not as 
much as we are doing now. So, we must consider the two aspects.
<P>
	As my colleague mentioned earlier, it is really as a critic, I do it 
personally because I believe in these issues, but it is also as the 
official opposition critic for human rights that I want to bring this 
aspect to the House's attention.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak on Bill C-27.
<P>
	It is interesting to read the preamble of the bill. The government 
is trying to set the stage by using what appears to be a lot of red 
book promises to indicate where this bill is hoping to go. My 
concern is that although the direction is fine, although the 
government is dealing with issues that need to be dealt with, it 
seems to be falling short of going all the way.
<P>
	It is important to support the government's direction and the 
move toward addressing these issues. However, I encourage the 
government to have the committee look at this bill and then look at 
the committee's recommendations to flesh the bill out a bit more 
and to seriously consider taking to a higher degree the steps the 
government is taking in many of these areas.
<P>
	I want to talk about a couple of specific issues, one of which is 
child prostitution. I use my householders for two-way 
communication in my constituency and I get a good number of 
responses. I put a couple of questions in one of my householders 
last fall to which I received 4,386 responses.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3576"> 3576 </A></B>
<P>
	One of the questions I asked was: Do you believe that 
prostitution should be legalized and regulated by the provincial 
government and the municipalities? The reason I asked it was that 
a number of people had talked about the need to get control over 
prostitution in their communities. My constituency is very 
conservative and I was really amazed and surprised by the 
response. Over 54 per cent voted yes, they wanted prostitution to 
be legalized and regulated.
<P>
	I also offer an opportunity in the householders for constituents to 
give comments. The comments fleshed out why a very 
conservative community with traditional families and a senior 
population thought that maybe it was time to legalize and regulate 
prostitution. Many of the comments in those 4,300 responses dealt 
with child prostitution. They thought it was time for some 
regulation to be brought in to try to keep young people off the 
streets, to try to somehow deal with a problem they thought was 
increasing.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	Daily we see the tragedy of young people who for whatever 
reason end up on the street trying to make a living or who are 
forced to make a living by prostituting themselves. They are young 
boys and young girls. In urban centres, the bigger cities, their age 
can be as low as 12 or 13 years. I do not think there is any person in 
this country who feels that is something we want to encourage or 
promote. Every Canadian is concerned about young children who 
are vulnerable, who should have more to look forward to than 
prostituting themselves.
<P>
	I look at the amendment the government is proposing, a 
mandatory minimum of five years for profiting from juvenile 
delinquency. That acknowledges it should get some sentence but I 
would suggest there may be cases where we would want it to be 
more than five years. I understand that is a minimum but we have 
seen in our justice system that a minimum almost establishes the 
norm. Whatever the minimum sentence is tends to be the sentence 
that is given out. The government is going to provide measures to 
facilitate the arrests. It is nice to know there will be something 
there to support it.
<P>
	The government is talking about making it easier for young 
people to testify against their pimps. They will have some 
protection so they will not be identified, which I think is very 
important. Many of those young people are there because they 
cannot get out, because of threats of bodily harm from their pimps. 
It is very important if we want to stop this from happening that we 
make it easier for them to report their pimps and to bring our 
attention to it.
<P>
	The other aspect is making it illegal to procure somebody under 
18 years. I have concerns that just putting in provisions to make it 
illegal is not going to stop it. It is already illegal for the 12 and 
13-year olds to be on the streets prostituting. We have to do more 
than  just put it in legislation. We have to give the courts the teeth 
and society the resources to deal with the problem of our young 
people on the streets. We need preventative measures. We need to 
give these young people other options, some resources they can go 
to when they are pulled off the street.
<P>
	The seriousness of child prostitution or the vulnerability of 
young people who are on the street was made very clear to me by a 
tragedy that happened in my community when Melanie Carpenter 
was murdered. The individual who murdered Melanie Carpenter 
had a history of violently assaulting two young prostitutes in the 
Toronto area to the point where they feared for their lives. The 
sentence that individual got was two years less a day. Because the 
young people were prostitutes, it was felt there was an element of 
consent and therefore it was not serious.
<P>
	We as Canadian legislators have to recognize that the courts have 
a very important role to play. I hope this legislation and the changes 
to it will send a very strong message to the courts that Canadians 
want the courts, the prosecutors, the defence attorneys and the 
judges to treat seriously people who are encouraging and keeping 
young people in prostitution and people who are using the child 
prostitutes.
<P>
	I will move on to the changes in this legislation that would bring 
what is called tourist prostitution to an end. The government is 
recognizing that we cannot condone the use of child prostitutes 
even if it happens outside of our country. If Canadian citizens are 
going to Thailand, the Philippines or wherever to avail themselves 
of child prostitutes, it should be condemned and we should come 
down with the force of the law.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	I commend the government for taking the steps of including 
charges against Canadians who are availing themselves of child 
prostitutes outside of Canada. It is something that is being 
addressed by other countries around the world. Canada is smart in 
co-operating and becoming part of the international community 
that is trying to bring an end to this type of abuse of children.
<P>
	I am reminded of a program I saw a few months ago on CBC. It 
was a documentary on a Thai group which was trying to relocate 
young children who had been kidnapped from their rural 
communities. Many of these children were six to eight years old 
when they were forcibly removed from their rural communities and 
put into prostitution in the main cities.
<P>
	The documentary followed who the children were, how they 
were removed, how they were taken into the main cities and also 
who was using the child prostitution services. It was quite 
sickening to see the aeroplanes full of individuals from North 
America, Australia, Europe, from all over the world who were 
visiting those communities for one purpose only, to use these six, 
eight  and ten year old children for sexual gratification. That is not 
something Canadians encourage or support. I commend the 
government in its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3577"> 3577 </A></B>
<P>
attempt to bring Canada into the international community by trying 
to deal with those issues.
<P>
	There is also the issue of female genital mutilation. I was pleased 
to support one of our hon. colleagues from the Bloc who introduced 
a private member's bill to bring something into the Criminal Code 
that would deal with the issue here in Canada.
<P>
	I am pleased the government is acknowledging that something 
has to be done, that female genital mutilation has to be considered 
to be illegal in this country but I worry that it has not gone far 
enough. I worry that it is only going to protect young women under 
the age of 18. A 19-year old girl who is facing that situation needs 
our protection just as much as a 17-year old does.
<P>
	There should not be an age limit placed on this protection. The 
procedure of female genital mutilation should be made illegal. 
Anybody who is aiding, abetting, recommending or supporting it 
should be charged as such and treated with all the force of the law. 
We have to send a very strong message to all people who live in our 
country that this procedure is something which is not acceptable.
<P>
	I am concerned with the wording in the legislation which allows 
for an exception for the medical community. I have a lot of respect 
for the medical community and I do not for minute want to suggest 
that there will be an abuse of it. I know there are circumstances 
where reconstructive surgery and other things that deal with female 
genital situations are needed.
<P>
	I want to make sure that this legislation would not allow a 
medical doctor who agrees with the practice to be able to continue 
the practice in Canada for whatever reason. That area needs to be 
looked at more closely. We have to make sure the full protection is 
there, not just for women under 18, but for all women who are 
faced with this kind of invasive attack on their person. We have to 
make sure there is no element where it can be abused in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	I commend the government for having considered the private 
member's bill which one of our honourable colleagues presented, 
which was included in this legislation. Again I would have liked 
the government to have been a little more definitive and a little 
tougher on that issue.
<P>
	I will briefly touch upon the issue of stalking and first degree 
murder. I do not think there is any question that Canadians want 
individuals who deliberately harass, stalk and threaten another 
person to be taken to the absolute limit of prosecution. However, I 
do have to wonder about whether we can justify a first degree 
murder charge for somebody who was not intending to murder. The 
full  force of the law should be against anybody who is harassing, 
attacking or threatening.
<P>
	I have been very upset many times over the past couple of years 
with the limitation that our law enforcement officers have in 
protecting individuals who are being stalked or harassed by a 
predator, an ex-spouse or whomever. There has to be more 
protection. The government and the courts must deal with it more 
seriously.
<P>
	I am not sure that those people should be automatically charged 
with first degree murder. Our legal system has the ability to charge 
those offenders with second degree murder, or first degree murder 
if it can be proven that the intent of the stalking or the harassment 
was to kill. If the proof is not there, I have difficulty with the fact 
that automatically if a person has been involved in stalking they 
will be charged with first degree murder.
<P>
	This legislation is going in the right direction. I like the fact that 
the government seems to be listening to a number of issues which 
private members are bringing forward. I like the idea that the 
government is trying to address the concerns of safety for women 
and children. However, this legislation needs work.
<P>
	I hope that my Reform colleagues, Bloc members and certainly 
government members who sit on the justice committee will look at 
areas where the legislation can be improved and toughened to 
protect a broader scope of Canadian women and children. I hope 
these changes will see the light of day to make the bill much better. 
The bill has a good beginning, but it needs work. I hope the justice 
minister and the government will allow input from the committee 
to make it a better bill.
<P>
	I thank my colleague for giving me the opportunity to speak on 
this legislation. I hope the bill becomes much stronger in the days 
to come.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
happy to see that other members of this House will support some of 
the amendments I proposed in my speech on Bill C-27, more 
specifically on genital mutilation and sex tourism.
<P>
	I note that my colleague who just spoke also agrees with me on 
the age limit. I do not see why there should be an age limit and why 
the practice of genital mutilation should be allowed in some cases 
for women over the age of 18. I think there should be no age limit.
<P>
	If we want to send a clear message to cultural communities and 
to eliminate this practice, there must be no exceptions. What kind 
of message would we send if the law made an exception and 
allowed this practice in some cases? That is why I will introduce 
amendments to ensure that there is no age limit and that this 
procedure cannot be performed on any female individual.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3578"> 3578 </A></B>
<P>
	The bill I introduced had a very specific purpose, namely to 
protect the physical integrity of women and girls. Women's 
physical integrity can be protected at any age. I think the 
minister's bill does not address this aspect. The legislation should 
also apply to any individual who participates in or promotes 
mutilation.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	As the House knows, this cultural practice involves an individual 
accompanying, encouraging or taking a child, for example, out of 
the country to undergo this procedure. This is another amendment I 
would like to make to the minister's bill.
<P>
	I would also like to see another amendment providing that no 
exceptions shall be made to allow this surgical procedure. I think 
that physicians know full well what genital mutilation entails and 
disagree with this practice, so I do not see why there should be 
exceptions to allow surgery if the woman is healthy.
<P>
	I take comfort in seeing that some of my fellow members will 
support my amendments and I thank my colleague for raising these 
amendments here in this House today.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Madam Speaker, I want to tell my hon. colleague 
I am pleased to support her amendments if that is what it is going to 
do. It brought to my mind that maybe there should be protection for 
people who go out of the country for the procedure and then return 
to Canada. Maybe that is another protection we should look at. It is 
similar to the issue of tourist prostitution. If somebody were to do 
it, be they Canadian or landed immigrant, and they went out of the 
country to have it done, then the full weight of the law would still 
come to bear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I would like the hon. member to acknowledge that it has been 
indicated where an individual leaves the country for the purpose of 
procuring female genital mutilation, that such person would be 
subject to criminal sanction in this country. Also, where it involved 
adults, this would be regarded as assault causing bodily harm. The 
supreme court has indicated that a person cannot consent to bodily 
harm being inflicted upon them. Therefore, the amendment the 
hon. member is talking about is not necessary.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Madam Speaker, for greater clarity I would like 
the member to point out where the protection is. I do not see 
anything dealing with female genital mutilation in the bill which 
would protect somebody who has it done outside of the country or 
somebody who has it done and is over the age of 18.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in this debate on Bill C-27, introduced by the 
Minister of Justice on April 18. It seems to me that the objective of 
this bill is very worthwhile, in that it will amend the Criminal Code 
to put an end to child prostitution, child sex tourism, criminal 
harassment and female genital mutilation.
<P>
	I am very sensitive to this problem as an immigrant, as a member 
of Parliament and as the official opposition critic on immigration. 
It is indeed among immigrant women from Africa, Asia and the 
Middle East that this practice takes on serious proportions. I 
vigorously condemn such criminal practices as the acts of violence 
and abuse against women and children that they are. They are a 
direct attack on their psychological and physical integrity.
<P>
	These harmful practices inflicted on women and children violate 
and deny human rights as well as fundamental freedoms.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	I look forward to this bill being adopted to finally prohibit and 
prevent child sex abuse and female genital mutilation altogether. 
Women and children are full-fledged persons and, as such, they 
must enjoy every right and freedom enjoyed by the other members 
of our society.
<P>
	I am not the only one to be extremely concerned about these 
issues. Several women's and children's rights groups, from Quebec 
and across Canada, have been organizing to eradicate child 
prostitution, child sexual tourism and female genital mutilation. It 
is interesting to note that, on December 21, 1994, Quebec's human 
rights commission adopted a position on the practices of female 
genital mutilation, namely excision and infibulation. According to 
the commission, such practices threaten the right of women to their 
integrity, to equality and to non-discrimination. The commission 
concluded that these practices discriminated against women.
<P>
	I must commend the Bloc Quebecois member from Quebec who, 
in 1995, presented Bill C-277 on genital mutilation of female 
persons. I think her bill was more far-reaching and more complete 
than this bill by the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	Like the Bloc members who spoke before me, I think that Bill 
C-27 has a limited, restricted scope. Bill C-27 could and should go 
further in several ways.
<P>
	As regard sex tourism, let me recall certain facts showing the 
extent of the problem. In the May 1993 edition of <I>L'Actualité</I>, 
journalist Luc Chartrand stated that between 20,000 and 30,000 
young boys were prostitutes in Sri Lanka. According to him, about 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3579"> 3579 </A></B>
<P>
10 per  cent of tourists are choosing this destination to practice 
pedophilia.
<P>
	Sri Lanka is not the only country where pedophilia is widely 
practised. It is also the case in other poor countries in Asia, like 
Thailand and the Philippines, and also in Latin America, 
particularly in the Dominican Republic.
<P>
	It is with great concern that, a few weeks ago, I watched a 
Radio-Canada report on this topic. What really shocks me is that 
there are Canadians who go to the Dominican Republic with the 
intention of sexually abusing young children and teenagers.
<P>
	A tragic consequence of sex tourism is the proliferation of AIDS, 
particularly among young boys. Because of this, clients tend to 
seek children who have never had sexual relations before, and who 
are therefore increasingly younger.
<P>
	There are also clandestine networks through which child 
pornography magazines can be exchanged, and even children. Sex 
tourism does create major problems, the most serious one being the 
fact that these children become slaves.
<P>
	Canada must put a stop to these criminal acts which violate 
human rights. We must follow the example of countries such as 
Germany and Norway, which have already criminalized these 
unacceptable practices.
<P>
	This brings me to my first reservation regarding Bill C-27 as it 
pertains to sex tourism. This reservation has to do with the very 
definition of the people targeted by the bill. In order to fully 
eliminate sex tourism, Bill C-27 should not target only those who 
use child prostitution services abroad.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	The wording of the bill should also include those who support 
the sexual exploitation of children. I am referring to promoters, 
organizers and travel agencies or companies organizing trips 
abroad for the purposes of sex tourism involving persons under the 
age of eighteen. In short, all those who directly or indirectly 
encourage these criminal practices should be punished.
<P>
	Second, according to clause 4.1, Bill C-27 only applies to 
persons who are Canadian citizens or permanent residents. It is 
important that such a bill also apply to any person living in Canada, 
whether or not that person is a Canadian citizen. Therefore, this bill 
would also apply to refugees, asylum seekers, everybody living in 
Canada on a relatively stable basis.
<P>
	With regard to genital mutilation, I would like also to give some 
idea of the scope of the problem. The World Health Organization 
estimates at between 85 and 115 million worldwide the number of 
women and girls who have been subjected to excision. This custom 
mainly involves excising the clitoris and the labia on little girls 
aged between 5 and 10.
<P>
	In the countries where this custom is practised, excision on little 
girls is an integral part of a culture that is sometimes several 
centuries old. This custom is considered a rite of passage: the little 
girl then becomes a woman. However, I want to point out that, 
contrary to some beliefs and claims, no religion accepts nor agrees 
with female genital mutilation.
<P>
	We may condemn these customs, but it is difficult to impose our 
views against the practice of female genital mutilation abroad. 
However, we must pass legislation to prohibit any female genital 
mutilation in Canada. These customs have limits.
<P>
	In this regard, I would like to quote from the declaration and the 
platform for action adopted in Vienna on June 25, 1993, where the 
World Conference on Human Rights, after restating that all human 
rights are universal, indissociable, interdependent and intimately 
related, pointed out that ``even though it is appropriate not to forget 
the importance of national and regional identities and cultural and 
religious historical diversities, every state, whatever its political, 
economic and cultural system may be, has the duty to protect all 
human rights and all basic freedoms''.
<P>
	Then it points out how important it is to try to ``eliminate the 
contradictions that can exist between the rights of women and the 
harmful impacts of certain traditional or customary practices, of 
cultural prejudices and of religious extremism''. Further on, in the 
part dealing with children's rights, the conference ``urgently begs 
states to repeal existing laws and regulations and to eliminate the 
customs and practices that are discriminatory and harmful to 
girls''.
<P>
	In Canada, the right not to be subjected to genital mutilation 
transcends the cultural argument. The right to physical integrity is 
included in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in the 
Canadian Charter of Human Rights and in the Quebec Charter of 
Human Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	It is important for Canada to adopt legislation prohibiting female 
genital mutilation, because, from 1986 to 1991, 40,000 immigrants 
from countries where this practice exists have come to Canada. In 
1992 only, another 3,245 immigrants from countries where genital 
mutilation is tolerated or promoted came to Canada.
<P>
	I think Bill C-27 is rather vague about the extraterritoriality of 
the prohibition of genital mutilation. I wish we would include in 
the bill a provision allowing proceedings in Canada against persons 
who take a child abroad for genital mutilation. This is important if 
we are to close a loophole that can be used, and is already being 
used, to bypass the law and have female genital mutilation 
performed.
<P>
	I do not feel comfortable either with the exception provided for 
in the bill concerning female genital  mutilation. This exception 
would allow mutilation in surgical procedures performed by a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3580"> 3580 </A></B>
<P>
physician for medical reasons or to enable that person to have 
normal reproductive functions.
<P>
	First, physicians think this exception is not needed. Dr. André 
Lalonde, president of the Society of Obstetricians and 
Gynaecologists of Canada, said so very clearly. He stated that 
female genital mutilation is not a medical procedure per se. 
Second, instead of banning completely this practice, Bill C-27, 
with this exception, allows it to go on for reasons of physical 
health.
<P>
	In the same vein, I would prefer if the bill did not specify an age 
of consent for female genital mutilation. The bill before us says 
that an adult person, that is an 18-year old, can give consent to 
genital mutilation.
<P>
	I should remind the House that female genital mutilations are 
permanent. It scars young girls and women forever. Consent is 
often the result of a conditioning process, so that the consent given 
by a child or an adult is questionable.
<P>
	The establishment of an age limit for consenting to genital 
mutilation seems to me to be contrary to the objective of Bill C-27, 
that is to totally eradicate female genital mutilation.
<P>
	Moreover, I would rather be in favour of legislation allowing for 
the prosecution of anyone directly or indirectly involved in the 
practice of female genital mutilation. In my opinion, Bill C-27 is 
too restrictive on this aspect because it deals only with the people 
who perform the operation.
<P>
	Legislation penalizing all those involved would make them both 
aware of the criminal aspect of female genital mutilation and 
accountable for their actions. It would also lead to the dismantling 
of clandestine networks operating in this field, of which there are 
many unfortunately.
<P>
	Finally, I believe Bill C-27 is a step in the right direction. Bill 
C-27 criminalizes child prostitution, sex tourism and women 
genital mutilation.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
will let my hon. colleague catch his breath. He will then be able to 
answer and proceed with his speech.
<P>
	I see that yet another colleague of mine will be supporting my 
amendments. With regard to my amendments, I want to point out 
that I have consulted various stakeholders who are concerned about 
genital mutilation and they agreed that this bill will no go far for 
several reasons. The amendment I want to refer to deals with 
genital mutilation and the concept of extraterritoriality.
<P>
	Since this concept was used in the sex tourism bill, I do not see 
why it could not be included in the genital mutilation bill. Any 
individual who is a Canadian citizen  could then be prosecuted. We 
know full well that mutilation very often happens outside the 
country. Under the bill introduced by the minister, these offenders 
would not be prosecuted, because no new offence would be created. 
The purpose of the bill I introduced was to create a new offence.
<P>
	The minister's bill only defines genital mutilation as part of the 
assaults stipulated in the legislation. I had hoped for a provision 
listing the various aspects of genital mutilation and all the 
prohibited acts, something that would apply not only to the 
individual performing the mutilation but to anyone encouraging 
such a practice or ensuring that an individual undergoes genital 
mutilation.
<P>
	I would like my hon. colleague to tell us if he thinks 
extraterritoriality is a good principle that could help to reinforce 
this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> Madam Speaker, first, I would like to congratulate 
the member for Quebec who, last year, introduced an excellent bill 
concerning female genital mutilation and who then made a very 
good speech. She continued in the same vein today. Indeed, this is 
an extremely important bill.
<P>
	On the subject of the territoriality of legislation, this is an 
important principle of international law, but one for which there is 
an increasing number of exceptions. There are, for example, the 
perpetrators of crimes against humanity, who can be prosecuted 
anywhere. It is important, and I believe that in this bill the concept 
of territoriality should be applied.
<P>
	People who commit infractions outside the country could be 
prosecuted here, and this is precisely an essential element of this 
bill. Canadians, not only Canadians citizens, but also residents, 
refugees and asylum seekers, who commit crimes in another 
country could be prosecuted in Canada. I believe this is the way to 
get rid of this reprehensible practice. If the principle of 
extraterritoriality is not applied, the bill's effect will be too limited 
and it will not have much significance.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I thank the hon. member for his comments but I suggest that in a 
number of areas there are other and better interpretations of the 
criminal law than were presented by his remarks.
<P>
	He indicated he would have preferred if the legislation had 
explicitly dealt with people who are tour operators or travel agents 
who offer sex tours. These provisions are already contained within 
the Criminal Code of Canada. Sections 212.1(a) and (g) 
specifically provide that everyone who procures, attempts to 
procure or solicits a person to have illicit sexual intercourse with 
another person, whether in or out of Canada, or procures a person 
to enter or leave Canada for the purpose of prostitution is guilty of 
an indictable offence.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3581"> 3581 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	It is clear that sex tour operators or travel agents who organize 
these types of tours are guilty in Canada of a criminal offence.
<P>
	Canadian nationals and all permanent residents who obtain or 
attempt to obtain outside of Canada the sexual services of a person 
under the age of 18 are guilty of a criminal offence, not just 
Canadian citizens as was indicated by the hon. member.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez: </B>Madam Speaker, it is not enough to mention citizens 
and permanent residents because there are people in Canada who 
are neither citizens nor permanent residents, particularly refugees 
claimants. They come to Canada, file a refugee status claim and 
spend one, two or three years here while the Board assesses their 
claim. So, I think the bill should be amended to include that 
relatively large category of persons.
<P>
	Second, the hon. member told me that travel agencies are already 
included in the bill, but I do not see that very clearly. If it were 
possible to clarify that a little, it would be a major step forward, 
particularly since it was clearly specified in the bill tabled by the 
member for Quebec that travel agencies or transportation 
organizations would also be guilty of those offences. According to 
what the hon. member said, that is included in the minister's bill, 
but I think it should be clarified and specified.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise today obviously to speak 
in favour of Bill C-27, an act to amend the Criminal Code.
<P>
	At the outset I congratulate my colleague, the Minister of 
Justice, for championing a bill designed to improve the Criminal 
Code provisions in four key areas vital to the health and safety of 
women and children both in Canada and around the world.
<P>
	I speak to this bill both as Secretary of State for the Status of 
Women and as a physician who has, in every one of the four aspects 
of this legislation, seen firsthand the results of this type of 
imbalance of power in society. The four aspects of this legislation 
are child sex tourism, child prostitution in Canada, criminal 
harassment and female genital mutilation.
<P>
	Hon. members will recall that many of the amendments before 
us were introduced in the last session as Bill C-119. Since the new 
session we have added a new section relating to child sex tourism 
and a further amendment relating to child prostitution in Canada.
<P>
	There are four things the bill has in common. They speak to the 
issue of systemic violence in society, particularly against women 
and children, and the  commitment of the government to removing 
that violence.
<P>
	Last year in Beijing at the fourth world conference there was a 
great deal of support for this issue of dealing with systemic 
violence, not simply by legislation but by dealing with systemic 
violence at its roots.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	Systemic violence requires strong comprehensive provisions 
that will deal not only with the legal components of this but also 
with issues that have to do with sensitizing the population, with 
prevention, with education, with treating the person who is 
harassed or violated and with dealing with the rehabilitation of the 
violator or the harassor. These things are very important if we are 
to put an end to this kind of violence in society. While this is an 
important component of a comprehensive strategy, it is not the only 
component.
<P>
	As well, many of these issues of violence stem from roots that 
have to do with cultural and religious backgrounds, with social 
issues which make violence a traditional imbalance of power in our 
society. Those in society who have very little support, who have 
very little voice to speak for themselves, who have very little 
autonomy and independence are the ones who are traditionally the 
victims of violence. We can see in all four of these issues they tend 
to deal with women and children who are still among the people in 
society who cannot speak for themselves or who cannot defend 
themselves.
<P>
	In Beijing it was clearly stated religion is not an excuse for 
mutilation and for violence.
<P>
	I urge everyone in the House to support the bill. Going abroad to 
have sex with children is exploitation at its worst, at its most 
shameful. It means we will not do in this country certain things we 
feel ashamed of, and we go to another country where we can be 
hidden by anonymity to exploit and abuse other people's children.
<P>
	The Criminal Code already addresses certain aspects of sex 
tourism. Section 212 could, now that we have seen it in its full 
entirety as an amendment, affect tour operators, travel agents and 
agencies offering sex tours. Subsection 1(a) deals with specifically 
providing or attempting to procure whether in or out of Canada, 
and that obviously refers to those who would set up tours or 
agencies which would allow people to go on this kind of venture. 
Subsection 1(g) deals with entering or leaving Canada for the 
purpose of prostitution. This is an indictable offence which will be 
given not less than ten years.
<P>
	Canadians are seen as role models to the world. For us as a 
country to allow Canadians to go across the world to exploit and 
violate children is absolutely unacceptable. The bill sends a clear 
signal that this behaviour is unacceptable at home and it is 
unacceptable abroad, especially with the extraterritorial provisions 
in the bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3582"> 3582 </A></B>
<P>
	Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Belgium, France, 
Germany, Australia, New Zealand and the United States have 
already adopted legislation which permits prosecution of nationals 
for sexual activities with children. A world congress against sexual 
exploitation of children will be held in Stockholm, Sweden on 
August 27 of this year. Canada will send government 
representatives. The congress is expected to develop a declaration 
and a plan of action.
<P>
	Clearly there is an international environment which upholds the 
principles we in Canada have included in the amendments to this 
bill.
<P>
	Bill C-27 further amends section 7 of the Criminal Code 
allowing proceedings in Canada against Canadian citizens who 
engage in activities associated with child prostitution when they 
are outside the country. This is an issue of morality. It is an issue of 
human rights.
<P>
	The second component of the amendments deals with changing 
these things at home. As my mother used to say, charity begins at 
home. It would be hypocrisy for us to make provisions which 
would create a problem for people who go abroad and not deal with 
the people at home who continue to exploit children.
<P>
	These amendments will make the pimping of a child under 18 an 
aggravated offence and will look at those who procure children 
under the age of 18 and those who use violence. When we talk 
about systemic violence we are talking about an imbalance of 
power. The perpetrators will use that power and violence to make 
those children under 18 continue to prostitute themselves.
<P>
<B>(1700 )</B>
<P>
	The amendment will deal with a very important component in 
the imbalance of power, where fear and anxiety play a major part. 
Many people who have been exploited in this kind of system are 
afraid to speak against their abuser or their exploiter. In this case, it 
will be made easier for children to testify behind a screen so that 
they do not have to be afraid of what might occur after they have 
testified.
<P>
	The third component of the amendment makes it illegal to cause 
someone to fear for their safety or the safety of someone unknown 
to them by following them, by threatening them, by 
communicating threats to them either at home or at work. This 
amendment is important because it will ensure that murder 
committed while stalking will now be seen to be first degree 
murder whether or not it can be proven that it was planned and 
deliberate.
<P>
	The penalty for first degree murder is 25 years with no parole. 
This is really important because in the past the argument was 
always made that the person did not intend to go ahead and do this, 
that it happened by mistake and was a crime of passion. Stalking 
clearly says that a  person is seeking to threaten and harm someone. 
Now that person should be made responsible.
<P>
	Finally, the fourth component of this bill deals with female 
genital mutilation. This is a very complex and sensitive issue 
because it deals with cultural and religious beliefs. However, it has 
become an international cause celebre. The World Health 
Organization, UNICEF, United Nations and Beijing discussed this 
issue and decided that it was absolutely unacceptable to use 
religion or culture as a reason to inflict violence on anyone.
<P>
	As a physician, I can say that female genital mutilation is not 
violence against children or against women solely. It also carries 
with it the health problem of chronic pain, chronic pelvic 
inflammatory disease, chronic disease that a woman has to live 
with for the rest of her life making her an invalid in many 
instances. This is violence and abusive power at its worst because 
religion is used to say that someone must succumb to this kind of 
violence.
<P>
	Paragraph 232 of the platform for action at Beijing requires 
governments to prohibit female genital mutilation wherever it 
exists and gives vigorous support to efforts among non-government 
and community organizations and religious institutions to 
eliminate such practices.
<P>
	While I said earlier that we require comprehensive plans and 
strategies to deal with the issue, legislation is one of them. 
Education, sensitivity training and awareness must be a 
component. Status of Women Canada, the Solicitor General and 
Health Canada have been working with communities and 
grassroots organizations to deal with this issue.
<P>
	We have found that communities which have been subjected to 
some of these violent episodes such as female genital mutilation, it 
is very difficult for people to speak out. It is very difficult for them 
to speak against what is a religious practice, especially when they 
live in these communities.
<P>
	Dealing with these issues on the ground and going out into the 
communities is very important. We need to talk about systemic 
violence, not only in terms of legislation but in terms of setting 
clear, comprehensive, holistic strategies where we work across 
departments, where we work across governmental levels and where 
we work within the community and with NGOs to ensure that we 
deal with these issues fully.
<P>
	At this time, the Criminal Code prohibits female genital 
mutilation in Canada. It also prohibits having a child removed from 
Canada to have female genital mutilation performed. The Criminal 
Code states that it is illegal. One cannot remove a person from the 
country in order to perform an illegal act.
<P>
	This amendment clarifies this. It also adds the very strong 
educational and sensitivity component we were talking about 
earlier by defining female genital  mutilation as aggravated assault. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3583"> 3583 </A></B>
<P>
Maiming and wounding a person is not a cultural practice. Anyone 
under 18 cannot consent or have any person consent to having this 
terrible act done on them.
<P>
	Underlying all these four amendments to the Criminal Code is 
something very important. It speaks to removing that imbalance of 
power that is systemic in our society today. It is a way of warning 
abusers in positions of authority or trust who abuse through 
religion or parenting. In many instances, children as young as five 
years of age have been subjected to child sex tourism in some 
countries of the world. This is not sex tourism. It is pedophilia.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	The exploitation and abuse of those who are at the lowest rung of 
the ladder, women and children, must be stopped. I see this bill as 
being a step in dealing with the issue.
<P>
	I urge everyone in the House to vote for the bill. Let us continue 
to work on other ways to bring about, not only legislation, but 
comprehensive strategies so that this country can be a safe place for 
women and their children and eventually the world will no longer 
exploit them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with interest to the hon. member's speech. She pointed out that 
under this bill those who commit murder who have first stalked 
their victim, if convicted, can be sentenced to first degree murder 
even though it is not required to prove intent and that the individual 
would have to serve 25 years.
<P>
	In view of what the hon. member has said, would she be willing 
to support the elimination of section 745 of the Criminal Code 
which would allow that murderer to apply for parole eligibility 
after serving just 15 years?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand what the hon. member is 
addressing. I cannot support the complete elimination of this 
section of the Criminal Code. We have to look at how to deal with 
the issue in a different way. We cannot just look at how the law 
deals with specific individuals.
<P>
	The law must be broad in its range. Justice must be meted out in 
accordance with the crime. Has the person been rehabilitated? 
Serial murderers cannot be lumped in with people who may have 
committed a single murder. The circumstances of the murder must 
be looked at. The families of victims must be consulted as well as 
the people in the communities who were there at the time of the 
murder. It must be looked at in a more comprehensive way rather 
than a knee-jerk reaction to something which could be meaningful. 
If a decision is made that is going to cut a deep swath in society, we 
may be doing more harm than good.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Secretary of State for the Status of Women says that Bill C-27 is a 
step forward, and I think it is true. I would like to ask her if she 
agrees with the amendments we want to make to improve the bill.
<P>
	When she says that mutilation is an illegal act, she is right, but 
the communities who practise genital mutilation do not intend to 
commit an illegal act. For them, it is just a cultural and not a 
religious practice. To improve the bill, I would like certain 
amendments to be made.
<P>
	Does the minister, who is also responsible for the status of 
women, agree with the age limit which means that we would 
tolerate that a woman over eighteen years of age cannot defend the 
physical integrity of her body? I think if we want to send a clear 
message to cultural communities, we must not establish an age 
limit. This bill wants to send a clear message, but the government 
is diluting the bill that I brought forward previously.
<P>
	After the minister made his intentions known on this bill and 
particularly on genital mutilation, I consulted a few organizations 
that agree with these amendments and that feel this bill does not go 
far enough. Anyway, we will hear the various groups concerned 
with this problem in committee.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	I ask the Secretary of State if she would support the inclusion in 
the bill of people who encourage or assist a person who performs 
this type of procedure. For the minister, the only person concerned 
is the one who performs the procedure.
<P>
	We know that it is a cultural custom and that it is the community 
which allows a seven or eight-year-old girl to be subjected to 
genital mutilation, namely the excision of the clitoris. It is 
atrocious. If we want to send a clear message, there has to be no 
exceptions, not even for physicians allowing such a medical 
procedure for health reasons. Doctors know what mutilations are 
all about.
<P>
	Also, I would like the Secretary of State to explain to us why an 
exception was made for physicians when the society of 
obstetricians does not agree. According to the society, physicians 
know full well what constitutes an act of mutilation and there is no 
need to make an exception in their case since it could lead to 
abuses. I would like the Secretary of State to answer these three 
questions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member asks a very interesting 
question. Not being a lawyer, I can say it is often very difficult to 
interpret laws. However, in many instances when a law is made or 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3584"> 3584 </A></B>
<P>
it is generic enough that it can affect people who in the course of 
their duties are doing something that is in fact for the health of 
someone  but could be interpreted as otherwise they need to have 
some sort of protection.
<P>
	It may very well be that when we speak of doing any sort of 
operation on a woman or on a child for their health there are many 
different operations that can be done. For example, in instances 
where a child or an adult whose external sexual organs do not 
function properly it may be necessary to do certain operations that 
would enable them to function properly. This is very different from 
what female genital mutilation is all about. That is an operation 
which prevents them from functioning properly.
<P>
	There is a fine line between things we may need to do to enhance 
a person's health, which is not necessarily mutilation. There are a 
lot of operations in medicine in which one has to open up certain 
areas so that the woman can menstruate properly. One wants to be 
sure that a physician doing some of those operations for the health 
of the patient does not have to be seen to be committing female 
genital mutilation. I believe this would have to be done on a case by 
case basis where one would clearly define what the person is doing.
<P>
	I thank the hon. member very much for that extremely important 
question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to follow up what the hon. member across the way touched on. 
When she indicated that anyone convicted of murder as a result of 
stalking would serve 25 years imprisonment, she should clarify 
that. She knows that under section 745 of the Criminal Code that 
individual would have the advantage of early parole after serving 
just 15 years.
<P>
	I do not think that should be side stepped, it is a fact. I do not 
think she was absolutely frank and forthright in her suggestion that 
anyone convicted of murder for stalking would have to serve 25 
years. They, like all murderers in this country under today's law, 
would have the advantage of section 745 and would be able to 
expend taxpayer dollars in an attempt to lower the parole 
ineligibility after serving just 15 years.
<P>
	Nevertheless, I rise today in support of the government's bill, 
C-27. In 1993, 52 Reform members came to Ottawa with a 
commitment to the Canadian people to reform Parliament. 
Included in those reforms was the promise to be supportive 
whenever possible of government legislation. We promised not to 
oppose government legislation simply for the sake of opposition or 
to gain political points.
<P>
	If a bill enhances public safety we will support it. We therefore 
support the government's initiative in Bill C-27. Bill C-27 is a 
series of amendments to the Criminal Code dealing with child 
prostitution, child sex tourism, criminal harassment and female 
genital mutilation. It will help reduce violence against women and 
children. Therefore we support it.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	The bill is not the final answer. A number of legislative changes 
must be implemented if we are to continue to eradicate domestic 
violence and child abuse. Attention must be focused on crime 
prevention, starting with the identification of the cause of domestic 
violence.
<P>
	Clause 5 of Bill C-27 amends Criminal Code section 268, 
aggravated assault. Under Bill C-27 infibulation in whole or in part 
to the labia majora, labia minora or clitoris of a young person under 
the age of 18 will be considered aggravated assault punishable by a 
term of imprisonment not exceeding 14 years. The thought that 
there are adults in the country who are willing to subject their 
children to that kind of treatment is the most abhorrent aspect of 
the whole issue.
<P>
	Therefore we will push for an amendment under this clause of 
Bill C-27 to completely eliminate this barbaric and inhuman 
practice to protect all women in the country.
<P>
	In view of the concern expressed in 1992 by the Ontario College 
of Physicians and Surgeons this Criminal Code amendment is 
necessary. The Ontario college reported that there had been a rise in 
the number of requests for infibulations in the country. Infibulation 
is the cutting off of a young girl's genital parts, including the 
clitoris, and the subsequent sewing together of the opening leaving 
room for only urination and menstruation.
<P>
	Just thinking about it, just reading about it, just speaking about it 
fills me with a degree of repulsion that makes me wonder why the 
government has waited as long as it has. As my colleague from 
Surrey-White Rock mentioned, we are indebted to the member 
for Quebec who I think spurred the government in this direction 
with her private member's bill. I congratulate her.
<P>
	Canada has been cited by the World Health Organization as 
being one of forty countries involved in the practice of what has 
become known as female circumcision, correctly referred to as 
female genital mutilation. Female genital mutilation causes a 
number of short and long term problems including excruciating 
pain; hemorrhaging; occasional death; exceptionally high rates of 
infections to the urinary tract, bladder, reproductive organs and 
bowel; menstrual and pregnancy problems; anemia; and 
disfiguring cysts that not only reduce or eliminate sexual pleasure 
but often result in extreme pain during intercourse and can even 
prohibit it.
<P>
	Suffice to say, the Canadian medical community says that 
female genital mutilation has absolutely no benefits but is 
completely unnecessary and extremely harmful.
<P>
	An assistant in my office watched a documentary on female 
genital mutilation. As the mother of a five-year old girl she says 
she cannot erase the horrifying impression the film left upon her. 
The documentary was about the cultural practice of female mutila-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3585"> 3585 </A></B>
<P>
tion. In the  film a four-year old girl sat on what appeared to be a 
stool upon a dirt floor while an elderly woman from the community 
using a crude instrument cut off her clitoris. No anesthetic was 
used. No freezing was used. As the girl screamed in horror and 
pain, the woman proceeded without any sign of anguish on the part 
of the mother, who not only witnessed the barbaric mutilation of 
her daughter but was part of it. The mother showing no sign of 
emotion restrained her daughter. When the procedure was complete 
the girl laid on a dirty mat, sobbing, with her feet tied together and 
with her hands bound.
<P>
	I relay this horrible story to the House because we as a nation 
must signal to the world that the practice of mutilating young girls 
is absolutely deplorable and therefore must be outlawed 
everywhere.
<P>
	In Somalia and other countries the practice meets cultural 
demands or cultural standards or preserves a sense of identity to 
their community, or it is done to preserve virginity and family 
honour. It is time the UN stepped in and protected children 
worldwide from being assaulted and abused in the name of 
culturally acceptable practices. The UN has been asked to put a 
stop to child labour. Therefore it is absolutely imperative that the 
UN move to stop this most savage abuse of children.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	I urge the Government of Canada to take the lead on the issue by 
initiating talk with those countries that would be supportive of UN 
action in this regard. We must take every measure possible to 
protect children in this country and throughout the world.
<P>
	I therefore fully support the section of Bill C-27 which makes it 
an offence for a Canadian citizen to obtain paid sexual services of 
children abroad or to engage in an activity associated with child 
prostitution when they are out of the country.
<P>
	The most alarming part of the issue is the fact that we have 
adults in this country who will travel to other countries to have 
sexual relations with children. It is alarming for me to realize there 
are adults from other countries who will come to Canada and take 
advantage of and abuse children from dysfunctional families who 
are prostituting themselves. There is a lot of work for us to do 
within our own country as well as internationally.
<P>
	I would be remiss, however, if I did not question the 
effectiveness of this Canadian measure in eliminating child 
prostitution throughout the world. While it may bring Canadian 
citizens to justice, it will not stop citizens from other countries 
from engaging in sexual relations with children. Again I believe the 
only way to eradicate this form of sexual abuse against children 
would be through UN action and action of other international 
bodies.
<P>
	I also support the portion of Bill C-27 which imposes a 
mandatory minimum sentence of five years imprisonment for 
persons found guilty of profiting from  juvenile prostitution. I have 
some concerns regarding the effectiveness of imposing only a 
five-year minimum sentence. Pimping is a serious offence and as 
such should carry a severe penalty. I will therefore be seeking the 
advice of the witnesses appearing before the standing committee 
regarding possible amendments to this portion of Bill C-27.
<P>
	Under subsection 212(4) of the Criminal Code obtaining the 
sexual service of a person under the age of 18 years is an indictable 
offence liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years. 
Bill C-27 alters this section of the code by adding that it is an 
offence to obtain sexual service of persons believed to be under the 
age of 18 years. I support this change.
<P>
	I would, however, recommend an additional change to make the 
procurement of sexual service of persons under the age of 18 years 
liable to a minimum of five years. Let us cut off the demand. If the 
Johns using these young children, abusing both girls and boys, 
knew they faced a serious term of imprisonment, they might think 
twice before they express their lust upon the children of our 
country.
<P>
	Buying sex from children is just as bad as selling it. The sex 
trade in this country is a booming industry in which children appear 
to be a hot commodity. Child sex consumers demand young flesh. 
Pimps are parasites, some of them violent, who happily supply the 
demand. The demand for child prostitutes will not go away as long 
as child sex consumers sleep easily at night knowing their risk for 
arrest is minimal and if caught the penalty is only a maximum of 
five years.
<P>
	According to the B.C. attorney general's office only eight B.C. 
men have been charged for buying sex from a juvenile since 1988. 
By contrast, 215 pimping charges were laid between 1988 and 
1993. Sexually exploited children deserve protection in the 
Criminal Code with all other children who are victims of sexual 
predators.
<P>
	Whether they are sexually abused on the street instead of in their 
homes or schools, the penalty ought to be the same. All children, 
especially those who are products of abusive and dysfunctional 
families which have forced them to retreat to the streets where they 
are further abused, deserve equal protection under the law.
<P>
	If we ever hope to reduce and eventually eliminate juvenile 
prostitution, we must address the reasons children are turning to the 
streets where they are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. Despite 
the justice minister's admission in the fall of 1995 that he had no 
money for crime prevention, we must implement preventive crime 
measures, particularly in relation to juvenile prostitution and in 
relation to young offenders.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	As we go about the country reviewing the Young Offenders Act, 
the 12-year review, we should talk to groups and organizations 
doing early identification and preventive work to keep young 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3586"> 3586 </A></B>
<P>
children out of the criminal justice system, prostitution and the 
drug trade. There are ways and means. We must spend more of the 
$10 billion that we spend at the back end of the system in 
preventive programs. They are there and they need our help. We 
can keep these young kids off the streets, out of prostitution, out of 
drugs and out of the criminal justice system.
<P>
	Those children who are turning to the streets and a life of crime 
must be given an alternative safe haven where they can have some 
hope for and assistance in having a positive and productive future.
<P>
	Finally I touch briefly upon the portion of Bill C-27 regarding 
harassment. We are all aware of the growing problem of domestic 
violence in the country and the need for the section on criminal 
harassment outlined in the bill. We need more legislation and more 
preventive measures in relation to domestic violence in the 
country, including more power for the police to investigate and 
prosecute people who abuse their spouses.
<P>
	If the justice minister thinks Bill C-27 and his gun registration 
legislation are the only measures needed to combat domestic 
violence, I suggest he is wrong. Firearms registration will not 
eliminate or decrease this form of violence. This fact was evident 
in the recent and horrible shooting death of 10 members of a 
Vernon, B.C., family by an estranged and distraught spouse.
<P>
	Now only did the police in that case not follow a 1993 
government policy to investigate cases of domestic violence, 
including those cases where there is no co-operation by the victim, 
they issued a gun permit to a person who had allegations of 
violence and abuse launched against him.
<P>
	I quote from an April 10, 1996 <I>Globe and Mail</I> article which 
states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This mass killing of 10 people last week in Vernon, B.C., has revealed fatal 
flaws and everyday limitations to Canada's much vaunted gun control laws.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The two handguns used-in the killings were acquired legally because there 
weren't enough police officers, enough public funding and enough political 
pressure to pursue tell-tale doubts that he might have been dangerous.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In closing I reiterate my opening statement. We support Bill 
C-27, but we hope to introduce amendments that will enhance its 
effectiveness in eliminating juvenile prostitution, domestic 
violence and female genital mutilation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to start by congratulating my colleague, the hon. member for 
Québec, for her courage and tenacity. She has risen regularly in the 
House to demand new legislation on the practice of genital 
mutilation. She has tenaciously raised several questions with the 
minister regarding these abusive practices.
<P>
	I therefore take pleasure in speaking to this bill for the second 
time, since I did so already when my colleague tabled Bill C-248. I 
am pleased that my colleague's voice has been heard by the 
Minister of Justice, leading us to today's debate on Bill C-27.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to modify the Criminal Code with 
respect to violence toward women and children. It addresses a 
number of aspects, procurement, criminal harassment, and the 
protection of child witnesses, themes which have been addressed in 
greater depth by some of my other colleagues.
<P>
	For my part, I shall be concentrating on two aspects of particular 
importance to me, sex tourism and genital mutilation.
<P>
	In the first case, sex tourism, Bill C-27 modifies the current 
wording in order to make it easier to arrest and prosecute the 
customers of child prostitutes in Canada and elsewhere. This bill 
will remedy an unacceptable situation, one which has often gone 
unpunished in the past.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	The aim of this bill is also to introduce the principle of 
extraterritoriality, which will allow Canada to prosecute an 
individual, even though the act may take place in another country. 
Unlike the Helms-Burton trade legislation in the United States, 
which we oppose, the extraterritorial nature of legislation on sexual 
tourism is intended to protect human rights, basic rights that justify 
setting aside normal legislative principles.
<P>
	The text of Bill C-27 as it stands is, however, incomplete, since it 
does not provide for the prosecution of the promoters of travel 
abroad for the purposes of sexual tourism and of those organizing, 
providing transportation and having any involvement with such 
trips. It would be entirely appropriate to include such provisions so 
the bill would be as complete as possible and so the victims of 
juvenile prosecution may be afforded the best protection possible.
<P>
	The argument that other provisions in the Criminal Code could 
make such prosecution possible does not hold. Where human rights 
are concerned, we cannot run the risk of error or misinterpretation. 
Express provisions should therefore be added to cover these 
categories of offender so it would be clear that they could be 
prosecuted just like those committing the act under the terms of the 
law.
<P>
	In this regard, the wording of Bill C-246 that my colleague for 
Quebec introduced earlier this session is entirely adequate since, in 
addition to forbidding juvenile prostitution, it provides that those 
who take or transport people to a common bawdy-house where 
people under 18 years of age can be found are guilty.
<P>
	The other point which makes me think of Bill C-27 as 
incomplete is the fact that it does not apply to people  who are 
neither Canadian citizens nor landed immigrants. In fact, clause 1 
of the bill states that someone can be prosecuted if this person is a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3587"> 3587 </A></B>
<P>
Canadian citizen or a permanent resident within the meaning of the 
Immigration Act. But there are other categories of people that 
could be included, that is refugees or asylum seekers, for instance.
<P>
	I wish to stop my comments here concerning sexual tourism, 
because I want to spend a little more time commenting female 
genital mutilation. As the critic for health, it is a clause that is of 
particular concern to me, considering my responsibilities.
<P>
	I want it to be clear, however, that it is unacceptable for us to still 
be dealing in 1996 with problems as serious as sexual tourism. 
Abusers still go abroad to satisfy their sexual needs with children. 
We are told that these children are younger and younger, 
considering the HIV contamination that is rampant in developing 
or poor countries, where numerous vacationers travel every year.
<P>
	That is inadmissible. Last week, on Radio-Canada, we saw 
young girls of 10, 11 or 12 years of age and people who were asking 
sexual services from these children declaring freely that it is 
nothing serious since their culture allows that behaviour.
<P>
	This is inadmissible. It is horrendous and it is time that someone 
took the matter in hand and that a clear and complete bill was 
passed. It is time that these practices, which deny children their 
rights, be prohibited and criminalized for once and for all. It is as if 
our children were not persons. We should not sexually abuse 
children; even animals do not do that.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	This is inadmissible. I hope we will pass a significant bill to put 
an end to these practices. It cannot be true that a country like 
Canada, which advocates the protection of human rights, and I 
think that includes child rights, would leave the door open to those 
people who abuse children.
<P>
	I would like to turn to the clause of Bill C-27 concerning 
excision and female genital mutilation. I think that this clause is a 
step in the right direction. But even here, there is room for 
improvement.
<P>
	I have been an active member of women's groups for nearly 30 
years. Right from the first time I met with women's groups, the 
first subject they brought up was their concern about genital 
mutilation. Women's groups across the world have long been 
condemning practices of this kind.
<P>
	It is fortunate that we before us a bill, but it should not, as for 
child sex tourism, barely touch the problem, deal with prevention 
or information, but it must give clear warning that this practice is a 
crime, that any such violation of women's genitals constitutes a 
mutilation. Everybody who comes to this country, everybody who  
lives in this country, must know that, here, in Canada, female 
genital mutilation is a crime, a violation of the Criminal Code, just 
like impaired driving.
<P>
	I would like to address this issue in more detail so as to make the 
people listening to us very much aware of this type of practice. It is 
not a question of five or six cases per year per country. Studies 
published in 1993-1994 show that between 85 and 114 million 
women alive today are the victims of genital mutilation.
<P>
	According to certain recent statistics, their number increases by 
2 million every year in some 40 countries in Africa, Asia, the 
Middle East and elsewhere. These practices are performed on 
young girls aged between 4 and 10 as an average. This is appalling.
<P>
	Although impressive, these statistics say nothing of the trauma 
endured by these girls, most of them very young. They say nothing 
of the pain during and after these mutilations, nor the health 
problems several will be plagued with for the rest of their lives.
<P>
	Often performed under dubious conditions by people without 
any medical knowledge, mutilations may cause many health 
conditions. I will only name a few: haemorrhaging, incontinence, 
abscess, infection, trauma, state of chock, and infertility among 
others.
<P>
	To perform these procedures, poorly sterilized instruments are 
used, sometimes a simple kitchen knife. According to a document 
issued by the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women, 
sugar, eggs, thorns and palm ribs are also used. These irreversible 
procedures are extremely painful and often performed without 
anaesthesia, and they often result in sexual and psychological 
trauma and complications for the victim. I do not believe it 
necessary to describe this practice to understand what we are 
dealing with.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	It is clear this practice is unacceptable and must absolutely not 
be tolerated. Furthermore, we must make sure that those guilty of 
such an act are severely punished.
<P>
	The justice minister decided not to create a specific offense for 
excision. His decision is based on two arguments: first, those who 
practice excision can be prosecuted under existing provisions. It is 
very hard to do so in a country such as ours because, when people 
arrive here, that practice is part of their culture and they will not 
denounce each other.
<P>
	So, how can we prosecute those guilty of excision? We must 
tell all the people who come to Canada that here, it is a criminal 
act and that we will not tolerate it. That is why I said earlier that 
we should not say it is already in the Criminal Code. That is not 
enough. We have made several requests along that line before. It 
was part of the bill presented by my colleague, the member for 
Quebec. It does not work.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3588"> 3588 </A></B>
<P>
	Several doctors across Canada have said that they often get 
phone calls or visits by people who ask them to perform an 
excision. Their code of ethics keeps them from denouncing those 
people to the RCMP. We saw recently the case of a young girl, 
about four years old, whose mother had gone shopping and whose 
grandmother decided to perform that mutilation on the child. Do 
you think the mother, deeply upset by what the grandmother had 
done, would have reported her to the RCMP and ask that she be 
imprisoned? That is the type of situation we are talking about. 
People for whom excision is a cultural practice must know, when 
they come to our country, that it is a criminal act here and that 
if ever there are accusations against them, they will go to prison.
<P>
	Second, the justice minister decided to focus on education and 
prevention. In my opinion, this is not reason enough to justify not 
creating a separate offence. As I said earlier, I am all for prevention 
and information. This should be done, but it is just not enough. In 
the words of Machiavelli, virtue alone has no effect unless it is 
reinforced by a degree of deterrence. Hence the need to include in 
the Criminal Code a provision dealing specifically with female 
genital mutilation, so that people will see that this particular 
practice is illegal in our country.
<P>
	Similarly, in light of the fact that the operation on Canadian 
nationals is often carried out abroad, the minister should give the 
provision on female genital mutilation extraterritorial effect, as he 
did for child sex tourism. It would then be possible to prosecute in 
Canada persons who take a child abroad or arrange her transport for 
the operation to be carried out. This extraterritorial effect would 
prevent these persons from continuing to circumvent the law and 
more efficiently protect children, which is the stated purpose of the 
act.
<P>
	Third, I would like to dispute the exception made for so-called 
necessary surgical procedures, as the medical profession does not 
recognize female genital mutilation as a medical act. There is 
therefore no need to provide for such procedures in a piece of 
legislation.
<P>
	There is also a provision in Bill C-27 about an adult consenting 
to a form of genital mutilation.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	I reject this possibility with great vigour as it defeats the 
purpose, which is eradicating female genital mutilation.
<P>
	In the name of what principle can we state in an enactment that a 
person can consent to mutilation? How do we expect to eradicate 
an age-old cultural practice which is widespread in certain cultures 
by providing for consent? A 22 or 23-year old immigrant may then 
request to be mutilated because, in her family and culture, she has 
so been indoctrinated. This is an unacceptable practice and it is 
imperative that it be prohibited here, in Canada; whatever the 
reason, this practice is reprehensible.
<P>
	Prevention, yes, but we must first pass specific legislation to that 
effect, like Bill C-235, which would make the practice of female 
genital mutilation illegal. After all, why close the barn door after 
the horse has left?
<P>
	In conclusion, education and prevention are all fine and good, 
but they are not enough. We must monitor the situation, find and 
denounce the culprits and, above all, really punish them.
<P>
	We must act quickly, because the existing provisions do not 
prevent this practice. There are more and more serious concerns 
about the effectiveness of a simple policy of prevention through 
education. The only avenue remaining is for legislators to enact an 
extraterritorial law that applies to the whole population and 
criminalizes practices such as excision, sex tourism, harassment 
and other forms of abuse.
<P>
	Bill C-27 may represent a step in the right direction, but there are 
still many improvements to be made to correct this situation in a 
really effective way once and for all.
<P>
	France, Great Britain and Sweden have already done so. Norway 
and several American states have also tightened their laws in this 
regard. The time has come for us to take concrete action in this 
matter. It must be made clear to everyone that sexual violence 
against women and children is unacceptable and will not be 
tolerated in any way, shape or form. Everyone must know that these 
are criminal acts and that those who commit them, whether here or 
elsewhere in the world, cannot escape justice and will have to 
answer for their actions before the law.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for her comments. However, a number of 
things are, with respect, in error.
<P>
	It was suggested it would not be illegal to conduct female genital 
mutilation on someone over the age of 18. That is not the case. It is 
illegal. The supreme court has made it very clear one cannot 
consent to aggravated assault, which female genital mutilation is, 
and therefore it is illegal.
<P>
	It was also suggested tour operators or those who organize sex 
tours are not subject to the law. As I indicated before, the Criminal 
Code already contains provisions which specifically make it clear 
that travel agents or tour operators offering sex tours are guilty of a 
criminal offence in Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3589"> 3589 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	It was also suggested that people who travel outside the country 
to have female genital mutilation performed  would not be subject 
to the law. This is also an error in that anybody who leaves the 
country for the purpose of committing a criminal offence, which 
female genital mutilation is, is guilty of an offence.
<P>
	I wanted to clarify some misconceptions put forward but I thank 
hon. members for their general support of the legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Picard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
comments. I say to the member: why make an exception? We are 
here to defend the integrity of all women and all children. Why 
come up with an exception? If we agree that female genital 
mutilation is illegal, if we prohibit it here and if it is not practised 
here in this country, why would we make an exception and put an 
age limit whereby a woman over eighteen years of age would have 
the right to have that surgical procedure done to her?
<P>
	As I said, and I may not have made it clear enough, there are 
certain cultures which resort to what we call brainwashing. Women 
are told: ``You will not find a husband if you do not go along with 
this practice''. Women who want to marry see this as cultural 
information and think the practice is an acceptable one. So, they 
will ask that it be performed on them.
<P>
	We say that here in Canada we do not want this to be done to 
anyone, whether the person is 18, 5 or 40 years old. The bill 
introduced by my colleague sought, as she pointed out, to ensure 
that this practice would not be tolerated in Canada, regardless of 
age.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to support the inconsistency my hon. friend pointed out.
<P>
	If the existing law is there to protect adult women now, why does 
that law not now protect those under the age of 18 as well? If the 
law is there in sufficient form to protect those over 18, why is it not 
there to protect those under 18?
<P>
	I see an inconsistency. To clarify it and leave no doubt, I am sure 
we will be bringing amendments in to do that very thing. For 
greater clarification to everyone concerned in this issue, I would 
like to see that part of the bill changed so that it does not seem to 
exclude anyone over the age of 18.
<P>
	This legislation should state that clearly and unequivocally. I 
support the member in her concern.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank you 
for giving me the opportunity to speak today in support of the 
changes the government wishes to make to the preamble of the 
Oceans Act. It is no coincidence if Canada's motto is ``a mari usque 
ad mare'', from sea to sea. There is no country in this world more 
influenced by the sea than Canada.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	Canada is, by definition, a maritime country. We are surrounded 
by three oceans, the Atlantic, the Pacific and the Arctic Oceans. 
Most of our southern boundary is made up of a true inland sea, the 
Great Lakes. Throughout the years, the exuberance of seafaring life 
along the coasts has helped to define Canadian culture and identity, 
due in part to the coastal communities of the First Nations, the 
European whalers and fishermen unafraid to sail the high seas to 
come and harvest our marine resources, and the first settlers who 
came from the old world to start a new life along the coast of this 
new found world that came to be known as Newfoundland.
<P>
	The large marine ecosystems along our coasts are varied, 
productive and precious. We have the responsibility at the national 
as well as the international levels to protect our marine heritage 
both for ourselves and for the future generations.
<P>
	In its motion to amend Bill C-26, the Oceans Act, the 
government proposes to add four new statements in the preamble, 
which have been discussed and approved by the Standing 
Committee on Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3591"> 3591 </A></B>
<P>
	In trying to amend the preamble, the government wants to 
ensure that the wishes of the many witnesses the standing 
committee heard are taken into consideration in this legislation. 
The government is going about this in several ways.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The first statement is a recognition of the distinct qualities of the 
three oceans of Canada and a recognition that these oceans are the 
common heritage of all Canadians. This sentiment was expressed 
eloquently by a number of witnesses representing fishing 
organizations as well as by the aboriginal authorities who were also 
witnesses at the standing committee.
<P>
	The second statement the government proposes to add as 
statement No. 5 to the preamble holds that conservation based on 
an ecosystem is of fundamental importance to maintaining 
biological diversity and productivity in the marine environment. 
This principle is the basis of a new oceans management strategy to 
be developed following enactment of the legislation. Amending the 
preamble in this manner responds to the many representations of 
witnesses before the standing committee and is consistent with the 
government's approach to conservation.
<P>
	The third statement the government proposed to add would fall 
as the sixth statement of the current preamble. This amendment 
would emphasize that Canada promotes the application of the 
proportionary approach to conservation management and 
exploitation of marine resources to protect those marine resources 
and to preserve the marine environment. That is to say, as a nation 
we would rather err on the side of caution than wait until harsh 
consequences of dithering idly confront us before taking action to 
preserve our cherished and fragile marine resources.
<P>
	Canada strongly advocated the inclusion of the proportionary 
approach in the convention on straddling stocks and highly 
migratory species. It is only natural to include this principle in our 
domestic legislation.
<P>
	The final amendment to the preamble proposed by the 
government addresses comments made by ocean industries and 
regards the opportunities offered by our oceans. It would be the 
seventh statement of the preamble. It reflects that Canada 
recognizes the oceans and their resources offer significant 
opportunities for economic diversification and the generation of 
wealth to the benefit of all Canadians, in particular coastal 
communities.
<P>
	All these amendments draw into the body of the preamble 
concepts that Canadians expressed from the legislation. It is 
co-operative legislation that will make it possible for Canadians to 
work together to preserve our ocean resources.
<P>
	The motions brought forward by the opposition suggest further 
amendments, specifically to provide  provincial jurisdiction over 
the management of oceans and marine resources. With respect, this
<P>
is an attempt to alter the authority granted the provinces under the 
Constitution. There is no need constitutionally to reiterate the 
federal government's commitment to a collaborative approach to 
oceans management. This is already contained in the preamble 
which highlights the role of the provinces and other stakeholders.
<P>
	The particular statement of the preamble to which I am referring 
states that in exercising the powers and performing the duties and 
functions assigned to the minister by the act, the minister shall 
co-operate with other ministers, boards and agencies of the 
Government of Canada, with provincial and territorial 
governments and with affected aboriginal organizations. The 
provinces are specifically mentioned again in clause 33(2), a clause 
dealing with consultation.
<P>
	Does this sound like an exclusionary act? Does this sound like an 
act that wants to take away the rights and privileges of provinces? 
Of course it does not. It is not an act that attempts to do this. The 
government would not be here promoting Bill C-26 if it were such 
an act.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	The act does not attempt to make any changes to the present 
constitutional framework or to the distribution of powers between 
the federal government and the provinces. How could it by way of 
ordinary legislation? It does not encroach in any way on provincial 
rights. Nor does it add to them.
<P>
	The bill before the House today calls on all Canadians, including 
the provinces, to come together to develop a strategy that combines 
a harnessing of the oceans' economic potential with respect for the 
oceans' environmental needs. The national environmental agenda 
can no longer be separated from the national economic agenda or 
the social foreign policy agendas.
<P>
	The preamble to Bill C-26 is visionary, thorough and inclusive. 
It is the convergence of visions of all Canadians from all across the 
nation for responsible ocean management. Members of the 
Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans have worked hard to 
make those visions a reality in the legislation. They worked hard to 
ensure that Bill C-26 is inclusionary and that it fosters co-operation 
between the federal government and the provinces.
<P>
	Provincial involvement in the management of our oceans is a 
given with the collaborative approach espoused by the bill. For that 
reason I hope all members will support the Canada Oceans Act and 
all it represents for ocean management, and Motion No. 1 proposed 
by the government to amend the preamble. At the same time I 
recommend members vote down the official opposition's proposed 
amendments, Motions Nos. 2, 3 and 4, as unnecessary, given the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3592"> 3592 </A></B>
<P>
statements already  contained within the preamble and those 
proposed by the government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member who 
just spoke in this House tried to minimize the importance of our 
amendments and, before reacting to his remarks, I would like to 
react to the amendment brought forward by the government. I will 
remind the House that it is a motion to amend an act intituled An 
Act respecting the oceans of Canada.
<P>
	There are, of course, three oceans. Quebec is particularly 
concerned with the Atlantic and its gulf. We can see that the bill is a 
new way for the federal government to try to and go even further in 
its attack on resources at all levels.
<P>
	As a former member of the human resources development 
committee, I was surprised when I saw this legislation, when I saw 
that, even in the area of natural resources, the federal government 
had the same thing in mind, that is to ignore the provinces, 
particularly Quebec. Obviously Quebec's interests are our first 
priority, and we can see in this bill that the provinces are treated 
like municipalities or any community.
<P>
	For the federal government, the national strategy is inspired by 
Captain Canada, the former Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, the 
one who admonished Spain and all that. It looks like the federal 
government has all the responsibilities. The government develops 
this plan and thinks that the opposition will sit idly and watch as 
this attack is going on on all fronts.
<P>
	So, what does the Liberal Party's Motion No. 1 contain? Wishful 
thinking. A lot of it. This is what I would call a hypocritical move 
to make them look good. It is true that the notion of provincial 
governments has been included, but it is buried in amongst 
aboriginal organizations, coastal communities and other persons 
and bodies.
<P>
	If the federal government truly wishes to respect provincial 
governments, let it show it by passing the motions proposed by the 
Bloc Quebecois, the official opposition, which really involve the 
provinces. Without some concrete action by the federal 
government, this motion remains a smoke screen.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	What do we hope to accomplish with Motions Nos. 2, 3 and 4? 
We want it clearly included in the bill that the provinces of Canada 
must be able to exercise their jurisdiction with respect to oceans 
and their resources. Limiting the federal government's power by 
including and respecting the power of the provinces is the whole 
focus of the official opposition's efforts concerning the 
amendments to this bill.
<P>
	Even if the motions are short, I think they should be read. They 
are being skimmed over as if it made no difference. Motion No. 2 
proposes the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``WHEREAS the provinces of Canada also exercise legislative jurisdiction 
with respect to oceans and their resources,''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Motion No. 3 proposes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-26, in the Preamble, be amended by replacing line 15, on page 1, 
with the following: </BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``sources in concert with the provinces, taking into account the areas of 
jurisdiction of each level of government;''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Motion No. 4 proposes that Bill C-26, in the Preamble-we 
know how important the preamble is in the Constitution, and it is 
the same in acts-be amended as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``and Oceans, in collaboration with provincial governments, with 
interested''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
bodies.
<P>
	We are presenting these motions because we know history often 
repeats itself. Quebecers feel that they have often been tricked by 
the federal government in the past. I am trying to think of an 
equivalent ocean image. I have one. Coming from the riding of 
Lévis, where MIL Davie is located, I would say that we have often 
watched others sail on by.
<P>
	This time we will be vigilant, and we are saying that, through its 
amendments, the federal government is still trying to reinforce its 
role and steamroller ahead with centralization. All the people from 
the Gaspé, from the Baie des Chaleurs, from the Gulf and from the 
North Shore are asking the official opposition to defend them. That 
is what we intend to do in this House and in committee.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in speaking to the 
motions before the House the Reform Party would like to be on 
record as saying that we agree with the parliamentary secretary on 
Motion No. 1. We will be supporting it because it fits with what we 
believe Canadians want. It certainly fits with what the Reform 
Party has been talking about, which is an ecosystem conservation 
based approach to our oceans, coastal waters and estuaries.
<P>
	In speaking to Motions Nos. 2, 3 and 4, the Bloc amendments, 
we offer the following. It is very clear a great deal of hostility is 
generated in the regions of Canada toward Ottawa over either the 
real or perceived overlap of jurisdiction or imposing of jurisdiction 
where Ottawa is interjecting itself in areas where it ought not to be.
<P>
	I certainly understand the feelings of the members in the Bloc 
and other members in the House, along with people right across the 
country, when it comes to the question of jurisdiction.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3593"> 3593 </A></B>
<P>
	Upon examining the oceans act and upon contemplating what 
is attempted to be achieved in the act, it is clear many of the 
concerns members of the Bloc or members in other regions of 
Canada might have with respect to Ottawa's jurisdiction cannot 
be overcome by transferring that jurisdiction to provinces.
<P>
	For example, many marine resources are transitory: fish, 
wildlife, seals, birds and so on. They do not respect international 
boundaries as they do not respect provincial boundaries. They 
continue in their life cycles without regard to human action or 
human activity.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	It is therefore very important that we have a national approach to 
husbanding and looking out for Canada's marine resources. Not 
only that, there are many international aspects and implications for 
Canada's marine resources and the oceans act does address them in 
a responsible manner for the most part. However, it is incumbent 
upon the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to engage in a much 
broader consultation with the provinces in many areas. That is why 
on Motion No. 3 we will be moving a subamendment. We have 
given notice to both the Liberal Party and the Bloc that we will be 
moving a subamendment. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Motion No. 3 be amended by deleting the following: ``taking into 
account the areas of jurisdiction of each level of government''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I will take the 
subamendment under advisement and I will return to the House 
without too much delay.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, we were speaking to motions in Group 
No. 2, on which the hon. member has already spoken, whereas 
there are still some speakers left on this side of the House who 
would like to discuss Group No. 2. I therefore respectfully ask you, 
Mr. Speaker, to recognize the hon. member for Richelieu, who 
would like to speak on Group No. 2.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I remember full well that the 
parliamentary secretary started off the debate on the first group of 
motions, Group No. 2. I have just given the floor to the 
parliamentary secretary to the Minister of International Trade; it is 
not the same one. It is now Mr. Macdonald, the member for 
Dartmouth.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
for International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to see 
this bill return to the House at report stage.
<P>
	In a previous life in a past Parliament I had the privilege to chair 
the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans. I thank all 
members of that committee, including the current chair, the hon. 
member for  Egmont, for the diligent work which was done by 
them in looking at this bill.
<P>
	I also commend the hon. member for Skeena who was on the 
committee. He showed that he has a deep interest and a very deep 
understanding of the requirement of governments to look 
periodically at the way they do things with a measure toward doing 
them a little better, with a little more consistency and a little more 
efficiency.
<P>
	With respect to the comments which were made a moment ago 
by our colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois, I would have to say 
unfortunately that I cannot be as magnanimous. Some of the 
amendments which I see in this first batch are not reflective of the 
support the bill received from a wide variety of sources as we 
deliberated it in committee. The Bloc Quebecois seemed more 
interested not in improving the bill but in making statements about 
Quebec sovereignty and jurisdiction. That is unfortunate but as 
every committee member has the right to do, their time is their 
own. It is their own nickel and they can do with it as they see fit.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	I cannot help but note that the amendments put forward by the 
Bloc Quebecois in no way reflected the testimony we heard. Some 
of the amendments that were put forward by the Reform Party, 
some of which I did not agree with, had some basis in fact. 
Individuals we heard had different points of view on various 
aspects of the bill and the member from the Reform Party would 
find some support there.
<P>
	This bill is very long overdue. The individuals we heard from in 
the environmental sector, the individuals who are most impacted by 
this bill said that this bill was too long in coming. They applauded 
that the bill had been put forward. Many had different points of 
view about various aspects of the bill and suggestions as to how 
those various aspects could be improved upon. However, they all 
agreed that an oceans act was long overdue.
<P>
	With a country like Canada and its maritime coastal zones from 
sea to sea to sea which is one of the longest continuous coastlines in 
the entire world, most said it was high time there was some order 
put into the very statutes and programs the federal government 
administers which have an impact on the marine resource. This bill 
seeks to consolidate under one minister, one department and one 
act much of that activity and much has been done. Over 14 different 
programs or departmental areas are under one jurisdiction now, that 
is, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	There was a lot of to-ing and fro-ing from various bureaucrats 
and various ministries as to why some of the jurisdictional issues 
should best be left with environment or with natural resources. I 
argued then as I will today that the oceans act is a good first step 
but that we must continue to look at some of the areas that might be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3594"> 3594 </A></B>
<P>
better  placed directly under the jurisdiction of the minister of 
fisheries.
<P>
	I think of some pieces of legislation that are currently with the 
Minister of the Environment dealing with deep ocean dumping and 
also with the Arctic Ocean that should be further studied by a 
committee of this place, perhaps a subcommittee or a joint 
committee of the fisheries and oceans committee and the 
environment and sustainable development committee. There has 
been some discussion and I hope this is not seen as the end of this 
work but is seen to be the very important beginning of a longer 
examination.
<P>
	There were some great witnesses. We heard from many 
witnesses. We heard from Canadian Arctic Resource Council 
which was instrumental in guiding us through this bill. When 
people asked what kind of consultation had been done before the 
bill came before the Parliament of Canada, all one had to do was 
look at the CARC brief. CARC had worked for quite a long time 
and had become the spokesperson for dozens and dozens of 
interested organizations and groups. When it came down to the 
short strokes, CARC was instrumental in assisting me as chairman 
and assisting the committee in coming up with some of the words 
and some of the amendments that further clarified this bill and 
made it a better piece of legislation.
<P>
	I want to thank the people at the World Wildlife Fund, 
Greenpeace, the many fishermen we heard from, and many others 
who had an interest and came forward. In every case they came 
forward with the express interest not of scuttling the bill, not of 
putting it off, but of genuinely trying to improve it.
<P>
	This bill works on a precautionary principle. It works on the 
principle of sustainable development. It clearly indicates that the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has the primary responsibility in 
various areas dealing with sustainable development, the marine 
resource.
<P>
	It instils in the minister the responsibility to take a co-ordinated 
approach with his cabinet colleagues and departments to ensure 
that those principles are the primary principles under which all 
government programs and legislation is reviewed with respect to 
Canada's oceans. That is very important.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	One of the most important things that has happened and which 
the bill speaks to is it also ensures there is a new terminology on the 
Canadian political landscape, which is marine protected areas. For 
many years environmentalists such as those in CARC and the 
World Wildlife Fund, fishermen and the Nunavut have indicated 
very clearly that there is a need for the establishment of marine 
protected areas in Canadian legislation. These are areas with such 
unique ecosystems that they must be protected under Canadian law. 
Someone has to take charge and make sure there is a single 
individual with the  responsibility to protect those areas of our 
oceans with unique ecosystems. That has been established in this 
bill. It is probably one reason this bill has received so much public 
attention and support.
<P>
	I want to close by indicating how pleased I am that the 
government with the support of the main parties in the House have 
agreed to bring this bill back. One concern I had when we ended the 
last session was that the very good work done by committees would 
have been for naught.
<P>
	In this case the committee can stand proud and show that all 
members, no matter what their political stripe, can have a very 
positive impact on legislation that goes through this place. There is 
no question there were some problems. I mentioned that the Bloc 
Quebecois continued to put amendments forward and they will 
defend those amendments in the House.
<P>
	Those amendments were not supported by any testimony we 
heard. Rather they were a part of their political ideology and 
philosophy that at every turn in the road they will try to attack 
anything that even looks like a humiliation of the province of 
Quebec or that somehow every piece of federal legislation is trying 
to take something away from provincial jurisdiction. I can say with 
a clear mind and a clear conscience there is nothing in the bill 
which takes away from any provincial jurisdiction, including 
Quebec.
<P>
	It is unfortunate that the only real problem we had when 
examining this bill was when we heard from the fishermen and 
plant workers from Nova Scotia. The problem we had was that an 
irresponsible member of the provincial legislature, a New 
Democrat, Mr. Chisolm, who has since gone on to be the leader of 
the New Democratic Party in Nova Scotia, almost incited the 
fishermen and the fish plant workers into a riot by saying that the 
bill was going to impose fees, privatize the fishery, and all of these 
ugly things that people on this side of the House do not support.
<P>
	What he did was very reckless. My understanding is that Mr. 
Chisolm, who I guess aspires to be the premier of the province of 
Nova Scotia some day, did not even bother to read the bill before he 
set out on his task of going around the province delivering 
misinformation at every turn of the road. I am sure that Mr. 
Chisolm has lost some of his personal charisma because the men 
and women from the fishery who chose to appear before the 
committee did have a concern and listened to what we had to say. I 
hope today they are supporting the report of the committee that the 
bill goes forward expeditiously and finally we will have the Canada 
Oceans Act proclaimed as law.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
astonished to hear the former chair of the Standing Committee on 
Fisheries and Oceans exhibit such  ignorance on this matter. He 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3595"> 3595 </A></B>
<P>
speaks of the unanimity of the witnesses heard, supposedly in 
favour of this bill, whereas a number of them, the majority, I would 
even say, saw a need for change, for very concrete amendments. 
According to the correspondence and the many phone calls 
received by the Bloc Quebecois, they would like to see the official 
opposition reel in this bill to make amendments to it, particularly 
along the lines of Motions Nos. 2, 3, and 4, the group of motions 
we are discussing today.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	If this hon. member is serious, if this government is serious, let 
them stop talking about respecting jurisdictions, let them adopt the 
motions we have presented, which address exactly that. Our hon. 
colleague from the Reform Party was saying more or less the same 
thing just now. Moreover, Mr. Speaker, the amendment you are 
having your officers look at right now is along the lines of what I 
have referred to. I know they are being guided by your wisdom, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	I was saying that, despite arguments by the Government of 
Quebec, reasonable claims and not matters of privilege, the 
province's fair share has always been manipulated if not 
engineered by the government, and worse in the case of a Liberal 
federal government, because that says it all.
<P>
	It means engineering and on a grand scale. It means prolific, but 
unkept, federal election promises-the GST, Canadian heritage, for 
example, the fact that copyright would be a matter for the 
Department of Canadian Heritage rather than the Department of 
Industry-all this appears in the election promises in the red book 
but it is all swept aside.
<P>
	After the election, they return to the good old days of Liberal 
engineering, trickery, the old boys network-as protected by the 
former Minister of Canadian Heritage, who hosted 20 people at a 
$2,000 a person cocktail party, thus raising $40,000 for the party. 
Seven of these people had been given government discretionary 
contracts directly by his department.
<P>
	This is the government, with its good old Liberal habits. They 
look after their friends; they appoint lawyers to head commissions. 
Out comes the money, and friends are well cared for. When it 
comes to revealing names in committee on financial protection or 
transfers of $2 billion, that sort of thing must remain secret, in 
order to protect party coffers. This is, in essence, the Liberal 
government. And they ask us to trust them, to believe in them, to 
trust that things are being done right, that jurisdictions will be 
respected. When did the federal government ever respect 
provincial jurisdictions?
<P>
	Mines are not under its jurisdiction, but it has its nose stuck in 
them. Same thing for tourism. How many departments has the 
government stuck its big foot in that, constitutionally, should be 
run by the provinces? In  sticking its big foot in, the government 
has simply aggravated problems and created division. Is this a 
government we want to trust?
<P>
	As the previous speaker, the parliamentary secretary, has just 
said, we want what is expressed very clearly in amendments Nos. 
2, 3 and 4. And yet here again we are dreaming. I remind the 
parliamentary secretary, who spoke to us earlier, that such dreams 
are often decisions that were not made at the right time.
<P>
	We have long wanted to put everything together under a single 
department and to improve all aspects of management from coast 
to coast, as the first speaker was saying. We do not, however, want 
this to be done at our expense, and this division into three parts is 
exactly what outraged all the opponents who appeared before the 
committee, as Quebec once again will end up paying the highest 
price. Once again, this reform will be carried out at our expense.
<P>
	Even though it is nothing new, even though we are used to being 
had, in this case, you will hear us on every motion, you will hear us 
in committee; we will win this fight because the whole population 
will be strongly opposed. You will have to answer for your actions 
in the next election campaign, which may come earlier than you 
think. I do not advise them to go ahead and try.
<P>
	It would be really bad timing with the kind of bills we have been 
dealing with lately, especially this one, which will have a very 
significant economic impact on Quebec. It will turn the situation 
completely around and may push maritime transport toward the 
United States, especially Philadelphia, which developed a very 
aggressive policy to attract clients, or move more deeply into the 
east as far as Quebec's major ports are concerned.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	We would like to improve this bill. We do not want to vote 
against it, but we would like the government to pay close attention 
to our suggestions and to take concrete action, that is to say, we 
would like the Liberals to sign some papers because they never 
keep their word.
<P>
	The worst thing that could happen is to give responsibility for 
such a vague bill to this Prime Minister, who personifies all the 
Liberal shenanigans since he has been in that party for more than 
25 years, as well as their many broken promises and their 
characteristic administrative mediocrity when in power, and who 
would reject the logical and proper amendments we are proposing. 
It would be a little like putting Dracula in charge of the Red Cross 
blood bank. That is about what would happen if we trusted the 
government with this. I can hear people in the audience laughing, 
but the example I just gave you is much more serious than you 
think.
<P>
	Like all its predecessors, the Liberal government embodies the 
failure to honour not only its own  commitments but also, when 
given the opportunity in a bill, the intentions of those who voted in 
favour, of the committees who heard witnesses, and of the 
witnesses who came to demand changes or to propose amendments 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3596"> 3596 </A></B>
<P>
that would help all the people directly affected by the proposed 
restructuring.
<P>
	In closing, I say to the Liberals that, if they are really acting in 
good faith, if they really want this bill to be passed quickly and 
properly, as my colleague was saying earlier, they should look at 
these issues in a more comprehensive and respectful way and find 
other arguments than those used by the previous speaker to reject 
the changes wanted by the people, the users and the Bloc 
Quebecois as well as by several members of the Reform Party who 
spoke to this bill. The government has an opportunity to show how 
open it is to valuable suggestions, and I hope that amendments 2, 3 
and 4 will be supported by most of the members in this House.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I am ready to give a ruling 
on the amendment moved by the member for Skeena that Motion 
No. 3 be amended by deleting the following: ``taking into account 
the areas of jurisdiction of each level of government''. That 
amendment is in order.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
rise in this House this evening to speak on this bill. I must confess 
that I am fresh off the plane. Modern transportation enables us to 
travel rather quickly from one end of the country to the other.
<P>
	The important thing to remember about this bill is that 13 groups 
of motions relate to it. The bill has three parts. The first group of 
motions deal with the first part of the bill, whose main intent is to 
incorporate the new law of the sea vocabulary, under the new 
United Nations convention Canada has not yet signed.
<P>
	There may be worthwhile elements in there. I caught bits and 
pieces of the remarks made by the committee's former chairman, 
and I should perhaps put a couple of things right. We may agree on 
the need to upgrade certain aspects, but when we have to ask that 
the provinces' jurisdiction be respected, why is it that it takes them 
so long to understand?
<P>
	My reading of the situation is that what is proposed to us in this 
bill and in the amendments put forward by the Liberals is just 
diluting the amendments we had discussed at committee, drowning 
the fish so to speak.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	I have nothing against coastal or aboriginal communities or any 
other persons and bodies concerned with ocean management. Not 
at all. My point is that this umbrella legislation will have tentacular 
ramifications. We will see later that the purpose of Part II is to 
develop  a management strategy involving all the various 
departments.
<P>
	I would like to have the assurance that the provinces and 
territories that make up Canada will be heard at the first level of 
consultation. Why try to dilute this principle?
<P>
	At this point, I would like to make a short digression. I was not 
going to raise the issue today, but I was led to do so. We are not 
trying to talk only about sovereignty and to play politics but, last 
December, in this House, the other side passed a motion 
recognizing Quebec as a distinct society. That day, the government 
wanted to tell us we were different, but when it comes to 
legislation, it refuses to state clearly that Quebec is a player in the 
process.
<P>
	The other provinces may not be interested, or they may not see 
things the way we do regarding this legislation and how to manage 
fisheries and waters adjacent to their coasts. This is fine, but why 
try to take away from us the right to manage these waters and 
fisheries, the right to take part in this process? I have been 
wondering about this for two and a half years.
<P>
	I will always protect and actively promote the interests of 
Quebecers. I tried to do so through my work on the committee on 
Bill C-26, but in vain. I do not have it with me, but I even received 
a letter from our former colleague from the other side, Brian Tobin, 
concerning this bill, in which he said: ``Mr. Bernier, your 
suggestion regarding a real partnership will be implemented''. This 
was not done.
<P>
	If Mr. Tobin was sincere-and I believe he was when he made 
these comments-, and assuming he were still a member of this 
government, I think he would take into account our proposed 
amendments. He would be true to his word and he would support 
these amendments, which only seek to ensure relations between the 
federal and provincial governments are clearly defined, because 
this is not currently the case. The provinces are included, but so are 
other interest groups and it should not be the case. It should not be 
the case.
<P>
	Let me give you one last example. About two weeks ago, two or 
three provinces were involved in the crab fishery dispute. The 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, who is here right now, did 
nothing. He did not meet with the workers concerned.
<P>
	Who made an effort to settle the issue? It is the provinces. 
Quebec met with its workers, and so did New Brunswick. Given 
such facts, why is it that the federal government does not want to 
give priority, in an act, to relations with the provinces?
<P>
	New Brunswick was reluctantly dragged into the crab fishery 
conflict. From the outset, its fisheries minister said the issue came 
under federal jurisdiction. It turned out to be a mistake, since 
people in his riding threw stones at his house when he told them to 
go back fishing  because the minister did not want to budge. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3597"> 3597 </A></B>
<P>
main thing is that the province was forced to get involved in the 
conflict, even though the issue came under federal jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	New Brunswick had to come up with solutions for its own 
residents. That is the conclusion drawn by the New Brunswick 
Minister of Fisheries, who does not agree at all with the 
sovereignty option I support. According to this minister, the 
members of the provincial legislative assemblies are closer to the 
people, they are more aware of the problems; they are also the ones 
who took the beating this time.
<P>
	I do not think it will be the last time. More and more often, the 
people are going to appeal to their MLAs. True, here, in Ottawa, we 
are a bit out of touch with reality. We are blinded, not sufficiently 
aware of what is going on in the ridings.
<P>
	I have always thought that for every local problem there was a 
local solution. People came up with solutions. There are 
negotiations under way, but I will not elaborate on this issue for 
now. All this to show that, in spite of themselves, the provinces 
must take an active part in management, along with the 
government which drafted this piece of legislation.
<P>
	Since we are still part of the federal system, something I have to 
acknowledge, can we get some recognition? Anyway, we-that is 
to say the provinces-will have a key role to play. They must report 
to Ottawa the whys and wherefores of the wishes of their residents. 
They have to negotiate with Ottawa. They have to ensure that 
Ottawa has understood. They sometimes have to put their vision 
against the vision of the other provinces, to ensure that the great 
legislator in Ottawa will be enlightened when the time comes.
<P>
	This bill hints at the development of a management strategy. 
They talk about an integrated oceans management system, with all 
that it implies, but what we need to do at the outset is to define our 
position with the provinces, and that is not being done. This is more 
than just rhetoric, more than a war of words, it is a true statement of 
the real need to operate this way.
<P>
	Those who claim to be uninterested in this type of partnership 
will see their relationship with the federal government unchanged. 
The first thing we have to realize is that some of the players are 
different, they have different problems and different needs. I will 
limit my comments to this group of motions.
<P>
	I will listen to the debate tonight. I will be here tomorrow if it is 
still under consideration. As long as the government does not get 
the message, we will repeat it over and over again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to take a few minutes to speak  to this bill, which in 
my view reveals the federal government's true intentions with 
regard to the evolution of Canadian federalism.
<P>
	It seems an obvious response to all those who dream of a 
decentralized Canada that could, for some federalists, be a 
response to the legitimate aspirations toward sovereignty of the 
people of Quebec.
<P>
	According to one school of thought, Canada could be more 
decentralized. Since the provincial governments are closer to their 
constituents, they should have more powers to provide for the 
welfare of the people.
<P>
	Here is a bill where the federal government barely recognizes the 
existence of the provincial governments, putting them on an equal 
footing with aboriginal communities, coastal communities and 
other stakeholders, even though this legislation affects directly 
Canadians from each of the 10 provinces. When one adds that to 
what it wants to do with the securities commission, the coast guard, 
etc., one gets a pretty good idea of the government's intentions.
<P>
<B>(1850)</B>
<P>
	This can also be seen in another aspect of the activity of the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans, where the government wants 
to impose a tax on all water equipment. If you have a cottage and if 
you have the misfortune of owning a pedalboat, a canoe, a rowboat 
or a sailboard, your pleasure will be diminished from now on 
because you will have to pay a $5 to $35 tax to the federal 
government for this equipment. And all that without any direct 
involvement of or consultation with the provincial governments. 
The federal government intends to establish partnerships with all 
kinds of regional organizations so it can collect these new 
revenues. And the excuse-the minister has mentioned it several 
times already-is public safety, because there have been some 
drownings. Well, of course, when you are around water, there may 
be drownings every year.
<P>
	It is hard to disagree, all the more so because public safety is the 
only argument the government has really used to justify slapping 
another tax on the humble citizen in his pursuit of recreation, not 
being sure it could count on those whose boats truly qualify as 
pleasure craft, with all the costs that these entail, when you are 
talking about boats 20, 30, 40 or 50 feet long that must have a 
captain on board, and knowing that this falls in the private domain. 
Personally, I would be curious to know how these people actually 
are taxed, how they do their bit for the national treasury, when we 
know that the reason the operation concerning pleasure boats is so 
extensive is to ensure that the tax man gets his bite.
<P>
	To get back to my premise, I would just like to say that the very 
fact that the federal government is going ahead in this way is a 
complete contradiction, and should sound a warning among 
English Canadians, who are wondering what to do about the rising 
tide of sovereignists. Despite  what some people might think, I do 
not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3598"> 3598 </A></B>
<P>
think that right now in Ottawa, in the Langevin Block, there is the 
will to decentralize the Canadian federation. There is an 
increasingly obvious desire to see that the real decisions are taken 
here in Ottawa.
<P>
	That may be fine for Canadians, because it seems that English 
Canadians' primary sense of loyalty is to the federal government, 
in a proportion, compared to Quebec, of 20-80 according to our 
information. Twenty per cent of English Canadians say that their 
first loyalty is to their provincial government, and 80 per cent say 
that it is to the federal government. In Quebec, the percentages are 
reversed: 20 per cent to the federal government, and 80 per cent to 
the Government of Quebec.
<P>
	So, that is all very fine and well, a form of decentralization 
which is only a dream at the moment, because there is no actual 
sign of it. But in the case of Quebec, if they ever manage to 
decentralize the Canadian federation, it will be contrary to the 
profound aspirations of the people of Quebec, who are turning, and 
this is becoming increasingly clear, unanimously, legitimately and 
ever more decisively, in the direction of sovereignty, that is to say 
partnership, the fairest, the most legitimate, the most harmonious 
and undoubtedly the most cost effective direction for Canada and 
Quebec in an economic partnership that respects both political 
entities.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am most pleased to 
resume speaking in favour of Bill C-26, An Act respecting the 
oceans of Canada.
<P>
	All Canadians who have followed the progress of this bill to any 
extent at all will know that the members of the Standing Committee 
on Fisheries and Oceans have worked very hard to ensure that Bill 
C-26 is given a thorough and detailed examination.
<P>
	The committee called witnesses representing more than 30 
groups and organizations from everywhere in Canada during its 
several weeks of hearings. Not only did the Committee call those 
witnesses, it listened attentively to what each of them had to say, it 
listened to what all Canadians have had to say constantly for some 
years now: our country needs legislation to ensure the proper 
management of our oceans by including in the legislation the 
concepts of sustainable development, an ecosystem approach and 
one based on the precautionary approach to the conservation, 
management and exploitation of marine resources.
<P>
	Canadians want legislation that will acknowledge the value and 
importance of traditional ecological knowledge with respect to 
ocean management. In fact, not a single witness nor anyone else 
has said: ``We do not need a act respecting the oceans of Canada''. 
Instead, what they have all said is the opposite: the law could do 
with some reinforcing. And that is exactly what has been done.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Equally important, the committee listened to the provinces and 
territories and proposed an amendment that guarantees 
collaboration with their governments as well as with affected 
aboriginal organizations, with coastal communities and with ocean 
stakeholders.
<P>
	We should thank them for the work they have done. What hon. 
members have before them is an act that is both forward looking 
and solid in its principles. One of the goals when constructing this 
act was to ensure it was built on the most solid of foundations. 
From this foundation will come better decisions about ocean 
management.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3601"> 3601 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1900 )</B>
<P>
	It is for this reason that the government examined every clause, 
every line and every word of the bill as it has been reported to be 
sure that the foundation was solid, that it is an act that demonstrates 
to the citizens of this country that the government understands and 
respects what they want for the oceans surrounding Canada.
<P>
	In this examination, the government discovered minor 
transcription errors, improvements that could be made in the 
quality and clarity of the wording and minor inconsistencies 
between the French and English versions of the text. Technical 
amendments can be found in Motions Nos. 5, 22, 38, 42, 43, 49, 57, 
58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 72, 74, 75, 89, 90 and 91. Although these 
technical amendments may seem minor, the government 
recognized that without them, there could have been 
misinterpretation of the act.
<P>
	The act makes it possible for Canadians to work together to 
shape the best national answers and the best local answers for the 
sustainable development of our ocean resources. The various 
technical improvements proposed by the government will add 
clarity to the act.
<P>
	The basic criterion of an act of Parliament is certainty and 
flexibility. We believe the Canada Oceans Act balances these two 
principles of certainty and flexibility. We urge all members to vote 
for Motions Nos. 5, 22, 38, 42, 43, 49, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 
72, 74, 75, 89, 90 and 91.
<P>
	Motions Nos. 47 and 48 by the Bloc Quebecois amend the same 
line in the text of the bill in two different ways. What does the Bloc 
Quebecois actually want? This section of the bill lays out the 
overall consultative theme of this bill and gives the minister the 
option of consulting with anyone or everyone on matters pertaining 
to part II of the bill.
<P>
	Motion No. 47 proposes that the minister and the provinces 
together will consult with all the other players with respect to part 
II of this bill. Why would the provinces be consulting on something 
that is not within their jurisdiction?
<P>
	May I suggest some better attention by the Bloc to the 
constitutional roles and missions, ordinary legislation versus 
constitutional amending procedures. It seems to me that the Bloc 
amendments propose to achieve by indirection constitutional 
changes that belong elsewhere. We are into a species of creeping 
constitutional amendments as to federal-provincial powers. That is 
not acceptable in ordinary legislation presented to this House.
<P>
	The people of Canada have not asked that there be 10 leaders in 
the management of our oceans. They have asked that there be one. 
Therefore, Motion No. 47 must be rejected.
<P>
	Motion No. 48 proposes that the minister must consult with all 
the provinces and standing committee in exercising his mandate in 
part II of this bill. This detracts from the flexibility of this section, 
which allows the minister to consult with the appropriate provinces 
or groups when an issue is relevant to them. It is not always 
necessary to consult with everyone when a matter may only have 
relevance to a particular province, territory or group.
<P>
	Furthermore, this motion obliges the minister to consult with the 
standing committee in exercising his mandate in part II of this bill. 
This would involve the standing committee in the day by day 
decision making of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.
<P>
	I remind the House again of what I said about creeping 
constitutional amendments. There seems to be a lack of respect for 
the constitutional separation of powers in this proposed 
amendment by the Bloc. It raises constitutional issues that are more 
appropriately dealt with in other arenas and in other processes not 
in the interstices of ordinary legislation devoted to oceans.
<P>
	Besides the standing committee in its review of this bill already 
put in a section to allow the standing committee to review the 
implementation of this act in three years. For these reasons, Motion 
No. 48, as proposed, should be rejected.
<P>
	Furthermore, the Bloc proposed through Motions Nos. 51 and 52 
to make two separate changes to the same line of the same clause 
35. These changes would require the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans to seek the approval of the standing committee to exercise 
his mandate as it relates to the establishment of marine protected 
areas. It would also effectively restrict the establishment of these 
protected areas to fishery resources.
<P>
	This is totally contrary to the testimony presented to the standing 
committee by Canadians from across the country. There are more 
living resources and habitats in the sea than only those that are 
fished and certainly there are many more worth protecting. 
Therefore, I ask all members to support the act by voting against 
Motions Nos. 47, 48, 51 and 52 and to support the passage of the 
Canada Oceans Act to the next stage of the legislative process.
<P>
<B>(1905)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, what the 
parliamentary secretary forgets or fails to see in this, when he says 
this is not the place to discuss the Constitution, is that I did not try 
to constitutionalize my proposals and I am not talking about 
constitutionalizing either.
<P>
	What I say to them is that there are problems at the moment and 
that the federal government is not equipped to deal with the 
situation. I say they should look directly,  look at the provinces 
which are prepared to play and they will avoid a pack of troubles. It 
is easy enough to understand. There is no need for constitutional 
meetings on the matter. However, sticking one's head in the sand is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3602"> 3602 </A></B>
<P>
worse. You cannot stick your head in the sand saying that you do 
not want to deal with the matter, that it involves the 
Constitution. When you have problems to face, you do not stick 
your head in the sand.
<P>
	It does not take much for the government to say it will 
co-operate with the provinces, that it will talk to them directly. I 
can understand if it says it does not want to involve all 10 
provinces. Alberta is perhaps less concerned about the oceans than 
perhaps either Quebec or Nova Scotia. It neither hurts nor takes 
anything away from the rest of Canada. That means that the 
meetings will go very quickly. Only the provinces concerned will 
be there. As for those that are not interested because of other 
problems or that prefer to let Ottawa handle it because they do not 
have the time, if it suits them, fine.
<P>
	What I am saying is that it does not suit us and it is not reflected 
there. I did not ask for a constitutional rewrite. I only asked that the 
fact that we have to work with the provinces be taken into account. 
We have no choice in the matter.
<P>
	There are other things we have to keep an eye on. With Motion 
No. 51, for example, we are asking for a consultation process, we 
want the matter to be sent back to the committee. Even though the 
parliamentary secretary tells us that the other place looked at it and 
said that it should go back to the committee every three years, it 
does not hurt to put it in here anyhow. I would rather know that it is 
the elected representatives in this House who are going to decide 
what to do with this bill. We are the ones who, within six months to 
a year, are going to face the people during the next election. I 
cannot tell my constituents in Gaspé that I could do nothing about 
it, that it had already been decided by the other place. It just will 
not work.
<P>
	I am running out of time and words. There is a lot to say, but 
when the new chair of the fisheries committee rise-he is a very 
sensible man, at least he was last week-he too will recognize that 
people of good will can get along.
<P>
	This is what our motion is all about. Look around, I am not 
talking about enshrining things in the Constitution. I believe that 
when you revamp a law, you should take advantage of it to make it 
more interesting. I already said at second reading that the principle 
could be good, that it was smart for the right hand to know what the 
left hand is doing.
<P>
<B>(1910)</B>
<P>
	I wondered why federal departments needed legislation to talk 
among to each other. However, it is there and we are trying to 
improve it. We are telling the Liberals it is there and we know there 
will be problems in relations  with the provinces. We are 
mentioning that and they tell us we are trying to talk about the 
Constitution. I am not trying to talk about the Constitution, I am 
trying to solve some problems.
<P>
	Motion No. 52 deals with marine protected areas-I have to go a 
little faster-but we would rather talk about protected areas for 
fishery resources. Why? I think that can be easily understood.
<P>
	The primary objective of this bill is, of course, to manage 
oceans, but the second thing is-and I take this opportunity to point 
this out to the parliamentary secretary off guard in case he wants to 
comment later on-the Constitution provides that fisheries are 
under federal jurisdiction. I would be tempted to change this, but 
we will raise this some other time.
<P>
	There are other management areas that are not outlined in the 
Constitution. There are grayer areas. To avoid problems, I would 
like that us to talk more specifically about fishery resources. If we 
want to get into the other domain, marine protected areas, there 
should be agreement with the provinces that make up Canada on 
what this expression refers to, what the government wants to hide 
in this expression, because it is unclear.
<P>
	Is there a mixup or a misunderstanding, even if only in terms of 
the environment? There, I have said it. There are problems with the 
environment, even in the federal cabinet, at least there were in the 
previous one, which operated until February. I can mention it, as 
the two individuals concerned are no longer there.
<P>
	When I questioned him at committee as to how Fisheries and 
Oceans Canada and Environment Canada were getting along, 
former fisheries minister Brian Tobin's answer was: ``Yvan, it is 
like yin and yang''. At the time, Environment Canada was led by 
Ms. Copps, who will be seeking re-election on June 17.
<P>
	If two departments cannot agree on definitions, if they cannot 
get along-and this is stictly at the federal level, in Ottawa-if two 
members of the team, two experienced politicians like Mr. Tobin 
and Ms. Copps, who worked together for a long time, cannot agree 
on the issue, what are we to conclude? The problem is not just at 
the personal level. Mr. Tobin's colourful language is well known. I 
accepted his answer in good faith, because it was reported in 
Hansard.
<P>
	I am trying to give them a chance by saying: ``Let us not refer to 
marine protected areas but to protected areas for fishery resources; 
it is much clearer''. The other expression is unclear. How would the 
provinces react if the federal government adopted this 
terminology? Have officials, at the senior and deputy minister 
level, met to try to make this designation clear for everyone? I do 
not think so.
<P>
	This bill was at the second reading stage when the former 
fisheries minister commented on the relationship between his 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3603"> 3603 </A></B>
<P>
department and the Department of the  Environment, led by Ms. 
Copps, saying it was like yin and yang.
<P>
	I will speak again over the course of the evening, but you can 
already see that, on this group of motions alone, we could debate 
for hours on end. That is exactly what we did in committee. 
Unfortunately, I had to refrain from submitting some of my 
arguments, because any argument defeated at committee cannot be 
raised again in this House. As you can imagine, I have a lot to tell 
you still and a great deal of information to share with the public.
<P>
<B>(1915)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
interest to the member for Gaspé. He is a member of the Standing 
Committee on Fisheries and Oceans. I certainly appreciate his 
participation on that committee over the last couple of years as he 
brings a valuable perspective to the committee. I sense the depth of 
frustration on the part of the member for Gaspé and many people 
from his province of Quebec. I addressed that issue in my earlier 
remarks when we were talking about the first grouping of 
amendments.
<P>
	It is past time the federal government got out of many areas that 
it currently has jurisdiction in, or that it asserts it has jurisdiction 
in, and allow the provinces and in some cases the municipal 
governments to make decisions more in keeping with the desires of 
the people who have to live with the results of those decisions.
<P>
	We have a situation in British Columbia where the Government 
of Canada is making a major decision with respect to the fishery 
resource on the coast. It is a decision that only the people of British 
Columbia will have to live with. That decision is to include an 
aboriginal fishery component in land claims in British Columbia in 
modern treaties.
<P>
	That is something that politicians from Ontario, Quebec and 
Nova Scotia will not have to live with but they are certainly very 
much involved in the decision making process. I sense the 
frustration of the member for Gaspé. As a citizen from British 
Columbia and knowing the depth of feeling on that issue in British 
Columbia, I understand the member's frustration.
<P>
	However, in looking at the oceans act it is clear there are times 
when there is a proper role for the federal government to play that 
goes beyond municipal and provincial jurisdictions. In the case of 
oceans it is clearly the responsibility of the federal government, 
particularly when it comes to issues such as straddling stocks, 
migratory wildlife and fish stocks. It has a role to play.
<P>
	I do not see how it is possible for the provincial governments to 
be making decisions with respect to those areas in the present 
circumstances. The federal government has a very serious 
obligation to consult with  the provinces. It is federal decisions that 
often cause provincial governments a great deal of pain, 
particularly economic pain.
<P>
	If members do not believe that, look at the groundfishery in 
Newfoundland and the collapse of that. It was managed right into 
the ground by the federal government. It created all kinds of 
impetus for investment into the groundfishery by providing grants 
and subsidies to fish packing plants and the construction of fishing 
boats and encouraged everybody and their dog to get out their fish 
those fish, and they did. Guess what? The fish are gone and guess 
who is paying the bill? In part it is the province. The province ends 
up with a great deal of the economic pain created as a result of 
federal mismanagement. The provinces have a right to be 
consulted.
<P>
	I have some difficulty with the way these amendments are 
worded. We will be again moving amendments to Motions Nos. 48 
and 90.
<P>
	I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Motion No. 48 be amended by deleting the following: ``-the Provinces 
and-'' and ``-may consult with others-''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I move:

with the word ``guidelines''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1920)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bonin):</B> The Chair will take the 
amendments under advisement.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I commend you 
for doing what you can to stand in for one of your colleagues at a 
moment's notice. That is quite remarkable.
<P>
	As far as the Oceans Act is concerned, some may wonder what 
the hon. member for Lévis is doing in this debate, since the riding 
of Lévis is far from the Atlantic Ocean and the Arctic Ocean and 
even farther from the Pacific Ocean. However, according to the 
legal definition, an ocean is any body of salt water. For the 
information of my colleagues who appear surprised by this 
definition, the St. Lawrence carries salt water as far as my riding.
<P>
	As I was saying earlier about greater federal interference, about 
the government's effort to extend its reach so it can regulate 
everyone's life, I see its borrowing the definition of ocean as a body 
of salt water as an attempt to extend its reach to my region under 
the Quebec bridge.
<P>
	This bill also covers the management of the coast guard, which, 
as it happens, is very important in the St. Lawrence. As you may 
well understand, we are concerned about the designation of 
maritime areas. For this reason, I like the amendment put forward 
by the  hon. member for Gaspé, which deals with fishery resources. 
What are fishery resources?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3604"> 3604 </A></B>
<P>
	I spoke on this issue in my riding. Today, again, before I 
arrived here in Ottawa, someone told me: ``I do not have a great 
deal of education, but it seems the government, the public 
servants or those who draft the legislation purposely try to 
confuse us with big words''. Take, for example, the French 
expression ``ressources halieutiques'', as in halieutics, the art or 
practice of fishing. This is not the word the person was 
concerned about, but we must define it.
<P>
	We, members of Parliament, have a duty to correctly inform the 
population. So, what does ``ressources halieutiques'' mean? This 
expression is more appropriate than marine protected areas, 
because it refers to the live resource, that is the fish and any other 
living species in the oceans, whether at the bottom or the surface. 
Things like this should be specified when drafting legislation.
<P>
	We are talking here about a large number of species. I did not 
count them but, in the St. Lawrence River and in the gulf, people 
still catch eels and sturgeons. The resources are becoming 
increasingly rare, because they were not adequately protected in 
Canadian waters located within in the 200 mile limit, since the 
ocean contour is not always straight.
<P>
	However, when the notion of ocean extends to the St. Lawrence 
River, we have a duty to make these specifications. This is why I 
fully support the amendments proposed by the hon. member for 
Gaspé, who knows a lot about fisheries and oceans. He was born 
and raised in a fishing community and, for three years now, he has 
been active in the committees of our caucus. He constantly keeps 
us informed, because we, urban dwellers, eat various species of 
fish now and then.
<P>
<B>(1925)</B>
<P>
	We are glad to get some once and a while, but we have to ensure 
it is processed correctly. Also, a lot of people are involved in this 
industry and some of them have received assistance from their 
provincial governments.
<P>
	I had the opportunity to work many years with the former 
Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Jean Garon. I went 
along with him to the meetings he attended and I heard the 
fishermen tell him how important the provincial government's 
involvement in this industry is, since the federal government 
cannot deal by itself with processing plants.
<P>
	The provinces can play a key role in many areas, if they so wish. 
The province of Quebec has tried to do so many, many times. It is 
still playing a major role, because this is an important resource. I 
remember when some of today's most popular resources, such as 
crab for example, were not developed here. Crab was only exported 
to Japan, to the delight of the Japanese people, but was not very 
well known here. Nowadays, thanks to all the ad campaigns and the 
special ways it is processed, Quebecers  enjoy crab, too much 
perhaps, because there are times we run short.
<P>
	I was talking earlier about another one of our resources, eels. 
This is a resource found in the St. Lawrence River, in what the bill 
considers a marine protected area in fact, a resource not well 
known to Canadians but a pure delight for Europeans, particularly 
Germans who really enjoy this fish, a resource that we could 
further develop.
<P>
	These are all good reasons for the federal government to join 
with the provinces, even if it has jurisdiction over the fisheries 
pursuant to the Constitution, and create a partnership to further 
develop our resources and let the provinces become some of its 
partners in order to help the people who work in the fishing 
industry.

	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>Mr. Speaker, I exhort members to 
reject Motions Nos. 7, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16 and 31 standing in the 
name of the hon. member for Gaspé. The purpose of these motions 
is to undermine the Oceans Act, which, as written, is in strict 
accordance with the codes and customs of international law.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Canada is a nation which has a long maritime history, one which 
has ranged from quiet diplomacy in the development of 
international agreements focused on the  development of a 
comprehensive framework for the regulation of all ocean spaces to 
that of proactive action to protect straddling stocks and highly 
migratory fish stocks.
<P>
	The legislation being discussed constitutes a major element of 
the overall strategy to intensify the Canadian government's efforts 
toward the conservation, protection and sustainable development 
of our oceans and their resources.
<P>
	The first objective of Bill C-26 is to recognize in domestic law 
Canada's rights and responsibilities as a coastal state as regards 
maritime zones and to delimit the area over which Canada will 
exercise its conservation and protection initiatives.
<P>
	The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea which 
came into force on November 14, 1994 provides for the 
delimitation and establishment of maritime zones under national 
jurisdiction and identifies the rights of coastal states and of other 
states within these maritime zones.
<P>
	The oceans act implements those provisions of the United 
Nations convention as regards the maritime zones. This is not the 
legislation by which Canada will ratify the United Nations 
convention. Members will recall that in the February speech from 
the throne the government indicated its intention to table enabling 
legislation allowing Canada to ratify the convention. This 
legislation will be presented to Parliament at a later date.
<P>
	The clauses which the Bloc Quebecois wishes to amend 
recognize and delineate Canada's maritime zones seaward of the 
internal waters of Canada as codified under the United Nations 
convention, otherwise known as UNCLOS.
<P>
	The amendments suggested by the Bloc in this group of motions 
would change all of this, and I refer again to what I said about the 
need for respect for juridical roles and missions. The Bloc 
amendments would intentionally have Canada contravene this 
international convention which we as a nation worked very hard to 
see established.
<P>
	Motion No. 7 as proposed is unnecessary and misleading. It 
refers to clause 5 which describes how baselines are drawn in 
accordance with UNCLOS. The motion indicates, if I may say so, a 
confusion between the determination of internal domestic 
boundaries with the determination of the international boundaries.
<P>
	The concept of baselines is not used in international law or in 
Bill C-26 to determine the internal boundaries of a nation. Rather 
the baselines serve as reference lines from which the nation defines 
its national maritime boundaries according to international law. 
These amendments, as proposed, therefore, are misleading. They 
do nothing to improve the bill, rather they detract from its clarity 
and accuracy.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3606"> 3606 </A></B>
<P>
	Bloc Motions Nos. 11, 12 and 13 apply to Canada's exclusive 
economic zone and seek to imply that this area and its seabed 
could be contained in the territory of a province. The exclusive 
economic zone is delineated to its inner margin by the outer edge 
of the territorial sea and stretches out to 200 nautical miles from 
the baseline or the coastline. By definition under international law, 
the exclusive economic zone is well beyond provincial waters yet 
the Bloc amendments would have us alter this important 
legislation to suggest otherwise.
<P>
	Bloc Motions Nos. 15 and 16 regarding the continental shelf 
make the same erroneous implications, namely that the continental 
shelf could be within the boundary of a province. The continental 
shelf is well beyond provincial boundaries. To amend this bill as 
proposed by the Bloc would make Canada's new ocean statute 
contravene international law. This is neither proper nor legally 
correct.
<P>
	Motion No. 31 proposed by the Bloc seeks to alter clause 28 
which defines the area of application of the oceans management 
strategy and makes it clear that oceans are defined to include 
estuary and coastal offshore waters. This clause, as it is, states that 
part II of the act, the part entitled ``The Oceans Management 
Strategy'' does not apply to lakes and rivers. This makes sense. An 
ocean management strategy does apply to lakes and rivers.
<P>
<B>(1935 )</B>
<P>
	The Bloc motion attempts to exclude application of a strategy to 
estuaries. This does not make sense as the interface between the 
fresh and saltwater estuaries form a significant component of ocean 
ecosystems, as well as the social economic well-being of 
Canadians. To include these areas in the ocean management 
strategy would effectively ignore the principles of ecosystems 
management set out in this act.
<P>
	I therefore urge the members of this House to reject the motions 
presented by the Bloc pertaining to the maritime zones of Canada 
and to the oceans management strategy. To accept them would 
contravene international law. It would also limit the effectiveness 
of our efforts to conserve and protect the ocean ecosystems.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, what needs to be 
understood and what those opposite are having a hard time 
understanding is that, although they tell us they want to include 
such definitions in order to comply with international law, one of 
the very first sentences of the bill provides that its aim is to permit 
Canada to affirm its sovereignty over its waters. What I want to say 
is that we can also affirm our sovereignty; we are sovereign in what 
we want to do and say.
<P>
	We can therefore, in keeping with the new convention on the law 
of the sea, still act imaginatively. We can design this bill according 
to the desires and needs of  those involved and of the people who 
make up Canada. I repeat: the provinces form Canada.
<P>
	The problem I am trying to reflect in this bill is the greyness of 
the powers, the jurisdictions and the definition of the maritime 
territories in this bill. Right off in committee, I stated that I had 
some concern about the government moving so quickly with this 
sort of bill and I felt some questions were unresolved.
<P>
	I keep coming back to the fact that the minister of fisheries at the 
time, Mr. Tobin, had promised me the bill was not written to 
mislead any province. It was to serve as a strategy toward a sort of 
partnership. When you want to be somebody's partner you take the 
time to listen to what they have to say and to respond to their 
insecurities. The fact is that we will have to live with this bill we 
are considering for a long time. More particularly, we will have to 
work with the wording it contains.
<P>
	If, as a Quebec representative on this today, I start off with 
concerns, how can anyone believe there was good faith on the other 
side? If, before signing the contract, I tell them I am having 
difficulty with this or that clause, which needs clarification, and 
they tell me it is not necessary, if it is unimportant in their eyes, 
why not include it?
<P>
	All, or nearly all, of the motions I submitted-I am not 
interested in reading them all again for people's benefit, as there is 
not enough time to do so-are for the purpose of clarifying that this 
bill will not encroach upon existing rights, existing though not 
perhaps claimed by the provinces. Why, then, is there such a rush to 
do away with that, and to speak of the provinces as little as 
possible? As we progress, every time we speak of a definition of 
territory, I add ``provided nothing abrogates or derogates from the 
rights, past or present, of the provinces''.
<P>
<B>(1940)</B>
<P>
	I try to make it as clear as possible that we need total clarity on 
this. Why is it that they keep taking us back to square one every 
time, by saying ``No''? It reminds one of the principle of least 
effort. They refuse to budge on certain points, and not minor points 
either. Perhaps I am running out of words this evening. If we hold 
this to be important, if there are concerns, what have they done to 
alleviate those concerns? Nothing.
<P>
	They say it is not important, that there is nothing to be feared. If 
there is indeed nothing to be feared, let it be put in, let the 
regulations be changed, let it be added. That would make things a 
lot clearer afterward. Why do I also insist in Motion No. 31 that 
this clause does not ``apply, either directly or indirectly, in respect 
of lakes, rivers and their estuaries''? Because there are many of 
them in our regions. Because we would like to have a say and 
because Quebec's relations with the various stakeholders, 
including municipalities and the environment ministry, are already 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3607"> 3607 </A></B>
<P>
complicated enough.  So why should the federal government come 
barging in with this bill? Why?
<P>
	I have been told there is no reason to worry. That is no reason for 
me to stop worrying and start telling myself that there is no risk, 
that I should not get involved in this. We are clearly saying that this 
bill should not apply to lakes, rivers and their estuaries. I am told it 
would be frivolous to exclude estuaries. I do not disagree that the 
first glass of water from the Saguenay River will flow past the 
Gaspé region before reaching Nova Scotia and then Newfoundland.
<P>
	I do not disagree it is a chain reaction. We are not saying we do 
not want to co-operate with them. Every time we talk about 
relations strategies, we indicate to them that, if they want things to 
work, the partner, that is to say, the province or provinces 
concerned, must be involved from the start. As soon as the minister 
gets an idea, he shares it right away with his provincial counterpart. 
Likewise, when a federal official gets an idea, he should be able to 
contact his counterpart right away to see if there is a problem.
<P>
	In such cases, both levels would share the problems, but for this 
to happen, it must be clear and well understood that part of the 
territory in question is ours and that this is the reason why we will 
have joint responsibility and why management responsibilities will 
be shared. I am realize that the Liberals are just trying to hog the 
whole thing, basically telling us: ``Mover over, everything is under 
control''. Not so fast, there are problems.
<P>
	To our friend opposite, the parliamentary secretary to the 
fisheries minister, who said in his preamble that the intent was to 
modernize international law, I reply that the United States also read 
the Convention of the Law of the Sea. Having read it, the U.S. still 
saw fit to specify that, while they have sovereign rights over their 
oceans, coastal states-that is to say U.S. coastal states-have a 
responsibility. I think it is up to three miles off the coast.
<P>
	How is the maritime territory shared with the provinces and the 
provinces' responsibility recognized?
<P>
<B>(1945)</B>
<P>
	I do not wish to start a dispute but I want to call the attention of 
the hon. members opposite to the fact that the modern thing to do 
may be to give management over to the provinces, as the U.S. have 
been doing with member states for quite a while now. This way, 
U.S. states deal with the big boss in Washington. If every power is 
taken away right from the start, what is there left to talk about?
<P>
	I say it again. In December, the government passed a motion 
saying that Quebec was a distinct society and undertook to enshrine 
it in the Constitution and to have it reflected in all other Canadian 
legislation. Here is a chance to acknowledge Quebec's desire to 
deal with its  own problems and participate in the management 
process with them, but they do not want us to.
<P>
	Do not be surprised if you see me rise again and again this 
evening, Mr. Speaker, because I have a lot to say on this subject and 
I will keep talking until I get through to them. The night could be 
long; they are quite hard-headed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find myself once 
again having to defer to the member for Gaspé. He has done a super 
job on the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans. He makes 
a valuable contribution to the committee.
<P>
	After looking at the amendments that are proposed in this 
grouping which are all his amendments, I have a great deal of 
difficulty. It is clear that as the federal government, the central 
government does have jurisdiction in Canada's waters. The 
sovereignty of Canada rests with the federal government. The 
provinces are way stations of that sovereignty but in the end that 
sovereignty rests with the federal government.
<P>
	In issues such as the law of the sea convention and other marine 
issues which tend to be international in nature, it is proper that the 
federal government have the jurisdiction and the ability to legislate 
and to act in Canada's interests in these areas.
<P>
	The Reform Party acknowledges the reasoning behind the 
amendments. People in western Canada and Atlantic Canada feel 
very much the same way in that the federal government is too 
intrusive, too big and too powerful, it takes too much of our tax 
dollars and is involved in far too many areas it should not be. 
However, this is one area where the federal government has a 
proper and legitimate role. Unfortunately therefore we will not be 
able to support these amendments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is my 
first opportunity to speak to Bill C-26, the Oceans Act. I must 
admit however that I am a little disappointed. As you know, I 
studied law at Laval University where, in the very first classes on 
constitutional law, the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra was 
quoted daily.
<P>
	What a small world, given that, 20 years later, I am now sitting 
across from the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra whom I always 
admired and still admire for his rigour and the principles he 
followed throughout his life. There is no doubt about that. I have 
seen Supreme Court decisions quoting the hon. member. I recall 
that Bora Laskin and Brian Dickson, two outstanding Supreme 
court judges, highly respected the professor who now represents 
the riding of Vancouver Quadra.
<P>
	I meet him today, some 20 years later, and cannot help being 
surprised to hear him advocate the exact opposite of what he used 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3608"> 3608 </A></B>
<P>
to espouse when he was a university professor. Politics is 
demanding for all members, including the hon. member for 
Vancouver Quadra. I would have been very impressed if, once 
again, he had been an exception, but such is not the case, 
unfortunately. Even the strongest structures have limits, and I think 
it is the case with the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra. This 
said, I do respect him immensely and I hope he will not be 
offended.
<P>
<B>(1950)</B>
<P>
	However, when the hon. member for Gaspé presented what I 
would call a neo-constitutional approach to the bill, to the 
legislative agenda before us, I recognized that, as the Reform 
member said and as the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra is 
saying, navigation, fisheries and oceans are under federal 
jurisdiction. In 1867, the Fathers of Confederation cared about 
navigation, about protecting fishery and marine resources, about 
safety, international transport and marine transport. It is probably 
true that they decided to give the federal government responsibility 
over this aspect of Canadian geography.
<P>
	However, the provinces never-and the member for Vancouver 
Quadra can say so if he does not agree-considered renouncing 
their historical presence on that portion of the oceans and seas that 
was adjacent to or, as in Quebec's case, inside their territory.
<P>
	The hon. member for Vancouver Quadra is aware of that. For 
example, Walker's flotilla ran aground at Pointe-aux-Anglais, on 
Quebec's north shore. This is part of our historical heritage and we, 
Quebecers, respect it. Every year, thousands of divers come to 
explore these relics at Pointe-aux-Anglais.
<P>
	When they decided to give the federal government responsibility 
over navigation, safety, etc., the Fathers of Confederation did not 
have in mind shipwrecks at the bottom of the ocean. The view 
expressed by the hon. member for Gaspé is that, yes, federal 
jurisdiction can be maintained. However, in our modern era it 
might be appropriate to follow the American example and to resort 
to joint action in this area. Indeed, there could be shared 
jurisdiction over the seabed and marine subsoil or, at least, some 
consultations.
<P>
	From now on, with Bill C-26, the federal government will act 
unilaterally. Everything will be ploughed under, weeds and grain 
alike. That is what the hon. member for Gaspé is saying. We might 
as well scrap everything, put aside the infamous constitutional 
quarrel of 1991-92, civil law in Quebec, navigation and fisheries 
coming under the federal government. In light of the distinct 
society resolution that was passed just before the holidays, we 
should review the most ambiguous areas, where the general 
interpretation of the Constitution gives rise to some speculation.
<P>
	Since the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra is more 
knowledgeable than I am in this field, he will recognize  that in 
some cases past decisions led to quite ridiculous situations. For 
example, when it was determined, in 1906, that Montreal trolleys 
were to be considered a work for the general benefit of Canada, I 
think the decision was wrong. That is not what the Fathers of 
Confederation had in mind when they established that works for the 
general benefit of Canada were to come under federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	When dealing, for example, with the content of television 
programming, they started by talking about the vehicle, the 
broadcasting method, towers, wires. All that was linked to 
telegraphy to finally conclude one day that television, radio, 
whatever, was an area of federal jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1955)</B>
<P>
	One thing lead to another, but it was always in favour of the 
federal government, which made Maurice Duplessis coin his 
famous line to the effect that ``the Supreme Court of Canada is like 
the tower of Pisa: it always leans toward the same side''.
<P>
	The time may have come for parliamentarians, cabinet ministers 
and the powers that be to try to restore some balance by giving the 
provinces, if not an absolute decision making power, at least a say 
in the development of joint policies. In other words, the 
government should respect and recognize the existence of the 
provinces, and vice versa.
<P>
	But politicians here refuse to do so. This is what is upsetting, and 
not only for Quebecers, because I imagine British Columbians also 
wonder about all this. This is not a linguistic or historical issue. We 
are talking about the management of resources, in this case the 
oceans, the seas, the Atlantic, the Pacific and the Arctic. We are 
talking about partnership.
<P>
	This is a perfect occasion for the government to show that it 
really means what is says when it makes nice promises and 
speeches. The government tells us we will get along and discuss 
things together. Well, now is the time to do so. It may already too 
late this fall. If what we hear from all sides is true, the government 
will have missed its last chance to meet the wish of its provincial 
partners. The hon. member for Vancouver Quadra should try to 
influence his government and make it use common sense once and 
for all. I know you do have a lot of common sense.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not 
want to take part in this debate but so much talk of good horse 
sense by my colleagues finally caught my attention and influenced 
me.
<P>
	This is totally contradictory. A few months ago, there was a 
referendum in Quebec and a few days before that referendum, we 
saw the Prime Minister stand up, as another Prime minister had 
done before the 1980 referendum, and promise with his hand on his 
heart that yes, the Canadian federation would be changed to take  
the interests and demands of the people of Quebec into account, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3609"> 3609 </A></B>
<P>
but, poof!-as the Prime Minister would say-today all that has 
vanished.
<P>
	In this debate, government members are telling us that they 
cannot do otherwise than what they are about to do because the 
Constitution and the British North America Act must be respected. 
How nicely put. How is it that respecting the Constitution has 
suddenly become such an absolute and inescapable criterion? What 
have the successive Conservative and Liberal governments done 
since 1867? We had time to observe them.
<P>
	What have they all done since then? With their spending powers, 
they have intruded on areas of provincial jurisdiction under the 
Constitution. And, as my colleague from Gaspé put it, they have 
encroached on these provincial jurisdictions. At the time, the 
Constitution was not that important. What was important was the 
spending power.
<P>
	But when the members from the Bloc Quebecois make claims in 
the name of good horse sense and talk about the Quebec's will to 
take its rightful place and exert some influence on lawmaking in 
this country, the only important thing is the Constitution.
<P>
<B>(2000)</B>
<P>
	Not too long ago, some time after the referendum debate, there 
was a speech from the throne. What did it say? It said that the 
federal government would no longer interfere in areas under 
provincial jurisdiction. I agree that this is an area under federal 
jurisdiction, but we could have thought that, following the speech 
from the throne, there would be a willingness to change the federal 
system.
<P>
	It is obvious, as my colleague from Trois-Rivières mentioned 
earlier, that this willingness does not exist. There is no willingness 
to make changes. It seems that, in this country, federalist members, 
federalist politicians are unable to learn from the past, even from 
the recent past. We are constantly sending them messages, but to no 
avail. Here is another opportunity that the government is preparing 
to miss.
<P>
	It would be a chance for the Liberals to prove that they can 
adjust, that they can transform the Canadian federation, as the 
prime minister likes to say. However, they are unable to do so 
because they have a different vision of this country. They have a 
vision where the government that has the most powers has to be in 
Ottawa and where the other governments, the provincial 
governments, have partial jurisdiction over matters of little 
importance.
<P>
	The same thing happens each time we have a significant bill 
before us: the rhetoric is there, but the government does not deliver 
the goods.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
speak to Bill C-26, and particularly to Motion  No. 7. This bill does 
not mention participation by the provinces. We know that the 
oceans are a vast natural resource over which the Government of 
Quebec would do well to have a say.
<P>
	In the past, we saw a fairly obvious inequity concerning fishing 
rights, for example. We also saw a fairly obvious inequity when the 
federal government decided unilaterally to develop petroleum 
resources through the great Hibernia project. Without the consent 
of Quebec, it was decided to develop the petroleum near 
Newfoundland, by saying that this would help Newfoundland, that 
this was a project to develop the eastern regions.
<P>
	We in Quebec were flatly opposed, because we knew in advance 
that Hibernia would be a project with almost no benefits for 
Quebec. Quebec would certainly have refused to subsidize the big 
Hibernia project. We know full well that Hibernia will cost 
Quebecers the pretty sum of two or three billion dollars, while the 
benefits will certainly not exceed a few hundred million. And 
Quebec was not consulted about this project.
<P>
	Once again, I would like to say that I support the motion by my 
colleague, the member for Gaspé, who is asking that the provinces 
be given a right of review, that they at least be informed of what is 
ahead. At the present time, we have no information. The federal 
government, as usual, is charging in and deciding unilaterally to get 
involved in large projects without consulting the provinces. Quebec 
is often penalized by these federal projects. There is no warning.
<P>
<B>(2005)</B>
<P>
	I remember very clearly, I was here in the House when they 
decided to launch the Hibernia project. I was an independent at that 
time, we were a small group of eight independents. We learned on 
the Friday morning that the Liberals, the Conservatives, and the 
NDP, a large contingent at that time, had decided unilaterally to 
introduce the bill on a Friday morning on the sly, to avoid 
discussion.
<P>
	Now, myself and my colleague for Richelieu learned about it on 
the Friday morning and came to the House to contest it, knowing 
full well that it was contrary to Quebec's interests. We were the 
only party-not even a party-but as you know, when there are 
major regional projects involved that are favoured by the federal 
government, things are too easy. The big three national parties 
always join forces and the thing is slipped through quietly. And 
who gets it in the neck? The provinces.
<P>
	Here I am not speaking just for Quebec. I think that British 
Columbia, with its extensive coastline, ought also to have been 
entitled to be consulted and informed, at least before the federal 
government acts in the key areas affecting the oceans. As I have 
already said, the oceans are a repository of great wealth, and the 
provinces absolutely must be consulted to ensure that they may  
take part in various ways to ensure that we agree, or in a few cases 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3610"> 3610 </A></B>
<P>
at least refuse, to become involved in projects when we know they 
will never be to our advantage.
<P>
	When we as Quebecers talk of fairness, we are not asking for 
charity, just fairness. We are not looking for handouts, we want to 
participate and to benefit, like good citizens, to have our fair share. 
It is not right for Quebec, one of the most industrialized provinces 
in Canada, to have the highest rate of unemployment and welfare, 
at the moment. That should not be.
<P>
	It is happening today because something was not working in the 
federal system. We are not talking about handouts, just fairness. 
We are talking about being part of the major projects so that we 
may benefit from them, no more than any other province, but at 
least as much as the other provinces.
<P>
	The ultimate proof lies always in the results. They are the 
indicator of success or failure. If we in Quebec have more welfare 
and unemployment than the other provinces, except the small 
maritime provinces, it is because we have lost out in a way, and not 
in terms of handouts. We are not expecting handouts or charity. We 
simply want to be part of the major projects that are to our 
advantage and benefit properly from them and not to be part of 
those to our disadvantage, as much as possible. This is why I rise to 
inform Quebecers that the federal government is yet again trying to 
pull the wool over our eyes by excluding Quebec from the debate 
on regulating the oceans.
<P>
	Once again, I repeat, this is not nothing. The oceans contain 
extraordinary riches, and Quebec must absolutely have a say in the 
decisions.

	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to address the 
Canada oceans act and the number of amendments that have been 
proposed to the act.
<P>
	I have to recur to the point I made earlier but with perhaps more 
precision. I have said it is not the appropriate role or mission for the 
House to assay constitutional amendments whether by the director 
or by the processes now being developed in intergovernmental 
relations and between federal and provincial ministers. This is an 
act which is devoted to Canada's oceans, and its integrity should be 
respected in that sense with proper criteria relevance applied to it.
<P>
	The clauses the Bloc Quebecois wishes to amend in this act 
relate to Canada's rights and jurisdictions over its territorial sea, 
the contiguous zone, the exclusive economic zone and the 
continental shelf as codified under the United Nations Convention 
on the Law of the Sea.
<P>
<B>(2015 )</B>
<P>
	These amendments are based on the misconception that this act 
could impact on existing provincial rights and boundaries. It is 
certainly not competent for ordinary legislation of this House to 
change the constitutional division of powers. There are other 
arenas and other processes in which that could be carried out if that 
were the will of the country.
<P>
	I will not take up House time by enumerating our rights and 
responsibilities in each of Canada's maritime zones as declared by 
Bill C-26. However let me point out there are elements of the act, 
including the declaration and recognition of our rights in all of the 
maritime zones mentioned, which are in full agreement with 
international codes and practice.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois would like to amend the oceans act in such a 
way as to suggest that provinces could have rights and jurisdiction 
in the maritime zones of Canada. Under international law however 
these are clearly assigned to the coastal state, that is, Canada. There 
is nothing to prevent efforts being made to promote constitutional 
change by direct amendment or otherwise but that is for another 
arena, another time and another place. It certainly would be a 
distortion of this act to try to incorporate suggested changes of that 
nature into it.
<P>
	Bloc Motions Nos. 8 and 9 suggest that the provinces have rights 
seaward of the base lines. The concept of base  lines is not used in 
international law or in Bill C-26 to determine the internal 
boundaries of a nation; rather the base lines serve as reference lines 
from which the nation defines its national maritime boundaries 
according to international law.
<P>
	Under international law, rights in waters seaward of the base 
lines are vested in the coastal state. Canada as a nation holds title of 
sovereignty over the waters within its base lines and within its 
territorial sea. These waters are part and parcel of the territory of 
Canada. Furthermore, contrary to what is implied by Bloc Motions 
Nos. 8 and 9, Canada holds property rights below waters that are 
not within provincial boundaries.
<P>
	Bloc Motion No. 14 applies to Canada's exclusive economic 
zone. It seeks to imply that there are or could be sovereign 
provincial rights in the exclusive economic zone. However under 
international law the exclusive economic zone is vested in Canada. 
For these purposes it is located well beyond provincial waters. 
International law as codified by the United Nations convention 
assigns to the coastal state Canada rights and responsibilities 
within the exclusive economic zone and these rights are vested in 
the state, in Canada, and not in the provinces.
<P>
	Bloc Motions Nos. 17, 18 and 19 regarding the continental shelf 
in legal terms make the same erroneous implications, namely, that 
the continental shelf could be within the boundary of a province 
and that rights in this area could be exercised by a province. Once 
again I would refer hon. members opposite to article 77 of the 
United Nations convention. It clearly states that the coastal state 
Canada has sovereign rights for exploration and exploitation of the 
continental shelf, its non-living resources on its seabed and subsoil 
and of its living sedentary species. Under the international law and 
the convention these rights are vested not in the provinces but in 
the coastal state.
<P>
	I therefore urge members of the House to reject Bloc Motions 
Nos. 8, 9, 14, 17, 18 and 19 pertaining to the maritime zones of 
Canada. To endorse them would be to destroy Canada's 
international credibility, to contravene international law and to 
destroy the work of the Standing Committee on Fisheries and 
Oceans.
<P>
	Bloc Motions Nos. 20, 21 and 23 refer to clause 23 of the oceans 
act which deals with the issuance of certificates of geographic 
location by the Minister of Foreign Affairs and by the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans. These certificates are court documents 
issued by or under the authority of the minister which contain a 
statement that a geographic location specified in the certificate is 
located in a specific area.
<P>
	In the case of the certificates issued by the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, the certificate would assert that a specific geographic 
location is within a specified maritime zone, that is the internal 
waters, territorial sea, the contiguous zone, the exclusive economic 
zone or the continental shelf. In the case of the certificate issued by  

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3613"> 3613 </A></B>
<P>
the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, the certificate would assert 
that the location prescribed is within an area of a maritime zone 
where a specified provincial law may have been extended. Once 
again these certificates focus on the geographic position of the site 
in question. They make no statement about the authority exercised 
there.
<P>
<B>(2020)</B>
<P>
	Strong legislation is made on a solid foundation. Basic tools 
such as these certificates are required to enable the courts of the 
land to efficiently conduct their business.
<P>
	It is clear that the nature of the certificates provided under clause 
23 of the oceans act has not been understood by some hon. 
members. Through amendments proposed in Motions Nos. 20, 21 
and 23, the Bloc suggests that the federal government might, 
through the certificates issued by either the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs or those issued by the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
impinge on provincial rights or legislative jurisdiction. The 
certificates provided for in this act do not deal with legislative 
jurisdiction. They deal with geographic locations, degrees of 
latitude and longitude. Constitutionally, they could not go beyond 
that.
<P>
	It has been mentioned before, but I will mention it again. 
Provincial boundaries and provincial claims are constitutional 
matters which cannot and will not be unilaterally amended by 
legislation and administrative action such as the issuance of these 
certificates.
<P>
	I therefore ask all members of the House to reject these motions 
presented by the Bloc which, if accepted, would make Canada's 
new oceans statute contravene international law.
<P>
	On another issue, Bloc Motion No. 32 of this grouping, there is a 
proposal to have the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and the 
provinces take the leadership role in developing the oceans 
management strategy, while Motion No. 34 proposed to have the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and the provinces take the 
leadership role in developing integrated management plans. 
Canadians have asked that there be one leader, not ten. Such a 
proposal would leave us where we are today with a maze of 
legislation and responsibilities but with no one person responsible 
for getting all the players to work together.
<P>
	It is not as though the provinces will be ignored in this process. 
The minister is committed to collaboration with the provinces, 
territories, aboriginal organizations, coastal communities and 
many other stakeholders. This commitment permeates the whole 
bill. The minister's leadership role must be preserved. For that 
reason alone, Motions Nos. 32 and 34 must be rejected.
<P>
	To further strengthen the language of the act, I propose in 
Motions Nos. 33 and 35 that the French text of clause 29 be 
amended to be consistent with the English text in order to clarify 
and remove redundancies and  make the bill consistent with the 
wording used in the Constitution and other legislation.
<P>
	In addition, during the standing committee's examination of the 
bill, concern was expressed by the hon. member for Gaspé with the 
use of the term ``communautés côtières''. This term has been 
changed to ``collectivités côtières'' to address the concerns 
expressed by the hon. member.
<P>
	I therefore urge members of this House to accept the 
government's technical amendments in Motions Nos. 33 and 35, to 
reject Motions Nos. 8, 9, 14, 17, 18 and 19 in which the Bloc seeks 
to alter provincial boundaries, and also Motions Nos. 20, 21 and 23 
which are based on erroneous assumptions that the federal 
government is seeking to alter federal-provincial jurisdiction and 
provincial boundaries. This is not its intent and it could not do so in 
this legislation.
<P>
	Bloc Motions Nos. 32 and 34 should also be rejected to allow the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to assume the leadership role 
which Canadians have clearly requested.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, for the 
second time tonight I must express disagreement with the idol of 
my youth. He should not see it as a personal attack, far from it.
<P>
	When the member for Vancouver Quadra tells us that the House 
of Commons is not the place to debate the Constitution, I have 
difficulty with that. I know, as he does, that traditionally, 
constitutional debates are held in the Chateau Laurier, and that real 
changes are made at night, between midnight and 6 a.m. This is 
where the 1982 Constitution was hatched, and René Lévesque was 
tricked, during what has been known since then as the night of the 
long knives. I know all this, the member for Vancouver Quadra is 
not telling me anything new. I am aware of this.
<P>
	Except that, what were we doing here before Christmas, when 
we voted on the distinct society motion? What were doing and what 
was the government doing, the government of the member for 
Saint-Maurice, the little guy from Shawinigan who said during the 
referendum campaign that we could have administrative 
agreements? The leader of the official opposition in Quebec is 
building his career on administrative agreements. If they do not 
emanate from this Parliament, where are they coming from then?
<P>
<B>(2025)</B>
<P>
	I do not agree when they say that the House of Commons must 
not be the place where we do indirectly what cannot be done 
directly. I must remind the member for Vancouver Quadra that the 
few times we did act directly it would have been better for us to act 
indirectly, because the results were nothing to brag about. The 
member must not forget that the Quebec premier has not  yet signed 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3614"> 3614 </A></B>
<P>
the 1982 Constitution and the Quebec National Assembly has not 
ratified it.
<P>
	I agree that fisheries, oceans, navigation, security and overview 
of marine areas come under federal jurisdiction so to speak. It is 
true and we do not deny it, the member is right. But, I am making a 
suggestion because, really, I am not convinced this is the way it 
should be.
<P>
	Yesterday, I listened to the Prime Minister on the French 
network of the CBC; he was on the program <I>Le Point</I>. He was ready 
to do indirectly what the member just blamed us for trying to do. 
He was willing to conclude administrative agreements and to 
discuss these things here in the House. He was ready to accept 
anything yesterday. Before the cameras, the Prime Minister is 
always ready to accept anything and everything.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> He is always ready to muddle an issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel: </B>He muddles so well that he just drowns himself in 
rhetoric.
<P>
	In the Liberal Party's red book, they mentioned decentralization 
and administrative agreements. That is what we are talking about 
here. This area comes under federal jurisdiction, so now is the time 
to conclude administrative agreements with the provinces. You are 
good at making administrative agreements when you want to 
intrude in provincial jurisdictions, so let us try to reverse the trend 
and make administrative agreements in your jurisdictions. It is not 
so funny, this is not the place to do it. We cannot do that here. You 
cannot not do indirectly what you cannot do directly.
<P>
	You were talking about economic rights-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. I hesitate to 
interrupt the hon. member, but I remind the House that any 
intervention must be made through the Speaker, and not directly to 
our colleagues from one side of the House to the other, whether 
they be old colleagues, students, professors or what have you.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lebel: </B>So, Mr. Speaker, I cannot even do directly what I 
cannot do indirectly; this is complicated. As for integration, I will 
quote something that was written recently. There are two types of 
integration to provide for in a political entity if we want to 
guarantee its stability and coherence: economy and politics.
<P>
	Economic integration implies that all aspects of the economic 
activity can be pursued within the entity, without tariff constraints 
or other trade barriers, and that there is considerable economic 
interaction within the whole area.
<P>
	So, when we talk about the economic entity that we must have to 
stand up politically, here it is: relations with fishermen, those who 
operate in the area, who manage the area and, most of all, who 
make a living from the area since they are the ones most directly 
concerned.  That is the first aspect, economic integration. Through 
you, Mr. Speaker, I say to the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra 
he does not want to consider this.
<P>
	One must also consider political integration, which means that 
the people in the political entity share many values and beliefs and 
identify with the political institutions, laws and government 
policies through which these values are expressed. The people 
living off fishery resources are told not to get involved in this, that 
it is none of their business. In fact, they are told to go back to their 
boats and fish as much as they want. They should not be concerned 
about whether or not there are any fish left, about whether or not 
our oceans are being restocked. The water and the sea belong to us, 
but you must still register your boats.
<P>
	Can you understand that these people are dependent on your 
policies? They will have to live with your policies. For some, it will 
be a tragedy. I am convinced that the exhaustion of underwater 
fishery resources will probably lead to tragedy, but they should at 
least have an opportunity to express their views and to be heard.
<P>
<B>(2030)</B>
<P>
	We were talking about fishery resources. According to some 
studies, if seals and sea lions had been eliminated from the St. 
Lawrence estuary, fish stocks might not be as low as they now are. 
When they said so 20 years ago, no one listened to them. 
Politicians were above all this; they argued that the problem lay 
elsewhere.
<P>
	We now see that the level of fish stocks and other resources in 
the ocean is only about 5 per cent of what it was in 1974. Before we 
lose forever this remaining 5 per cent, the federal government 
should wise up and start consulting the provinces as well as the 
fishermen and other people concerned. But they prefer not to do so 
directly. Forget about the Constitution.
<P>
	What are we doing here, Mr. Speaker? I wonder. I simply want to 
tell the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra that I also wonder what 
he is doing here. We must talk about the Constitution. If they do not 
want to take direct action, fine, but they should still proceed 
indirectly so that the goal is achieved. As Balzac said, the bottle 
does not matter as much as the drunkenness. To the hon. member 
for Vancouver Quadra, I say I will not take offence at the means 
used, as long as the goal is achieved. That is all I ask.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, again we hear 
from the member of the Bloc the deep concern that people have for 
the intrusion of the federal government into areas where it does not 
belong.
<P>
	In looking through the motions and the groupings it is clear that 
Motions Nos. 33 and 35 have to do with housekeeping.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3615"> 3615 </A></B>
<P>
	Bloc Motions Nos. 8, 14 and 17 have to do with the 
safeguarding of the legal rights of provinces. At this time Reform 
is favourably disposed to these motions. We have not heard 
anything that would lead us to believe there is anything in these 
amendments that could create concern for the federal government.
<P>
	Motions Nos. 32 and 34 give the provinces a higher priority in 
the consultative process which we think is progressive.
<P>
	However, Motions Nos. 9, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 23 unfortunately 
deal with jurisdiction. The federal government properly has the 
right and the responsibility as the sovereign government of the land 
to exercise jurisdiction over Canada's marine waters. There are too 
many issues concerning Canada's marine waters such as 
international agreements on migratory wildlife and fish that do not 
recognize provincial borders and do not recognize international 
borders. It is only the federal government that can properly oversee 
the management of Canada's marine areas.
<P>
	Reform will be supporting Motions Nos. 33 and 35. We are 
favourably disposed toward Motions Nos. 8, 14, 17, 32 and 34, and 
we will be voting against Motions Nos. 9, 18, 19, 20, 21 and 23.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> I must say, Mr. Speaker, that it 
is comforting to see the interest all my colleagues in the Bloc 
Quebecois take in the consideration of this bill at report stage. I 
thank the hon. member for Chambly for the kind remarks he made 
earlier.
<P>
	To come back to my horses, so to speak, Mr. Speaker; horses are 
normally on land, but the white froth on the crest of waves is also 
called horses.
<P>
<B>(2035)</B>
<P>
	What we must understand here this evening about GroupNo. 5-and I like the expression my hon. colleague from Chambly 
used earlier when he talked about neo-constitutional relations-is 
that we are doing our very best to come to an agreement with the 
people opposite. That is what is commonly called creating a 
partnership. We are even doing so at the instigation of former 
fisheries minister Brian Tobin, who told me: ``Yvan, we want to be 
your partners. We want to establish a partnership''. When you want 
to establish a partnership, you sit down with your partner and start 
making comparisons and agreeing on definitions. This is the very 
foundation of any partnership: the equality of partners.
<P>
	To do so, we need to be able to talk and to establish clear 
premises from the start. When I was preparing these motions, I 
never thought the debate was going to develop this way. I must 
admit that I tried to get the idea across during our committee work. 
I did not jump on  people with my idea, but when people come and 
tell me: ``We do want to have partnership with you and make 
headway'', I take that opportunity to check how sound things are. 
That is how the kind of motions before you today came about.
<P>
	I could perhaps share or read a few, if I may. They deal with 
simple things. I am on Motions Nos. 8 and 9. Motion No. 8 deals 
with clause 8, defining rights. I am simply adding the words 
``derogates from any legal right or interest of the provinces or any 
legal right or interest held before February 4'', to include the notion 
of province. It does not hurt anyone. Why should the government 
be ashamed of mentioning in the legislation that the provinces are 
its main partners? This is an example.
<P>
	I will read clause 9. It is very eloquent. Subclause 9(5) mentions 
establishing a partnership; this is the provision I would like to see 
withdrawn-I realize this is boring for those who are listening to us 
at home, but I too would rather be doing something else. Put 
simply, the word ``Limitation'' appears in the margin, on the left 
side of subclause 9(5). This provision contains a limitation.
<P>
	Here is what subclause 9(5) says. It reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For greater certainty, this section shall not be interpreted as providing a basis 
for any claim, by or on behalf of a province, in respect of any interest in or 
legislative jurisdiction over any area of the sea in which a law of a province 
applies under this section or the living or non-living resources of that area-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What does this mean? We are told that a claim cannot be made. 
A limitation is imposed. This is a bad way to start a partnership. I 
do not pretend to be a constitutional expert. I may not have as much 
legal expertise as does the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra or 
the hon. member for Chambly. However, I am an administrator by 
training and when you start with restrictions, it is a bad sign.
<P>
	The same goes for Motion No. 14-we can go into details this 
evening, since we have time to do so. I specifically use the word 
``provinces'' in the motion. Again, it is for a simple reason. Why is 
the government afraid of naming one of its main partners?
<P>
	I will get to motions that are even more interesting. MotionNo. 23 seeks to add a fourth paragraph to clause 23. Earlier, in 
reference to certificates, the member for Vancouver Quadra said 
that, as regards Canadian sovereignty and international law, this is 
not quite the way to proceed. The member for Vancouver Quadra 
does not have to convince the whole world. He must convince the 
partners, that is the provinces, and the members who are here in 
this House.
<P>
<B>(2040)</B>
<P>
	I would like clause 23 to be amended by adding a fourth 
paragraph which would read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3616"> 3616 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``(4) The certificate referred to in this section is not proof of the truth of the 
statement contained in it where the effect of the statement is to abrogate or 
derogate from the existing rights or legislative jurisdiction of a province''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We might be told that what is indicated in clause 23 does not 
come under provincial jurisdiction, or what have you, but it would 
not hurt to include it in the bill, so as to stress the notion of 
partnership. One would say to the other: ``Listen, if you accept it 
like that, I am prepared to live with clause 4, because I will not lose 
anything, and if it suits you, great, so much the better''. But no. It 
cannot work like that.
<P>
	I move on to Motion No. 32 right away. I will read it carefully, 
slowing down at the important words and comparing it at the same 
time. It refers to clause 29. This may be an academic exercise. In 
any case, I think it could be instructive for those listening at home, 
and even for certain members who did not have the chance to look 
through the whole bill.
<P>
	As written, the clause reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``29. The minister, in collaboration with other ministers, boards, and 
agencies of the Government of Canada, with provincial and territorial-''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I note that the provincial governments are not quite last, but 
come after relations with other ministers, boards and agencies of 
the Government of Canada, in collaboration of course.
<P>
	What I would like to see, and I mention it in the motion, because 
the provincial partners will have to make it work, because Canada 
is made up of provinces, I would rather see the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``29. The Minister, in concert with the provincial governments-''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	So there is an direct link right off the bat. As soon as you read it, 
it is clear: the main partners are the provinces and agreement must 
be with them. This is followed by ``in collaboration with other 
ministers, boards and agencies of the Government of Canada'', and 
then ``interested persons and bodies''. But it is the minister, in 
concert with the provincial governments, who is going to ``lead and 
facilitate, with respect for the rights and legislative jurisdiction of 
the provinces-it does not hurt to mention it-the development and 
implementation of a national strategy''.
<P>
	In other words, putting things in the right order from the start 
simplifies things later. It is not because I am a sovereignist that I 
would put the words in this order. I told you earlier that my second 
defect is to be an administrator by training. I therefore like to be 
able to identify the other players from the outset so as to be able to 
determine what our relations with them will be. I have said ``in 
concert''. What is done in concert? To lead and develop the 
implementation of a strategy. Now that is clear. But let us not begin 
with a list that, when the clause is read by more experienced jurists, 
such as there  might be in this House, waters down the purpose of 
this motion.
<P>
	If you try to do that, you risk serious problems, since this act will 
be implemented to resolve problems. So there must be an effort, 
from the outset, to avoid creating problems so that the relations are 
very clear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> I have been listening to the 
words of the member for Vancouver Quadra. Although rigorously 
legal, his interpretation is that all of the proposed amendments 
suggested by the hon. member for Gaspé and supported by myself 
are constitutional amendments and thus there is nothing that can be 
done. This is not the proper tribunal for discussing it. We are not, 
therefore, the right ones to discuss it, for we are in the federal 
Parliament and here we must speak of laws and not constitutions.
<P>
	I find that most curious. We have looked at laws here, and I have 
sat on the Standing Committee on Human Resources Development. 
I recall the famous debate on occupational training.
<P>
<B>(2045)</B>
<P>
	That was an area of provincial jurisdiction, and yet in Bill C-96, 
the act to establish the Department of Human Resources 
Development, the minister awarded himself powers in this area, by 
making official those powers he had long recognized as his, having 
long interfered in that area.
<P>
	During another session, Bill C-28 dealt with financial assistance 
to students, another area of provincial jurisdiction, education, 
under the Constitution. Through legislation, the minister made 
legal his intruding in this area.
<P>
	I have been a member of the health committee for some weeks, 
where there was a bill to make the existence of Health Canada 
official, reinforcing and clarifying its role. It already existed under 
another name, but now it is really called the Department of Health. 
An act has been passed to that end, clarifying the powers of the 
minister, yet health is a provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	At that time, the types of things that have been said just now 
were not being said, for it was OK, it was for the well-being of all 
Canadians. Each time there is federal intrusion, it is for the good of 
the people. I have been interested in politics for a long time, and I 
can remember Réal Caouette's time here. He used to say: ``The 
government has your good at heart, and it will manage to get its 
hands on your goods as well''. I say he was absolutely right.
<P>
	There are areas which are not in the Constitution: culture, the 
environment, communications, to name but a few. Since it is not 
written down, not specified, when we get into a grey area, we know 
that the Supreme Court will be called upon to decide and will 
always say that if not set out otherwise, it is a federal area of 
jurisdiction.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3617"> 3617 </A></B>
<P>
	Without going over every recent event, the Prime Minister 
recently stated, repeating it last night again on <I>Le Point</I>, that he 
wants a partnership, and what the hon. member for Gaspé is 
proposing is precisely the possibility of entering into partnerships, 
reaching agreement, collaborating with the provinces. Why? 
Because the Constitution was written in 1867, and things have 
changed for it, as they have for the catechism.
<P>
	I will soon be 50 years old, so I am entitled to that analogy. 
When we were in primary school, we read the catechism. There 
were questions and answers, and we said: ``That is the way it is''. I 
was prepared to believe that things did not change. Today, however, 
perhaps it depends on religion, but sins are not what they used to 
be. Things have changed. You do not even have to confess to a 
priest any more. It is changing. Society is changing, but Canada's 
Constitution is immutable. It cannot be changed.
<P>
	Recently we were told that, since there was no provision for a 
province's sovereignty, it was out of the question. They try to 
convince us that it is immutable and that if it is not provided for it 
is out of the question. If we listen-I was going to say 
religiously-to the member for Vancouver Quadra, nothing can be 
changed. Nothing whatsoever can be changed.
<P>
	The question is about the impossibility of changing anything, not 
a comma of what the opposition suggests. I remember-I have 
been here for three years. When we manage to get a minor 
amendment on a minuscule word, it is a real victory, because 
traditionally with this system proposals from the opposition are not 
accepted. The party in power runs the show. We see it on the sheet 
we have. If it is a Liberal government proposal, it is good; if it 
comes from the opposition, it is not.
<P>
<B>(2050)</B>
<P>
	The people listening to us must be saying: ``What is all this?'' 
What does it all mean. It must be changed. Opposition speeches are 
intended to try to convince the members opposite that, yes, in 
theory things can be changed. We said: ``We are indeed 
sovereignists, but it is because the system is immutable, there was 
never any desire to change it''.
<P>
	So those who must prove us wrong must prove that it is 
amendable, that there is room for improvement and that the 
opposition has valid things to say. The fact that it is logical ought to 
be enough. No. There is the party line, and that is the end of that.
<P>
	If you do not do that, you are saying, like the member for 
Vancouver Quadra, that the Constitution does not permit that. 
Therefore, Mr. Speaker, tonight we are talking about things which 
we should really not be talking about, and I appreciate your 
extraordinary tolerance, allowing us to talk about something the 
member for Vancouver Quadra thinks we should not be talking 
about. But curiously enough, the Chair and its  advisors ruled our 
amendments, the amendments moved by the member for Gaspé, to 
be in order, which means that they can be debated and voted on.
<P>
	The member for Vancouver Quadra says: ``It might be in order, 
we can discuss it, but in any case, it will lead nowhere, the 
Constitution does not permit changes''. This is a strange situation, 
and since we cannot make further changes, I will spare my voice, 
but I find this rather bizarre legally speaking. This is quite a lesson 
in democracy for the young people who are listening to us. Efforts 
made to get people interested in politics are all for naught when the 
answer is: ``This is not in the constitutional catechism, and when its 
is not in the constitutional catechism, there is no salvation''.

	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in resuming the 
debate may I make the preparatory comment that one has been 
fascinated by the debate tonight. I point out to those trained in the 
great Cartesian tradition that balance and form are an integral part 
of its mode of reasoning. Therefore what we are suggesting here 
was in that full spirit.
<P>
	This is an oceans act and it is not the proper forum to tack on 
American congressional style, other matters that are better dealt 
with elsewhere.
<P>
	There is nothing in this debate that indicates the government 
regards the comments made opposite as irrelevant or not of 
importance and worth consideration. Surely they belong in another 
forum and we would welcome the members of the official 
opposition to co-operative federalism through federal-provincial 
discussions of the sort referred to by the hon. member for Chambly 
and bring these matters there.
<P>
	In terms of the oceans act, it has its own integrity and it should 
be left with that. The references to clause 9(5) of the oceans act are 
misplaced. That is a simple interpretive provision. As a matter of 
law in the Latin sense it is inserted ex abundante cautela. It takes 
away no rights, it creates no rights. It is a simple provision of 
interpretation. It leaves the situation as it was before.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3620"> 3620 </A></B>
<P>
	Getting back to the specific amendments now proposed by the 
Bloc, we would have to recognize that the government has applied 
multi-disciplinary approaches here. It looks to an integration of 
economic, environmental and social considerations and it seeks 
to involve all affected stakeholders.
<P>
	Stewardship of the ocean and coastal resources is 
responsibilities we must all share, federal, territorial, provincial, 
municipal and aboriginal governments, in partnership with the 
larger community, the extended family, business, unions, 
non-government organizations and academics.
<P>
	The government is prepared for the leadership role in oceans 
management and embraces the reality of co-operative stewardship 
and partnership.
<P>
	Although the government is committed to collaboration with the 
provinces, as evidenced by its preambular statements in the Canada 
oceans act, the Bloc Quebecois proposed amendments such as 
Motions Nos. 24, 25, 26 and 27 which would require further 
consultation with the provinces and would obligate the review of 
decisions made by the governor in council by the standing 
committee.
<P>
	This is a fundamental change in the structure of government that 
may well be worth considering in another forum. Everything is 
open to discussion in those terms, but it is the wrong approach to 
try and tack it on to the oceans act, which has its own integrity and 
its own purposes.
<P>
	The Bloc amendments apply to other ministers and to the 
governor in council. To require the governor in council to consult 
with the provinces and with the standing committee before issuing 
a regulation recommended by another minister is in legal terms a 
preposterous proposal.
<P>
	The Minister of Foreign Affairs will be making 
recommendations to the governor in council on the delineation of 
maritime zones. It is a question of international relations, not one 
of federal-provincial relations, as suggested by Bloc Motion No. 
24.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice will be making recommendations 
respecting the application of federal and provincial laws to the 
maritime zones of Canada.
<P>
<B>(2100 )</B>
<P>
	Regulations respecting the application of federal and provincial 
laws to the maritime zones under the provisions of part I of the 
Canada Oceans Act are the responsibility of the Minister of Justice. 
It is not the role of the provinces or of the Standing Committee on 
Fisheries and Oceans to alter the responsibilities of either of these 
two ministers, or to interfere with the recommendations they make 
to the governor in council.
<P>
	Further, Motion No. 39 proposes to require that the minister 
consult with the provinces and receive approval  from the standing 
committee before establishing advisory or management bodies and 
appointing members to those bodies. The minister is already 
required to take the views of the provinces into account, so this 
motion in legal terms is redundant.
<P>
	Again the Bloc is proposing that the minister's abilities to 
exercise his mandate be fettered, this time by proposing that the 
valuable time of the standing committee be taken away, time that is 
better spent representing the views and interests of Canadians.
<P>
	In short, we have found the debate interesting and fruitful in 
terms of ideas. We do regard the amendments in essence as ones in 
which the Speaker could have exercised his discretion the other 
way, but we have made no proposal to that effect. I would suggest 
the thrust of these matters is not germane to the oceans act under 
consideration and would be better taken up in another forum at 
another time. And be assured this government is prepared to 
consider every proposal in those other fora.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly have 
some difficulty understanding the parliamentary secretary's 
scheme of thought tonight when he says this is not the right place to 
discuss the motions I have tabled. It is indeed because we were not 
able to agree in committee that it is my prerogative as a member of 
Parliament to submit to the House certain observations that could 
not be heard during the committee's proceedings.
<P>
	The implied spirit of all the motions before us tonight did not 
transcend the committee's work. I get the impression the 
committee was pressed by time, given Minister Tobin's imminent 
departure. The machine went somewhat out of control and we were 
forced to limit our work a little.
<P>
	As a general rule, I am easy to work with, to communicate with. 
I must say that things were going well on the other side for a while, 
up till the moment when pressure from the government machine or 
the department, perhaps in anticipation of Mr. Tobin's departure, 
caused them to put aside the spirit underlying my motions. That is 
why I had to wait for the bill's debate in the House to explain what I 
mean to all hon. members and those watching us, since in 
committee we are not always able to speak directly to the people. 
That is why we are here tonight.
<P>
	I always come back to the underlying spirit. I will read again the 
group containing Motions Nos. 24, 25, 26 and 27. It is quite simple. 
Since they are short, I will read them again. Motion No. 24 says 
``the Governor in Council may, in consultation with the standing 
committee and the provincial governments''. Why refuse to 
mention one of the main partners?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3621"> 3621 </A></B>
<P>
	Motion No. 25 says ``after consultation with the provinces 
affected, make regulations''. Provinces have direct contact with 
populations. I feel it is normal that they should be consulted before 
regulations take effect. If we adopt that line, we deprive ourselves 
of a source of information. Since provinces are closer to them, 
they are normally able to convey or express their populations' 
problems.
<P>
	I quoted a figure in jest a few moments ago in the anteroom for 
the members who were there. I told them that if we were to take 
simply this framework, we would not be rebuilding the 
Constitution and the history of Canada, but just giving ourselves 
the tools that would allow us to settle in advance 90 per cent of the 
problems before they appear.
<P>
<B>(2105)</B>
<P>
	So, we must find information sources.
<P>
	Motion No. 26 reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``26.(1) The Governor in Council may, in consultation with the standing 
committee and the provincial governments, on the''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I mention this motion again because we have here four groups of 
motions which say that consulting the grassroots is a good thing, 
that having a communication process, a feedback process is a good 
thing. Without such a process, we will run into problems.
<P>
	Ottawa, the national capital, is a beautiful place, but it is right in 
the middle of the country. Of course, departments have regional 
offices, but that is not good enough when, as in the case of those in 
our ridings, they are all managed according to the viewpoint of 
Ottawa. Regional offices are maybe full of goodwill, but they have 
no contact with the grassroots. Therefore, it is very important to go 
back to the base.
<P>
	I will try to go a bit faster. Among the other motions, there is 
Motion No. 39 which I find interesting. I will read it and explain 
after. I propose the following amendment:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``appropriate, members of those bodies, in consultation with the provinces 
and with the approval of the standing committee,''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Clause 32 says: ``For the purpose of the implementation of 
integrated management plans, the minister (<I>a</I>) shall develop-(<I>b</I>) 
shall coordinate-(<I>c</I>) may-establish advisory or management 
bodies and appoint or designate, as appropriate, members of those 
bodies''.
<P>
	If an organization responsible for the integrated management of 
oceans must be created, do you not think it appropriate to establish 
a good working relationship from the start? I would ask the federal 
government to discuss it immediately with those who created 
Canada, namely the provinces. That is the kind of ideas that should 
be discussed.
<P>
	If there must be integration and implementation of a 
management strategy, it would be appropriate to consult  
provinces, since there will be more than two members on advisory 
or management bodies and those members will have to come from 
somewhere. It will not be from Mars. So it would be important to 
give the provinces a say in who will be appointed to these 
organizations, giving them a chance to ensure that the appointees 
will reflect or at least know their basic philosophies. As for the 
federal government, it will also ensure that this organization 
includes people who will reflect its basic philosophy.
<P>
	I think that our actions are dictated by common sense so that, to 
make progress, we must share our ideas. We must then ensure that 
we have a say in the appointment of the people who will manage 
them.
<P>
	My time is running out, but I also want to read Motion No. 66. If 
I do not have enough time to complete my comments on this 
motion, perhaps one of my colleagues could do so.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``(2) In exercising the powers and in performing the duties and functions 
assigned to the minister under this act, the minister shall, as far as possible, see 
to it that the provinces affected by the application of this act are consulted''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is what I am asking. There was no mention of this in clause 
40 of the bill. Clause 40 deals with the powers, duties and functions 
assigned to the minister in part III of the bill. This clause sets out in 
concrete terms the management powers assigned to the minister. 
Part II stipulates that he must implement an integrated 
management strategy, while part III lists the powers he will have.
<P>
	I think that, whenever the minister takes a measure affecting a 
province or its people, he should consult this province. That is the 
least he can do. Why do I have to put this in writing? Because, as 
we just saw and as I have seen in my two and a half years as a 
member of Parliament, the federal government does not usually 
react that way.
<P>
	Among other things, how come, in the case of the coast guard 
and the new fee schedule for commercial ships, there was no direct 
meeting between the federal Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and 
the transport officials from Quebec and Ontario?
<P>
<B>(2110)</B>
<P>
	That is why, Mr. Speaker, I am asking myself questions and 
calling on this House to include this kind of provision because the 
federal government does not react in a normal way. In other words, 
we should protect ourselves in all our relations. So this, in a way, 
would be our safeguard.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the motions in this 
grouping speak to the governor in council having an obligation to 
listen to the concerns of witnesses who appeared before the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3622"> 3622 </A></B>
<P>
standing committee  and to take them into consideration when 
making decisions.
<P>
	For the most part we can support these motions. They do not 
speak to the issue of jurisdiction, but they do require the federal 
government to move with some sensitivity and with some 
obligation to consult.
<P>
	There is certainly nothing wrong and as a matter of fact there is a 
lot right with the federal government having a requirement to 
consult with the stakeholders, the provinces and others when 
making changes to legislation and when making changes to the 
rules and regulations which govern Canada's marine areas. For that 
reason the Reform Party supports these motions and thanks the 
hon. member for Gaspé for submitting them.

<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-26, in Clause 27, be amended in the French version by replacing 
line 31, on page 14, with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``d'effet, les intéressés-notamment les provinces-se''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with pleasure 
that I rise once again in support of the Canada Oceans Act.
<P>
	I would like to thank all the members of the Standing Committee 
on Fisheries and Oceans, and I include here the hon. member for 
Gaspé, for ensuring that Bill C-026 is an accurate reflection of 
consultations with Canadians and of the views advanced by 
witnesses who appeared before the committee.
<P>
	Motions Nos. 28, 29 and 30 concern clause 27 of the Canada 
Oceans Act. Clause 27 repeats the prepublication obligation found 
in the Canadian Laws Offshore Application Act which has its 
interesting mnemonic CLOAA which is an obligation required of 
the government prior to the proposed effective date of the 
legislation.
<P>
	Currently the clause includes special consideration of the 
provinces with respect to providing feedback on proposed 
regulations. Federal legislative policy and practice already calls for 
consultation with stakeholders on proposed modifications to 
regulations.
<P>
	In our view, the Bloc's Motion No. 28 would only serve to 
increase the administrative burden of this act by obligating the 
government to prepublish all proposed amendments as well as 
continuing with the public consultation practice.
<P>
	Administrative burden is something the government is trying to 
reduce because it costs the taxpayer money. I think I can safely 
state that there is not one individual or organization that in 
consultations or when appearing before the standing committee in 
the autumn of 1995 requested more red tape be introduced into this 
legislation. Therefore the government is not prepared to support 
Motion No. 28 or Motion No. 30 which eliminates the clause that 
recognizes that legislative policy and practice does not call for the 
prepublication of amendments or regulations.
<P>
	Additionally, to obligate the government to prepublish each and 
every single proposed amendment to each and every regulation 
would not only burden the process unnecessarily but it would serve 
no purpose. To accept this motion will only serve to increase the 
administrative burden the government is trying hard to reduce. At 
the same it would offer no benefits to Canadians.
<P>
	I am happy to support the regulation making provisions of this 
legislation and the government's Motion No. 29, a technical 
amendment to clarify the intent of clause 27 which is to say that 
interested provinces will be given the opportunity to make 
representations with respect to proposed regulations published in 
the <I>Canada Gazette</I>.
<P>
	This and similar technical amendments are being proposed to 
show that Canada Oceans Act makes it possible for Canadians to 
work together to shape the best national answers and the best local 
answers for the sustainable development of our ocean resources.
<P>
	I ask all members to reject the Bloc proposed amendments to the 
regulation provisions of this act, specifically Motions Nos. 28 and 
30, as unnecessary and without grounds and to support the 
government's amendment, Motion No. 29.
<P>
	I am happy to support the bill and urge all members to join me in 
allowing the legislation to go forward.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we seem to be 
reading these documents differently.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member: </B>It is due to jet lag.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier:</B> It is perhaps not due to jet lag, but I do not 
understand. Just to make sure all the hon. members in this House 
and everyone watching are clear on this, we are currently on 
Motions Nos. 28 and 30. Here is what they are about. There are two 
clauses on regulations in the bill, namely clauses 25 and 26. Clause 
25 deals with recommendations of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
Clause 26 also deals with regulations made by the Governor in 
Council, but on the recommendation of the Minister of Justice this 
time.
<P>
<B>(2120)</B>
<P>
	If I am calling your attention to this, it is because the bill before 
us is trying to establish integrated management, which would 
effectively force all cabinet members across the way to talk to one 
another. That is great. Second, channels of communication also 
need to be provided for. Publication requirements are stated in each 
clause. But when we get to clause 27, it is not quite clear.
<P>
	What I find shocking in all this is that, and I am getting to my 
Motion No. 30, and read the following in clause 27, paragraph 2: 
``No proposed regulation that has been published pursuant to this 
section need again be published under this section, whether or not it 
has been altered''. What is the catch here? What it says is that 
regulations can be made, but that if they are altered, changes will 
not be published. I do not understand. Not only have we been told 
over and over all evening that this is not the place to talk about 
constitutional amendments and the kind of changes we would like 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3624"> 3624 </A></B>
<P>
to make, but now we are told that changes will be made but that 
we will no  longer be informed of changes made. What does this 
mean?
<P>
	I will give the other motion the hon. parliamentary secretary 
mentioned. It is from the fisheries department, the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans. The proposed change relates to the 
provinces, and for once there was a clear reference to the provinces 
in clause 27. It was clearly stated that relations had to be 
established with the provinces, but they want to take that out 
offhand and write ``notamment les provinces'' instead. That was 
not said openly, but that is my understanding.
<P>
	Since the beginning of the evening, I have been trying my best to 
make it clear that the intent of this bill is to establish integrated 
management, which means teamwork. To work as a team, you need 
partners. This spirit of partnership has to be honoured. Hence the 
need to clearly state who the other players will be. I for one believe 
it should be the provinces who make up Canada. How will all this 
be put in place?
<P>
	Earlier, I mentioned that organizations would be established to 
oversee the implementation of the management plan. But we are 
denied the right to be consulted on appointments to these 
organizations. This time, we are told that it will be possible to make 
regulations without having to publish them again. Can you believe 
it?
<P>
	It is becoming a tiring exercise. We spent a long evening 
discussing the issue. I spent hours and even weeks debating it in 
committee. This is the end result. It is supposed to be important.
<P>
	You will notice that we mostly heard the Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. But there are others who 
worked on that committee. I would like to hear them. This bill on 
the oceans of Canada is important. How come there are not more 
people discussing it? Are we to understand that either it is not 
important or it is controversial and people do not really want to 
discuss it? I am a little disgusted by all this. I would like the whole 
issue to be clarified.
<P>
	After all that was said, what will people at home think of the 
debates that take place here? This is like a dialogue of the deaf. The 
hon. member rises and tells me this is not the place to discuss 
amendments. I rise and ask where I can discuss these amendments. 
I am trying to make things clear.
<P>
<B>(2125)</B>
<P>
	I tell government members precisely what I would like to see 
included; I tell them I would like a clear reference to the provinces; 
I tell them I would like the government to respect the spirit of 
partnership that is required. But the time is never right. When and 
where will it be appropriate? Given the government's attitude, it 
should come as no surprise that it refuses to do a reform, to 
modernize things, and to take certain factors into account.
<P>
	The government should not be surprised to see the population, at 
least in Quebec, express its discontent. We are used to having a 
referendum every 15 years. It is little things like this that, over the 
years, result in accumulated frustration. In a business and a 
partnership, if you want to be successful in the long term, you must 
first make sure that the parties involved will not feel they got taken.
<P>
	How come this is precisely the feeling I have this evening? I am 
all the more convinced of that when I read that: ``No proposed 
regulation that has been published pursuant to this section need 
again be published under this section, whether or not is has been 
altered''. Can we believe this to be merely a typo that escaped the 
lawmakers' attention? I do not think so. But, since the evening 
began, when I tell you that I think we might really get taken with 
this bill, that is a striking example, which shows the sort of thing 
the government will say.
<P>
	As well, why is there such a rush for Canada to pass this 
legislation? Earlier, I mentioned the relations between the various 
departments, and I told you about the committee minutes. The 
former fisheries minister said himself that his relations with the 
former environment minister were like the yin and the yang.
<P>
	If it is not yet clear across the way, how will they manage to 
agree when it comes to speaking with the other partners described? 
The point I am making, but I see my time is running out, is that for 
once the objective seems a laudable one. I am forced to admit that, 
at a given point in time, a bill that sets out to explain to the left 
hand what the right hand is doing is very wise, but it would not do 
for the government to get carried away, with the risk, in wanting to 
see all its bills pass, of removing what is important in them. I 
repeat, if we listen to this, these are management tools to ensure 
that 90 per cent of problems will be resolved before they find 
themselves in-Pardon me.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find myself in 
complete agreement with my colleague from the Bloc.
<P>
	This series of amendments has the effect of requiring the 
government to do nothing more than advise Canadians through the 
gazetting process of changes that it proposes to make. When the 
parliamentary secretary opposed these motions, he was of the 
opinion that this would create a lot of bureaucratic red tape and 
would serve no useful purpose. It would only cost money.
<P>
	I would suggest to him and to the government it is exactly that 
kind of attitude of executive federalism which has failed this 
country miserably, so that we have the problems that we have right 
now. I do not see what is wrong with the government putting 
Canadians on notice, through the gazetting process, of changes it 
intends to make in regulations or in legislation.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3625"> 3625 </A></B>
<P>
	Reform believes that any amendments to regulations should be 
done in an open manner and, as such, should be published in the 
<I>Canada Gazette</I> as would the implementation of any other 
regulation. Forcing the governor in council to print all 
amendments to regulations as well as the original regulations will 
serve to ensure all regulations are made in an open manner. It 
would also allow the public 60 days to make a representation to 
the minister on a particular regulation or amended regulation that 
may affect them. Consultations are imperative and not to be 
viewed as negative but must instead help to ensure that regulations 
are fair and take into account the interests of the affected 
stakeholders.
<P>
<B>(2130)</B>
<P>
	Reform has a saying and we are learning how to say it in French: 
the problem with Canada is Ottawa; le problème du Canada, c'est 
Ottawa.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Colleagues, a great deal of 
work has been done tonight on Bill C-26. There is a large number 
of motions. The official opposition, the Bloc Quebecois, has 
indicated it would have one more speaker for a maximum of five 
minutes, the member for Chambly would speak for no more than 
five minutes, and that would conclude the debate on Group No. 7. 
Would that be agreeable to the House?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again, 
and believe me, very reluctantly, I pass through you to address the 
hon. member for Vancouver Quadra. In administrative law, it was 
always stated in legislation ``the Governor in Council may, by 
order'', meaning an order from the House. This House could, 
therefore, ask the Governor in Council to adopt or promulgate this 
or that regulation.
<P>
	Listen well-speaking to the hon. member for Vancouver 
Quadra, Minister of State for Fisheries, via the Chair who is 
himself listening to us most attentively: ``the Governor in Council 
may, on the recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs-'' 
This is clause 25. It does not say ``on order of the House'' but ``on 
the recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs''. Clause 
26(1) has the same effect, except that it reads ``on the 
recommendation of the Minister of Justice, make regulations''.
<P>
	As you are aware, the Statutory Instruments Act was not passed 
by either the Bloc, the PQ, the Government of Quebec, or the 
former Leader of the Opposition, but by all of you together here. It 
is your legislation, you are the originators of it. Not you personally, 
Mr. Speaker, but the House. The Statutory Instruments Act is 
passed over, and we enter the spirit of, and follow in the wake of, 
the late lamented bills. By that I mean C-62 of last spring, which 
was never passed, and C-84 which came back to us  in the guise of 
C-25. The minister is taking over the powers of this House.
<P>
	So much for the Statutory Instruments Act. From now on, the 
minister may, on his own initiative, just wake up one day on the 
wrong side of the bed, and there we are, he can just pass 
regulations, any regulations. He tells the Governor in Council 
``pass this for me this morning''. The House is not informed, no 
one is.
<P>
	Worse still, the icing on the cake, as they say, is clause 26(2). 
Somebody was mixed up, somebody goofed, a regulation has been 
poorly applied or announced. No problem. It is not necessary to 
publish the draft regulation again, even if modified.
<P>
	For example, it is written that large vessels are no longer entitled 
to ply the St. Lawrence, when what was meant was small vessels, 
but that is not published. The first small vessel they catch in Du 
Moine Channel or in my buddy's riding of Saguenay, is told he is 
breaking the law. He replies that he has seen nothing to that effect, 
and we tell him that there is nothing to see, it was not published.
<P>
	We had published one; it was no good. We prepared another; it 
was not published. Ignorance of the law is no excuse, and my 
colleague for Vancouver Quadra should certainly know this maxim. 
Now, however, he is changing it to: guess right. That is what it will 
be from now on for clause 26(2), especially: guess right.
<P>
	Earlier on, he was criticizing me for trying to do indirectly what 
the law did not permit directly. Here, it is the opposite. He is doing 
indirectly what the law requires him to do directly. So everything is 
topsey turvey. You tell the member for Vancouver Quadra, since I 
cannot tell him myself. As we said: ``A word to the wise is 
sufficient''.
<P>
	All that to say to the member for Vancouver Quadra: ``Try it-'' 
I see the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell getting in a 
state. He is chic. I am not sure whether he has understood the 
technique. The member for Vancouver Quadra could explain it to 
him. I am sure he will do it well. He is a famous prof.
<P>
	I will ask him one last time to intercede with his leader, his 
officials or the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. There is even a 
clause to the effect that it is possible to fish if it is done in good 
faith. I saw that somewhere. I have never seen such a law.
<P>
	In any case, as for the passage of regulations, I would ask the 
member for Vancouver Quadra, if he could exercise his authority in 
the matter a bit and try to line their eyes up with the holes. They 
need it.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We will now move on to the 
question. The question is on Motion No. 28. Is it the pleasure of the 
House to adopt the motion?
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3626"> 3626 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> All those in favour will 
please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> All those opposed will 
please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In my opinion the yeas 
have it.
<P>
	<I>And more that five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> A recorded division on the 
motion is deferred.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We would have to wait for the vote to actually take place on 
Motion No. 28 to know how it would apply to Motions Nos. 29 and 
30, as was the case earlier this evening with another grouping.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I thank all those who spoke this evening for their co-operation. 
Pursuant to order passed Tuesday, May 14, 1996, the House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 9.38 p.m.)
