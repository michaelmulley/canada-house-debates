	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of

	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, Canada must have a modern, integrated and affordable 
national transportation system. One that emphasizes safety and 
reliability. One that is efficient. And one that supports strong, 
viable companies in all modes.
<P>
	Our government has been working hard to provide Canadians 
with the transportation system they need to compete into the 21st 
century.
<P>
	We have made tremendous progress in the air sector, based on 
our commitment to benefit the travelling public. The dispute 
between Canada's major air carriers  was resolved. New 
regulations will ensure that the computer reservation system 
industry is more consumer friendly, and new financial fitness 
testing for start-up carriers will ensure that passengers are not 
stranded by companies that do not deliver.
<P>
	This government has introduced a national airports policy that 
gives local communities a greater say in airport operations.
<P>
<B>(1005)</B>
<P>
	We now have an agreement in principle with Nav Canada, a not 
for profit corporation, to commercialize Canada's air navigation 
system. Transfer of the system will mean $1.5 billion to the federal 
treasury and the elimination of a $200-million-a-year subsidy.
<P>
	We have unveiled an international air transportation policy that 
establishes clear criteria for second-carrier designations on 
international air routes-a policy that also makes sure Canadian 
carriers use the routes they are allotted. We have signed a long 
awaited ``Open Skies'' agreement with the United States. 
Seventy-five new services have already begun thanks to Open 
Skies. Another 20 are at the planning stage.
<P>
	We have taken steps to modernize Canada's rail sector. The 
privatization of Canadian National saw the largest and most 
successful initial public offering of shares in this country's history. 
We have introduced in Parliament the <I>Canada Transportation 
Act</I>-legislation that will make it easier for Canadian 
transportation companies to move people and goods safely, 
efficiently and affordably, and which will allow the short-line 
industry to grow.
<P>
	The government has moved away from broad subsidies for 
transportation. More than $700 million in subsidy payments under 
the <I>Western Grain Transportation Act</I> and the Atlantic region 
freight assistance program have been eliminated entirely.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Today I am proud to introduce on behalf of the government a 
comprehensive strategy for Canadian transportation, a new 
national marine policy. Canada's marine system has to become 
more responsive to the needs of its users. It must become more 
efficient and less of a financial burden on the Canadian taxpayer.
<P>
	The government intends to ensure that Canada has a modern, 
efficient and safe marine transportation system into the 21st 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17666"> 17666 </A></B>
<P>
century. Therefore, the Canada Marine Act  will be introduced this 
spring. This act will consolidate and modernize the marine 
regulatory regime, cut red tape and allow for faster, more efficient 
business decisions.
<P>
	Canada's public ports will be commercialized using consistent 
criteria applied equitably coast to coast to coast. Ports that are 
important to domestic and international trade will make up the 
national ports system. They will be transferred to financially 
self-sufficient Canada port authorities made up of representatives 
nominated by port users and governments.
<P>
	Community organizations and private interests will be given the 
responsibility for operating regional and local ports. Provincial 
governments and municipal authorities may become involved if 
they wish. The maintenance of designated remote ports will 
continue to be ensured by the Government of Canada. The 
government will pursue commercialization of the operations of the 
Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway system.
<P>
	Whether through the establishment of a new not-for-profit 
corporation or through changes within the current management 
structure, it is the intention to make the seaway a more efficient and 
effective transportation system. The government will move 
aggressively to full cost recovery.
<P>
	The government will commercialize the delivery of ferry 
services. Marine Atlantic will be directed to substantially reduce its 
costs and increase efficiency. The corporation will explore new 
vessel management and procurement practices. It will take steps to 
streamline services and match the operating season of its vessels to 
realistic traffic demand.
<P>
	The government will review the subsidies it provides to private 
ferry operators. I want to emphasize that the Government of 
Canada will respect all of its constitutional obligations in this area. 
Remote and essential ferry services will be maintained.
<P>
	It is the intention to modernize the marine pilotage system. The 
four pilotage authorities have been directed to prepare detailed cost 
reduction plans. Those plans are expected to be on my desk by the 
end of this month. Pilotage authorities will be required to fulfil 
their mandate of self-sufficiency. Cost recovery for pilotage 
services will be 100 per cent in every region of the country where 
they operate. Pilotage tariffs must reflect market conditions and 
appropriate costs.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	The four pilotage authorities have been directed to review the 
designation of compulsory pilotage areas, the process for licensing 
pilots and granting pilotage authorities and certificates, the criteria 
under which vessels may be exempted from pilotage requirements 
and the feasibility of new training courses to prepare more 
candidates for their pilot licence or pilotage certificate  exam. 
Revisions to the Pilotage Act will be made once these reviews and 
consultations have been completed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	All of these changes will have an impact on federal employees. 
The government will make every effort to ensure that employees 
are treated fairly and equitably.
<P>
	The national marine policy will ensure that Canada has the 
modern marine transportation system it needs to compete 
worldwide.
<P>
	It will bring commercial discipline and business principles to the 
management of Canada's ports, the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence 
Seaway system, as well as to ferry and pilotage services. It will 
maintain the federal government's constitutional obligations-as 
well as its commitment to marine safety and environmental 
protection.
<P>
	It will help to ensure that shippers have access to efficient and 
affordable marine transportation. That those who use our marine 
system pay a greater share of the costs. Services levels will reflect 
realistic demands. Users who will pay will have more say.
<P>
	And for those honourable members who have been calling for 
greater local control, we have responded through the changes 
outlined today.
<P>
	I want to thank all those who participated in helping us put this 
policy together. In particular, I want to thank the honourable 
member for Hamilton West, Mr. Keyes, and the members of the 
standing committee on transport, he chairs. The standing 
committee's cross-Canada consultations earlier this year, as well as 
its comprehensive report on the marine sector, proved invaluable to 
the development of the national marine policy.
<P>
	Canadians depend on marine transportation. The measures I 
have outlined today will help ensure a safe, efficient, affordable 
and integrated marine system that meets the needs of Canadians as 
we move into the 21st century, where there will be the toughest 
competition in the marketplace Canadians have ever had to face.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome this opportunity to rise in the House 
today to comment on the marine policy tabled by the Minister of 
Transport.
<P>
	The minister started his speech with a retrospective of his 
initiatives during the past two years. In many cases, they did not 
quite come off. The principle was fine, and it was to provide 
Canadians and Quebecers with a transportation system that would 
be less costly and more responsive to user needs. However, the way 
the minister proceeded with these reforms was so awkward that it 
caused major problems within the transportation system, especially 
in the case of regional transportation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17667"> 17667 </A></B>
<P>
	Thanks to its national airports policy, the federal government 
was able to offload the cost of operating regional airports on the 
communities that depend on those airports. The minister went 
ahead with his policy without even considering the impact it would 
have on the cost and availability of regional transportation.
<P>
	The minister is about to commercialize the air traffic control 
system by turning it over to a non profit company that is not even 
representative of all users, since small carriers and regional carriers 
will not be represented on the board of NAVCANADA.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	I strongly urge the minister to take all necessary steps to protect 
the interests of small carriers during this privatization exercise. 
These carriers provide transportation to remote areas that have 
already paid a very high price for the minister's reforms.
<P>
	If we consider the international route allocation policy put in 
place by the minister, it is biased in favour of Canadian Airlines 
International, which has been given privileged access to booming 
Asian markets. Air Canada has obtained very limited access to 
Asian markets. It has no fifth freedom rights and a very reduced 
flight schedule.
<P>
	Canadian, however, has gained unlimited access to Air Canada's 
main foreign market, the United States. And now the minister's 
policy is sabotaging the development of Montreal's airports by 
refusing to let Air Canada operate a Montreal-Rome service. The 
fact that Canadian International has withdrawn its operations from 
Mirabel must be seen as an indication that the minister's policy for 
international route allocation has failed.
<P>
	The Canada Transportation Act is seriously deficient in several 
respects. It contains no incentives for developing short-line 
railways. If we want to preserve Canada's railway network, it is 
essential that short-line railways be able to take over the operation 
of branch lines from the big railway companies.
<P>
	When the House reconvenes in February, the Bloc Quebecois 
will propose several major amendments to this bill, and we hope 
the minister will have the common sense to support them.
<P>
	As vice-chairman of the Standing Committee on Transport, I had 
an opportunity to take part in the proceedings of this committee and 
of the sub-committee chaired by my colleague for Thunder 
Bay-Nipigon on the development of a national marine policy. I 
must say I was surprised and gratified to see that in developing his 
marine policy, the minister was strongly influenced by the minority 
report of the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	In fact, unlike the government members on the committee who 
only wanted to privatize ports that were in the red, Bloc Quebecois 
members favoured  commercializing all port facilities, whether 
they were profitable or not. I therefore welcome the minister's 
plans in this respect. However, I do wish that in this connection, he 
would show more concern for the regions that he did when 
commercializing the airports.
<P>
	I am also most pleased to learn that the minister has not followed 
up on the recommendation of the government members of the 
transport committee to repeal the Pilotage Act. In their minority 
report, the Bloc members of that committee were against repealing 
the act, pointing out that the problems between the pilots' 
associations and the shipowners could be solved through minor 
amendments to the legislation. The minister seems to share our 
view, but we shall keep a close eye on the amendments he plans to 
make to the Pilotage Act.
<P>
	We had supported the commercialization of the St. Lawrence 
seaway, and are not surprised to find that in the minister's policy. If 
done intelligently, I believe this will bring renewed life to that 
important waterway. I hope the minister will make an effort to 
involve those who work on the Seaway in that process.
<P>
	In conclusion, I am pleased to see several of the Bloc Quebecois 
minority report in the minister's policy. My impression at this time 
is that the minister is on the right track for providing Quebec and 
Canada with a forward-looking maritime policy. We must, 
however, wait and see how he plans to transform his policy into 
actions.
<P>
	In light of past experiences, the official opposition will need to 
remain watchful, and we intend to examine every last detail of the 
minister's measures very carefully. It is already not a good sign that 
the government is looking at cost recovery for icebreaking in the 
St.Lawrence. This is unacceptable, for it would mean that Quebec 
shipowners would be saddled with close to half of all the charges 
the government intends to levy for coast guard services.
<P>
	It would be unfair to make shipowners pay for a service that is in 
the public interest and ensures the safety of those living along the 
waterway, not to mention the very negative impact this measure 
would have on the ability of St. Lawrence ports to compete directly 
with U.S. ports, as they must.
<P>
	So you see, Mr. Speaker, the important thing is the way we go 
about it.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is the Christmas season and a time of goodwill. 
Therefore I would like to start by wishing the minister a good 
holiday season. I trust he is still able to hoist some holiday cheer 
after the strain he put on his arm by patting himself so vigorously 
on the back.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17668"> 17668 </A></B>
<P>
	It has been an interesting time for me as Reform's national 
transport critic. Each major policy the minister  has introduced has 
had my support in concept. As I explained recently to a New 
Brunswick reporter, the minister has very Reform like concepts; 
now if we could only convince him to adopt more Reform like 
implementation.
<P>
	The minister spoke of many policies, including the national 
airport policy. Although I support its concept, this policy has a 
tendency to skim profits and leave several of the airport authorities 
struggling for future financial viability.
<P>
	On the commercialization of air navigation services, I support 
this move but there are still many unanswered questions about the 
Hughes contract and how it will impact, with its deleted features 
and increased costs, on the final agreement and on the financial 
viability of NavCanada in the future.
<P>
	On the international air transportation policy, given the initial 
backroom dealing of the government, I am glad to see it has come 
up with a clear and reasonable policy at last.
<P>
	The government went ahead with the much requested open skies 
policy while stifling Pearson airport with its unwarranted political 
decision to cancel a contract that would have enabled Toronto to 
compete with the best for the new hub concepts. As it is, over $5 
billion has been spent at airports within one hour's flight of Toronto 
to enable them to compete with new hub business while Pearson 
languishes with decrepit, outdated terminals I and II. The contract 
would have seen $350 million already spent at Pearson with much 
more in progress. The government has spent nothing, has 
announced no alternative construction plans and has no money. The 
final cost to the Canadian taxpayer will likely run well over a 
billion dollars.
<P>
	On the privatization of CN, again the concept was good but the 
implementation was terrible. The new private company is 
legislated to remain headquartered forever in one location whether 
that is best for the company or not. I asked for an amendment that 
would have seen the shares of that company first offered to 
Canadians before opening sales to the rest of the world. The 
Liberals refused. The results were that although there was an 
unsatisfied demand for the shares here in Canada, 40 per cent were 
sold exclusively to foreign purchasers.
<P>
	On the Canada Transportation Act, committee handling of this 
has been better than it was with Bill C-89. A more open approach to 
Reform amendments has seen the bill made more reasonable. 
There is hope for a good bill if Parliament accepts the voice of the 
majority of witnesses who asked for the removal of clause 27(2). 
Surely the government will consider this. The alternative is to tell 
all the witnesses their testimony was meaningless and there is no 
point in appearing before committees again in the future.
<P>
	Now the minister is ready to proceed with the Canada marine 
act. Once again I am in favour of the concept but I worry about the 
detail and the implementation. I put the minister on notice of the 
following points which differ from those recommended by the 
Liberal majority in the Standing Committee on Transport.
<P>
	New port authorities must be better protected from government 
cash grabs than they have been in the past, and some of the airport 
authorities are being faced with that now. The minister said 
representatives will be nominated by port users and government. 
The committee recommendation refers to the government 
appointing at least the majority. That is unacceptable. Government 
representation, yes; control, no.
<P>
	The committee is also recommending a ports capital assistance 
program. The main emphasis it placed on this was to bring 
non-commercial ports to upgrade them to become self-sufficient. 
The idea has some merit as long as it is not used to subsidize a port 
to compete directly with an unsubsidized Canadian port.
<P>
	The minister's suggested policy regarding cost recovery of ice 
breaking services is unacceptable. User pay is a great Reform 
concept, once again accepted by the minister but potentially 
implemented incorrectly. Users should pay only for what they use, 
use only what they need and pay for it at a commercially fair and 
reasonable rate.
<P>
	The minister talks about revising the marine pilot act, as did the 
committee. As he does this he should keep in mind that all regions 
have a problem with the pilotage and he should not create national 
policy to deal with regional problems. I support the concept of the 
privatization of Marine Atlantic. I would like the minister to 
consider the concept of the in-depth study of cross-departmental 
financial impacts.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	The province of Nova Scotia has recently completed an impact 
study on the <I>Bluenose</I> ferry. It would save something over $4 
million by closing down but the impact in other departments and 
other jurisdictions would cost as much as $15 million. These things 
must be harmonized together.
<P>
	Marine Atlantic proposes to close the ferry in the winter but that 
study suggests this would create a net financial loss to the 
taxpayers. These new concepts must be considered.
<P>
	I find I have got on fairly well with the minister. Amid all the 
talks of cabinet shuffles, I hope the Prime Minister sees fit to leave 
him where he is. I would hate to have to break in a new one now.

<P>
	As members recall, two or three days ago I withdrew a bill which

bill will also bring more certainty as to the timing of byelection and 
general election dates.
<P>
	In light of the vacancy in Labrador, the way this bill would affect 
that vacancy is it would prevent a byelection from being held in the 
dead of winter. It would also prevent the people from Labrador 
from not being represented for an undue length of time. It would 
also have prevented the past byelections that were held over the 
Christmas and New Year's season from happening.

	This bill brings more certainty to the election process. It is not a

and if they could propose amendments that would make it an even 
better bill, I would certainly be willing to have them talk to me

<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. On 
September 18 I put a written question on the Order Paper and asked 
for a response within 45 days. It was one of those questions which 
every government department should have had at their fingertips 
and I have not had a response yet. Now we are going into the 
Christmas recess and the House will not sit until February. I cannot 
understand why there is not enough competence to answer my 
question in a reasonable length of time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will try to explain the situation to 
the hon. member. His question was:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What is the total dollar amount spent on advertising by the government and its 
crown agencies in fiscal years 1991, 92, 93 and 94, by province, in each of the

monthly newspapers, billboards, and direct mail?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is going to be a massive reply, I have no doubt. The hon. 
member knows, as well as I do, that the previous government spent 
millions and millions each year on advertising. This is going to 
take massive research.
<P>
	The latest information I have is that there are 14 government 
agencies which have to file the information which is required in 
order to provide the kind of detail which the hon. member wants.

House leader for the Reform Party.
<P>
	So that we will know how we are to proceed, I believe there have 
been some minor discussions. I will recognize the Reform Party. 
Then I will recognize the Bloc and the government. Then I will 
invite anyone who wants to add anything at all to this point of 
order. I will hear it all.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise at this 
time to talk about some very important issues: first, democracy; 
second, the role of an opposition in a parliamentary democracy; 
and, third, the office of the leader of Her Majesty's Loyal 
Opposition.
<P>
	There are no formal criteria for selecting the official opposition. 
By longstanding tradition the leader of the opposition is the prime 
minister in waiting and his caucus is the government in waiting.
<P>
	Should the government lose the confidence of the House:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-it is the largest minority party which is prepared, in the event of the resignation 
of the Government, to assume office.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is from Erskine May, the 20th edition, page 252, and 
Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 196.
<P>
	Doubt exists as to the Leader of the Opposition in this assembly. 
This doubt among other things stems from the fact that there is near 
parity of numbers between the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform 
Party. The Bloc does not have the best claim to be the government 
in waiting and the present leader of the Bloc has given notice to the 
Chamber of his departure.
<P>
	We believe that the Reform Party should be the official 
opposition because we are the largest minority party that is 
prepared, in the event of the resignation of the government, to 
assume office.
<P>
	I suggest at this time another criterion for a party becoming the 
official opposition. After the Alberta provincial general election in 
1983, the legislative assembly found itself with two opposition 
parties with equal numbers. Much energy was expended on both 
sides and much energy has been expended since assessing and 
evaluating that decision. However Speaker Amerongen based his 
ruling found in the summer 1983 edition of the <I>Canadian 
Parliamentary Review</I> on the following basis:
<P>
	First, the popular vote received by the NDP was over 200,000 
throughout the province. The popular vote of the other party was 
considerably less.
<P>
	Second, the speaker concluded that since the two NDP MLAs 
represented a broader range of interests-and that is very 
important-they should be the official opposition.
<P>
	Let us look at the facts facing us in this assembly. In addition to 
achieving the election of 52 members of Parliament, the Reform 
Party elected these members in five provinces. Further, the Reform 
Party received the second highest popular vote. Over 2.5 million 
electors voted for the Reform Party, which amounts to 18 per cent 
of the popular vote nationally. By comparison, the Bloc Quebecois 
received about 13.5 per cent of the total popular vote in one 
province.
<P>
	We contend that the Reform Party represents a far broader range 
of interests than the Bloc Quebecois, both in terms of the popular 
vote and in terms of our caucus including MPs from the five 
provinces. Electors who  voted for Reform but whose MPs are from 
another party look to Reform to defend their interests. These 
Canadians surely do not look to a party whose raison d'être is the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17673"> 17673 </A></B>
<P>
break up of the Canadian Confederation. I cannot understand and 
Canadians cannot understand how that concept could be supported 
in any way. It puts doubt on who should be the Leader of the 
Opposition and who should be the official opposition in this 
assembly.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	Why does the Reform Party now bring the matter before Your 
Honour? Early in this Parliament the leader of the Bloc and his 
party asserted and made a commitment that they would defend the 
interests of all Canadians and fulfil the roles of the Leader of the 
Opposition and the official opposition.
<P>
	We have to look at the record, and the record speaks for itself. 
Over the past two years it has become absolutely clear this 
commitment has not been fulfilled.
<P>
	We did not believe the interest of the Canadian union would be 
served by bringing this issue before the House while the 
referendum campaign was being waged. Instead we proposed 
measures for change to Confederation in the midst of that 
campaign. We proposed positive, democratic measures in pursuit 
of peace, order and good government of Canada. A constructive 
opposition could not have done otherwise.
<P>
	Now the leader of the Bloc has again indicated, as of yesterday, 
that it is his intention to leave the House. Regardless of whether or 
not the Bloc leader leaves and the seat is declared vacant, serious 
doubt exists about whether the Bloc Quebecois should continue to 
be the Official Opposition in the Parliament of Canada and for the 
people of Canada at this time.
<P>
	Your Honour, serious doubts have been cast. The time is ripe for 
the consideration of this issue. In fairness, we would also like to 
offer another approach in considering this matter, an approach in 
keeping with the spirit and the evolving traditions of our 
democratic system. There are precedents when doubt exists where 
members of the opposition have been allowed to select their leader. 
I draw attention to two such cases.
<P>
	From 1918 to 1920 the U.K. leader of the opposition was the 
leader of the Liberal Party, which was the fourth party in the House 
of Commons. The government of the day was a coalition of the 
Tories and like minded members of the Liberal Party. The second 
party was the Sin Fein and the third party was Labour. The official 
opposition went to the Liberal Party for two very important 
reasons.
<P>
	First, on the basis of a compromise worked out by the Speaker, 
Labour agreed to support the leader of the Liberals becoming the 
leader of the opposition. It was on the basis of the Liberal leader's 
having support from the  greatest number of opposition members 
that he became leader of the opposition.
<P>
	Second, in the event that the coalition government broke up, the 
coalition Liberals would return to their party banner. Therefore it 
would be the Liberals who would be asked to attempt to form a 
government in the event of the coalition's failure. The Liberals had 
the largest and strongest claim to being government in waiting.
<P>
	The second case is from the Australian Parliament's House of 
Representatives in October 1941. Of the coalition parties, the 
United Australian Party was the largest party in opposition. The 
decision on who should be the leader of the opposition was not left 
solely to the United Australian Party. Instead the UAP settled its 
own leadership.
<P>
	The Speaker then presided over a joint meeting with the Country 
Party, which was the other opposition party in the House. The two 
groups elected the leader of the opposition. The leader of the 
Country Party was elected leader of the opposition and the results 
were announced in the Australian House of Representatives on the 
next day. This can be referenced in the <I>Commonwealth 
Parliamentary Debates</I> of October 8, 1941, volume 168, pages 730 
and 731.
<P>
<B>(1055 )</B>
<P>
	In summary, we are facing a very serious crossroads and we ask 
Your Honour to consider what we have laid before you at this time. 
We have pointed out that there is serious doubt surrounding the 
status of official opposition and that is why I have brought the 
matter to your attention on behalf of my party.
<P>
	Where there is doubt, Mr. Speaker, I am asking you at this time 
either to make a decision with regard to the doubt or to preside over 
an election where opposition members determine the Leader of the 
Opposition. We have pointed out that it is not simply the largest 
party in opposition that becomes the official opposition in all cases. 
There are exceptions and other ways of dealing with the matter. 
There are circumstances that warrant another party becoming the 
official opposition.
<P>
	As I have stated at the outset, we in the Reform Party have a 
better claim than the Bloc Quebecois to being a government in 
waiting. It is absolutely clear. I can see where there is no doubt with 
regard to that matter. There is no way that anyone could argue any 
differently.
<P>
	We have also pointed out that the Reform Party represents the 
broadest range of interests, whereas the present official opposition 
represents a very narrow range of interests and objectives, not for 
all of the people of Canada but for themselves and in their own 
province of Quebec.
<P>
	In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, Reform Party members and I ask 
you in the most responsible way to consider the  deliberations that 
have been presented before you. We ask that you base your ruling 
on our submission and, if required, give us your ruling when the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17674"> 17674 </A></B>
<P>
House reconvenes. We also ask that you consider any change in 
circumstance regarding the matter during the Christmas recess. If 
such changes take place that put you in a position where you can 
make a decision before the House reconvenes, we ask you to advise 
us immediately on those change in plans. Mr. Speaker, I thank you 
and the House for the opportunity to deal with this matter.
<P>
	The matter is very serious in the minds of many Canadians. It is 
also serious to the future of the House and its deliberations in the 
next two years. When we cross the bridge of accepting the Reform 
Party of Canada as the official opposition or not, we will cross a 
bridge of democracy that will be either good for the country or will 
be an action that will not be good for our future in regard to unity.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
certainly not out of a lack of respect for my hon. colleague, but I 
will be brief.
<P>
	The Parliament of Canada Act and the Standing Orders of the 
House of Commons recognize the minority party with the most 
members as the official opposition. I do not want to offend my 
colleague, but there are 53 of us and 52 of them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do not think I will take quite as long as the House leader 
of the Reform Party, but perhaps I will not be quite as brief as the 
House leader of the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	Essentially three arguments were brought before you, this 
morning, Mr. Speaker: one invoking democracy, the second on the 
role of the opposition, and the third on the designation of the 
Leader of the Opposition within the context set in the second 
argument.
<P>
	It was explained that there was doubt, at least in the mind of the 
House leader of the Reform Party, about the status of the Leader of 
the Opposition; that there was near parity in the House of 
Commons; and that the present Leader of the Opposition had given 
notice that at some point in the future he would no longer hold that 
position. This argument was brought to the House before and was 
raised by the Reform Party outside the House in the media at some 
point. Some months ago the Reform Party asked the Government 
of Canada to declare it to be the official opposition. The argument 
was presented that for ideological considerations the third party 
should be declared the official opposition, notwithstanding the fact 
that there was no precedent for doing this in the  Canadian system 
and second, it was asking the government to choose its own 
opposition.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	The argument was obviously very weak because if the 
government chose its own opposition based on ideological grounds 
and not on numbers what would stop it from choosing the party that 
is in fourth place, the New Democrats, to be the official 
opposition? After all, there are less of them and presumably that 
would be less offensive to the government. The argument could be 
made that they have been around longer and therefore have 
legitimacy.
<P>
	What about the Conservative Party? It is in fifth place with two 
members. As a government that would suit a lot better because 
there are less of them to object to government policy. After all the 
Conservatives were in power at the time of Confederation. If the 
argument follows, that would give them some claim to legitimacy. 
Why can we not invoke that?
<P>
	If the government were ever put in the position where there 
would be a vote of the House choosing who the opposition would 
be, with all members voting, as was suggested some weeks ago, or 
the new twist of this morning of asking only opposition members to 
vote, the result would be the same.
<P>
	The result would be the same because neither the government 
nor supporters of the government or anyone else, other than the 
Speaker, should choose who the Leader of the Opposition is in the 
House of Commons. Once we deviate from that we could be on 
very dangerous ground that would subvert parliamentary 
democracy.
<P>
	I listened very patiently to the remarks of the previous speakers 
and they, the great advocates of democracy in what they refer to as 
an important debate, perhaps would care to listen for a few minutes 
and at the same time give the same respect that was given to them 
not that long ago.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you will recall that on October 31 during question 
period the member for Lethbridge, the House leader of the Reform 
Party, asked a question which was tantamount to asking the 
government to recognize his party as the official opposition. That is 
on page 16028 of <I>Hansard</I>. At that time the request was made of 
the government. Now the request is made of the Speaker.
<P>
	I have before me an article from the Calgary <I>Herald</I> of 
November 18 which quotes the member for Lethbridge. At that 
time he said: ``As soon as'', referring to the Leader of the 
Opposition, ``gives his letter of resignation the member for 
Lethbridge says he will be ready to rise in the House and make his 
case''.
<P>
	It seems that is not soon enough for the member. He rises today 
in anticipation of what he believes to be the future resignation of 
another member of the House.

<P>
	The fact remains that while the decision is yours-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hart:</B> Yesterday was his last day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Don't you remember hugging and kissing him?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I go back to the point I raised a while ago about 
people who believe that democracy is at stake here and that their 
arguments be heard, seem to believe other people's arguments do 
not deserve the same democratic consideration. They will probably 
stop heckling sooner or later or their leader might come and order 
them to shut up.
<P>
	I want to indicate to you, Mr. Speaker, that the decision is yours 
and only yours. It does not belong to members of the House, to be 
made either individually or collectively. A vote of opposition 
members or a vote of government members would subvert the 
democratic principles that the third party says it espouses this 
morning.
<P>
	I had the opportunity to consult the Parliamentary Guide 
concerning what happened in the Alberta legislature because of the 
precedent quoted by the hon. member for Lethbridge. The 
argument was made that the two independent members, 
presumably joined together at the hip, should form the official 
opposition versus two people who held that designation at the time.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	It is interesting to note that one of the two people asking for that 
was the present member for Lethbridge. He lost the argument and 
did not become the official opposition. Perhaps he forgot about 
that, but that is what occurred some 13 years ago.
<P>
	Second, the legislative assembly of the province of New 
Brunswick was faced with the situation of an identical number of 
seats, not close parity of seats some years ago. It made a decision in 
that regard and I will refer to it in a minute.
<P>
	The interesting point that was raised by the member of the third 
party, the hon. member for Lethbridge, was that there was some 
similarity to what has occurred in other regions of the country.
<P>
	The Speaker, of course, will be making his decision in due time 
on this. However, the precedent that was invoked is inappropriate, 
inaccurate and does not even reflect what occurred.
<P>
	In reference to the decision in 1994 in New Brunswick, the 
Speaker had to choose between two political parties having an 
identical number of seats. The decision of the Speaker was that 
when there are an identical number of seats, the rule of incumbency 
should apply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in response to the hon. government whip and as 
the House leader in the last year of this session.
<P>
	I want to make it abundantly clear to the House-I know you 
know this, Mr. Speaker-that this is the first formal presentation 
my party has made regarding the issue of the official opposition. 
We have not formally requested the government make a decision 
because we realize the government does not have the jurisdiction to 
determine who is the official opposition. We understand that is 
your prerogative, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	I reinforce what my House leader stated, that we give you that 
prerogative. Our House leader has suggested that there may be two 
ways that you might choose to deal with this issue.
<P>
	We have not, at any time, asked the government to recognize us 
as the official opposition. We have responded to Canadians' 
concerns about who forms the official opposition in this House. 
That debate has at times occurred in the House but I want to clarify 
that this is the very first presentation by the Reform Party to this 
House and to yourself specifically regarding the matter of official 
opposition.
<P>
	The only further comment I would make is that this is the correct 
timing. We understand this is a serious matter and want to give you 
adequate time over the Christmas and New Year's break and 
through January, if need be, to consider the argument that my 
House leader has brought forward, the precedents that he cited, not 
only from the Canadian parliamentary system but the British and 
Australian systems as well.
<P>
	I also want to acknowledge that the government whip did 
recognize that my House leader has personal experience in this 
issue. The precedent he is using is to argue that the Speaker in 
Alberta made the right choice. He is bringing those arguments to 
you. Hopefully you would make the same choice in this case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened very carefully to the presentations of the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster and the hon. member for Lethbridge.
<P>
	With great respect, I disagree with the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster when he says that there has been no 
formal presentation before. There was a request. It was 
summarized by the chief government whip in his remarks a few 
moments ago. I would like to read it to the hon. member to refresh 
his memory.
<P>
	On October 31, 1995 the hon. member for Lethbridge put this 
question during question period. He said: ``Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister has catered to the separatists in the House. His 
government supports them as the official opposition. His 
government has elected them as committee chairmen and his 
government has changed the agenda of the House for the 
separatists. The separatists in the House have been granted special, 
preferential treatment. My question is for the Prime Minister. Why 
is this happening and when is it going to stop?''
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17676"> 17676 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> More, more.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> I could read more of the words of the hon. 
member for Lethbridge. However, it is clear that what he meant by 
``when is it going to stop'' is, when is the government going to 
install the Reform Party as the opposition. The government did not 
support the Bloc as the official opposition. It was chosen as the 
official opposition because it was the largest opposition party and it 
still is the largest opposition party.
<P>
	The Reform Party, despites its efforts, has been unsuccessful in 
winning any seats in any byelections. It is down in the polls to 10 
per cent. Reform members have problems and they are trying by 
this grandstanding technique today, when they are still behind 53 to 
52, as the hon. member for Roberval so ably pointed out, to say that 
Your Honour ought to make a decision to displace the official 
opposition in their favour.
<P>
	What the chief government whip has said is very clear. You, Mr. 
Speaker, have the power to make the decision as to which party is 
recognized as the official opposition in the House. It is not for the 
government to make that decision and the government does not 
want to be a part of that decision.
<P>
	We are prepared to say that if a situation arises in the next little 
while where there is an equality of votes, the standard practice in 
the House is to leave the status quo. We point that out. It is not, of 
course, intended to be binding on anybody, but it is the normal 
practice.
<P>
	When the Speaker, for example, is confronted with a situation 
where there is a tie vote in the House and has to break the tie, he 
generally exercises his favour so as to maintain a status quo and not 
to pass a motion that would otherwise change the status quo by 
voting in favour that motion. It is generally exercised in favour of 
maintaining the status quo.
<P>
	That is the normal practice developed over some considerable 
time by Speakers of the House. While it is not necessarily binding, 
it certainly is a fairly well accepted convention and one that Your 
Honour will want to consider very carefully when making any 
decision. Perhaps your decision not be made today, but be made at 
a future date when there has been a resignation by the hon. member 
for Lac-Saint-Jean. He might not win the leadership of the Parti 
Quebecois. If he came to his senses, of course, he would seek the 
leadership of the Liberal Party. But that is not vacant in Quebec.
<P>
	So far that has not happened. He has changed parties before, as 
hon. members opposite know.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Five times.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> As the chief government whip says, five times.
<P>
	The fact is that he is running for a particular position and he 
indicated very clearly that he was not going to  leave his seat in the 
House until he got it. Why give up certainty and trade it for 
something so uncertain? He is staying as a member of the House 
and that is the case now.
<P>
	If that situation changes before the House resumes in February, I 
am sure that Your Honour will want to bear that in mind when 
looking at the facts and assessing the situation in making a ruling 
on this point of order.
<P>
	With great respect, the point of order is premature. The hon. 
member for Lethbridge should really get a grip on the 
rambunctiousness of some of his members. I realize it is 
Christmastime, but all the presents do now flow in December. 
Some of them may come on another day.
<P>
	This application is premature. He should have waited, as he said 
he would do when he spoke to the Calgary <I>Herald</I> in November, 
until he is in a position where the Reform Party is the larger party 
and then make his claim.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what is happening today is perhaps the most important 
consideration that will be faced by this Parliament. Make no 
mistake, Mr. Speaker, the point has been missed thus far in this 
debate. The fact is that our country is at peril, every bit as much as 
if we were facing an enemy from without. We have an enemy in our 
midst. We have given the Trojan horse in our Parliament the ability 
to subvert the actions of the House. The really important 
consideration is we are going into a life and death battle for the 
future of the country. The separatists, the Bloc, have a democratic 
right to be here. They have a democratic right to fight this on any 
battlefield they can get and to do so with passion.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	We have the same right to use everything in our power, every 
resource we have, to fight them. For the last two years our fight has 
been one of retreat. Every opportunity the country has had to face 
the separatists, to stare them down, we have retreated. That is what 
damn near cost us the country on October 30.
<P>
	The time to start facing down the separatists is now in the very 
centre of the country, the House of Commons. They have no right 
to be the official opposition. They do not represent the continuation 
of the country as a whole and complete entity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not now 
envy the load of responsibility you carry. The decision which is 
yours now to make is pivotal.
<P>
	I add and emphasize the definition of the official opposition, 
which you must take into consideration, from section 196 of 
Beauchesne:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The political party which has the right to be called the ``Official Opposition'' 
is the largest minority group which is prepared, in the event of the resignation of 
the Government, to assume office.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

<B><A NAME="17677"> 17677 </A></B>
<P>
	This statement does not say the government will resign, but only 
in the event it resigns.
<P>
	I cannot emphasize strongly enough the importance of the 
decision you are about to make in the next six weeks. You are being 
called on to decide who would form the Government of Canada in 
the event the Liberals resigned.
<P>
	If you decide Canadians are best served by a party whose stated 
objective, which it has demonstrated in the last two years 
consistently, is to break the country into two pieces, you would err 
greatly.
<P>
	We receive a great deal of mail. I receive mail from my 
constituents in Elk Island and from other people right across the 
country. The Speaker needs to be informed that there are Canadians 
right across the country who have written to Reform MPs, me 
included, in near exasperation, asking when we will do something.
<P>
	We are helpless in the sense, as has been pointed out, that we are 
the third party by the ranking of numbers. A number of petitions by 
electors of Canada have been presented, asking the House to name 
a loyal party to Canada the official opposition. This is of greatest 
importance.
<P>
	I have received letters from and have had personal appointments 
with people who said they are so distressed but feel so helpless. 
They ask: ``What can we do? We have a group in Canada that wants 
to tear the country apart and we cannot even deal with them in the 
House of Commons''.
<P>
	This is a very serious problem. I urge you, Mr. Speaker, to do the 
right thing, and I appreciate the tremendous responsibility you bear 
at this time.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
some question has arisen in the House on the matter of 53 Bloc 
members versus 52 Reform members, although I do not believe 
that is the entire consideration placed before you by our House 
leader.
<P>
	The question arises whether the current Leader of the Opposition 
is deemed to have resigned from his seat in the House considering 
the issue of conflict of interest by an individual who has verbally 
given notice to lead a province and a party dedicated to separating 
from Canada.
<P>
	The issues that individual is now dealing with are provincial in 
nature and not explicitly in the interests of the federation. Mr. 
Speaker, I therefore believe there are 52 members in both parties 
and that you should look at the issue of whether the Leader of 
Opposition is a member of the House at this point.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a few brief comments.
<P>
	I could tell you that if the Bloc had finished third in the 1993 
election, we would have had enough pride not to beg for the job of 
official opposition. I think that it is a matter of numbers, as the 
Bloc parliamentary leader pointed out.
<P>
	I find it hard to understand the third party, Reform. Yesterday, 
they were calling for the Prime Minister's dismissal; today, they 
want to become the second party with fewer members. They live in 
a different world.
<P>
	As the holiday season gets under way, there may be too many 
people in that party who still believe in Santa Claus.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I think that is one round. I was given notice of this 
point of order and I wanted to hear it.
<P>
	At this moment there is no decision for me to make, nor would I 
make one now.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
I will consider the statements that were made by all our colleagues 
here in this House, I want some time to reflect.
<P>
	As you know, there may be changes in the number of members 
sitting in this House. These changes may occur in the coming 
weeks.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	You have asked me as your Speaker to reflect on a point of order 
that was raised. I have now received information from you, my 
colleagues. I intend at this time to take the information, gather 
information of my own, reflect on what has been asked of me and if 
it is necessary, when it is necessary, I will return to the House with 
a decision.
<P>

	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Secretary of State (Parliamentary 
Affairs) and Deputy Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House take note of the Interim Report of the Standing Committee on 
Finance pursuant to Standing Order 83.1, presented to the House on December 
12, 1995.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, just over a year ago I was privileged 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17678"> 17678 </A></B>
<P>
to lead off the last take note debate on the possible measures for the 
1995 budget. Today it is a pleasure to replay that role for the 1996 
budget. It  allows me to renew the heartfelt challenge to all hon. 
members of the House.
<P>
	I also take the opportunity to thank on behalf of the Minister of 
Finance the finance committee for its work not only on prebudget 
consultations but on many other issues. I see both of my colleagues 
from two opposition parties here and I extend my thanks to them.
<P>
	The chair of the finance committee who was here earlier to 
present a report told us yesterday that the finance committee has 
met over 200 times since the government was formed. It has a 
considerable workload. The attendance has always been first class. 
There is continuity in what has been said in debate in the 
committee. The collegiality we have in the organization of our 
work is greatly appreciated. We know that in a partisan House there 
are natural divisions, some very heartfelt divisions, but it is also 
reassuring to those of us to enjoy Parliament to see a committee 
work so well. On behalf of the minister I say thank you and wish 
everyone season's greetings and I look forward to continuing the 
work in the new year.
<P>
	Today's debate is an accumulation of the work done by the 
committee as well as individual members of Parliament. Since 
September we have been meeting with Canadians in Ottawa and 
across the country. The committee split itself in half. Half went 
west and half went to Atlantic Canada and Montreal. We have 
heard hundred of witnesses in a series of round table discussions. 
We have also heard individual presentations. The interested public 
as well as members of the committee are getting more familiar with 
the process. We have had some very good debate.
<P>
	I would highlight the work by charitable organizations. They 
have given us some new ideas. I would also highlight the work by 
health coalitions. They have given us some suggestions to what the 
budget response should be on health care. We have also heard from 
several business organizations talked about their optimism with the 
economy and at the same time their desire to see some changes in 
the way we do business.
<P>
	These suggestions are always considered. They are always taken 
in good faith. They are very much appreciated. The government has 
every intention to follow up on these many ideas. The government 
is awaiting the committee report which will tabled in the House 
during the Christmas recess. It will have more ideas and a 
semblance of what we think should be done.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance was before the committee last week. He 
presented his idea of where we should be heading, the 2 per cent 
target for the deficit in two years. That was the new announcement 
for the second year of our rolling target. The committee 
wholeheartedly endorsed the suggestion, although there were two 
dissenting opinions. On the whole, the committee appreciated that 
the minister was very forthright about our new target. 
Parliamentarians, Canadians and people  around the world 
watching the Canadian fiscal situation were very pleased with what 
the minister said.
<P>
	One of the pledges which brought our government to office was 
to deliver genuine change in how the federal government manages 
its fiscal decision making; change that provided the public with 
more open access to information and a change which would give 
Canadians and their representatives, their members of Parliament, 
a real role in charting the course of action for the nation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The latest economic and fiscal update, which the Minister of 
Finance submitted last week to the House Standing Committee on 
Finance, is a very concrete example of this commitment to account 
publicly for our actions and to make our decisions openly. The 
same thing can be said about this debate.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	Again, I must challenge my hon. colleagues from all parties to 
seize this opportunity and provide the government with concrete, 
sensible, non-partisan advice. This is a chance to really make a 
difference in the interest of our constituents and of all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The 1995 budget demonstrated clearly and convincingly that 
public and parliamentary input was valued and acted on by our 
government. This was confirmed by the substantial public 
acceptance of that budget.
<P>
	It must be and will be the ideas and suggestions of all members 
that dominate this debate. Meaningful discussion occurs most 
easily when there is a clear and defined context for the issues 
involved. When it comes to budget planning, that context is 
nothing less than Canada's economy and the fiscal situation of this 
government.
<P>
	I would like to spend a few minutes highlighting some of the key 
points that the finance minister made in his presentation to the 
finance committee last week. Let me start as the finance minister 
did by reiterating one fundamental point.
<P>
	Our government's objective is not simply to provide a better 
balance sheet. It is to provide and work toward a better country, a 
fairer society. It is an economy that more than anything else is 
capable of producing the kinds of jobs and growth that will enable 
Canadians to have faith in their future. This is a compelling reason 
why our commitments to fiscal health will not falter.
<P>
	There is simply no contradiction between deficit reduction and 
job creation. Continued deficit reduction is essential if we are to get 
our interest rates down, interest rates that stand in the way in the 
creation of jobs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17679"> 17679 </A></B>
<P>
	The federal fiscal situation is directly tied to the outlook for 
the economy as a whole. I want to touch on how our economy 
has evolved since the last budget.
<P>
	Last February the budget projected an economic slowdown as 
high interest rates weakened the U.S. economy. Unfortunately that 
slowdown came much sooner than anyone anticipated. Today 
however we seem to be back on the right track. The U.S. economy 
is poised for a moderate expansion through 1996 and beyond, a 
growth that will contribute directly to Canada's growth.
<P>
	Domestically, interest rates have been falling. They are almost 
down 2.5 percentage points from the early 1995 highs. This 
contributes not only to spurring consumer and business confidence 
and investment, but also eases the cost of our debt charges.
<P>
	Another harbinger of renewed growth is the fact that our cost 
competitiveness continues to rebound strongly vis-à-vis the United 
States. It is now the best that it has ever been in the 45 years that we 
have kept data on this particular issue. In turn, our merchandise 
trade balance, exports over imports, stands at $34.6 billion, an 
all-time high in September.
<P>
	As we can see, our economic fundamentals are strong but as the 
finance minister warned our committee and all of us, the challenge 
is to keep them strong, to take the further budgetary action that will 
translate those basic strengths into more jobs for Canadians. That 
takes us to the fiscal challenge and the relationship between public 
debt and the economy.
<P>
	Twenty years ago for the federal government the debt to GDP 
ratio stood at 19 per cent; ten years ago it stood at 50 per cent; 
today it is close to 75 per cent. The issue is not simply excessive 
government spending. The very nature of the ratio is the 
relationship between two variables. The debt to GDP ratio reveals 
the two things on which we believe very strongly we must 
concentrate. One is to keep our spending under firm control. The 
other is the necessity to maximize the nation's potential, its 
productivity, its capacity to grow, its capacity to create jobs.
<P>
	I agree with the Minister of Finance. Our strategy must be based 
on synergy. Neither growth nor deficit reduction is sufficient alone 
but pursued together they can do the job.
<P>
<B>(1135 )</B>
<P>
	This brings me to the heart of our approach, the steady pace 
approach based on rolling two year targets that we have adopted. In 
my view, these do not undercut our commitment to ultimate deficit 
elimination. Instead, they are a credible strategy to make sure that 
we get to where we have to go without throwing the baby out with 
the bath water. Of course we could lighten our load further, just like 
we could lighten a car by throwing out the engine or removing the 
brakes, but that would not likely take us to where we want to go.
<P>
	Our government knows where it wants to go: to the destination 
Canadians have set for us which is to bring down the deficit firmly 
and consistently but in ways that sustain and enhance economic 
growth. That is what we are doing.
<P>
	By 1996-97 with our 3 per cent interim deficit target secured, we 
will have halted the growth of the debt to GDP ratio. But that 
simply sets the stage for the next challenge which is to ensure that 
this ratio continues to track downward, year after year, cycle after 
cycle.
<P>
	Meeting that challenge means more jobs. It means enhanced 
economic sovereignty as we free ourselves from being beholden to 
foreign lenders. That is why our government has mounted the 
largest assault on the federal deficit in Canadian history.
<P>
	In the 1994 budget we took action to deliver three year savings 
of $20 billion. In the 1995 budget we took even more dramatic 
action for a further $29 billion in budget turnaround. In both 
budgets the vast majority of our action items were spending cuts.
<P>
	The results are already becoming clear. Last month the finance 
minister announced that the deficit for our first full year in office 
was $37.5 billion, $2.2 billion below the target set in our first 
budget and $4.5 billion lower than the previous year.
<P>
	In 1993-94 the deficit stood at 5.9 per cent of GDP. It went down 
to 5 per cent last year. This year the deficit will continue to decline 
to 4.2 per cent of GDP, on its way to 3 per cent in 1996-97.
<P>
	In order to maintain that progress, the finance minister 
announced last week that the deficit for 1997-98 will be brought 
down to 2 per cent of GDP. This is estimated to be approximately 
$17 billion. This means that we will have cut last year's deficit by 
more than half. It also means that the debt to GDP ratio will be on a 
downward track.
<P>
	Furthermore, this means that the government's new borrowing 
requirements on credit markets in that year, which is the way that 
many other governments, including the United States, calculate 
their deficit, will be less than $7 billion, less than 1 per cent of 
GDP. This means that by 1997-98 new borrowing requirements in 
relationship to the size of our economy will be at their lowest level 
since 1969.
<P>
	I have emphasized our action on the spending side of the fiscal 
equation but I want to reiterate that there is a second track, which is 
the redesign of government itself and its programs to play a better 
part in creating jobs and growth. It is jobs and growth and the 
revenue they bring to government which will also help us to 
ultimately eliminate the deficit.
<P>
	That is why we have made improvements to the unemployment 
insurance program which have been the most profound in the last 
25 years, bringing it into line  with the labour market realities of the 
1990s. It is why we are encouraging small businesses to invest and 
hire by lessening the regulatory burden and by improving their 
access to capital. It is why the government is emphasizing trade 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17680"> 17680 </A></B>
<P>
missions around the world. Canada is a trading nation and new 
exports mean new jobs.
<P>
	There is a companion priority to jobs for our national well-being 
that our budget planning must encompass. That is to sustain our 
social programs in the face of a changing global economy and 
domestic demographics.
<P>
	This priority is reflected in our unequivocal support for Canada's 
health care system. It is also reflected in our commitment to ensure 
that Canadians are not discriminated against when they move from 
one part of the country to another and seek social assistance.
<P>

	Let me add a few notes about the nature of Winnipeg and 
Winnipeg North Centre. I was first elected to represent that 
constituency in 1988. Many people have said to me: ``You were the 
social policy critic of the Liberal Party in opposition and now you 
are working in finance. How do you resolve the two? Do you not 
feel as if you are doing harm to your own constituency?''
<P>
	Let me state quite clearly to the House that the actions we are 
taking will help my constituents to have a strong province and a 
stronger country. It will increase the ability of governments to 
respond for years to come. The actions we are taking now will 
provide more opportunities for them than could be imagined under 
the present debtload.
<P>
	The situation which has developed in the last 15 years has been 
an increase in child poverty, a high rate of high school dropouts, 
and the incidence of high unemployment in downtown Winnipeg. 
There is a feeling of helplessness, a feeling that governments 
cannot respond, that governments have neither the energy nor the 
ideas to develop a stronger economy.
<P>
	I want to assure my constituents that uppermost in my mind as I 
carry on in the position as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Finance, is the impact of these actions on their lives. I know that 
by the way we are gradually reducing the deficit we will not harm 
the ability of the federal or provincial governments to respond to 
their needs.
<P>
	There is in the public debate a great deal of noise about the 
impact of cutbacks on the provinces, about the impact of social 
transfers. Let me again assure everyone that every thought was 
given to minimize the impact on provinces such as Manitoba, 
Saskatchewan and other poorer provinces across the country so that 
they could retain the fiscal capacity to respond and deliver 
appropriate health care and social policies to our people. As the 
government regains its strength it will be able to respond even 
more clearly and strongly to ensure that  there are job 
opportunities, school opportunities and a lifestyle we can all be 
proud of.
<P>
	Let me conclude on the same note as I did over a year ago. For 
many years when it came to decisions on the economy and our 
fiscal dilemma, the federal government too often took the easy way 
out leaving the hard choices to another day. That has not been our 
path. We have taken the hard choices and the role of leadership, 
real action to bring the deficit down sharply, but we have also taken 
measures to boost economic strength and a real commitment to 
sustain the social safety net Canadians from coast to coast to coast 
cherish.
<P>
	The struggle is not over. We have more to do, further to go to 
complete our fiscal freedom. We must continue to set priorities for 
where the government can and must act to help growth and jobs.
<P>
	This is where we came in today. On behalf of the government, I 
encourage hon. members to share the ideas and concerns that we 
can work together on to ensure a strong and prosperous Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary 
to the Minister of Finance on his excellent speech. If only it 
reflected reality, it would be fantastic, but it does not. Coming back 
to the Liberal majority interim report on prebudget consultations, I 
would like to read to you a few lines of this whole report, which are 
quite telling and which distort the premises of this debate.
<P>
	The last paragraph of the interim report on prebudget 
consultations, the Liberal majority report, reads as follows: ``The 
Committee recommends that this House support the real and 
sustained progress being made on deficit reduction, while 
maintaining a balanced approach''.
<P>
	These few words seem to indicate that the government is taking 
the people of Quebec and Canada for fools, and that they are not; 
this is an insult to their intelligence.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that, in light of the actions it has taken 
over the past two years and the direction it is taking for the next 
three years, the government does not score well in terms of 
financial administration. Why not? Because the Minister of 
Finance will be meeting his targets in 1995-96 and in the following 
years at the expense of the unemployed, welfare recipients, 
students and those who are sick.
<P>
	When the Minister of Finance tells us that, in 1995-96, his 
deficit will reach $32.7 billion, we have to add to this $32.7 billion 
the $5 billion he snatched from the UI fund surplus.
<P>
	When he talks about having largely exceeded the deficit 
reduction target for 1996-97 set in his last budget,  when he talks 
about the deficit being brought back down to $24.3 billion in 
1996-97, once again, we have to add another $5 billion in funds 
snatched 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17681"> 17681 </A></B>
<P>
from the UI fund surplus. I remind the House that, since 1990, the 
federal government has not paid a dime into the UI fund, which is 
fed by employees and employers through their premiums. The 
Minister of Finance makes himself right at home, snatching from 
the UI fund surplus an amount of $5 billion that must be added to 
his 1996-97 deficit figure. Beside the $5 billion drawn from the UI 
fund, federal transfer cuts must also be taken into consideration. In 
1996-97, these cuts will total approximately $2.5 billion.
<P>
	Therefore, if we figure out the total for next year, that is if we 
add to the $24.3 billion deficit mentioned by the Minister of 
Finance in his economic statement the cuts in transfers to the 
provinces, as well as the surplus in the UI account, we arrive at an 
actual deficit of $31.8 billion for 1996-97.
<P>
	The same is true for 1997-98. The Minister of Finance paid a 
visit, with great pomp, to the committee last week and showed us, 
with his usual imposing presence, all kinds of nice and colourful 
diagrams and graphs. He told us that not only will he meet his 
budget goals but that, in 1997-98, he will be able to bring the 
federal deficit down, to 2 per cent of the GDP, or $17 billion. 
Again, the Minister of Finance does not tell the whole truth.
<P>
	The government is hiding some facts. Indeed, to this $17 billion 
deficit we must add $4.5 billion in cuts, which is a way for the 
federal government to offload its problems onto the provinces. Mr. 
Speaker, we are talking about $4.5 billion. The federal government 
dumps its deficit reduction responsibilities on the provinces, to the 
tune of $4.5 billion in 1997-98. Then, we must also add to that 
amount a $5 billion surplus in the UI account, which the Minister 
of Finance and his government will take from the UI fund.
<P>
	Therefore, far from standing at $17 billion as claimed by the 
finance minister and his secretary of state, the actual deficit in 
1997-98 will total $26.5 billion.
<P>
	When you look at all this you wonder what the Minister of 
Finance has done in the last two years to really provide leadership 
and sound management regarding Canada's public finances? What 
has he done? Nothing. The minister was content with taking, if not 
stealing, the UI surpluses. He was content with offloading his 
responsibilities onto the provinces, and, regrettably, he was content 
to solve his deficit problems on the back of the unemployed, the 
welfare recipients, the sick and, soon, the elderly.
<P>
	These are the corrections I wanted to make following the finance 
minister's snow job, which was added to this morning by his 
secretary of state.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	How does the Minister of Finance manage to get these surpluses 
in the UI account, which will be $5 billion this year, $5 billion next 
year and $5 billion the following year?
<P>
	He uses an approach which is twofold. First, as we saw with the 
reform introduced by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, which I consider to be a human tragedy, the minister 
came up with a plan to tighten UI eligibility criteria. In so doing, 
not only was a surplus created, but also the responsibility ends up 
dumped into the backyard of the provinces, as literally whole 
families, thousands of families eligible in the past for 
unemployment insurance, end up on welfare year after year.
<P>
	For Quebec alone, the Quebec department of income security 
calculates that no fewer than 10,500 additional households will end 
up on the welfare rolls in 1996-97 as a result of the tightened UI 
eligibility criteria which have been decreed by the Minister of 
Human Resources Development, lauded by the Minister of 
Finance, and backed by this government, one which has not shown 
a once of compassion in the two years it has been in power.
<P>
	In 1997-98, the tightening up of UI will force an additional 
26,500 households, 26,500 Quebec families, onto welfare. A 
further 27,500 Quebec households we be added in 1998-99. A sad 
thing to contemplate.
<P>
	The second equally heartless approach this government is using 
to create a surplus in a fund into which the government has not put 
a red cent for the past five years is to maintain high contribution 
levels for employees and employers.
<P>
	I think the public is entitled to know that contributions at this 
time represent $2.95 for each $100 of insurable earnings. The 
Minister of Finance could have reduced that figure, this very year, 
from $2.95 to $2.93, thus creating no fewer than 12,000 new jobs 
and meeting his deficit objectives for the coming year and the year 
after that, but he preferred to sacrifice 12,000 jobs by maintaining 
contribution levels at $2.95 per $100 of insurable earnings, instead 
of dropping them to $2.93. That is how they claim to have achieved 
the goal of sound and balanced administration of public finances 
that we all are seeking to achieve.
<P>
	As I have already said, the main victims of the two years of 
Liberal reign have been the jobless, the welfare recipients and the 
students. Before long, as the Minister of Finance disclosed during 
his appearance before the finance committee, it will be seniors 
whose necks are on the chopping block.
<P>
	Among the Minister of Finance's objectives, as revealed in his 
last budget, is a review of the Canada Pension Plan. Now, having 
tightened up UI eligibility criteria, he is focussing the same 
attention on the pension plan.
<P>
	But why make such a mess of things? Why reduce the federal 
government's deficit by creating a very substantial social deficit? 
There are other options. The Minister of Finance has other options 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17682"> 17682 </A></B>
<P>
than skimming the surplus off unemployment insurance. He has 
other options than offloading the deficit on the provinces and, in 
the process, on students, welfare recipients and those who are ill. 
He has other options than preventing the creation of thousands of 
jobs by keeping unemployment insurance premiums unduly high. 
He has other options than attacking senior citizens.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	And one of those options, one we have kept repeating for more 
than two years, is a thorough reform of corporate taxation. We keep 
telling him but it was not until others started saying the same thing 
that the minister realized that perhaps something could be done in 
that area, but there is still a lack of political will to do so. The 
people of Quebec and the people of Canada are not being told the 
whole truth, once again.
<P>
	Until 1987, the Department of Finance published statistics on 
Canadian businesses that made a profit without paying taxes. In 
1987, the last year for which figures were available, 93,405 
businesses had made profits totalling $27 billion without paying 
taxes. After that, do you know what they did? The Department of 
Finance and the Minister of Finance at the time and today, the 
current finance minister, were so ashamed of these figures and how 
they multiplied, because they tripled over a period of seven years, 
that they stopped publishing these statistics.
<P>
	According to a report from the Department of Finance published 
last year in December, if I am not mistaken, 288 tax measures were 
available to Canadian businesses, 288 measures they could use to 
avoid losing part of their profits to federal taxes.
<P>
	Let me tell you about two of these measures which the Minister 
of Finance, if he had the political will to do so, if he were not 
himself directly involved in the wonderful world of big business, 
could set in motion immediately and plug the holes in the tax 
system with little effort.
<P>
	First there is the income tax return, and then there are tax havens 
and the lack of fiscal measures to prevent Canadian businesses 
from using countries considered as tax havens as part of their tax 
planning.
<P>
	With respect to the tax return, allow me to quote from an 
excellent study done last September by Professors Bernard, Lauzon 
and Poirier, three researchers for the department of accounting 
sciences at the Université du Québec in Montreal.
<P>
	In connection with a study of 438 businesses, they say, and I 
quote: ``Of the 438 businesses included and analyzed in our study, 
we found that 200, or 46 per cent, actually paid less than 20 per 
cent of their profits in income tax in 1992. Two hundred businesses 
managed to  pay less than 20 per cent tax, because of the tax return. 
Of these 200 businesses, 30, or 6.8 per cent of the sample, received 
tax refunds totalling $126 million, despite profits of $200 million''.
<P>
	These 30 businesses received a tax refund of $126 million, 
despite profits of $200 million. Does this make sense?
<P>
	My quote continues: ``It is also noted that 51 businesses paid no 
income tax-0 per cent income tax-despite $282 million in 
profits before taxes. Of those 200 companies, 72, or 16.4 per cent, 
paid less than 10 per cent tax. Thus before tax profits of $2.2 billion 
gave rise to actual tax payments of $130 million, or approximately 
6 per cent income tax.''
<P>
	This is not considered unusual. The government considers this 
usual. The Reform Party is mum on the subject, their nest having 
been made long ago. They do not find it unusual that such 
businesses make huge profits and do not pay a cent of income tax, 
or almost none. It is acceptable for these business to use 288 
measures to get around having to pay and for the government to 
make drastic cuts in unemployment insurance and in transfers to 
the provinces for welfare, post-secondary education and health 
care. For the Liberals and the Reform Party this is fine, just as it is 
to continue with a tax system that no longer makes any sense.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	It makes no sense when we look not only at these facts but also at 
the market emerging for the exchange, the sale of tax losses. These 
classified ads can be seen every day in the newspapers, as I have 
said repeatedly over the past two years. The <I>Globe and Mail</I>, the 
<I>Financial Post</I>, <I>The Economist</I>, all financial and business 
magazines carry ads like this one: ``Tax losses for sale''.
<P>
	Just imagine, they are no longer selling goods and services but 
tax deductions. The ad goes on to say: ``Our client, a cosmetics 
distributor with large tax losses and undervalued assets seeks a 
buyer who can use his tax deductions. Discretion assured''. I 
should hope so, discretion assured. They should be ashamed of 
themselves. ``Please contact-''I will not identify the company but 
not because I am not tempted to do so.
<P>
	I find it simply outrageous that, faced with this evidence, the 
government, the Minister of Finance, the Reform Party can hide the 
reality of tax evasion from the population and not have done 
anything in the last two years to close the loopholes. Another way 
for large corporations and high income people to avoid paying their 
fair share to the federal government is to use so-called tax havens.
<P>
	An article in last June's <I>CA Magazine</I>, the magazine for 
Canadian chartered accountants, urged large corporations and very 
high income individuals to create companies in countries regarded 
as tax havens. It urged  Canadian chartered accountants to create 
these phoney companies in tax havens such as Bermuda and some 
Caribbean countries so that they can shelter their millions of 
dollars in profits and avoid paying taxes to the Canadian 
government, or pay very little.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17683"> 17683 </A></B>
<P>
	That is a lot of money. In 1992, the auditor general talked about 
$16 billion in revenue lost to those countries regarded as tax 
havens; $16 billion is a lot of money. Although all individuals are 
required by tax laws to report all the money they make outside 
Canada, corporations and businesses are not. They are not required 
to report their income outside Canada.
<P>
	The hundreds of millions, even billions of dollars in profits, as 
the auditor general said in 1992, that go through the phoney 
companies set up in these tax havens are not taxed. The profits are 
sent back to Canada without being taxed so that thousands of 
Canadian businesses, most of them large corporations, do not pay 
one penny of tax while making billions of dollars in profits.
<P>
	I do not understand why the Minister of Finance has not yet 
initiated a corporate tax reform, as we have been asking him to do 
for the past two years. He should do it, if only to be fair to 
businesses that do pay their taxes, to the majority of 
businesses-we all know entrepreneurs-with a sense of corporate 
citizenship.
<P>
	He should also do it to be fair to those businesses that see other 
businesses, like the ones I just mentioned, get away with not paying 
a cent in taxes when they, on the other hand, are bled dry, especially 
since 1990, to be good corporate citizens, and when individual 
taxpayers are even worse off than businesses, paying taxes year in 
year out but being affected by all the cutbacks, like the ones 
announced by the Minister of Finance, that were made since 1984 
to the UI fund and to federal transfer payments. At the end of the 
day, it is always the same people, the taxpayers, who foot the bill 
for these inhuman measures, which border on incompetence in 
improving the state of public finance as planned.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	We are always accused of getting on the case of banks. Well, 
they will come under scrutiny because, when we look at tax havens 
and at what the six major Canadian banks are doing, it is 
outrageous. Is there nothing wrong with these banks being allowed 
to use such tax havens to avoid paying taxes to the federal 
government?
<P>
	There are quite telling figures in this regard. Just the other day, 
officials of major banks were close to tears, saying: ``We have to 
pay taxes. That is terrible. They are strangling us''. Banks will 
make $4 billion in profits this year, and they are complaining about 
being strangled.
<P>
	Is it normal that the Scotia Bank, for example, has more 
branches in the Caribbean alone that around the world? Scotia has 
33 branches in the Caribbean, in small  countries that are generally 
viewed as tax havens. Thirty three branches. It has one branch in 
America outside the Caribbean, five in Europe, seven in Asia-I 
would say there are quite are few more people, potential customers, 
in Asia than in the Caribbean-but 33 in the Caribbean.
<P>
	It is the same thing with CIBC: seven branches in the Caribbean. 
Same for the Royal Bank: ten branches in the Caribbean. There are 
even countries with a population of barely 60,000 where Canadian 
banks have four branches.
<P>
	Is it normal to put up with that? Is it normal to let these banks 
take advantage of tax loopholes to transfer hundreds of millions in 
these countries, take the profits back home, not pay any federal 
taxes, and then announce with great pump, as they did one after the 
other last week, record profits for 1995? This no longer makes any 
sense.
<P>
	In view of this situation, it is not surprising that, since 1950, the 
fiscal contribution of Canadian companies, unlike that of 
individual taxpayers, has been shrinking and is now next to 
nothing.
<P>
	Let us take a brief look at history. In 1950, companies paid 23 
per cent of all taxes collected by the state, compared to 24 per cent 
for individual taxpayers. In other words, the contribution of 
companies and individual taxpayers was essentially the same.
<P>
	And what were these contributions in 1993? The federal 
government collected 52.7 per cent of its taxes from individuals, 
compared to only 6.5 per cent from companies. That change alone 
should make us wonder. It should make the Minister of Finance, as 
we have been asking him to for two years, undertake, with our 
assistance, a comprehensive and in-depth review of the corporate 
tax system.
<P>
	But this is not all. On December 8, it was mentioned in the daily 
<I>La Presse</I> that companies should pay more taxes. The article read, 
in part: ``Corporate tax represents a smaller proportion of the GDP 
in Canada''-a comparison was being made with the United 
States- ``and this gives us reason to believe that it might be 
possible to reduce some of the tax benefits granted to Canadian 
companies''.
<P>
	Who expressed that view? It is not leftist groups, nor the Bloc 
Quebecois, the unions or some progressive organizations. Do you 
know who said that? It is the International Monetary Fund, which is 
a group of very conservative analysts, conservative not in the 
political but in the philosophical sense of the word. These people 
usually ask the Minister of Finance to cut twice as deeply as he 
actually does in federal programs and expenditures. But this time, 
the IMF is asking the minister to review the corporate tax 
legislation and perhaps impose higher taxes on companies, at least 
those that do not pay their fair share, and there are a quite a few of 
them.
<P>
	There is a gap between what goes on and what we have been 
asking for two years from the Minister of Finance.  If the minister 
really wanted to show some leadership in putting our fiscal house 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17684"> 17684 </A></B>
<P>
in order, he would not target the poor. He should take a 
comprehensive approach regarding this issue. When we speak of 
fiscal consolidation, this means not only expenditures but also tax 
receipts, revenue.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	Is it possible, from what I have just demonstrated, that the 
Canadian tax system may want some cleaning up? That it may be 
time to do some tidying of corporate taxation, after 30 years of 
adding on and taking off new measures, top-loading as it is termed? 
If only out of a need for fairness, as I have said, for those who pay 
their taxes as opposed to those who do not, as well as to simplify 
the system.
<P>
	Two years ago, I asked the library for some reference books so 
that I could know all there was to know about taxation. I do not 
think my office could have held all of the documentation I would 
have had to read to be an expert like those folks who get half a 
million dollars a year to advise businesses to open up branches in 
tax havens, or those who write in CA Magazine.
<P>
	For all of these reasons, the Bloc categorically rejects what the 
Liberal majority report states concerning pre-budget consultations. 
I would like to indicate four approaches the Minister of Finance 
might use in preparing his next budget.
<P>
	The first is absolutely vital: the Minister of Finance must reform 
the corporate taxation system.
<P>
	Second, as the Quebec Finance Minister asked this week, the 
federal government must forget about the Canada social transfer 
for Quebec and give it tax points, in order to eliminate duplication 
and overlap in the management of this reality, thus enabling 
Quebec to assume the responsibilities the federal government has 
abdicated with respect to the most disadvantaged in society. 
Quebec can take over and do it much better.
<P>
	Our third suggested measure: further defence cuts. Another $1.5 
or 2 billion could well be cut as early as next year. This is 
something he can and must do.
<P>
	As for the fourth measure, we are asking the Minister of Finance 
to stop dumping on the jobless, welfare recipients, students and the 
sick-as well as the seniors who are about to be added to their 
ranks.
<P>
	These are the four points the Minister of Finance and his 
government ought to be guided by, after two years of showing 
absolutely no compassion toward the most unfortunate of our 
society, while boasting of how well they are handling public funds, 
this is nothing but smoke and mirrors.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pursuant to the agreement, the hon. 
member for Capilano-Howe Sound will now speak for 30 
minutes, without questions or comments, on behalf of the Reform 
Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to offer the Reform Party's first 
comments on the preliminary report of the finance committee's 
prebudget hearings which was tabled today.
<P>
	To come right to the point, Reform considers the report's budget 
recommendations to be too timid. The proposed deficit target of 
$17 billion or 2 per cent of GDP in 1997-98 is totally inadequate.
<P>
	I remind Canadians that even two years from now the 
government plans to add $50 million per day to the debt, which by 
then will be over $600 billion. This amount is $2 million more per 
hour than it collects. Currently the government is spending $4 
million more per hour than it brings in.
<P>
	In addition, the absence of a definite date for complete deficit 
elimination is very undesirable, as is the failure to announce any 
plans for tax reform and reduction.
<P>
	In the Reform Party's minority report we set out our alternative 
recommendations to the Minister of Finance: cut spending 
sufficiently to achieve a deficit of $12 billion or 1.5 per cent of 
GDP for fiscal year 1997-98.
<P>
	It is important to recommend announcement of a budget in 
balance or in slight surplus in election year 1998-99. In addition, 
we suggest the minister offer Canadians hope by the promise that 
budget surpluses generated by economic growth in the following 
years will be used partly to reduce taxes and partly to lower the 
debt.
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	The proportion in which this is done will have to be decided, but 
a definite commitment to this kind of plan is necessary in order to 
prevent the successive pressure for using surpluses for further 
increases in spending.
<P>
	We urge the minister to initiate plans for the introduction of a 
simplified tax featuring a single rate with a generous personal and 
spousal exemption, thereby restoring fairness, visibility and 
efficiency. This simplified taxation system would end the 
nightmare of the GST.
<P>
	Before I present our reasons for opposing the government's 
recommendations and offering our own, I want to raise a point 
which troubles me greatly. If the past is any guide to the future, 
many speakers in the House will attack the fiscal plans of the 
Reform Party on the grounds they are slash and burn and show a 
disregard for the welfare of the most needy in society.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17685"> 17685 </A></B>
<P>
	This attack is balderdash. Our program is not slash and burn. 
No one in the House has a monopoly on compassion. We propose 
our program precisely because we care and want to preserve 
Canada's support for the neediest. We defer with Liberals on the 
merit of cutting today versus cutting tomorrow and a number of 
other mainly technical issues of economic management.
<P>
	I will discuss these issues and hope that Liberal members will 
similarly stay away from denouncing moral standards of others and 
proclaiming the superiority of their own. All Canadians will benefit 
if they do.
<P>
	With this preliminary out of the way, let me now turn to 
discussion of Reform's position in favour of the more rapid 
elimination of the deficit. In developing this position, I draw 
heavily on ideas which were advanced by the IMF, several 
Canadian think tanks and a large number of business leaders, 
economists and private individuals in their presentations to the 
finance committee.
<P>
	We recommend the elimination of the deficit by the end of the 
government's mandate because it reduces the risk that some 
threatening event will once again increase the deficit to the point at 
which the debt grows more rapidly than national income. As more 
and more Canadians realize, when this happens we find ourselves 
in the unsustainable situation in which we need to borrow ever 
increasing amounts to pay the interest on the ever growing debt. To 
use analogies that have become so popular, we would not be on a 
treadmill standing still. The treadmill would keep speeding up and 
making it more and difficult to keep up with it.
<P>
	One threatening event pointed to by witnesses is the downturn in 
economic activity certain to take place before very long. Another 
threat stems from the traditional reluctance of governments to 
enact spending cuts in an election year. Concerns were expressed 
about the consequences of another Quebec crisis which could result 
in large increases in the interest on the government's debt and thus 
aggravating the deficit position again.
<P>
	The second reason we recommend presenting a target for a 
balanced budget is it signals to capital markets the government's 
political courage and determination. As many witnesses noted, if 
the government did so, capital markets would reward Canada by 
eliminating the risk premium on the interest rate they now demand.
<P>
	In a speech a couple of days ago, the Governor of the Bank of 
Canada in his technical capacity noted that one of the big problems 
Canada faces is the risk premium that puts the Canadian interest 
rate above the U.S. rate due to the deficit and a lack of a signal by 
the government to come to firm grips with the deficit.
<P>
	If we went ahead and the result were a lower interest rate it 
would then stimulate housing and other interest sensitive demand. 
The increased economic growth and  tax revenues would move 
Canada into a virtuous cycle for a change of smaller deficits, even 
lower interest rates and more opportunity for tax cuts and debt 
reduction. This is not fantasy; this is an idea supported by many 
witnesses who appeared before the finance committee.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	The government's rolling or shifting target of slow deficit 
reduction offers the worst of both worlds. The cuts create 
unemployment and uncertainty, which make consumers reluctant 
to spend and slow economic growth. At the same time, capital 
markets are reluctant to reduce the risk premium on interest rates 
because the cuts are too small and there is no definite date for the 
elimination of the deficit. We heard that argument in the finance 
committee again and again.
<P>
	The announced target of a $17 billion deficit in 1997-98 carries 
another risk. The careful analysis of the effects of economic 
growth, interest rates and spending cuts already announced suggest 
that with any luck and the proper treatment of the precautionary 
reserve this target is attainable with additional cuts of as little as $1 
billion. It may be more, but it could conceivably be done by cutting 
an additional $1 billion. For the sake of all Canadians, I hope 
capital markets will not interpret this fact as evidence that the 
government has lost its nerve and more than two years before the 
election plans no more spending cuts to balance the budget. If they 
do, the risk premium on interest rates is sure to rise and the deficit 
will be even larger.
<P>
	Third, we believe the complete elimination of the deficit by 
1998-99 does not involve slash and burn. As the Minister of 
Finance found out during the referendum campaign with his 
reference to job losses of one million due to separation, hyperbole 
may be rhetorically satisfying but it has its risks. The IMF and 
numerous other analysts have noted that many billions of old age 
security and UI benefits go to Canadians who by all acceptable 
standards can do without them during this period of national 
emergency. This is a national emergency.
<P>
	With a little political courage, reduced payments to high income 
earners would permit the complete elimination of the deficit 
without the need to cut into the support for Canadians with true 
needs and into other spending programs of the sort discussed by the 
finance minister in his report which yield high economic and social 
return.
<P>
	We believe the Prime Minister's decision to rule out any and all 
cuts to these social programs, made on the eve of the referendum 
campaign for whatever political or ideological reason, very much 
harmed the broad interests of Canadians. I predict history will not 
be kind to him on this matter. It certainly has put the Minister of 
Finance in the position in which he will have to make some cuts in 
otherwise desirable government programs, and all Canadians will 
suffer.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17686"> 17686 </A></B>
<P>
	In this context it is important to note that the Reform budget 
would not harm but might increase prosperity in employment. This 
is so because on the one hand the recommended spending cuts of 
1.5 per cent of GDP are only one-half of the normal economic 
growth of the 3 per cent per year which was made famous by the 
red book. On the other hand, the lower interest rate and the 
restoration of confidence in the country's fiscal future which the 
governor of the Bank of Canada talked about would stimulate 
demand more than that lost through the cuts.
<P>
	The fourth reason for presenting our program is that the delay of 
spending cuts results in the accumulation of more debt, which in 
turn necessitates higher interest payments and even more cuts in 
program spending in the future. This is illustrated dramatically by 
the realization that in this fiscal year total government spending has 
remained unchanged from last year at $120 billion in spite of cuts 
in program spending of $11 billion. The cuts were eaten up by 
higher interest.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	More dramatically, if the government had made serious cuts in 
the first budget early in 1994, as Reform had recommended, it 
could now announce a surplus at the end of its mandate without 
having to make further cuts. The country's debt would now be 
much lower and the level of program spending would not have to 
be reduced as much as it will have to be done even now.
<P>
	This means ultimately the Liberal approach to balancing the 
budget will necessitate lower spending on social and other 
programs than does the Reform approach. Note the irony of it all, 
Liberal backbenchers. Note that the minister would not have had to 
do what he did in his report, announce the need to renege on red 
book promises on the maintenance of social spending and other 
programs so loved by Liberals who believe the government is a 
source of everything good in this world.
<P>
	Let me quote one sentence, a hidden way of reneging on the red 
book: ``On these two central priorities, more jobs and more social 
programs, we would be less than candid today if we pretended that 
we are doing all we would like''. Substitute ``all we would like'' for 
what they promised in the red book and we will see how in a sneaky 
way red book promises are being abandoned.
<P>
	I have a comment on our proposed rate of spending cuts. 
Canadians are becoming cynical and discouraged. They have been 
hammered for years with talk about spending cuts. Every day they 
learn about more layoffs, reduced government services and higher 
taxes accompanied by reports that the deficit still adds millions to 
the debt every hour. No wonder they are worried and do not spend 
enough to create the economic boom we should have right now, so 
many years since the end of the recession.
<P>
	All of our prosperity, all the job creation the Liberals are 
bragging about that took place since they took over were the result 
of a booming economy in the United States. All of our output 
growth was driven by exports. They were lucky.
<P>
	People are not spending because they have no confidence. 
Canadians need confidence but they also need hope. They need to 
see light at the end of the tunnel. The failure to accommodate these 
aspirations of Canadians is perhaps the greatest shortcoming of the 
Liberal budget plan and one of the greatest strengths of the Reform 
alternative.
<P>
	We offer a general reduction in the tax burden out of the revenue 
surplus which will be sure to materialize once the deficit monkey is 
off our backs. We are offering a lowering of the debt burden so that 
even more tax cuts can be enjoyed in future years.
<P>
	We offer these tax cuts in the context of tax reform which would 
eliminate the abomination called the GST. We would offer hope for 
the young generation which will be burdened with this outrageous 
75 per cent of GDP, $600 billion or more of debt probably by the 
time the government gets through with its timid cuts, a trillion 
dollar debt and the interest on it.
<P>
	I recently attended a conference on the future of our social 
security programs and the problems caused by the baby boomers. 
By the year 2030, some actuaries are saying, just to deliver on the 
already existing promises for old age security benefits, on 
medicare and on CPP we will need to raise $50 billion. This $50 
billion will have to be raised by a generation that has fewer people 
of working age than we have right now.
<P>
	They will need an increase in their personal income taxes by 50 
per cent.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	The young generation should be on the barricade. We have to 
work on the social security program we are leaving as a mandate to 
future generations. Another thing we can work on right now is that 
extra legacy, almost a trillion dollars worth of debt, and if we 
combine the provincial and the federal debt, that figure is easily 
reached. It will at least be that much there is a recession, and then 
some of the other contingencies that witnesses have talked about 
will be realized.
<P>
	It is one of the great hidden scandals that we in this House are 
borrowing and are forcing it on a yet unborn generation and young 
people who are too occupied with making a living. Our debt burden 
is the greatest in the history of this country and is one of the 
greatest in the history of the world. People who cannot vote are 
being asked to tax themselves so that we can live beyond our 
means.
<P>
	No wonder we are getting rave reviews as being the greatest 
country in which to live. Any country can do that  as long as it has 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17687"> 17687 </A></B>
<P>
credit and is prepared to borrow from as yet unborn generations. 
Live and blow it, have a great life for everyone. Get yourself a 
glowing report in the United Nations. It is okay that it is done on 
borrowed money. Those young people do not have any vote yet. 
That approach is the ultimate in cynicism. I find it unbelievable 
this issue is not being raised. We have been promised a white book 
on pension reform. Nothing. They are too timid to even raise it. It is 
one of the greatest scandals we are going through at the moment.
<P>
	It will take another 20 years when this crunch will begin to hit. 
Twenty years is nothing, nothing, yet it is not being discussed at all. 
When it comes to one portion of that unbelievably horrendous 
legacy we leave for our children, grandchildren and as yet unborn 
generations, we hear: ``Oh, no, we cannot be too tough on 
Canadians who are making $50,000 a year on old age security 
benefits. We promised it to them''.
<P>
	We could ask Canadian pensioners who are making over $50,000 
a year in today's dollars: ``Do you know what kind of a burden your 
generation and the generation sitting in this House is passing on to 
your children and grandchildren? Do you not think we ought to 
share and get together to make sure it is not as big as this?'' I 
believe if I spoke to audiences and pointed this out, they all would 
say: ``Yes, I am prepared to take a little cut in my income''. That is 
all it would take. The IMF and everybody who looks at these 
numbers points out that it would not take a great deal of sacrifice to 
do this.
<P>
	What does the Prime Minister do? Probably without consulting 
anyone he commits his government never to do what everybody 
says is necessary. I hear Canadians saying that we should be doing 
it because it is not right to burden future generations, our children 
and grandchildren, with the amount we have.
<P>
	In concluding my analysis of the government's prebudget 
recommendations, let me note that the views I expressed were 
shared by a large number of witnesses who appeared before the 
finance committee. They reflect the concern of those who argued 
for the preservation of our country's social security net. I am sure 
they are shared by a very large segment of our population. I am 
sorry, truly sorry, they are not shared by the Minister of Finance, 
cabinet and Liberal backbenchers. How good it would be for 
Canada if they did.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it 
interesting to speak following the slash and burn speech I just 
heard. Let me say to the hon. member that this government instead 
of just listening to the IMF and taking its direction, listens to the 
Canadian people and tries to meet their needs through the budget 
that we propose.
<P>
	I will begin by thanking the members of the Standing Committee 
on Finance for their efforts in terms of holding prebudget 
consultations across the country. On November 27 the finance 
committee conducted prebudget hearings in my province of Prince 
Edward Island. That gave the opportunity for many island groups 
and individuals to present their views on the direction the 
government must take when designing the 1996 budget. Their 
views will certainly assist the committee in preparing its 
recommendations for the minister. I want to thank those islanders 
who took the time and the effort to think through the briefs and to 
present them.
<P>
	There is no question about it the round table in Charlottetown put 
forward many views and recommendations from all sides of 
society. It is crucial that the government listen to what those 
presentations said. We had to find a balance between the massive 
job of deficit reduction and our social obligations to all Canadians. 
I would like to quote a couple of remarks from those presentations 
because they do differ from the left to the right of the political 
spectrum.
<P>
	The Charlottetown Chamber of Commerce put forward its 
position that ``the deficit must be reduced more rapidly with tough 
but attainable targets being clearly set out and achieved''. They do 
go on to say though that ``the entire program could take over 25 
years. Given that we have had 20 years of overspending to arrive at 
our present position, such a time frame for debt elimination is both 
appropriate and manageable''. As well, the chamber of commerce 
suggested four points: continuation of privatization; harmonization 
of the GST and PST; doing away with jurisdictional overlaps; and 
changing the annual filing system to perhaps two or three years in 
order to save money.
<P>
	A different presentation from the opposite side of the spectrum 
came from John Eldon Green. He said: ``I am not one of those who 
believes the new disentanglement can be achieved according to the 
rapid schedule of the finance minister or those around him, or 
indeed of the entire financial community in Canada. I would get out 
of debt the way we got into it, slowly, gradually and over the long 
term. What is now being attempted is entirely counter to the 
creation of an environment for jobs and growth'', from his point of 
view.
<P>
	Mr. Green went on to say: ``The issue for me is: How much 
money is there in Canada and what is an appropriate amount to be 
left with the people, allocated to governments and devolved to 
other countries? Our borders have to remain open to business, but I 
have trouble seeing the jobs and businesses of people around me 
being sacrificed in the cause of global business and undertaxed 
profit. However I do not know the numbers but then no one in 
Ottawa these days seems to know anything but''. I think it is a valid 
point.
<P>
	The view of priorities that governments should set for 
themselves is not disputed. We as a government must also  
recognize 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17688"> 17688 </A></B>
<P>
that if they are achieved at the expense of social programs on which 
all Canadians depend, then this quick fix is much too high a price to 
pay.
<P>
	There are basic programs that benefit all Canadians as well as 
the business community: educational programs, medicare, et 
cetera. Yes, these programs do cost money but we can have a 
debate on whether it is a cost or an investment. I see these kinds of 
programs that this government is pursuing as an investment in the 
people of this country to ensure that they have the means by which 
to work in the job community in the future.
<P>
	In fact many of these programs that we have as a Canadian 
government today are an asset to the business community in terms 
of its members being able to compete abroad.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	We must maintain the level of social programs we currently 
have. They are one thing that unites us as a country and why this 
country is recognized as the best country in the world in which to 
live.
<P>
	The approach taken by the minister to date has been a reasonable 
one. The minister's statement last week showed the progress we are 
making. Some, like members of the third party we just heard, like 
to blow the deficit out of proportion. Somehow they disregard the 
needs of people. They like to blow the deficit out of proportion and 
negate the progress we have made. Clearly, we have made 
progress.
<P>
	The 1994-95 deficit was $400 million lower than predicted. We 
are on track to reduce the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP by 1996-97 in 
a timely and reasonable way. In my province in November 1995 the 
unemployment rate fell to 12.2 per cent, down more than 6 per cent 
from the 18.5 per cent when this government took office. Retail 
trade has strengthened through 1995 and outperforms by far the 
national level.
<P>
	Given that kind of progress, we now must undertake and make a 
much greater effort to better balance the social side of the equation. 
Yesterday's announcement by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development is a move in the right direction in terms of increasing 
child care spaces in the country.
<P>
	In terms of the social and tax balance on the tax expenditure side, 
a loss of tax due to a tax break either to corporations or to the 
wealthy is as much a cost as the direct expenditure of dollars under 
government programs. To date, governments at all levels have 
tended to target the direct expenditures and too much have ignored 
the tax expenditures. It is very important in this budget to try and 
balance that.
<P>
	I know it is not easy in the face of the current attitudes that are 
prevalent throughout the country and throughout the world. I want 
to quote from Peter Newman's book, <I>The Canadian Revolution</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``The values of the marketplace have infiltrated every institution in Canada: 
the family, the church, the legal system.... Anti-human, commercial values are 
dominating every sphere of life. Now that we're coming into economic hard 
times, the sense of each man for himself-save your own skin, get whatever 
advantage you can-is going to sink public spiritedness and make it much more 
difficult to preserve our sense of obligation to community''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I make that point to stress the kind of attitudes that are out there 
at the moment. Those are the kinds of attitudes that are coming 
from the Reform Party. Real leadership by the government in the 
face of that hard nosed attitude is required. The Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Finance mentioned earlier the action 
necessary which the government is taking to address the concerns 
of people.
<P>
	The employment insurance proposal was one that was 
mentioned. I do want to point out that I hope two measures in that 
bill can be changed. One is the intensity of work rule and the other 
is the calculation of the benefit base. We must ensure coming out of 
this budget and the policy objectives of the government that the 
seasonal industries do have the opportunity to grow and prosper.
<P>
	In conclusion, let me quickly list some of the initiatives I would 
like to see furthered in the next budget.
<P>
	We must start to develop a program that deals with child poverty. 
Expansion of the infrastructure works program should also be 
considered. That has been an excellent program. In fact, it has put 
in place a base for businesses to develop and grow.
<P>
	The major industries in Canada are still the natural resource 
industries. Although we hear much about the knowledge based 
industries and the technological highway, it is important that we 
not ignore those natural based industries: agriculture, fisheries, 
forestry and mining.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	As well, we need to enhance and strengthen the ability to market 
products internationally. We need to renew our commitment to the 
great marketing institutions across this nation, the Canadian Wheat 
Board and the supply management boards which have brought 
prosperity to communities and continue to contribute to the balance 
of trade.
<P>
	We need to continue to maintain and strengthen our regional 
development programs and, in my area, specifically, ACOA. I will 
make one point on ACOA. Since 1993, ACOA's programming and 
partnering with the provinces and the private sector has created and 
maintained over 46,200 jobs. It has assisted 5,300 businesses. It 
has a proven track record in small and medium size business 
development.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I begin my 
remarks by noting that this is the third year in a row  that members 
of the House have been invited to participate in a prebudget debate. 
They have been asked to share with the Chamber and certainly to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17689"> 17689 </A></B>
<P>
share with the Minister of Finance their particular points of view, 
their advice and their concerns about the direction and the hopes 
for our country and its fiscal circumstances.
<P>
	I will make my remarks from two points of view today; one, as a 
member of the Standing Committee on Finance and, second, as the 
member of Parliament for Brant. I have recently met with my 
constituents at one public meeting to talk about the budget and will 
meet with them again early in the new year to collect more input 
and advice.
<P>
	From the point of view of a member of the committee there are 
three things that have struck me over the course of the prebudget 
consultations that have been under way since September. First of 
all, it is very clear to me that there is a different tone in the 
representations that are being made at the committee table this time 
around.
<P>
	If members recall, last year at this time the newspapers were full 
of the issue of the budget and the fiscal circumstances. As members 
of Parliament, we were receiving all kinds of representations from 
constituents, from lobby groups about what we should and should 
not do, what our strategy should be and what our approach should 
be.
<P>
	Very soon after that, in fact as soon as the budget was tabled, all 
that frenzy melted away because the Minister of Finance had 
listened. He responded to Canadians. He addressed their concerns 
with a very effective budget.
<P>
	That calmness, that understanding, that support for the approach 
to budgetary strategies continues. The tone since September has 
been a measured tone, a very supportive tone, one that shows 
appreciation for the approach the government has taken. It shows 
appreciation for the strategy of rolling targets. It shows acceptance 
that the government is going to make its commitment of reducing 
the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP. It shows support for the fact that 
conservative assumptions are taken into consideration when 
preparing the budget package. It shows acceptance of the notion of 
having a contingency reserve so that as the economy's cycles work 
their course, that fund will keep us on target to meet the goals that 
have been set.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance came to the committee recently and 
indicated that for 1997-1998 the deficit goal would be improved to 
2 per cent of GDP. I strongly support that strategy. I would 
encourage him again to use conservative assumptions as he 
prepares his budget for 1995-1996.
<P>
	The committee was told in several ways and several times over 
the course of the budget hearings, by economists, by members of 
the business community, not to forget that Canada is in a cycle and 
we can anticipate  somewhat of a downturn in the near future. I 
would encourage the minister to consider maybe increasing the 
contingency reserve that has been addressed to date.
<P>
	This is all good. The tone is solid. It is supportive of our 
approach.
<P>
	There is something else that is interesting. In this set of 
prebudget debates the focus has turned away from being solely on 
the deficit to actually talking about the debt. What that says to me 
is that Canadians are quite confident that the first strategy, the first 
hurdle; the hurdle of the deficit has been managed and now they 
want to continue on with good, sound fiscal management and start 
to attack the debt.
<P>
	The minister spoke about that, as did many witnesses as well. It 
is a process, an evolution, a confidence that the government is 
moving in the right direction.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	Third, I would like to point out the issue of quality. The 
presentations that have been made to the committee over these last 
few months have been exceptional. They were even better than last 
year. We in the committee are starting to learn more effective uses 
of the consultative process. We used the round table as the hon. 
member before me noted. It is a very effective way of getting 
Canadians to come together and understand the different 
perspectives and concerns that people have, their needs and 
requirements.
<P>
	However, I would point directly to some of the sectors in our 
community which have worked so hard to pull themselves together 
and build a consensus before they come to committee. When they 
come to the committee they have a single voice. They are very 
clear in what they are looking for and they make a very pointed and 
accurate intervention.
<P>
	The health community came together under HEAL and 
presented its suggestions to us so that a strong and healthy Canada 
Health Act can be maintained.
<P>
	The voluntary sector has done an incredible job over this last 
year bringing dozens of groups together to build a consensus. It 
stated that these groups were building so they could be considered 
as a voluntary sector in this economy. It made some very good 
representations and suggestions to us that will help us to encourage 
donations at the moderate level and at the high level from 
businesses. We have to listen very carefully to this group's 
representations and give it some time because it is coming together 
and will provide Canadian society with very valuable contributions 
and partnerships that should be supported.
<P>
	I also think of the coalition for private and public partnership 
where the private sector has come together with public partners and 
said that they can work together in this notion of 
privatization-commercialization in identifying where the effective 
partnerships can be built.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17690"> 17690 </A></B>
<P>
	These are the kinds of things that Canadians are doing now as 
a result of the government's approach to managing the country's 
fiscal requirements. They are moving in the right direction and 
I am proud of it.
<P>
	I would now like to turn to the messages that my constituents are 
giving me back in the riding of Brant. As I said, we met late in 
November with a very interesting group of people from all sides of 
the political spectrum. The message was loudly and clearly heard 
that Canadians in my community want us to continue on the deficit 
reduction track, to move toward dealing with the debt, to do it 
without raising personal income taxes and to manage it on the 
spending side.
<P>
	In Ontario, people in my riding are now able to juxtapose the 
different strategies. The government's strategy is of a balanced, 
measured, thought out approach that is timed and pitted against 
goals that are set versus the strategy of the provincial Tory 
government, in fact almost Reform government, taking a slash and 
burn approach. There are two different ways of getting to the end 
and Canadians are saying to do it in the Liberal way.
<P>
	I need to tell members about individuals in my riding who have 
suffered as a result of the Tory strategy. They did not know that 
their social security cheques were going to be cut by 20 per cent. 
They were not told. If they had been told they would have had to 
read it in the newspapers and not everyone has those facilities or 
capabilities. It is unconscionable, inhumane and not what 
governments are about.
<P>
	Despite those that say that governments should be managed like 
businesses, it is just not true. Governments are here for people. 
Governments have to manage in that fashion. Therefore, I am very 
proud and certainly support the strategy of the government to take a 
balanced, measured and stable approach to managing our fiscal 
house.
<P>
	One gentleman in our conversation, Mr. Dave Levac, brought up 
an issue that people are concerned about which is the issue of 
government accountability. We know we have to do a better job at 
letting people know what our goals are and about measuring 
ourselves against our goals. Mr. Levac suggested that ministries, 
when they do not spend all the money allocated to them over the 
course of a budgetary period, contribute that directly to deficit 
reduction. That is not a bad idea but there may be some very 
complicated and technical administrative costs that are associated 
with that. However, what my constituents are saying is that 
government still has a way to go in assuring the Canadian public 
that it is truly accountable in spending tax dollars effectively. I 
accept that input. We do have to work more effectively in that 
regard.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Finally, on a detailed level my constituents very much were 
supportive of a government that supports the social  side, the side 
that speaks to individuals, the Canadian public. They said that 
government support to the economy, to industries and business 
through subsidies, is probably one place where the government 
should continue to make cuts. Let the market look after itself.
<P>
	We heard that at length over the course of the hearings in the 
finance committee where members of the chambers of commerce 
and different organizations representing business said they could 
manage more effectively without subsidies. We should, as a 
government, cut where Canadians are saying they will take cuts. 
That should be our strategy. I think of Mr. Lobb at the town hall 
who said: ``I appreciate the fact that where the government made 
cuts was more on the side of business and the economy and less on 
the side of the social budgetary agenda''. That made sense to him.
<P>
	I suggest that we continue with that strategy. We must remember 
that governments are here for Canadians. As a government we are 
opening the back rooms so that Canadians can participate in the 
budget debate, which is critically important to each and every one 
of us. We are taking a measured approach, with targets and 
commitments and we are meeting those commitments. We are 
creating stability in the marketplace, which is buying us credibility. 
We must focus on providing social support to Canadians across the 
country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, today 
the debate is on a motion intended to congratulate the government 
on a job well done in the area of government finances. Of course 
you will realize we do not share that view.
<P>
	I listened carefully to the hon. member for the Liberal Party who 
just spoke, and I will get back to what she said later on. In fact, 
towards the end of her speech, she said she was pleased because 
people had told her this government did not reduce its deficit by 
attacking the most vulnerable in our society but by cutting 
subsidies to business, and so forth.
<P>
	We will put that in perspective later on, and maybe she should 
provide some figures or information for the constituent who said 
that, because the exact opposite is true. The main sectors affected 
since this government came to power-and I will explain that later 
on-are transfers to the provinces and unemployment insurance. It 
is largely these two sectors, as well as some economic growth, that 
enabled the government to reduce its deficit.
<P>
	In the case of unemployment insurance, it is an artificial 
reduction. I will elaborate on all that, but I will also comment on 
the pre-budget consultation process as such. In fact, this is the 
second year we have had these consultations. I am not so sure the 
process has improved over time. Perhaps certain technical details 
such as organizing round table discussions instead of hearings, 
could be seen as an improvement. However, when we  consult 
people without providing a context, without parameters, as we did 
this year, there are certain consequences. The groups that appeared 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17691"> 17691 </A></B>
<P>
before us had to answer several questions formulated by the 
Minister of Finance, without exactly knowing where the debate 
was leading and without necessarily having access to updated 
information which we did not receive until after the consultations. I 
will talk about all that as well.
<P>
	I will discuss program review, which is an important element, 
and the fact that the Minister of Finance just announced there will 
be a phase II. I will also discuss what happened in the past few 
days, and I am referring to a proposal from the government of 
Quebec which was dismissed out of hand by the finance minister. 
When Quebec is willing to start a dialogue on a serious and 
constructive basis with genuine decentralization as the ultimate 
goal, it is rather surprising that the response to this initiative should 
be a quick and categoric no. So we are going to discuss that, plus 
corporate taxation and some of the measures that are in the works. 
So let us have a look at these items one by one.
<P>
	First, the pre-budget consultations. This was the second year. 
Last year, the Minister of Finance came to explain his position. He 
came with a whole launch kit, with his video cassettes and 
documents. He managed to make these consultations meaningful, 
up to a point. This year, the process was somewhat delayed, 
because obviously the Minister of Finance did not want to appear in 
person before the committee in the middle of the referendum 
campaign in October. The minister preferred to postpone his 
appearance and let the hearings proceed during the whole month of 
November, without appearing at the beginning of the hearings to 
tell people what he had in mind.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	Therefore, we found ourselves in a situation where, contrary to 
what was said-well, in some instances, witnesses made proposals 
that were constructive to a certain extent-many groups came 
solely to defend their own corporate interests, unfortunately. They 
said: ``Our sector is vital. What we do is important, so do not touch 
us, but do look at all the rest''. We cannot comment on the rest, 
because we have neither the knowledge nor the information to do 
so.
<P>
	On this point, I agreed with the witnesses. Very often they spoke 
of overlap and briefly explained the various types, especially in 
Quebec and western Canada. We heard very little talk of 
decentralization and overlap in Ontario.
<P>
	These people asked us about things and said they could not get 
hold of studies on the subject. It is unfortunate, because the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs says he did studies, but 
never made them public. It is as if management of public funds 
does not concern the public. It is as if documents should remain 
hidden somewhere and used only by cabinet. No, this is not the way 
things  should work. If we want to consult people seriously, we 
have to inform them. We have a long way to go on this.
<P>
	If we really want public consultation we will have to do it in 
some way other than having a committee make a show of touring 
the provinces telling people it is listening to them, when it is not 
necessarily.
<P>
	The interim report of the finance committee is not particularly 
good. It is, obviously, not the final report, but it is not up to the 
level of an end of session report or a high school paper. It is really 
too bad that, with all the expertise of the members and the 
personnel involved in the committee's work, the result is so 
ordinary. It is regrettable. Let us hope that the January report will 
contain more detail. This will not be easy, however, given the way 
the minister categorizes these consultations, providing no specific 
objective, no particular direction as to what he wants by way of 
information really, and so this is the way we end up.
<P>
	I am disappointed by and rather critical of this process, which, in 
my opinion, does not provide many positive benefits. I will now 
address this issue before moving on to unemployment and transfer 
payments.
<P>
	I would first like to talk about the program review. The Minister 
of Finance told us that the program review was about to enter Phase 
II. This means that every program involving government spending 
will be assessed as to effectiveness and need.
<P>
	One of the problems is that parliamentarians face elections every 
few years. Programs are put in place by different political parties 
and different governments and their goals set at a specific point in 
time. In the mid-1970s, for instance, the government decided to 
create a tax credit to stimulate research in a particular area. In 
1995, however, this has become less of a priority. Programs should 
be assessed more according to their initial goals and to whether 
they meet a current need. I imagine that a program review does in 
fact assess the need for a given program.
<P>
	Our current budget situation requires that we set priorities. This 
means keeping what we deem most important, and to do so, we 
need information. All this is done behind closed doors with just a 
few people. This is no way to achieve a consensus and convince 
people to make necessary but difficult efforts to improve public 
finances. Until we give a sense of equity to these measures and 
until people feel that everyone is doing his or her fair share, there 
will not be a consensus. When this information is not made public, 
people wonder what they are hiding and why. Do they want to keep 
some bad programs or to eliminate some good programs? Perhaps. 
To avoid this kind of embarrassment, the government has decided 
to do everything in secret.
<P>
	I would like to talk to the minister about the upcoming Phase II.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17692"> 17692 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	If he is serious about it, he will start by releasing what came out 
of phase I, and then proceed to phase II. That could make things 
interesting. I am convinced that there are people who would have 
interesting things to say on the subject. Their comments could form 
the basis for his next round of consultations. Instead of using these 
studies as a basis, he should release them and make them available 
to groups interested in participating in consultations. That will 
make for a real budget consultation process involving public 
participation.
<P>
	We do not hear enough from ordinary citizens. It is all well to 
hear from formal groups, but these already have a voice; they are in 
contact with the various department and opposition critics. Regular 
folks are the least represented in this debate. At hearings, they 
sometimes end up sitting at the same table as the chairman of the 
Chamber of Commerce, who has the staff to prepare briefs and 
what not for him. This forum then becomes intimidating for these 
people. It is not the kind of forum that attracts ordinary citizens, at 
least very few of them and not as many this year as last year.
<P>
	In time, only corporate interests will participate in this forum. I 
am not saying that they are all bad; there are a few that are great 
and quite legitimate in the bunch, but the problem is that we 
already hear from them. We already know their positions, and these 
contain very few surprises, because there are other means available 
to them to make themselves heard. So, this whole issue needs to be 
reviewed.
<P>
	Moving to deficit reduction. The Minister of Finance just 
announced his targets for the years to come and gave us an 
additional piece of information: this year's deficit will be $32.7 
billion. The deficit will be reduced next year, down to 3 per cent of 
the GDP, which means that it will be somewhere between 24 and 25 
billion dollars. The following year, it will be brought down to $17 
billion. No one can oppose deficit reduction, which is a laudable 
goal.
<P>
	However, we can be critical of two things regarding the means 
used to that end. The first one is the transfer payments. As we 
know, transfer payments to the provinces are part of federal 
government expenditures, since it collects revenues and then 
makes transfer payments to the provinces.
<P>
	This is the way it used to be done in certain areas such as 
post-secondary education, health, as well as the old Canada 
Assistance Plan, or CAP. Now, these transfer payment programs 
are grouped together under the Canada Social Transfer. The various 
transfer payments are combined into a single consolidated 
category, so that only one payment is made.
<P>
	In so doing, the minister pursues two objectives. The first one is 
to make things less transparent, so that he can say: ``We put all this 
together, but we reduced the  payment by a certain amount''. It then 
becomes difficult to accuse the minister of making direct cuts in 
the health, education or social assistance sector, since he is making 
a cut in the global payment made for all three areas. He says to the 
provinces: ``It is up to you to cut where you want. You have a 
choice between health, education and social assistance. I reduced 
the overall amount paid to you for these areas. You do what you can 
with what you have and you pay the political price attached to it''.
<P>
	We must remember that this means $2.5 billion in cuts for 
1996-97 and another $4.5 billion for 1997-98. That is a lot of 
money. My hon. colleague from the Liberal Party said earlier that 
cuts to social expenditures were not as steep as those made to 
business grants. That is just not true. Cuts to business grants made 
so far and over the next to years amount to about half, perhaps $1.5 
billion, when transfer payments primarily used to fund social 
services will be reduced by $7 billion.
<P>
	There is an order of magnitude there. Cuts to the Canadian social 
transfer alone will be four or five times larger. And that is not 
taking into account successive UI reforms, which, once again, are 
much deeper and wider in scope than cuts to business grants. So, let 
us not draw long bows here and let us be honest. The people should 
know that the cuts in question were made mainly to government 
social expenditures.
<P>
	We could argue to determine whether these cuts were necessary 
or not. The hon. member may think that they are appropriate. She 
may think what she wants; she is perfectly within her rights. But 
she cannot tell people that cuts were not made there. The figures 
and the facts speak for themselves. The hon. member should set the 
record straight with her constituents, who believed her when she 
said that only business grants would be affected.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	So, as far as the Canadian social transfer is concerned, Quebec 
alone will bear 26 per cent of the cuts, the first round of cuts. 
During the first year, there will be $2.5 billion in cuts, of which 
Quebec will bear 26 per cent. The following year, we are not quite 
sure yet how extensive cuts will be because the applicable criteria 
have not been set.
<P>
	According to a document issued by the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, the new Canadian social transfer will be 
distributed on a population basis, which means that Quebec would 
absorb 42 per cent, or $1.9 billion, of the $4.5 billion in transfer 
payments to be cut in the second year. That is a lot of money. 
Especially when you think that, if the current criteria were 
maintained, Quebec's share of the cuts would be $1.2 billion. That 
is already a substantial amount. But with the new criteria, Quebec 
will lose an extra $700 million.
<P>
	There have been discussions these past few days and an 
interesting proposal was put forward, but I will come  back to that 
later, if I have time. The minister will soon have to be more precise 
about where he stands on this issue. Our point is that, overall, if the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17693"> 17693 </A></B>
<P>
federal government reduces transfer payments to the provinces, it 
does not really spell deficit reduction for ordinary citizens, for the 
taxpayers, because the problem has only been shifted from Ottawa 
to the provinces.
<P>
	In turn, the provinces then have to make cuts and pay the 
political price for this. They are the ones left with the unpleasant 
task of explaining to their people what must be done to reduce the 
deficit. It is no easy task. Here they are washing their hands of it 
and saying that they are putting their fiscal house in order. Part of 
this is an illusion.
<P>
	The other part that is illusory is the UI account. In the last five 
years, the UI account has been funded by employees and 
employers, which means that UI premiums are paid by insured 
workers through payroll deductions and by their employers. The 
government does not make any contributions to the UI fund. It is 
funded solely by the employees and their employers.
<P>
	When this funding method was adopted in 1990-during the 
recession-, the UI account was running a deficit, which the 
government had to absorb. In the first three years, the fund ran a 
deficit, thus accumulating a three year debt. Since the 1994 UI 
reforms, however, the UI fund has run a surplus. This year, this 
surplus will reach some $5 billion.
<P>
	If we look at the five years since employee and employer 
premiums became the only source of funding, the UI fund will have 
accumulated a surplus of about $1.2 billion at the end of this year. 
The fund therefore did not run a deficit for those five years.
<P>
	Another $5 billion surplus is forecast for next year. The 
accumulated surplus will exceed $6 billion. The Minister of 
Finance has not said anything about raising benefits or reducing 
employee and employer premiums next year in order to stabilize, to 
contain a surplus that could reach $11 billion in three years in this 
account funded by employees and employers.
<P>
	The government uses this surplus to give the impression of 
reducing its deficit. Without unemployment insurance in this year's 
books, the deficit would be $37.7 billion.
<P>
	If the fund was balanced this year, for example, the deficit would 
be $37.7 billion. A different accounting method must be used, as 
well as a different account, so that we have a better balanced 
system and that the government does not use the UI account to 
create an indirect tax on employment.
<P>
	We do not agree-and I will end on that note because I am 
running out of time-with the fact that the government 
significantly reduced its deficit through transfer payments and 
changes to the UI account. It will have to truly tackle other issues. 
It will have to take a  hard look at the corporate tax system and 
conduct a real review of programs, so as to see which ones are no 
longer essential.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	The government will arrive at a more comprehensive, permanent 
and stable solution that way than by simply making minor changes 
to its accounting method, or by off-loading the whole problem onto 
the provinces and never tackling the real issue.
<P>
	This is why we will try, in our report, to reflect that spirit and 
ensure that the government will head in the right direction in terms 
of reducing its deficit.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in February, the Minister of Finance set the course of 
deficit reduction and economic growth. The budget focused on 
national priorities and set goals of fairness and credibility, goals we 
have met.
<P>
	In 1993-94 there was a 5.9 per cent ratio of deficit to GDP. This 
year it will be 4.2 per cent and we are almost certain to meet our 
target of 3 per cent deficit to GDP by the year 1996-97. This is good 
news for Canadians, as we are on course and have achieved our 
goals.
<P>
	This week the finance minister set a new two-year rolling target, 
the goal of a 2 per cent deficit to GDP ratio by the 1997-98 fiscal 
year. This means the deficit for that year will be approximately $17 
billion. The borrowing requirement will be at its lowest level since 
1969. This is credible reality of a finance minister of the 
government of today.
<P>
	There are those who say we should go further and faster with 
cuts like this slash and burn approach but I say the deficit and debt 
were not created overnight and we cannot change them overnight. 
We are on a steady course showing results. With an anticipated 
growth rate of no more than 2.5 per cent next year and with 
inflation and wages under control we must continue the path we are 
on to reduce the deficit while stimulating the job creation strategy 
equation.
<P>
	We have spent the past few months in committee listening to 
Canadians. They want us to be fair and show equity in all changes 
and cuts we make. We will earn our nation's affection and the 
respect of all Canadians if we as a government remain true to our 
own Liberal values. Those values of honesty, hard work, fairness, 
tolerance and compassion must prevail as we look at how to fight 
Canada's deficit and debt.
<P>
	Liberals are a political party of the middle road. We will avoid 
the slash and burn policies of the extreme right wing and balance 
with compassion those policies of the extreme left. Margaret 
Thatcher once observed that staying in the middle of the road is 
very dangerous, as one gets knocked down by the traffic on Both 
sides.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17694"> 17694 </A></B>
<P>
	The government is not afraid of being knocked down by either 
side. We will listen to Canadians; we have listened. We will 
uphold the value of a one level health care system, the values of 
tolerance and compassion, the values Canadians want and respect, 
the values of eliminating poverty among our children. Difficult 
choices were made last year. Unemployment is being reformed 
this year and our workforce is more competitive. We have had the 
co-operation of Canadians and I thank them for that.
<P>
	I share some concerns Canadians expressed to our committee. 
Many asked why we do not force the Bank of Canada to lower 
interest rates and manipulate the money supply. Past governments 
have tried it and it does not work. If we reduce this strangling 
deficit and the debt we will have a healthy financial picture and 
interest rates will fall on their own, mortgage rates will fall and the 
economy will expand.
<P>
	Economists tell us a 2 per cent reduction in interest rates over 
four years allows the economy to grow by approximately $13 
billion. Canadians have asked us why we do not set a longer 
strategy to look at the debt to GDP ratio. We know we must do this, 
since 20 years ago the total federal debt was 19 per cent of gross 
domestic product; 10 years ago it was 50 per cent. It was growing 
even in good times. Today is close to 75 per cent. We know this 
ratio must be reduced if we are to compete globally and to remain 
the best country in the world in which to live. We know our 
generation must set an attainable strategy for reduction of debt to 
GDP.
<P>
	Some recommendations by Canadians deal with the construction 
industry. It needs a boost. One idea is to renew the RAP, the 
residential assistance program we brought in last year. This helps 
low income earners to maintain adequate housing. It helps seniors 
on fixed income to stay in their home where they remain healthier 
and happier and it has helped the construction industry. Another 
suggestion was the use of the RRSP to extend to new construction 
by extended family members. As an example, a father could use his 
RRSP without penalty to construct the first new home for his son or 
daughter. Also, it has been suggested that if we remove the tax 
incentives that go along with demotion of buildings we would then 
indirectly encourage retrofitting and remodelling of older buildings 
and our heritage properties. This has two benefits. It restores and 
maintains heritage properties and in most cases it creates twice as 
many jobs. Renovating creates two jobs for every one of new 
construction. It does have the job creation factor.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	Each one of us elected to this hon. House knows how closely 
literacy is tied to the economy. Without strong literary skills we 
cannot read the work manuals or the directions on a piece of 
equipment, nor can we comprehend the orders of our bosses. Adult 
literacy is  closely linked to employment and income levels. Since 
literary requirements are forever on the increase it is important to 
promote reading.
<P>
	One way this budget can do this is by removing the GST on 
books and magazines. It may be necessary to work co-operatively 
provinces. However, I believe it can be done. The provinces would 
participate. The marginal lost revenue would be regenerated in 
more sales. There would be a greater stimulation to Canadian 
writers and composers. Above all, a society that reads more 
becomes more knowledgeable and more competitive in a global 
society.
<P>
	In last year's budget we taxed the chartered banks some $100 
million over two years. What we saw as a result was an increase in 
service charges passed on to the consumer. At the same time the 
banks enjoyed billion dollar profits. It is my recommendation that 
we take a new strategy. That strategy in simple terms would be for 
us, the federal government, to establish a community investment 
strategy and permit it to be funded by the banks in the 
communities. This forces the banks to do more for small business, 
more for community economic development, and it forces them to 
leave some of those profits in local communities.
<P>
	In addition, we have some responsibility to see that the banks 
lower those service charges. The charges have a negative impact on 
small business and a negative impact on the consumer. We are 
constantly told by economists we must adapt to an increasingly 
competitive world market.
<P>
	Global competition means something entirely different to 
workers in small rural communities than it does to the workers at 
large corporations like Ford. This is where the banks can assist in 
those small communities often adversely affected by those global 
market forces.
<P>
	I want to address labour sponsored venture capital funds. These 
are fairly new in the Canadian government's portfolio. They have 
been in existence less than five years and their mandate was to link 
investment opportunities to small and medium size businesses for 
the purposes of job creation. These are heavily tax subsidized 
dollars with about $2 billion in venture capital available in Canada 
today. Very little is earmarked for small companies requiring less 
than $250,000 in capital, and still a large portion is invested in 
secure treasury bills, not helping small business at all.
<P>
	The individual who invests in these funds get a 40 per cent tax 
credit in addition to the usual tax deduction if the fund is placed in 
an RRSP. The time has come to insist these funds be used in job 
creation or remove the tax credit incentive. This budget can clearly 
look closely at this area for new revenue.
<P>
	There is an opportunity since 1991 to carry forward any unused 
deduction in the RRSP, and StatsCanada shows that Canadians 
could pump up to $154 billion this  year-not likely to happen 
because Canadians do not save that much money. There is an 
opportunity in the 1997-98 fiscal period to look at setting a ceiling 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17695"> 17695 </A></B>
<P>
on RRSPs, somewhere around the $8,000 to $10,000 mark for 
individuals, and we can look at the opportunity in changing it from 
a deduction on the income tax page to a tax credit.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	By changing it to a tax credit, we would give a greater incentive 
for low income earners to invest in an RRSP because a tax credit 
would give them more dollars in their pockets rather than a 
deduction at that low level. We would seal it for high income 
earners so the advantage was more equal in the incentive process.
<P>
	There are many more things I could talk about in the budget 
process such as our training programs, our education facilities, 
needs such as the national highway strategy, and on and on.
<P>
	We have heard Canadians speak and they have told us clearly 
their needs and wants. With political stability in the country we can 
create a dynamic federalism wherein we have sustainable financial 
resources, sustainable economies and a sustainable environment. 
What more can we give our youth but a country in which they can 
live and fulfil their dreams?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canada has been declared the second wealthiest nation on earth and 
yet far too many of Canada's children live in poverty. There has 
been a steady and alarming increase in child poverty in Canada 
over the last decade and a half.
<P>
	According to the Canadian Institute of Child Health, the poverty 
rate for children rose 60 per cent between 1981 and 1991. The most 
recent Statistics Canada figure indicates that 1.447 million children 
in Canada under 18, some 21 per cent, now live in poor homes.
<P>
	The majority of low income children live in two parent families 
at 54 per cent, but a rising proportion live in one parent families. 
Almost two-thirds of single parent families headed by women live 
below the low income cutoff line. It is estimated that over half of 
native grow up in poverty.
<P>
	The effects of poverty on children are many. Poor children are 
more likely to get sick, suffer injuries and are twice as likely to die 
from injuries in comparison to better off children. Their academic 
performance suffers, as poor children demonstrate behavioural 
problems, reduced attention spans, poor attendance and low 
self-esteem. Weak academic performance is often simply due to 
hunger. Due to their parents' inability to afford the associated 
costs, poor children cannot participate in simple things like 
recreational and extra curricular activities that children in better off 
homes can take for granted.
<P>
	They miss out on the camaraderie in sharing healthy activities 
and the pleasure in self-discipline and attendant self-confidence 
which are so necessary to later life successes. Poor parents simply 
do not have the room in their household budgets to afford some of 
the extras that make such a difference in young lives. Their 
children are often left to their own devices in the home or on the 
street.
<P>
	Disadvantaged children grow up to be disadvantaged adults. It is 
impossible to measure the social costs in unfulfilled lives but it has 
been estimated that between 1990 and 2010, high school dropouts 
will cost Canada approximately $33 billion. This figure includes 
lost tax revenue, lost income, lost unemployment insurance 
contributions, increase UI benefits and increased social assistance 
benefits.
<P>
	Our social security is strongly linked to nationhood. It is through 
our values reflected in our social programs that Canadians from 
coast to coast often define themselves. Canada has always been a 
society committed to social equity. We have always tried to reduce 
the disparities between regions, between men and women, the 
young and old, and among the social classes.
<P>
	Poverty is growing. As poverty increases, so does economic 
insecurity. Economic insecurities threaten families and 
communities. When a society becomes polarized economically, 
great social costs must be paid. We pay for more crime prevention, 
attending to different acts of violence and loss in human capacity. 
All of this can lead to slower economic growth. Poverty is a real 
threat to Canada.
<P>
	I have an article written by Michael Valpy dated Thursday, 
November 2, 1995. In it he quotes Edward Newall, chief executive 
officer of Nova Corporation in an address to the Business Council 
on National Issues. In his speech, Mr. Newall refers to two issues 
that must be moved to the front burner, issues that will be positive 
if we succeed and hugely negative if we fail.
<P>
	One of the issues he addressed was poverty in Canada and our 
lack of a national game plan to cope with it:
<P>

<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	With great respect to the House, as members of Parliament we 
too will fail Canadians if we do not effectively act on this issue.
<P>
	On November 24, 1989 the House passed a unanimous motion to 
eliminate child poverty by the year 2000. However, between 1989 
and 1993, the number of children in low income houses grew by 
almost a half a million. Children are a gift to us for the future. All 
of us must take the responsibility to ensure that we live up to our 
declaration to eradicate child poverty.
<P>
	The problems of poverty are complex; the solutions are 
multi-faceted. My reason for speaking on this crucial issue in my 
prebudget speech is to ask the government, when preparing the 
1996 budget, to remember that the House has pledged to eradicate 
child poverty and that government spending priorities should be set 
to work toward this end.
<P>
	There are many powerful lobbies, interests and misconceptions 
that can work to thwart attempts to act on eradicating child poverty.
<P>
	We also hear from politicians on both sides of the House who say 
they must do as their voters wish. As members of Parliament they 
represent voters. We must always remember that even though 
children do not vote we represent them. As members of Parliament 
we must act in ways that honour and respect the needs of children.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, having 
spent my first two years in Parliament as part of the finance 
committee and the chief finance critic, I certainly appreciate the 
opportunity to speak today on the finance report. For me, and I am 
sure for many others, the state of the nation's finances is a matter of 
utmost importance and certainly the number one issue that must be 
dealt with.
<P>
	In the time I have today I will ask some simple questions: Where 
are we now and how did we get there? Who do we point at to 
answer those questions? Only after we have answered the where 
and the how can we tackle the most important question: What do 
we do next?
<P>
	Let us begin with where we are now. The government is still 
going into debt but not as fast as before. It still overspends but not 
quite as much. It still overtaxes but it is more clever in disguising 
that fact.
<P>
	In 1996-97 the government will spend $25 billion more than it 
has. In 1997-98 it will spend $17 billion more than it has. Sadly 
some people call this progress. I call it irresponsibility.
<P>
	The finance minister is lowering the deficit but not quickly 
enough. Yes, he is making cuts but in 1997, not today. Yes, he is 
making an effort to put our house in order, but it is a half hearted 
effort that could come undone with the blink of an eye.
<P>
	The government is playing a risky game with its go slow fiscal 
criteria and agenda. A recession, a secession crisis that could 
happen or rising interest rates, any one of those events could 
unwind three years of progress in a matter of days, sending us right 
back to where the government started at the beginning of the 35th 
session of Parliament, with a $40 billion to $44 billion deficit.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	The government is deeply in debt, uncertain of its course, 
lacking in conviction and drifting at sea. How do we explain it? 
What accounts for this uncertainty, this sense of drifting and this 
ocean of debt that is drowning the federal government?
<P>
	I have observed the following. The Liberals who came to office 
in 1993 were believers. They believed in the ideology, the 
philosophy and the cause of Liberalism. I must say when I compare 
the environment of the House of Commons with the environment 
of the Alberta legislature, in which I spent 28 and a half years, 
Liberalism was not alive in the Alberta legislature. However 
Liberalism is alive in the House of Commons. I cannot believe that 
Liberalism exists in the country in the way it does.
<P>
	The Liberals who are leading the country believe in the same 
cause as their predecessors. The Trudeaus, the Martins and the 
Pearsons constructed a massive social welfare state, attempting to 
coddle all their citizens from cradle to grave.
<P>
	What did these welfare Liberals really believe? They believed in 
governing from the top down instead of the bottom up. We are 
suffering from that. They believed in centralizing control instead of 
keeping it close to the people. They believed in governments 
running people instead of people running governments. The results 
of this approach were very predictable.
<P>
	First, social programs fostered dependency rather than 
self-reliance. Business subsidies tilted the playing field instead of 
fostering competition. Paternalistic policies stifled initiative 
instead of creating opportunity. Because they believed that 
government could do a better job of managing people's lives than 
the people could, the welfare Liberals never hesitated to fund social 
engineering through higher and higher tax rates.
<P>
	That is the legacy the Liberals inherited upon their election and 
are continuing to build on: an outdated,  discredited welfare state 
that could no longer afford the vision of its creator. Yet the Liberals 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17697"> 17697 </A></B>
<P>
who campaigned on the red book in 1993 were the children of that 
legacy. They believed in this vision. They came to the House 
believing that it worked. They believed it wholeheartedly, even 
after it was proved to be wrong.
<P>
	In reality it cannot be avoided forever, even in Ottawa. When the 
truth of my last statement finally sank in, when the truth of chronic 
unemployment, economic dependency and runaway debt became 
too indisputable to deny, they discovered they had lost their 
bearings.
<P>
	These fervent believers who sailed into office on the HMS red 
book discovered that the Liberal philosophy which had anchored 
their beliefs was gone, discredited and sunk. They awoke to find 
themselves drifting, lost at sea and drowning in an ocean of debt. 
That is why the government spent its first two years in office doing 
nothing. Discovering that the welfare state had crumbled under its 
own weight, they found they had no other vision to take its place, 
nothing at all, no replacement.
<P>
	Now they have become half hearted warriors, deficit fighters, by 
default. They reduce the deficit without conviction or 
understanding. They do it without a vision or a goal. They do it not 
because it is the right thing to do, but because they do not know 
what else to do.
<P>
	The finance minister spent two long years on the road to 
Damascus before he had his own fiscal conversion, two years of 
continuous warnings from the Reform Party, international 
investors, academics, the IMF, the auditor general and the Bank of 
Canada, just to bring him to grips with fiscal reality. He believed 
that those bodies were not authorities that knew what they were 
doing. They did. While he has now experienced a half hearted 
conversion to the benefits of deficit reduction, he is rowing against 
the tide in his own Liberal caucus. That is most unfortunate.
<P>
	Tax and spend dinosaurs like the Deputy Prime Minister, the 
Minister of Human Resources Development, the Minister of Public 
Works and Government Services, and the Prime Minister are still 
clinging to the wreckage of their ideology like a drowning man 
clings to driftwood.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	The finance minister is desperate to keep his government's head 
above water, yet these 1960s Liberals are hung around his neck like 
an albatross, dragging him down. They will certainly drag the 
country down fiscally as well.
<P>
	There is a bitter irony here. These children of the welfare state 
are drowning in an ocean of debt that they themselves have created.
<P>
	Let us look at the alternative, and there certainly are some 
alternatives. It is the Reform Party. What do we present to 
Canadians? Reform knows what to do and we  know why it must be 
done. Reform has an end vision. We know why deficit reduction is 
important and where it will lead. It will lead to jobs and business 
opportunities in Canada.
<P>
	Reform's vision includes the elimination of deficits and a 
reduction in debt. It is unbelievable that our debt grows at $1,000 
per second. Can anyone imagine putting $1,000 on the table every 
second of the day and night? It is beyond belief that happens but 
that is the kind of debt we have. It expands at the rate of $1,000 per 
second.
<P>
	We believe in lowering borrowing costs both for the government 
and the people and in lowering tax levels, leaving more money in 
the pockets of Canadians. We believe in social programs that offer 
a hand up, not a handout. We believe in a society where everyone 
believes they have an opportunity to grow, prosper and learn in a 
safe and secure environment.
<P>
	That is the vision Canadians so desperately need. That is the 
vision of the Reform Party and that is the vision the Liberal 
government does not have.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am also 
pleased to rise to debate the economic and fiscal update tabled by 
the Minister of Finance for us to take a look at as we begin our 
prebudget consultations.
<P>
	The unfortunate part of the document, if I can recall back to last 
year, is that the Minister of Finance has laid it before us and said: 
``Here is the problem. Here are the facts. This is where we are''. 
However he did not give us any idea what he has on his mind about 
where we are going. He did not lay out any options. He did not give 
any indication of his preference. He did not say we should explore 
this avenue or ask what we think of a particular suggestion.
<P>
	As a result, when I attended the finance committee hearings on 
occasion as an associate member, I heard continuous rounds of 
presentations that indicated: ``We have a problem in this country. 
We concur with the Minister of Finance. Therefore we should raise 
taxes, but don't raise mine''. We also heard: ``We agree with the 
Minister of Finance that we have to cut spending, but don't cut 
me''. That was the general theme throughout the presentations.
<P>
	Because the Minister of Finance did not use the power of his 
office to give any general direction on the kind of thinking he had 
in mind, much of that unfortunately did not actually produce a 
great deal of substance.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance could have given us some idea about 
what he has in mind, the general direction in which he would like to 
go. The country would soon focus and either give him thumbs up or 
thumbs down. Then he would be able to plan his budget in 
accordance with the wishes of the people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17698"> 17698 </A></B>
<P>
	I am fairly convinced we will find in this round of prebudget 
consultations a repeat of last year: ``Yes, we have a problem; raise 
taxes but not mine or cut spending but don't cut me''. If that is 
applied across the board the status quo would remain, which is 
not what the minister had in mind.
<P>
	Looking at the document, we see it is a fairly detailed and 
substantial document not only in its content but also in its 
omissions. I looked at annex No. 1 which states where the 
government spends its money. It goes through department by 
department: human resources development, citizenship, health and 
so on.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	I was looking for finance. There is no annex on finance because 
it is going to spend $50 billion on interest on the debt. But we really 
do not want to highlight that. I am not sure if it was an omission by 
oversight or by design, but all of a sudden I find that this country's 
major expenditure, which is interest on our debt, is absent. While it 
is a good document for what it says, it is a good document for what 
it does not say as well.
<P>
	On page 91 the document mentions budgetary revenues. We all 
know how strong the Minister of Finance is about wrestling this 
deficit down. He said: ``I am going to bring it down to 3 per cent of 
GDP and now it is 2 per cent of GDP and no doubt it will be the 
magic number of 1 per cent of GDP''. He never really tells us how, 
just that he is going to do it.
<P>
	When we look at budgetary revenues on page 91 of the 
document, we find revenues from 1994 at $123.3 billion rising over 
two years to $136 billion. If my math is correct that is an increase 
in revenues of $12.7 billion.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has never wasted an opportunity to tell 
us that during that period he is going to reduce the deficit down to 
$24 billion or 3 per cent of GDP. The public accounts were tabled a 
few weeks ago and the deficit for 1994-95 was $37.5 billion. In the 
next two years the finance minister is going to wrestle it down to 
$24 billion, a decrease of $13.5 billion. We say: ``Right on''.
<P>
	But then, he has squeezed another $12.7 billion out of taxpayers 
along the way, so his net saving is $800 million, $.8 billion. That is 
the total savings by the government which tells us at every 
opportunity that program spending is coming down and that all 
kinds of opportunities are being used to cut the deficit. He is not 
cutting the deficit; he is taxing Canadians. That is what the finance 
minister is doing. He is taxing Canadians more because every 
dollar by which he wants to reduce the deficit is a dollar out of the 
pockets of Canadians, not a dollar out of the government's pockets.
<P>
	That is the clear point we want to make. Unfortunately, it 
requires doing a little bit of math because it just does not stand out 
in the presentation of the documents. Again, let me compliment the  
government on what it has produced, but let us not ignore what is 
not here either.
<P>
	On page 91 there is tax on personal income, which is about the 
closest the government gets to recognizing what it is doing. It says: 
``In 1993 tax on personal income in Canada stood at 15.4 per cent 
of GDP on a national accounts basis and was higher than in all 
other G7 countries except Germany''. At first glance we think we 
are bad, but we are not the worst. However, if we read on: 
``Relative to other G7 countries, Canada relies to a much greater 
extent on personal income taxes which were 13.5 per cent of GDP 
and social security taxes represented 1.9 per cent of GDP, the 
lowest share among G7 countries''.
<P>
	Let us take the two points together. Apart from Germany, we 
have the highest personal income tax as a percentage of GDP of any 
country and we have the lowest amount of social security taxes, 
those being Canada pension plan, UI, the things we return back to 
the constituents. We are the lowest on that, yet we are the highest 
on taxation which means that the money is being drained out of the 
pockets of Canadians and is being passed over on other issues.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	Let us look at page 82 of the document. The only increase is 
transfers to individuals, which I can talk about later. Here we have 
on annex table 30, distribution of net federal elderly benefits by 
household income 1995.
<P>
	Remember, as taxation goes up new families are being created 
and they are trying to buy a house. The spouse has to go to work. 
The Minister of Human Resources Development just announced 
$700 million for day care to help them over the hump because their 
finances are in difficulty. Canadian families are in trouble because 
of high taxation. We need to try to improve the prosperity.
<P>
	Here we have on page 82 that we are giving $630 million to 
households that have incomes over $75,000, and we are spending 
another $500 million on households whose incomes are between 
$60,000 and $75,000.
<P>
	I could go out on to Wellington Street in Ottawa, Jasper Avenue 
in Edmonton or any other main street to stop a young couple who is 
trying to find some money to buy Christmas presents and ask: ``Do 
you realize that a lot of your tax money is going to pay $1.1 billion 
to families whose incomes are over $50,000?'' Should the Minister 
of Finance not be taking a look at that? If he did he would find that 
there is room to cut spending. That is the Reform Party's platform: 
to cut spending rather than tax Canadians more. That is a big 
difference.
<P>
	We can go through the document and find all kinds of references. 
Unfortunately the bad news has to be dragged out but the good 
news of course just hits us right in the face. It is a good document 
but the presentation on the bad news could be improved in another 
year. We do talk about the debt and deficit.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17699"> 17699 </A></B>
<P>
	The other day the governor of the Bank of Canada appeared 
before the public accounts committee. I would like to bring to 
members' attention some of the things he said in his opening 
statement. He said: ``At a minimum, this calls for action to stop 
the ratio of public debt to gross domestic product from rising. It 
is time we got the debt under control''. He said further: ``Just 
stabilizing the debt to GDP ratio may not be sufficient. Lower 
ratios may be needed''. He concluded his remarks by saying: ``We 
need a debt to GDP ratio for Canadian governments in total that 
is lower than it is now''.
<P>
	I am not saying that the Minister of Finance has an easy job. We 
all know how difficult it is. But let the Minister of Finance stand up 
and tell Canadians that it is the Liberal Party's policy to tax 
Canadians more, not to cut spending. Let us recognize that and let 
us get that point out.
<P>
	The finance minister still has a long, long way to go before he 
balances his budget. If it is the intention of this Liberal government 
to do it totally and absolutely on the backs of taxpayers without 
cutting one nickel of government spending, Canadians will have 
something to say at the next election.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin-Norfolk, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
my pleasure to join the take note budget debate and offer my views 
to the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	When talking about the budget the first issue we have to deal 
with is the debt and the deficit. We have to come to some sort of 
understanding on how big a problem it is. Once we come to grips 
with how big a problem it is, then we can say how much cost we are 
willing to bear to get it under control.
<P>
	My own view is to move aggressively as reasonably possible to a 
budget surplus. I use the word surplus as opposed to a balanced 
budget. A balanced budget does not solve the problem of too much 
debt. A surplus would allow for the lowering of that debt. In the 
lowering of that debt there would be a number of factors that would 
compound positively for the Canadian economy.
<P>
	There would be a lessening of interest rates as money lenders 
would see less of a risk in lending money to Canadians. They 
would lower the cost of the money that they lend. There would be 
less of a currency risk which would again compound to lower 
interest rates. Consumer confidence would go up; investor 
confidence would go up.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	All of those factors would provide some possibility of tax relief 
which again would be good news for the economy. All of those 
factors combined would increase economic growth, increase jobs, 
increase opportunity and would be good for the Canadian economy 
overall.
<P>
	However, the goal to eliminate the deficit must not be our sole 
purpose. We must acknowledge the linkages  within the economy. 
To simply slash government spending would from a 
macroeconomic point of view lessen aggregate demand and risk 
putting the economy into recession.
<P>
	Furthermore, we need to acknowledge there are pressing needs 
within Canadian society. The issue then becomes: Can the 
government maintain or even improve social spending or social 
programs while reducing overall spending? The answer is yes it can 
by making adjustments or deeper cuts in other areas. By 
establishing priorities we can consider new initiatives to meet 
urgent needs.
<P>
	Let me bring the attention of the House to what I believe should 
be this country's number one social priority for the upcoming 
budget, the issue of child poverty. There has been a steady and 
alarming increase in child poverty in Canada over the last decade 
and a half. According to the Canadian Institute of Child Health the 
poverty rate for children rose 60 per cent between 1981 and 1991. 
The most recent Statistics Canada figures indicate that 1.4 million 
children in Canada under the age of 18 now live in poor homes. 
Poverty among single mothers remains stable and tragically high at 
56 per cent.
<P>
	According to the United Nations Children's Fund, among the 
OECD nations Canada has one of the worst records on child 
poverty, second only to the United States. Given the UN has also 
rated Canada as the top country in the world in overall quality of 
life, our failure to deal with child poverty is all the more glaring. To 
those who might insist we cannot afford it at this time, we have to 
ask why our OECD partners faced with similar fiscal challenges 
have been able to do a better job for their nation's children. I 
believe it is a matter of setting priorities.
<P>
	I would also like to point out that in solving the child poverty 
problem we also address a number of other problems. We would 
improve the country's productivity. We would spend less money 
related to crime and crime prevention. We would lower our health 
care costs. All of these factors combine to make a better country.
<P>
	The solution in part can be found through an income supplement 
program. I am recommending to the Minister of Finance that he put 
in his budget a $500 million program called the working income 
supplement. I will not bore this House with the details of the 
proposal but would point out that it was described most adequately 
in a supplement to the green paper in a paper called ``Income 
Security for Children''.
<P>
	One might ask: ``If this fellow believes in cutting the debt and 
cutting the deficit but he wants to invoke a new social program, 
where does he think we are going to get the money from?'' I would 
like to talk for a moment about the defence budget because I think 
the defence budget needs to be cut, it needs to be cut not only to 
free up money for debt and deficit reduction but also for social 
programs such as child poverty.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="17700"> 17700 </A></B>
<P>
	Canada's current military budget is approximately $11.4 billion. 
Peacekeeping accounts for only 5.5 per cent of this budget. Canada 
currently has the 12th largest military spending in the world. We 
are the sixth largest spender among NATO's 16 members. Military 
spending has been declining significantly around the world for 
several years. However, Canadian military spending has been an 
exception to this pattern.
<P>
	By 1994 world military spending was 29.6 per cent lower in real 
dollars than it was in 1985. Military spending by countries that are 
not members of NATO was a whole 42.5 per cent lower. However, 
Canadian military spending remained 3 per cent higher in real 
dollar terms than it was in 1985. As a result Canadian military 
spending rose by 46.2 per cent relative to world military spending. 
I ask my colleagues to check the facts which I believe they will find 
accurate.
<P>
	The pattern is even more striking if we look back to 1980. 
Although it grew substantially during the early part of the 1980s, 
by 1994 world military spending was 16.5 per cent lower in real 
dollars than it was in 1980. However, Canadian military spending 
was 36.2 per cent higher. As a result Canadian military spending 
rose by 63 per cent relative to world military spending.
<P>
<B>(1400)</B>
<P>
	The Canadian government has begun to make real cuts in 
military spending since 1994. I acknowledge those cuts and I 
applaud them. The reductions, begun in 1994, are expected to total 
about 19 per cent-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleague, you still have five minutes in your 
speech. The Chair will recognize you when we return to debate. 
Right now we will go to Statements by Members.

	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the use of 
drugs is one of the most corrupting influences in our inner cities, 
producing poverty and crime.
<P>
	In Rosedale riding the Regent Park community centre has set up 
the Regent Park community coalition against substance abuse to 
fight this menace. Its program involves youth making videos on 
such issues as drug and alcohol abuse and how to resist peer 
pressure encouraging smoking, drugs and alcohol.
<P>
	They promote a healthier community by promoting a healthy 
lifestyle and set an example for their peers. At the centre young 
people are given an opportunity to explore these issues and reflect 
their thoughts in video form. In making these videos they also learn 
skills that  will prepare them for future employment and access to 
the work world.
<P>
	I would like to pay special tribute to the Regent Park focus

This is just the most recent in a series of blunders on the minister's

somatrophin, AIDS, breast cancer or other issues, the minister

	<B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Clark's Crossing, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the child care initiative announced yesterday by the 
Minister of Human Resources Development is a small step in the 
right direction, but only 12 per cent of Canadian children who need 
licensed child care have access to it, compared with 80 per cent in 
many European countries. The 362,000 regulated child care spaces 
in Canada barely scratch the surface, as there are 3.1 million 
children in need.
<P>
	The Liberal government is using budgetary restraint as an excuse 
for not developing a real national child care program and it has 
already slashed $7 billion in social programs, thus compounding 
the problems the less well off children in Canada face.
<P>
	The government has also chosen to download its responsibilities 
on to the provinces, which are already strapped for cash. Plainly 
some provinces will not be interested in participating in this offer 
of child care partnership, and then what will become of the children 
in those provinces?
<P>
	Unfortunately the government does not understand our children 
are our future and that now is the time for real and full commitment 
to Canada's greatest resource in the form of universal, accessible 
and non-profit child care.

Montreal yet which opposes gun control; a party that claims to

Montreal rally and stands unanimously with the Bloc on every 
issue of Canadian unity.

<P>
	Of course, the federal government has skewed the facts by

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the 
same time that the Minister of Finance was vainly trying to reach 
agreement with the provinces on distribution of the drastic cuts in 
social programs announced by Ottawa early this year, the Minister 
of Human Resources Development was freeing up $720 million for 
a new national child care strategy. Surprisingly, the Minister of 
Finance was totally in the dark about the announcement.
<P>
	What explanation can there be for the Minister of Finance 
knowing nothing, at the very moment when he was discussing 
significant cuts in social programs with the provinces, about his 
Human Resources Development colleague's initiative, his decision 
to inject $720 million into a new daycare package?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday and the day 
before that, at the meeting of ministers of finance, there were most 
definitely discussions on putting public finances on a more sound 
footing, as well as of the necessity for both levels of government to 
set priorities.
<P>
	Several provincial representatives therefore spoke to the 
Minister of Human Resources Development concerning daycare. 
The British Columbia Minister of Social Affairs also made a 
statement on her wish for such a program.
<P>
	The federal government therefore needs to respond to the wishes 
expressed by the provinces. What we established yesterday with 
the ministers of finance was that the absolute necessity of setting 
priorities.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, will the 
Minister of Finance admit that by cutting back the general transfers 
to the provinces for social programs, and ploughing part of the cuts 
back into child care, the federal government is imposing its choices 
on the provinces, which is diametrically opposite to the Prime 
Minister's promises of decentralization?
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the Minister of Finance has 
already explained, one of the great advantages of the new transfer 
program is that it allows provincial governments the flexibility to 
set priorities to determine what is the most important investment to 
make in this area of programming.
<P>
	We are suggesting and promoting the notion that if we want to 
get people back to work that we have to be able to provide for the 
proper care of children along the way, a point of view shared by 
many provincial governments.
<P>
	All we are trying to do in this case is to ensure that there is 
support in those areas, so that they can exercise the new flexibility 
and the priorities that they have under the new social transfer.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
understand the minister's response perfectly but it does nothing to 
change the fact that on the one hand the federal government is 
cutting general transfer payments to the provinces, which they are 
given to organize their own social services, and is then reinvesting 
that money into a child care package. That is called ramming your 
choices down the other's throat. If the federal government does not 
want to impose its choices on the provinces, all it needs do is stop 
making cuts in general transfer payments to the provinces. That 
would be a good way to give the provinces some help.
<P>
	How can the provinces count on federal funding, when they can 
only be sure of it for three to five years? The need will still be there 
after that but the federal government can pull out unilaterally, again 
leaving the provinces to foot the bill, as it has with the transfer 
payments?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate the hon. 
member gets his facts from the pages of a newspaper and does not 
try to seek out the real information.
<P>
	The real information is that when writing to the provincial 
ministers, after extensive discussion with ministers and their 
officials over the past several months, we indicated the initial 
investment to help augment the supply of quality child care. Once 
that initial addition for augmentation takes place, we are 
committed to the ongoing support and maintenance of those 
facilities.
<P>
	It would seem that the hon. member for Roberval might want to 
talk to his colleague, the hon. member from the constituency of 
Quebec, who on February 9  said: ``Does the government intend to 
make available to the provinces the financial resources to go ahead 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17705"> 17705 </A></B>
<P>
with developing child care?'' Again on February 24, she said: ``Is 
the government prepared to act on its commitment respecting 
quality child care?''
<P>
	It seems that on the one hand, the Bloc Quebecois is asking for a 
commitment and, on the other hand, the member for Roberval does 
not want us to hold to that commitment. Which voice of the Bloc 
Quebecois should we listen to?

Resources Development announced yesterday a national daycare 
strategy costing $720 million over five years, on the condition that 
the provinces match the amount and meet national standards that 
Ottawa may set.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister realize that, by making the federal 
contributions contingent on a matching investment by the 
provinces, it is favouring the wealthier provinces, which have 
greater financial capabilities, over the poorer provinces such as 
Quebec?

<P>
	It is really surprising that the hon. member for Quebec who last 
February was on her feet in the House demanding in no uncertain 
terms that the government live up to its commitment, has now 
fundamentally changed her mind, reversed her position, and no 
longer is committed to the government helping children and their 
families get proper care.
<P>
	It really is a very sad day when the hon. member who has had 
such a good reputation in the House for supporting the cause of 
children has now bought into some kind of partisan attack against a 
program that is designed primarily to make sure that children get 
good quality care.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister is intervening after cutting aid to the provinces. That is not 
what I meant in my letter.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Human Resources Development 
acknowledge that he is preparing once again to use his spending 
power to meddle hamfistedly in the daycare sector, which is under 
Quebec's jurisdiction exclusively, while imposing national 
standards; and that, if he really wanted to react or to effectively 
resolve the daycare problem, he would do well to transfer federal 
funds to Quebec so they could be managed according to our 
interests? That was the gist of my letter.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is really a great regret that 
the hon. member has made such a major reversal in position in so 
short a time.
<P>
	In the letter sent to provincial ministers we made it very clear 
that the provincial governments should respond to us. We said: ``It 
is within your jurisdiction. You propose what kind of program you 
would like to see happen''. It is entirely within their discretion, 
entirely within their authority to decide how they respond to this. 
No one is interfering. No one is providing direction in terms of 
specific programs. That is entirely and thoroughly within the orbit 
of the provinces to manage.
<P>
	We are going to ensure that in the very crucial question of 
ensuring proper care for children and the equally important 
providing of support for the employment of their parents so that 
they can go back to work, that we are prepared to help share the 
burden with the provinces and hopefully they will respond in a like 
kind.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr.

no rational answer.
<P>
	Any government that can talk itself into believing that a 
separatist veto over the Constitution of Canada helps national unity 
can talk itself into any other kind of concession. It is the Neville 
Chamberlain approach to constitutional negotiation: unity in our 
time through irrational concessions. When Winston Churchill was 
asked how to deal with a Prime Minister taking that approach, he 
replied: ``If the Prime Minister trips, he must be sustained; if he 
makes mistakes, they must be covered; if he sleeps, he must not be

in the justice system there is a provision whereby a judge can order 
somebody to be sent for a mental examination for a period of 30 
days. Mr. Speaker, I was thinking that we might give you that

general must have had some substance to it.
<P>
	My final question today is what lawyers call a notwithstanding 
question. Notwithstanding the desire of Reformers to see the entire 
government replaced, notwithstanding our desire to see the cabinet 
shuffled and the Prime Minister impeached, notwithstanding our 
desire to see the Deputy Prime Minister go on an extended tour of 
Antarctica, will the government House leader please convey to the 
Prime Minister, Madam Chrétien and the Prime Minister's 
colleagues the best wishes of Reformers and our constituents for 
the season and for the New Year.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I will say nothing to impeach the good wishes that were expressed 
by the Reform Party. We accept them in a very positive, 
forthcoming and gracious spirit. I hope that in the future members 
of the Reform Party will join with us in our commitment to national 
unity and abandon what seems to have been their previous 
obsession with separatism.

	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, two 
years of effort have resulted in failure as the Minister of Human 
Resources Development does not have one single province signed 
on to his day care package. Yesterday despite this failure he 
announced his day care package. The provinces cannot afford this 
program and the minister knows it.
<P>

provinces when his day care package goes up in flames?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, why am I not surprised that 
the hon. member for Calgary Southeast is opposed to a major 
program to help children across Canada? It comes as part of the 
general philosophy where her party simply has no interest.
<P>
	I would like to provide for contrast what the minister for 
women's equality for the Government of British Columbia said 
yesterday in her press conference. She said that she is glad the 
federal government is going to share and is prepared to commit 
funds to help with children's care. She will be contacting her 
provincial colleagues to encourage them to support the offer and to 
work with the federal government.
<P>
	It shows that the British Columbia minister understands far 
better than the member for Calgary Southeast the important 
investment that can be made in child care in helping parents go 
back to work and in helping to make sure children are well looked 
after.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member did not huff and puff like Santa Claus going down the 
chimney but he just about did.
<P>
	The government is offering over 720 million taxpayer dollars for 
its ill thought out day care package. The Reform Party believes the 
Liberal package discriminates against stay at home parents. It 
provides funds for those who choose to leave child care to others.
<P>
	Will the minister commit to providing tax relief for stay at home 
parents?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, with questions like that, the 
hon. member for Calgary Southeast is going to give the Grinch a 
bad name.
<P>
	I would like to point out to the hon. member that in developing 
our child care proposal, the first thing we have done is to sign an 
agreement with the aboriginal  people to provide 6,000 additional 
spaces for the group in the country who probably needs them most. 
That is not a failure but a major investment. Also, because we want 
to recommend, recognize and respect provincial jurisdiction, we 
have made a similar offer to the provinces to which we hope to 
have a positive response.
<P>
	To answer the question specifically, I would like to quote from a 
sometime distinguished member of the House who represents the 
constituency of Calgary Southeast. On October 16 she said: ``We 
can do more as federal legislators to foster hiring and employment 
such as supporting new day care facilities''. From time to time we 
are prepared to listen to the advice of the hon. member for Calgary

<P>
	In a letter sent to an RCI employee in January 1991, the Prime 
Minister, who was Leader of the Opposition at the time, pointed out 
that Liberal members had moved an amendment in the debate on 
Bill C-40 to have Radio Canada International designated a 
permanent service in order to ensure its survival. During the same 
period, the current secretary of state for the status of women went 
so far as to ask, on behalf of the Liberal Party of Canada, that full 
funding be restored for Radio Canada International.

unconditional support to RCI, his government suddenly decided to

provincial finance ministers to set the new terms for the Canada 
health and social transfer. They came together this week and could 
only agree on a dinner menu and that was about it.
<P>
	Why in the world did the minister wait until three months before 
the decision was to be made to bring the ministers together? What 
is his game plan now if the provinces cannot agree? It certainly 
looks like that is the case.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, officials from the 
provincial and federal finance departments have been meeting 
regularly for quite some time.
<P>
	The meeting that was held had been scheduled and follows the 
normal schedule of such meetings. I made it very clear that we did 
not expect to come out of that meeting with a final decision but that 
at the ministerial level we would engage in a discussion by the 
officials that would continue for quite some time.
<P>
	In fact, the meeting ended up roughly where one would have 
expected. That is, those provinces which are contributing were 
seeking one formula and those provinces again by another formula 
were seeking to protect that position.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
have equalization payments that serve to equalize the services that 
are provided across the country.
<P>
	The initial distribution of the Canada health and social transfer 
discriminates against Alberta, B.C. and Ontario. Furthermore, 
Quebec gets more than Newfoundland on a per capita basis.
<P>
	Is it the minister's intention to continue his discrimination 
against some provinces? Will he favour a distribution of the CHST 
that results in per capita transfers to all the provinces and all 
Canadians on an equal basis?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

Speaker, yesterday, when questioned about the federal 
government's refusal to withdraw from health, welfare and 
education as requested by Quebec, the Prime Minister said that he 
found Quebec's tax point transfer proposal unacceptable because 
this formula would not give the federal government enough credit 
with Canadians.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Does the Minister of 
Finance agree with his Prime Minister and is he also more 
interested in ensuring the federal government's visibility than in 
reducing overlap and improving services to the public?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the Quebec 
government's proposal will not eliminate overlap and duplication. 
Mrs. Marois was proposing a tax point transfer that, given 
Quebec's expenditures, would be exorbitant.
<P>
	At the same time, if we look at the possibility of transferring tax 
points to all the provinces, it must be said that Quebec would lose 
out. This formula would benefit wealthier provinces such as 
Alberta and Ontario, but not Quebec. I should add that Mrs. Marois 
did not talk about equalization, which is a very important element 
of federal transfers to Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Quebec finance minister's proposal has but one 
objective: to stop his government's drastic cuts on the backs of the 
most disadvantaged in our society. That is all.
<P>
	If it is not to ensure visibility at the expense of services to the 
public, how does the minister explain that, in the area of job

announced the government's plan to deal with the defaulted 
sponsorship obligations, he said that he did not support the use of 
bonds as it was unfair to require the money in advance, up front.
<P>
	However, the minister did not address the use of non-cash surety 
bonds. Considering the great expense for the taxpayer in pursuing 
defaulted sponsorship through the courts, would the minister not 
agree that the use of these bonds would be a more cost effective 
way of ensuring compliance with the terms of sponsorship?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member started her press 
conference by suggesting that the government's package and the 
government's actions were very much on the right course. After 
some reflection and after some hint, she comes to the House of 
Commons and suggests that perhaps a bond is the way to go.
<P>
<B>(1450 )</B>
<P>
	We have the right package, the right mix. We reflected on the 
bond and believe it is far preferable to proceed  with this package, 
keeping in mind that some 85 per cent to 90 per cent of sponsors 
who undertake a sponsorship agreement live up to their end of the 
bargain. The question became: How do we address the remaining 
10 per cent, the few who abuse, and try to make the few fewer?
<P>
	That is why we are tightening eligibility. That is why we are 
tightening abuse to social programs. That is why we are enforcing 
the enforcement side of the procedures. We also said that should 
these procedures not work, and we believe they will, at that time we 
can contemplate additional action.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, while the minister states his government's 
intentions to deal with defaulted obligations, he still faces a very 
major hurdle with the IRB, the Immigration and Refugee Board. I 
remind the minister of a decision it made with Mohammed Assaf, 
who was permitted to sponsor his second wife despite being 
$32,000 in arrears.
<P>
	What is the value of the initiative that he announced earlier today 
when the IRB is deliberately undermining his department's 
objectives?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one case does not make a good 
law.
<P>
	The member agreed with the direction of the government's 
package today. We consulted all the provinces. We always hear 
from that side of the House, the apologists usually for the 
provinces. In this case each province suggested that the federal 
government not introduce a bond at this time.
<P>
	Therefore, in the best interest of co-operative federalism, this 
package was developed in concert with the provinces, which the 
hon. member always suggests we do. I wish her and her colleagues 
a merry Christmas.

Act would remain intact. In fact this government intended to go to 
the wall to protect those. At the same time we established the 
principle that one could not impose a residency requirement in 
terms of welfare. The wisdom of that has already been 
demonstrated by the Minister of Human Resources Development in 
events of which the member has full knowledge.
<P>
	It is very important to note that the Prime Minister, the Minister 
of Health and I have stated unequivocally, and I repeated this 
yesterday in a meeting with the finance ministers, our intention to 
not allow that the cash would eventually run out to nothing as is 
currently the case. Our intention to stabilize the cash component of 
the CHST is a very important component.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, in just a few minutes I am going 
to hear a point of privilege but there are three housekeeping 
statements I would like to make.
<P>
	The first has to do with one in our midst, as he has been for a 
number of years. We have a member of the class of 1943. I refer of 
course to Mr. Stanley Knowles. I wonder if you would join with me 
in wishing this table officer of ours a very pleasant holiday season, 
very, very good health and a very happy Christmas with his family.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
<B>(1505 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Second, if today is really the last day we will 
assemble as a House of Commons, every year at this time your 
Speaker has a very small reception to which I very cordially invite 
all of you to attend, of course your duties permitting. This will take 
place after question period.
<P>
	Third, we as a House of Commons and we as a nation have come 
through a very stressful period for ourselves, for our families and 
for our fellow citizens. I do hope all of you will be able to get a 
good rest and come back-no pun intended-ready to do battle 
again when the House reconvenes.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 
holiday spirit may I offer my best wishes to all of the members of 
this House, inquiring at the same time of my good friend the Leader 
of the Government in the House what he has in mind for us next 
week, outside of holidays?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the </B><B>House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
I am most pleased to respond to my esteemed colleague.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I also wish to reciprocate on behalf of all members 
of the House to your very good wishes. We appreciate your efforts 
as Speaker and as the visible manifestation of the dignity of the 
House of Commons. Mr. Speaker, in that regard even though you 
tell us to be ready to do battle when we come back, we will also 
remember your admonition a few minutes ago that we avoid any 
efforts at poleaxing.
<P>
	The House will sit into this evening to consider the preliminary 
prebudget report of the finance committee. It will then adjourn 
until February 5, save for one or two royal assent ceremonies that 
may be required in the interim.
<P>
	On February 5 it is our intention to call report stage of Bill 
C-101, the transportation legislation. We will treat this bill as our 
first priority with a view to obtaining early passage. We would then 
turn to the other items that are at advanced legislative stages, 
including: Bill C-52, the public works and government services 
reorganization bill; Bill C-78, the witness protection bill; Bill C-88, 
the internal trade legislation; Bill C-94, the fuel additives 
legislation; Bill C-95, the health reorganization bill; and any bills 
that might find their way back from the other place for our further 
attention. We will consult our friends opposite about the exact 
order of this business closer to the event.
<P>
	Finally, this work is however well ahead of us. We have now 
finally reached the time of year when members of Parliament are 
permitted to be as joyful as everyone else in the country. Therefore, 
I think it appropriate to conclude by thanking members on all sides 
of the House for their co-operation during the year, to thank our 
hard working staff for their faithful service and to wish everyone a 
pleasant holiday season and a happy, healthy and prosperous New 
Year. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Merci beaucoup à tout le monde.

	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on a question of privilege. I regret to delay your annual 
reception of the season but this is a matter which I take quite 
seriously. This point of privilege arises from the debates of 
December 12, 1995, page 17557 of <I>Hansard</I>.
<P>
<B>(1510 )</B>
<P>
	I was delivering a speech on Bill C-110 and talking about the 
importance of the two founding peoples of this country. My last 
sentence was: ``Without the French settlers and explorers who 
came to this country we would not have what we have today''. A 
member of the Reform Party chose to intervene by saying: ``We 
would have something far better''. I found that to be a most 
regrettable racist slur against certain citizens of Canada based on 
their-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleague, I have a copy in hand of the 
<I>Hansard</I> to which you referred. Although I find that the statement 
may be objectionable to you and perhaps to other members, I had a 
chance to look it over earlier today in anticipation of what might be 
said.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member could go directly to the specific 
point that she thinks her privileges have been infringed upon.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, if I may I would like to go to the 
point of the privilege of the House and myself as a member of the 
House rather than as a personal affront to me as an individual 
member.
<P>
	I find that kind of remark being made in the House derogatory to 
the dignity of the House. It calls into question the honour and 
integrity and character of this House.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleague, I can understand that some 
hon. members will take offence in the course of the debate. We in 
this House have been elected to speak for our constituents and we 
have very strong feelings.
<P>
	In this case, I find it difficult to zero in precisely in that the 
House itself has been offended by the language. We have heard 
language even today, my dear colleague, which was very strong. It 
would be the intention of your Speaker to give within the bounds of 
dignity and decorum as much leeway as we can to hon. members to 
express themselves.
<P>
	I would rule that although the hon. member would surely have a 
point where she is feeling badly about something being said, at 
least at this point from what I have read this is a point of debate and 
not a question of privilege.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="17713"> 17713 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Beauchesne's citation 26 states, and I read selectively: 
``A question of privilege is a question partly of fact and partly 
of law, the law of contempt of Parliament''. It is in reference to 
that section that I believe the hon. member's comments should 
be thought of this afternoon.
<P>
	The law of contempt of Parliament has been applied on several 
occasions by Speakers when people have made comments in regard 
to particular groups, such as derogatory comments against women 
and derogatory comments against others. I suggest very 
respectfully that the Speaker in the past has identified those 
comments as being unacceptable and offensive to the dignity of the 
House. Similarly as it applies to courts of law, a very senior judge 
of this country for having made equally unacceptable remarks only 
days ago was told promptly by Canadians and by our Minister of 
Justice that remarks of that nature were not acceptable.
<P>
	For that reason and for the offence to the dignity of the House 
that I referred to in the citation of Beauchesne, I feel that the hon. 
member for Ottawa West is quite appropriate in bringing this 
unacceptable comment to the attention of the House.
<P>
	The member in question who made the comment, in order to 
restore the dignity of this House should be rising now and 
withdrawing the remark. We could all then turn the page as we have 
done on many occasions in the past and restore the dignity of this 
Parliament.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The difficulty your Speaker has, and I refer of 
course to <I>Hansard</I>, following the statement by the hon. member for 
Ottawa West, where it says: ``an hon. member''. We could have 
something far better. I do not have the name of an hon. member.
<P>
	If the government whip is suggesting that I should encourage a 
greater choice of words, I wholeheartedly agree. Time and time 
again I have risen in the House to ask you to be very judicious in 
your choice of words. These types of words are offensive to many 
members of the House of Commons. But your Speaker has no 
recourse to any specific member.
<P>
	Again, I make the admonition, the encouragement, if you will, of 
the government whip that I am sure that other members would want 
to say in the House.
<P>
	I encourage members once again to choose carefully their words. 
The choice of words you have can be very cutting, they can be very 
inflammatory. That is why, my dear colleagues, I encourage you to 
be very judicious in your choice of words. I hope this type of thing 
will not arise again in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a point of order.
<P>
	There have been discussions among political parties in the 
House. If you were to seek it, I believe you would find unanimous 
consent to revert briefly to presenting of reports from 
interparliamentary delegations. I understand that one delegation 
was not ready this morning and that a member from that delegation 
would like to report briefly.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is it agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The hon. member for 
Elgin-Norfolk had approximately four minutes remaining.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Knutson:</B> Mr. Speaker, for the benefit of those who were not 
listening when I was interrupted by question period, let me briefly 
summarize what I had said in the first half of my speech.
<P>
	The first point I made was that the deficit needs to be addressed 
aggressively. We need to go to a balanced budget and then to a 
surplus budget as quickly as possible.
<P>
	However, there are pressing and very urgent social problems 
within our country, the primary one being child poverty. I would 
like to encourage the Minister of Finance to put in February's 
budget approximately $500 million for a child poverty program 
through the tax system, called a working income supplement which 
would put approximately $1,000 a year in the hands of the poorest 
working families with children. I am sure this money would be well 
spent.
<P>
	The question then arises, if we believe in cutting the deficit, 
balancing the budget and in spending more  money on child 
<P>

<B><A NAME="17714"> 17714 </A></B>
<P>
poverty, where does the money come from? I would suggest that 
one area is the defence department.
<P>
	Let me say before I get to my main point that I do not disagree 
with defence spending per se, only some parts of defence spending. 
We need to look at the defence budget and decide that we cannot 
have a military that tries to be all things to all people.
<P>
	For example, we should get out of the submarine business. 
Recently, members may have read in the newspapers that Canada's 
three submarines, which represent our fleet, were in Halifax for 
maintenance. I do not know if any of us felt any less secure 
knowing the submarines were in Halifax. I do not know if any of us 
will feel less secure tomorrow if we got out of the submarine 
business.
<P>
	Certainly we do not need to buy old British submarines for 
Canadian defence. We do not need the subs to hunt subs. Since the 
cold war ended there has been a shortage of submarines to hunt as 
the Russians are mothballing their subs.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	We do not need subs to patrol our coastal waters. Our existing 
frigates and destroyers, brand new coastal patrol vessels, 
underwater sensor sites, radio intelligence sites and non-military 
assets such as the coast guard and fishery patrol vessels are more 
than capable of doing the job.
<P>
	We do not need the subs to monitor UN embargoes. The frigates 
and destroyers can do that already and they can do it more 
effectively.
<P>
	We do not need subs to patrol Arctic waters. The sub DND wants 
to buy cannot operate under the ice.
<P>
	Cutting defence spending is only one example of where money 
can be found to not only address the deficit but also address child 
poverty. Another example is the whole issue of tax expenditures.
<P>
	The finance department and the Minister of Finance need to 
understand that a tax expenditure is just like an expenditure in any 
other area. For example, the money we spend on subsidizing 
RRSPs or RPPs, which are retirement savings plans, through the 
tax system unduly benefit the well to do. They do little to improve 
the life of the middle class and lower economic classes. In short, 
they are a benefit primarily for the rich.
<P>
	I want to make a very modest proposal. We should lower the 
limits for RRSPs and RPPs to $10,500 from a current level of 
$13,500, a level that is set to rise to $15,500. This very modest 
proposal would not affect anyone making less than $70,000 a year 
annually and, by the department's calculations, would raise 
approximately $550 million for the national treasury. This is 
exactly the amount of money that I suggest the government spend 
on a child poverty program.
<P>
	At this time of Christmas I want to ask Parliament, the Minister 
of Finance, the government and all Canadians to look at our 
country and recognize that we have many assets to build on. I am 
optimistic for our future. I recognize that not all Canadians are 
participating in the economic recovery and the ones who are most 
vulnerable are children and children going hungry. 
Notwithstanding that we have other urgent and pressing concerns 
like balancing the budget, we should address the needs of those 
children in this year's budget.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peterson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. A petition 
has just come into my hands and I would like to ask for unanimous 
consent to table it quickly.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is that agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gary Pillitteri (Niagara Falls, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is 
my first opportunity to address Canada's 35th Parliament. It is a 
special day for me and the constituency I represent. I would like to 
take a moment to thank the people of Niagara Falls who two years 
ago elected me as their federal representative.
<P>
	It is with great pleasure and eagerness that I take part in today's 
debate, a debate which focuses on pre-budget consultations that the 
finance committee, of which I am a member, held across Canada.
<P>
	The consultations began in Ottawa on September 19. Since that 
time the committee has listened to testimony from Canadians from 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17715"> 17715 </A></B>
<P>
coast to coast. The committee chose to use round table discussions 
to allow as many groups and individuals as possible to participate.
<P>
	On the agenda, among other specific subjects, were the 
charitable sector, agriculture, monetary policy, education, health, 
the hospitality industries and tax expenditures.
<P>
	The committee heard from labour unions, business and health 
organizations, charitable and community groups and also from 
many individual Canadians.
<P>
	This year I was part of the group which heard from people in 
eastern Canada. The people who appeared before the committee 
offered sincere, diverse and far-reaching advice. One thing struck 
me: the eastern Canadians who made presentations to the finance 
committee expressed the same concerns, aspirations and dreams as 
the people in my beautiful constituency of Niagara 
Falls-Niagara-on-the-Lake. Their hopes and dreams are for a 
better future; a future in which unemployment will decrease, the 
economy will turn around and their children, when they graduate 
from high school, college and university, will find gainful 
employment. There is widespread agreement among Canadians to 
work together to achieve a better tomorrow.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	Spending has to be cut, but at what price? We do not want to hurt 
those who can least afford it, as we see happening in Ontario. 
Canadians are ready to make sacrifices in order to have a better 
future.
<P>
	By the end of the third year of the Liberal government's mandate 
the Minister of Finance will have fulfilled the party's election 
pledge. The finance minister will have shaved $18 billion off the 
deficit we inherited in 1993-94. We will have been successful in 
cutting the deficit almost in half, from 5.9 per cent to 3 per cent of 
the GDP.
<P>
	We know that mindless cuts without concern for the 
consequences or the need for adaptation may result in short term 
savings, but they can also result in long term costs.
<P>
	The third party presented to Canadians a slash and burn approach 
in its shadow budget which considered the elimination of the 
deficit in one year. At what cost? Canadians know that the Liberal 
government is proposing a lean but not mean approach. The 
government is committed to ensuring that the most vulnerable in 
our society will be protected. The fundamental problem remains a 
debt that is growing faster than the economy. Reducing the deficit 
remains paramount for job creation and growth.
<P>
	There can be no more effective job creation program than getting 
interest rates down. In turn, there is no more effective way to get 
interest rates down than to decrease the deficit. A stronger 
economy contributes to the reduction of the deficit and the debt 
burden. The benefit is mutual and it will continue to grow with 
time.
<P>
	Our strategy has been to apply a steady, significant, but orderly 
reduction of our deficit. We have seen the results. Today we have 
learned that the inflation rate is steadily declining. That is good 
news for all Canadians. However, we must remember to be careful. 
We must remember that transfer payments to provinces and to 
seniors amount to approximately 20 per cent of program spending. 
The most important thing remains the changes we have put in place 
to reduce the deficit. Those changes have been structural and have 
resulted in a lasting improvement in the way government does 
business.
<P>
	In the 1995 budget we made a commitment to reduce the size of 
the unemployment insurance program by 10 per cent. We have 
done that. Once the reform of the unemployment insurance 
program is fully implemented, the cost of benefits will be reduced 
by approximately $2 billion a year. More important, $800 million 
will be reinvested in employment benefits to help Canadians get 
back to work.
<P>
	When the system is fully implemented the reform will create 
approximately 100,000 to 150,000 jobs per year. In high 
employment areas, such as the riding which I represent, the new 
system will be phased in to ensure that individuals and 
communities have the time to adjust. These reforms are about 
fairness. They are about helping people get back to work.
<P>
	We recognize, with understandable satisfaction, that 500,000 full 
time jobs have been created since the election, but we know that 
much remains to be done. Government alone cannot create jobs. 
We can, however, generate and foster the right environment in 
which the private sector can grow and create desperately needed 
jobs.
<P>
	In last year's budget we stated clearly that one of the main 
objectives was to ensure the affordability of a public pension 
system. We know that over the next 20 years Canada will undergo 
big demographic changes. If we want to maintain our pension 
system well into the next century we need to start planning now for 
future changes.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	The government has started discussing with the provinces how 
best to secure the future of the Canada pension plan. We have to 
ensure this key part of our social fabric be sustained well into the 
future.
<P>
	In the 1995 budget the government reduced subsidies to business 
by 60 per cent, or $2.3 billion. Most of the remaining assistance is 
in agriculture where it takes the form of contributions to insurance 
schemes.
<P>
	The government will continue to examine spending on subsidies 
so as to ensure that it is limited and, most important, justified.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17716"> 17716 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to talk about a subject that is on the mind of every 
Canadian, our tax burden. We all agree taxes are too high. 
However, our present economic situation does not permit us to 
reduce taxes.
<P>
	We must realize that difference in tax burdens with other G-7 
countries reflect differences in the composition of tax revenues. 
Some countries rely more heavily on revenue such as payroll taxes 
than Canada does.
<P>
	Higher taxes in Canada have always reflected a higher level of 
public services. We may say without hesitation we have the best 
social programs in the world. These programs have without doubt 
contributed greatly to the fairness and quality of life enjoyed by all 
Canadians.
<P>
	For this reason we must ensure everyone is paying his or her fair 
share of taxes. Again, the Liberal government has taken steps to 
ensure this is the case, first by enhancing enforcement efforts in the 
underground economy through increased audits and reporting 
requirements; and by eliminating tax advantages that do not meet 
the standards of fairness expected by all Canadians.
<P>
	As Canada moves forward we have the duty to help Canadians 
better understand the value they receive for their dollars and how 
that value contributes to defining Canada as one of the best 
countries in the world.
<P>
	We have to prove to Canadians their government is becoming 
more efficient. Canadians will expect us to balance the budget as 
well as lay out our vision for addressing the national debt. They 
want us to be frugal. They want us to end costly duplications in our 
programs.
<P>
	I believe, as does my government, that Canadians want us to act, 
to show leadership and courage, to do what is needed while still 
maintaining the Liberal philosophy.
<P>
	We must be successful. We must meet the expectations of 
Canadians. Only in this way will we achieve the stability and 
confidence level that Canada must enjoy to sustain economic 
growth, to meet the challenges of the 21st century and create 
lasting jobs.
<P>
	I believe this can be achieved and I will continue to work with 
the finance committee, the government and, most important, with 
the input and help of my constituents to reach these important 
objectives.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate on the prebudget 
consultations.
<P>
	These consultations, held annually by the Standing Committee 
on Finance, are an opportunity for Canadian taxpayers to comment 
on the budget being prepared by the Minister of Finance. 
Individuals, groups and associations come to testify before this 
committee which in turn reports on the hearings and submits a 
report to the Minister of Finance. The minister is to examine the  
report and take into account the concerns expressed by the 
witnesses.
<P>
	That, in a nutshell, is the normal and transparent process that is 
supposed to give taxpayers a chance to have some input as the 
Minister of Finance prepares his budget. Unfortunately, that is not 
what really happens. Actually, neither the committee nor the 
minister seem to be really listening to what taxpayers have to say. 
The minister's budget plans are prepared behind closed doors, in 
the course of limited and private consultations. In other words, the 
game is fixed.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	Every year in February, the minister pulls out his budget like a 
rabbit out of a hat. Every February, it becomes increasingly 
obvious that all these public hearings and consultations held across 
the country are a sham and just a way to make the federal 
government look open and transparent.
<P>
	The committee seems to draw its inspiration from what is said by 
the minister during his annual visit. In fact, instead of reflecting the 
comments of a host of witnesses, the committee's reports, from 
which the Bloc Quebecois has always dissociated itself, more or 
less repeat what was said by the minister. In other words, the 
committee submits the minister's own recommendations to the 
minister. How is that for an open and transparent process?
<P>
	Basically, the sole purpose of this exercise is to legitimize the 
actions and decisions of the minister. I remember the big show our 
millionaire minister put on when he was about to bring down his 
first budget in February 1994. On the news we saw the minister 
getting out of planes on to a windswept tarmac and telling 
taxpayers: ``You see, I am consulting across the country, and it will 
all be reflected in my budget''. Fat chance. The 1994 budget, the 
one in 1995 and the one next February are all concocted behind 
closed doors in those ivory towers, well away from those so-called 
public consultations.
<P>
	Only a small group has a say in the process, and it includes the 
richest taxpayers in this country, who are of course friends of the 
minister and buddy-buddy with the big decision makers.
<P>
	We have here a kind of mafia whose members all know each 
other and have certain mutual obligations. This inner circle 
controls, decides and leads the way while protecting the assets, 
money and profits of its members.
<P>
	This regrettable tendency to give certain interests an edge is 
obvious from every decision made by the Liberal government and 
especially by the Minister of Finance. The minister shamelessly 
attacks the average taxpayer and lets the wealthy and large 
corporations get off scot free. And yet this government says it 
wants to act in a way that reflects the principles of justice and 
fairness. I am not so sure it is prepared to do so. It is clear that this  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17717"> 17717 </A></B>
<P>
government favours the principle of letting the rich get richer and 
the poor get poorer.
<P>
	I remember, for instance, the cuts the government made in social 
housing. As soon as we took our seats in this Parliament, we 
condemned the federal government's withdrawal from this sector 
and more specifically, its decision to withdraw from direct 
financing of the construction of new social housing.
<P>
	When members opposite were the official opposition, they made 
a big fuss and condemned the inhumane and immoral policies of 
the Conservatives.
<P>
	Despite the pleas of the ordinary folk needing public housing and 
the most disadvantaged, who, in most instances, are obliged to 
spend more than half their salary on housing, despite their pleas to 
the government, the knife continued to cut. The result is that the 
disadvantaged really need housing, and the provinces are left 
picking up the pieces left by the federal government's departure. 
This sort of behaviour is shameful.
<P>
	The minister's guidelines remain unchanged. They are easily 
spotted. They are aimed directly at cutting the deficit on the back of 
the small and medium taxpayer, while the deficit is being dumped 
in the backyard of the provinces. You do not need to be a specialist 
to see what the government is up to. The deficit is the bugbear of 
the Minister of Finance, and he will stop at nothing to get rid of it. 
One of his preferred ways to reach this goal is to dip into the 
unemployment insurance fund, which both employees and 
employers contribute to.
<P>
	The surplus in this account, called the Unemployment Insurance 
Account, will help reduce the deficit by $5 billion. These $5 billion 
have come out of the pockets of employees and employers and off 
the backs of the unemployed, and yet there has been no word about 
creating steady jobs.
<P>
	This amount is planned for 1995-96 and for each of the coming 
years as well. It is a tax, a hidden tax. So now we can call 
unemployment insurance, deficit insurance. The aim of the plan 
has been totally changed, indeed twisted, by the Liberals.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	In this regard, a task force on unemployment insurance set up by 
the Canadian Institute of Actuaries wrote in its report that since the 
UI program is financed entirely through employee and employer 
contributions, the current formula distorts the government's budget 
results.
<P>
	In short, the CIA maintains that the UI account balance should 
not impact on the federal deficit, as is now the case. The surplus for 
the 1995-96 fiscal year is $5 billion. If we adjust the deficit to 
allow for this surplus, the budget deficit will be $37.7 billion 
instead of $32.7 billion.
<P>
	The Liberals' decision to take money from this account is 
unacceptable. Discontent is simmering in several regions of the 
country. The workers feel that this money belongs to them.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance himself admitted that the annual surplus 
was used to reduce his deficit, thus contradicting our dear Minister 
of Labour who, not so long ago, was denouncing the federal 
government, who recently told <I>Le Point</I> that the government was 
setting this surplus aside and that it would not be used to reduce the 
federal deficit. What awareness. What a great demonstration of 
ignorance by our favourite minister, the Minister of Labour no less.
<P>
	Another issue that is very much in the news these days is the old 
age pension. To reach its so-called target of reducing the deficit to 
$17 billion by 1997-98, the federal government will have to cut 
spending by several billion dollars. After presenting his economic 
and fiscal update, the Minister of Finance clearly expressed his 
intention of cutting old age pensions as part of the review 
announced in his last budget. Again, it is the little guys that will 
pay the price. The Bloc Quebecois is vigorously opposed to these 
cuts that will affect our seniors' living conditions.
<P>
	It is clear that workers, the unemployed, seniors and the poorly 
housed will not be part of this circle of friends I referred to earlier. 
It is also clear that the federal government is not listening to these 
people or addressing their concerns. Except, of course, before an 
election, and especially before a referendum in Quebec. The 
Minister of Finance deliberately delayed his appearance before the 
finance committee this year, precisely because he did not want to 
upset these people. Political courage is certainly not a trademark of 
this government. There is a lack of backbone on the other side of 
the House.
<P>
	Another Liberal strategy to reduce the deficit is simply to dump 
it into the provinces' backyards. The federal government is 
reducing its deficit by forcing the provinces to increase theirs. 
Instead of tackling the total deficit supported by taxpayers, it 
decentralizes it. The federal government's annual cuts of $2.4 
billion in unemployment insurance have led to an increase in 
provincial welfare spending. And next year will be worse, with 
Ottawa making further cuts to UI totalling $2 billion.
<P>
	Furthermore, cuts to transfer payments announced in the last 
budget will translate into a $2.5 billion shortfall to the provinces in 
1996-97 and a $4.5 billion shortfall in 1997-98. Federal policies are 
forcing the provinces to either increase their deficit or reduce 
services provided to the public because cuts to UI make the 
provinces' expenditures go up while cuts to transfers make their 
revenues go down.
<P>
	Given how dramatically transfer payments will be reduced, 
shovelling is hardly the appropriate word to describe what the 
federal government is doing with its deficit; it is literally blowing it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17718"> 17718 </A></B>
<P>
in the provinces'  backyards. The government is no longer using a 
shovel, it is dumping the deficit by the truckload onto the 
provinces. But this approach does not seem to bother them. Quite 
the contrary; that is just what they wanted.
<P>
	On this subject, I should read you a few lines of what 
Jean-Robert Sansfaçon wrote in last Saturday's edition of <I>Le 
Devoir</I>. Under the headline ``How clever'', Mr. Sansfaçon says that 
Ottawa is giving up its role as far as redistributing wealth is 
concerned. On the issue of budget management, and thus the deficit 
issue, he writes: ``The provincial government's task is never easy. 
Unlike Ottawa, the provinces cannot just decide what amount they 
want to put on the UI and pension cheques they write out. The 
provinces are responsible for most first line services, the main ones 
being health and education. At this critical stage of the deficit 
reduction effort, the provinces now see themselves forced to review 
the very framework of these services, a task the difficulty of which 
escapes federal mandarins''.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	And he goes on to say that Pauline Marois was right when she 
pointed out that the future state of the province's finances is closely 
linked with cuts to federal transfers. While these cash transfer cuts 
may not affect Quebec, they will not result in a drop but rather in a 
shortfall of $650 million for Quebec next year.
<P>
	Listen closely to this: ``Note the intense lobbying effort carried 
out by elected representatives from the have provinces, through the 
federal cabinet, to get Ottawa to abandon its plans to use transfer 
programs other than equalization for wealth redistribution 
purposes. If Ottawa should give in to this pressure, budgets 
earmarked for social assistance and post-secondary education 
would not only be in free fall, as expected, but they would be 
distributed on the sole basis of provincial population. The Quebec 
government and every member from Quebec must oppose this 
Machiavellian way of redistributing wealth, since the per capita 
income is generally 25 per cent higher in have provinces than in 
have not provinces''.
<P>
	According to Mr. Sansfaçon, the UI reform in itself is a breach of 
the redistribution principle. The have provinces are the ones that 
stand to benefit the most, at least from a macroeconomic point of 
view, from the rollback of premiums paid by higher wage earners, 
who are concentrated mainly in have provinces, the integration of 
part time workers and the tightening of qualifying conditions.
<P>
	The editorial writer of <I>Le Devoir</I> continues by saying that it is 
easy to identify the reasons why the federal finance minister is so 
optimistic in terms of meeting his goal of a $32 billion deficit for 
this year. He writes: ``Revenues are increasing, the clean-up in the 
departments has just begun, and most of the cuts were passed on to 
the provinces and to the UI account. Later, of course, pensions will 
also be targeted. The UI surplus  alone will allow Ottawa to reduce 
its annual spending by five or seven billion, between now and the 
next recession, with no equivalent reduction in the contributions 
made. This is like a jackpot. This is another way, although certainly 
not progressive or productive, of collecting taxes''.
<P>
	He continues in the following manner: ``The more time goes by, 
the more the Martin method becomes clear. Ottawa will reach its 
budget goal without too much difficulty. That goal seems rather 
modest, considering that the way to meet it consists in forcing the 
provinces to tighten the belt of their people, forcing the 
unemployed to work, and forcing small businesses to pay for a UI 
program whose surplus will primarily be used to reduce the deficit. 
It was simply a matter of thinking about it''.
<P>
	Do we need to add anything more to an article that so clearly 
tells us about the intentions and the ways of the finance minister? 
Social justice and tax fairness are not compatible with the Liberals. 
Not everyone, and I am referring to the rich and the companies that 
get away with not paying any taxes, is being asked to contribute to 
the deficit reduction effort. The deficit is being reduced at the 
expense of the masses, and that includes the poor, the have nots, as 
well as the low and middle income workers.
<P>
	It is the provinces that have to do the dirty work, since they are 
stuck with the every day reality and must provide the essential 
services to the public. Yet, in spite of cutting in the transfers to the 
provinces, the central government continues to impose its 
guidelines and national standards to the provinces. This becomes 
unbearable and unacceptable.
<P>
	To counter the federal way of doing things, Quebec's finance 
minister, Pauline Marois, suggested two days ago to her federal 
counterpart that his government withdraw from the social 
assistance, post-secondary education and health sectors. Under 
Quebec's proposal, the federal government would give the 
province tax points instead of an annual cheque, which gets smaller 
every year.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	An interesting suggestion, one I might even call it an intelligent 
one. The Minister of Finance is always being asked for 
suggestions, and he got one, but unfortunately for Quebec he 
clammed up afterward. A great pity, for everyone could have 
learned more about what to expect in coming years in those areas of 
activity.
<P>
	Let us keep in mind that this suggestion would have allowed the 
provinces to do away with much of the overlap and would have 
given Quebec more leverage for creating an integrated job creation 
policy. In Quebec alone, duplications account for $3 billion 
annually, a real waste of money, but a waste that the federal 
government seems to absolutely insist upon.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17719"> 17719 </A></B>
<P>
	The federal government's rejection of Quebec's demands is 
deplorable, since its role in these matters does not make much 
sense. It collects taxes, then it gives them back to the provinces, 
but sets certain standards for them. Before the referendum, 
Quebecers were promised change. Great possibilities were dangled 
before our eyes. This suggestion by Quebec offers an opportunity 
to fulfil those promises. But, unfortunately, the promises dwindled 
into meaningless noise.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has nothing against reorganizing public 
finances, but we do disagree with the approaches the Liberals are 
taking to that reorganization.
<P>
	We have always asked the government to review the entire 
taxation issue, among others, in order to reach some form of equity. 
Far from complying, the Liberals are instead heading off in the 
opposite direction, as I have already shown.
<P>
	My colleague from Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot has brought to my 
attention the fact that, 40 years ago, 50 per cent of the taxes 
collected by the federal government came from businesses, and 50 
per cent from individual taxpayers. Today barely 8 per cent comes 
from the business sector and the rest, 92 per cent, comes from the 
pockets of individuals. This is a scandalous and unfair situation, 
and what is even more scandalous is the federal government's lack 
of action to correct this totally imbalanced situation.
<P>
	On top of the imbalance that exists between the corporate and the 
individual taxpayers, there are great injustices and inequities 
within those groups. Where businesses are concerned, the last 
federal list of those companies who paid no tax came out in 1987. 
No wonder it was the last one, since it was becoming an 
embarrassment to the government. The list included the names of 
more than 90,000 businesses that did not pay a cent in taxes. Not 
one cent. In 1990, according to the federal Department of Finance, 
77,000 businesses that made a profit managed to avoid federal 
taxes.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has constantly asked the federal 
government to introduce a real minimum tax on corporate profits. 
The minimum tax is not aimed at increasing the tax burden of 
businesses. It is only intended to deal with profitable businesses 
that manage to avoid paying taxes altogether. It's purpose is also to 
be fair to businesses that pay taxes and, as good corporate citizens, 
do not try to evade that responsibility.
<P>
	We see the same problem with individual taxpayers. The wealthy 
can take advantage of every loophole in the tax system and 
legitimate provisions such as tax shelters as well, to evade the 
obligation to pay their share of the government's revenue 
requirements. Such opportunities are of course not available to the 
average wage earner and the middle class.
<P>
	The Bloc is asking the government to proceed with a complete 
review of the tax system, the purpose being to  simplify and restore 
equity to the tax system by eliminating tax provisions that give big 
corporations and high income taxpayers an unfair advantage. The 
whole issue of tax conventions with countries that are considered to 
be tax havens should be reviewed as soon as possible. According to 
the auditor general, hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue 
are lost to the government as a result of these tax treaties.
<P>
	These are suggestions the finance minister should act on without 
further delay. The minister should get rid of all these tax loopholes 
pronto, but he does not seem to be very anxious to do so. The 
minister is like Santa Claus, sporting the Liberals' colours and 
exuding their generosity as he hands out presents in the form of 
family trusts, tax havens and tax shelters of all kinds.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	We have to look at where he comes from. He is not from the 
North Pole, as people might think, but, rather, from the Power 
Corporation Pole. I think that has some effect on his intentions and 
decisions.
<P>
	We have proposed other avenues to the federal government. We 
want it to cut the annual budget of the Department of National 
Defence by an additional $1.5 billion starting next year. The Bloc, 
because Quebec receives only 17.4 per cent of national defence 
expenditures, insists that cuts be made in such a way that Quebec 
will end up with 25 per cent of defence expenditures.
<P>
	And what about the Hibernia project, with the government 
pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into it year after year? We 
call on the government to withdraw from this financial sinkhole.
<P>
	Finally, it is vital the federal government and its Minister of 
Finance listen to the people. Come out of your shell and tune into 
reality. The provinces, Quebec among others, and the people of 
Canada are talking to you and making perfectly reasonable 
requests. Pay attention and get in gear. Stop pretending so stupidly 
in an effort to keep alive a federal system, which is off track and out 
of touch.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
a budget captures society's priorities. That is why the prebudget 
consultation process is so important. It is an opportunity for 
Canadians to share their perspectives with us. From those views 
and from our principles as a government we can find the path that 
will work best.
<P>
	This consultation process has proven to be much better than the 
old ways of doing business. The road to budget day was once a 
darkened one. It was full of secrecy. Canadians suspected some 
special interest groups had ways to get their opinions into the 
process but that  for most of us it was a closed system. Canadians 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17720"> 17720 </A></B>
<P>
had no way to contribute to this essential part of our democratic 
process. Gladly that has changed for the better.
<P>
	The budget deserves to be the subject of debate well before the 
late winter afternoon when the Minister of Finance tables it here. 
And so it is. The government has used a comprehensive prebudget 
consultation process. It is open, inclusive and fully in keeping with 
our commitment to govern with honesty and integrity.
<P>
	Everybody recognizes we face a fiscal crunch. I hosted several 
town hall meetings and consultation meetings in my riding on the 
nation's finances. Hundreds of people came together to talk about 
economic and fiscal issues facing the nation. Together we 
discussed the steps the government has taken thus far and made 
recommendations for future change.
<P>
	We looked at where the government was going with its fiscal 
agenda. We considered questions of jobs and growth. We discussed 
government spending. For all the diversity in the detailed 
comments there was a surprising degree of consensus on the big 
picture. People were quite supportive of the steps the government 
has taken to get our fiscal house in order.
<P>
	A message that came through loud and clear was that people 
support budget cutting but not mindless budget cutting. The people 
who took part in my consultation process felt we all benefit from 
government programs and services. We all benefit from an activist 
government, a government present in communities. That is true 
whether we are rich or poor, young or old.
<P>
	The people of York North want what most Canadians want, 
fairness, balance and a government that responds to people, one 
that can support initiatives that spring from communities.
<P>
	Let us be clear. We live in a time of immense change in society, 
in the economy. Canadians are trying hard to adapt to that change 
but they want to know that if needed, the support of government is 
there to make it happen. This view is echoed throughout society. I 
have heard it continuously since I have been a member of 
Parliament. When I co-chaired the joint House of 
Commons-Senate task force on youth I heard young people asking 
for vehicles of opportunity to help them make the transition from 
school to work. We followed through on the very firm commitment 
we made in the red book by establishing Youth Service Canada and 
youth internship programs. Today I am pleased to say over 30,000 
young people are benefiting from these programs.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	We also kept our word that we would enhance summer 
employment programs for young people. As a result of the 
government's policy, the youth employment development services 
budget has actually been increased to $236 million, an increase of 
$43 million. When we  consider we are living in fiscally 
challenging times, this speaks volumes to the fact that the 
government does not simply say young people are our future but 
actually acts by giving young people sound financial support and 
programs that not only get them working but make our country 
work.
<P>
	As a member of Parliament I have had the opportunity to be a 
member of the human resources development committee. I 
travelled throughout the country listening to what Canadians had to 
say about our social security system. In that role I found Canadians 
wanted to modernize and restructure our social security system, a 
system which needs a complete overhaul since we are living in a 
time quite different from the time when the system was created.
<P>
	Our goal was to meet three objectives: to help Canadians get jobs 
and keep jobs; to help the most vulnerable in society; and to make 
the system sustainable. In large measure this has been achieved. I 
point to the announcement by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development a few weeks ago in which he outlined a program of 
employment insurance which focuses on getting people back to 
work. The net impact of this program is the creation of 
approximately 100,000 to 150,000 new jobs for Canadians.
<P>
	More important, it is not the old income support measures 
program of the past; it is a program which embodies two very 
important elements. One is income support, which will give people 
the security they need in their everyday lives as they face the 
challenges of unemployment. There is also an active element 
which speaks to the re-employment measures, the five tools under 
the $800 million human resources investment fund. The five tools 
are the targeted earning supplement, the wage subsidy, skills and 
loan grants, self-employment assistance, and job partnerships, 
which will be done with local governments and organizations. It is 
a way to empower local communities and individuals to make the 
type of decisions which better reflect the local reality.
<P>
	I will talk a bit about the self-employment assistance program 
initiated a few years ago. It has been extremely effective. Since we 
formed the government in October 1993, 34,000 people have 
participated in the program. These formerly unemployed 
Canadians have created jobs for themselves and have created jobs 
for an equal number of Canadians. That means 68,000 jobs have 
been created through this very active program which the 
Government of Canada instituted.
<P>
	This is the type of positive change Canadians have been calling 
for, empowering individuals to make the right decisions which 
better reflect their reality, their needs and their aspirations as 
responsible Canadians.
<P>
	This is where we are turning the corner as a government. We are 
returning a great deal of faith to the people. We are returning faith 
and hope to the communities. We are telling people we have faith 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17721"> 17721 </A></B>
<P>
in them  and know they understand what it takes to make things 
happen as individuals and as communities.
<P>
	We have taken other measures. We have modernized the delivery 
of services. We have increased the points of service for Canadians. 
We have moved from approximately 400 to 700 human resources 
development centres so that the needs of people at the community 
level, rural and urban Canada will be better met.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	Returning to young people, we have increased funding for the 
Canada student loans. As institutions increased their tuitions, it is 
extremely important for the federal government to help our young 
people attend universities and colleges, to make sure they have an 
opportunity to acquire the required skills to compete in a very 
competitive global market.
<P>
	That was an increase of $2.5 billion over five years, an increase 
of approximately 57 per cent in funding. Those are positive 
measures that speak to the needs of Canadians as they try to adapt 
to the change I spoke about earlier.
<P>
	One of the most interesting aspects of being a member of 
Parliament, whether we are talking about the red book or federal 
government policies, is to make those things living documents in 
our communities. I will share with the House some of the 
initiatives through the partnership of local stakeholders at the 
community level I have been able to adapt to my community.
<P>
	My community has been blessed with affluence, good schools, a 
good educational system. We are also blessed with a vibrant 
community that understands the new economy really speaks to 
technology, making sure people have the skills to adapt to the 
technological change that has occurred.
<P>
	Therefore we initiated in partnership with local stakeholders 
colleges, local schools boards and community organizations the 
York North technology strategy which has been extremely 
successful in making sure our local businesses are now on the 
global web to attract business from abroad, to generate jobs locally 
and engage in the production of high value added products. At the 
same time through the investments we have made in human 
resources investment funds we can provide people with world class 
skills so they can compete in the global environment.
<P>
	The people of York North are certainly behind the government to 
continue on the course it has charted so far.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure on behalf of my constituents to speak on the budget 
process.
<P>
	Just after I was elected I went on a talk show in Vancouver. One 
of the first things the host asked me was  whether I would deal with 
the budget deficit. He outlined how minister after minister had set 
targets to deal with the deficit and each time they had failed. I said 
we would deal with the deficit, that we are determined to deal with 
it, and that as time goes by we will meet the targets.
<P>
	I congratulate the finance minister who has not only met the 
targets he set but has exceeded them. In the last fiscal year the 
target in terms of the deficit was $39.7 billion. The minister was 
$2.2 billion below the target he set.
<P>
	The finance minister has done what many finance ministers in 
the past have failed to do. He has also done other things which the 
Liberal Party promised during the election.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	For the first time in history a finance minister went to Canadians 
and consulted with them before introducing a budget to make sure 
Canadians had an input into the budgetary process to, ensure we 
were able to take the excellent ideas Canadians had, and the ideas 
economists had, to ensure their ideas also were reflected in the 
budget.
<P>
	There is no doubt Canadians said they want us to deal with the 
deficit and the debt. During the election we said we would bring 
down the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP. So far we have that carried 
out. There is no doubt we will make sure we meet the targets set out 
in our election platform. We will be able to deliver on one of the 
fundamental promises of the Liberal Party, to bring the deficit 
down to 3 per cent of GDP.
<P>
	We have a further vision which the Minister of Finance has 
articulated. We will bring the budget to a zero deficit. As we all 
know, in order to deal with the debt and the deficit problems we 
must deal with the deficit first. The way to deal with it is to bring it 
down to zero. That is our vision. Each two years the minister sets 
the targets to ensure we are working toward that goal.
<P>
	One of the fundamental reasons it is so important is the targets 
we meet send a very loud and clear message to the international 
community. We will not set targets we cannot meet. We are 
realistic. There is a political will that once we set these targets 
down we will meet them.
<P>
	In the international community that develops confidence in that 
what the government says, it is willing to do it. In creating 
confidence in the international community we will ensure the 
fundamentals which help us create jobs and growth will be there. 
Lower interest rates, which we have seen, and long term interest 
rates on mortgages have dropped because we have sent a very loud 
and clear message to the international community that we will 
work toward a zero deficit.
<P>
	When the government set those targets it was very important to 
look at the principles on how we were to achieve our deficit targets. 
There is a whole variety of  ways. Some of our colleagues on the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17722"> 17722 </A></B>
<P>
other side have given us their views. We have rejected their views 
when they said we should do it in three years and that we should 
bulldoze many government programs and that we destroy some of 
the infrastructure and some of our industries in the science and 
cultural areas.
<P>
	We said no. We have to look at the core government, what we 
should be doing as a government, what we have to build on, what 
we have to expand. What provinces and the private sector can do 
we should let them do. They will be more efficient in providing the 
service. We have to look at what we as a government need to do. 
There is a role for government in many areas.
<P>
	We had a comprehensive review from the bottom up. We looked 
at services government provides. We looked at what things we need 
for the future of the country and where we have to be strategic in 
strengthening our position as a government. Many things that may 
have been relevant in the past in today's economy, in this day and 
age, may not be relevant. We looked at boards. Many boards were 
eliminated. We realized we really did not need them.
<P>
	This was a grassroots approach, from the bottom up, to evaluate 
all government services. We went to those people and asked where 
duplications were. Let us take the duplications out. Where can the 
municipalities provide the service better? In recreational harbours 
in the area of fisheries it does not make sense for us to manage 
those from Ottawa.
<P>
	We are going to the local governments, to the provincial and the 
municipal governments. If they are not interested we will go to the 
private sector and say: ``Do you want to manage these assets? You 
can do a much better job''. It will create opportunities for small 
business people and opportunities to develop that asset more.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	We have gone through a comprehensive review from the bottom 
up. At the same time we do not want to forget to restore the 
fundamentals and provide better core services to ensure that we 
improve on them.
<P>
	We also want to look at the infrastructures that make us 
competitive. One of the reasons we are competitive is because we 
have strong infrastructures. We do not want to destroy those. We 
want to develop them. We want to make sure our 
telecommunication infrastructure is the best in the world. We 
cannot escape the global economy which is moving very quickly.
<P>
	As a trading nation where one out of five jobs is created because 
of the trading, we have to be competitive to ensure that the total 
infrastructure, whether it is telecommunications, transportation or 
the information highway, is competitive and we are able to 
compete with the rest of the economy.
<P>
	That is why we want to strengthen these areas. The Minister of 
Industry has done a tremendous amount of work in strengthening 
our position in the area of information technology. In the 
environmental industry, one of the great opportunities that exist 
around the world is in this industry. There is going to be a 
tremendous amount of opportunity there. Strategically as a country 
we must make sure we have the skills, the knowledge and the 
infrastructure to take advantage of the environmental industry.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has taken a leadership role in the area of 
trade to ensure that Canadian businesses have the opportunity to 
take advantage of all the new opportunities that exist in the global 
economy by going to different countries. At the same time, we need 
to develop a trade infrastructure so that we develop an information 
system which tells our small and medium size businesses that there 
are certain opportunities that exist in all the different sectors we 
compete in.
<P>
	In meeting with people from many other countries, they have 
told us that Canadian technology is some of the best in the world 
and that we can compete with anybody out there. However, we 
need to know the opportunities. We need to ensure that we build a 
system of information so that right at a computer they will be able 
to access all the tenders that are coming up and all the opportunities 
that exist in the rest of the world. That is the reason why we need to 
develop our trade infrastructure so that we will be giving 
opportunity to small and medium sized businesses.
<P>
	What we have done in this government is fulfil the promises we 
made to Canadians by ensuring that we meet our deficit targets and 
that we have a vision for this country to bring the deficit to zero and 
to build a country where small and medium sized businesses will 
take the opportunities that exist in the global economy and that is 
the way we are going.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to address some of the recommendations that were made 
in the report from the finance committee as a result of the 
prebudget hearings.
<P>
	I want to come at this from the point of view of regular, average, 
every day people who may not know a lot about economics but 
know a lot about what kind of country they want to live in.
<P>
	It is my view that the real reason for governments, constitutions, 
laws and all the institutions is for the people. What that says to me 
is that these institutions and the economy and all of those types of 
things need to be in alignment with the values of the people. 
Therefore, when we go about designing these institutions, budgets 
or laws, we need to know what the values of the people are.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17723"> 17723 </A></B>
<P>
	It is a failing of these committees when we travel around that 
we do not always get input from regular people who express where 
they are coming from on these things.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	It is not just the finance committee but all committees. It is a 
peculiar problem governments have: the ability to really hear what 
people are saying. It is something we have to work harder on. 
Certainly my party will try to help in doing that.
<P>
	All members go out once in a while to sit in the coffee shops and 
talk to people about what life is like in the real world. There are 
some fundamental values that people believe in. I know in my 
riding they believe in certain values. I would hazard to say that it is 
probably true for most MPs.
<P>
	One of the values people really believe in is equal treatment. For 
instance they believe that under the taxation system people should 
be treated equally and people should be equal before the law. They 
oppose anything that seems to grant special privilege to anybody.
<P>
	That certainly applies to politicians when it comes to their 
pensions. The hon. member who just spoke was one of the MPs 
who gave up his pension. I appreciate that. I think that MPs have to 
lead by example because people do not want to see MPs or people 
in government getting treatment that is not available to everybody. 
They believe in equal treatment and they want to see that as one of 
the principles that finds its way into all institutions.
<P>
	People believe in the merit principle. They feel that if you work 
hard and produce more, then you should be rewarded. Value should 
be recognized in all the things we do. People feel very strongly 
about this. People are tired of getting beaten up for working harder 
and producing more.
<P>
	When we have the heavy a tax load we have in this country, 
sometimes people feel that way. This is why people are escaping 
into the underground economy or leaving the country with their 
talents and going to other countries where the taxes they pay are not 
so high. In some cases companies go to tax havens around the 
world to avoid taxes. The merit principle is a value that needs to 
find its way into all the legislation that comes out of the finance 
department.
<P>
	I also think people believe in prudence. People who are 
successful in their own lives have to be prudent. They have to 
spend less than they take in. That is something that the government 
should be working toward doing. I know the hon. member across 
the way has said that it is working toward doing that but I would 
argue it has to go much faster still.
<P>
	People feel very exposed as a result of how slowly the 
government is going toward its zero deficit target. It has not even 
announced when it will get there. It will be  sometime in the next 
millennium I guess. Of course between then and now there will be 
an election. There could be another referendum. There could be a 
peso crisis. There could be a recession. There could be kinds of 
things that affect those targets.
<P>
	If the deficit is not dealt with right away people are left exposed. 
Canadians' values are opposed to that. They want to have a 
government that lives within its means, that is prudent and ensures 
that any decisions made are dealt with by the current generation, 
that a large debt is not passed on to the next generation. That is 
something the average person is very much opposed to.
<P>
	There is probably a lot more to discuss on values. People in this 
country are compassionate and they are compassionate in a 
particular way. They really believe that people who cannot look 
after themselves need to be looked after. That does not mean that a 
social program for everybody. It means that a social program for 
those people who cannot look after themselves. That is a small 
minority, not everybody. We do not need to have universal social 
programs.
<P>
	I do not think anybody today would deny that universal social 
programs have not only helped create some of the social problems 
in this country where through some of the programs people are 
actually paid to remain idle. I would also argue that they have 
really and truly added to the debt problem.
<P>
	There was a time when people thought that money grew on trees. 
Programs were expanded-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Can I have one of those trees?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> The member for Calgary Centre wants one of 
those trees. We all do. Those days are long gone. We have found 
that we were not actually even paying for those programs at that 
point. We were only using borrowed money to pay for them. Now 
the chickens have come home to roost and the country has a 
massive debt.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	I have talked about some of the values. People want equal 
treatment. They want the merit principle in all of their legislation 
and in all of their laws. They believe in prudence. They are 
compassionate and want those programs directed toward the people 
who need them the most.
<P>
	I wish to talk about those values in the context of the current 
situation. The situation is certainly not ideal. It would be wonderful 
if we could go back and wipe the slate clean and build new 
institutions based on some of these principles we have talked 
about, but we cannot do that.
<P>
	We are in a situation today where we are really in a huge hole. 
The debate is $570 billion. Something like 44 per cent of the total 
federal and provincial debt is foreign owned. In a very real way a 
great deal of our sovereignty as a nation has been lost as a result of 
that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17724"> 17724 </A></B>
<P>
	The deficit will be somewhere around $32 billion this year. In 
other words, we are going to go into the hole another $32 billion. 
By the end of its mandate the government will have gone into the 
hole by another $100 billion.
<P>
	If interest rates are 6 per cent or 7 per cent, it means it is going to 
be $6 billion or $7 billion, but that is only at the end of it. Over that 
period interest has also been accumulating and it would probably 
be much higher than that, say $11 billion or $12 billion.
<P>
	Because we have waited so long, it means we are going to have 
to cut a lot deeper into our social programs. It means we cannot 
hold out any hope for tax relief for Canadians for a long time. 
People are crying for some relief from taxes.
<P>
	If I may touch on our current situation, by the end of the mandate 
Canadians will be paying $51 billion a year in interest on the debt, 
about 37 cents of every tax dollar. That is a tremendous amount of 
money to devote just to paying interest.
<P>
	Furthermore, we are mired in an unemployment rut. 
Unemployment now is about 9.4 per cent. A lot of people would 
argue that the biggest single reason for that high unemployment 
rate is the tremendous drag on the economy because of that 
massive debt and deficit.
<P>
	Hon. members across the way say we should have a job creation 
program. The auditor general has slagged the government for these 
job creation programs because they do not work. All they do is add 
to the debt and that makes the situation worse.
<P>
	All of these problems have to be looked at. We have to figure out 
how we can address them, using some of the values I have talked 
about just a minute ago.
<P>
	I wish to talk a little more about our current situation. The 
Canada pension plan is in serious trouble, about $500 billion in 
debt. Taxes are rocketing up. In fact, they have gone up more in this 
country than in any other G-7 nation over the last several years. 
The situation is very serious.
<P>
	I will conclude by pointing out that as members go home for 
Christmas and sit down with their families, with their children and 
grandchildren, they should remember exactly why we are in this 
place. We are here not to serve only our generation, but also to right 
all the wrongs that we are loading on to the shoulders of the next 
generation.
<P>
	May I suggest that down the road what people really want is not 
a budget. What they want is some confidence that they will be able 
to retire some day, that they will be able to find a job, that they will 
be able to have enough money in their pockets after taxes so that 
they can put their kids through university. It is those human things 
that ordinary people desire every day. When you talk to people 
around the country this is what they tell you they want. This is my 
recommendation to the finance minister.
<P>
	As we close, may I wish all the members in this place a very 
merry Christmas and all the best in the new year.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I thought for a moment the 
hon. member for Medicine Hat was going to begin borrowing on 
the time of the member for Calgary Centre. I am sure he wants to 
speak about the trees and the other matters that were raised earlier.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have bad 
news. As of one o'clock yesterday the doomsday clock which 
registers the national debt was $570,947,551,591.35. The second 
bit of bad news is that we cannot continue to borrow indefinitely. 
The third bit of bad news is that the public has lost confidence in 
the government's ability to manage money and resources and to 
live within its means as taxpayers have to do.
<P>
	The greatest single impediment to job creation today is the 
plethora of taxes Canadians face. Governments must reduce the tax 
burden of individual Canadians and businesses alike. The debt and 
the interest expense to service the debt are jeopardizing the 
viability and flexibility of existing programs. That is why we need 
a balanced budget.
<P>
	Instead we have a finance minister who mocks the Reform Party 
for presenting a balanced budget over three years as if the value and 
the merits of a balanced budget are insignificant and irrelevant.
<P>
	When the finance minister talks about rolling deficit targets as a 
percentage of GDP and meeting those soft targets, he brags about 
bringing in a deficit of $37.5 billion. I would really be proud of 
that. That is exactly what the Conservatives projected two years 
ago, which of course ended up being $42 billion or $43 billion.
<P>
	As a businessman I am astonished to find that even when the 
country is facing a debt of close $600 billion reality has not set in 
with the government. Government overspending is the number one 
problem facing the country, and the finance minister will not act 
decisively. He had his opportunity two years ago. He had his 
opportunity last year. He would rather concentrate on deficit 
financing, continually spending more money than we bring in. 
People are tired of this.
<P>
	In 1968 the great and wonderful Liberal leader by the name of 
Pierre Elliott Trudeau ran across the country and got everybody to 
vote for him. That is when the Liberals started to run deficits. He 
ran a deficit. He came in at $17 billion. When he left it was close to 
$200 billion. Then Mulroney came in and left the country with a 
debt of about $508 billion.
<P>
	Now we have this Liberal government. After four or five years, 
when it leaves two years from now, its legacy to the people of 
Canada will be to leave a debt over $600 billion. I hope the 
government can be proud of that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17725"> 17725 </A></B>
<P>
	As the member for Medicine Hat said earlier, the debt and 
interest costs are hurting the country, the drag and the slag that 
will put us into receivership somewhere down the road. Our 
grandchildren will have to pay off this huge debt. We have a 
responsibility to do something about it.
<P>
	Having been in the Standing Committee on Finance I heard a 
number of witnesses who appeared before it for the prebudget 
consultations, and that is really what we are debating today. Some 
interesting comments were made. I am looking forward to the 
budget to see if the minister listened to the submissions.
<P>
	One day 10 leading economists appeared. I heard a number of 
them say-and it was consistent across the spectrum-that it was 
good a target had been set and achieved. That sends a good message 
to the financial community. There is nothing wrong with that. We 
needed some confidence. We needed to restore some credibility in 
the finances of the country. To that degree the finance minister has 
done that.
<P>
	However the hole is dug and it is deep. Now he will continue to 
dig it deeper but just dig slower. To solve the problem he has to stop 
digging. That is what a balanced budget means. Somewhere we 
will stop digging in two years, three years or whatever.
<P>
	This year a number of economists suggested a 3 per cent target 
next year in terms of the deficit as a percentage of GDP, 1.5 per 
cent the year after and zero in the third year. That is what they 
suggested.
<P>
	Another economist suggested that we should get off of the 
treadmill of deficit as a percentage of GDP and talk about debt as a 
percentage of GDP. Overall as a nation it is over 100 per cent. As a 
federal government we are at a 73 per cent debt to GDP ratio. Even 
the Governor of the Bank of Canada at a public accounts meeting 
said it was too high, that we had to get it down.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	For two years we have had economic growth. The wonderful 
targets the minister has been achieving have not been through 
spending cuts. Ninety per cent of them have been through growth. 
He is deceiving the Canadian public by taking all the credit for it. 
The businesses and the people of Canada should take credit for it.
<P>
	The minister is playing games with the people. The projections 
by the economists were 2 per cent or maybe 2.5 per cent in the short 
term. That is not very much. If the inflation rate is close to or 
higher than the growth rate, the economists say that what is needed 
is a surplus budget. That is what the Governor of the Bank of 
Canada says, but the government will not do that.
<P>
	I recommend a balanced budget. Yes, we will have a deficit. The 
finance minister should tell the Canadian public when he will have 
a balanced budget and when he will address the real problem in 
Canada, the high levels  of taxation. Then he can start promising 
Canadians tax relief. Then he can start promising Canadians a 
break in their pocketbooks. Then we can start looking at ways to 
stimulate the economy which will lead to money in the hands of the 
people and will let them do it, rather than the government.
<P>
	I recommend the three 1.5 to zero scenarios, versus the four, 
three and two which the finance minister is now proposing. When 
the finance minister introduces his budget he will use the same 
principle he used before: selective hearing.
<P>
	The business community was also at the standing committee 
hearings and said the same thing. It said that government targets 
were too soft and that it was moving too slowly. The finance 
minister has a tough job. It is difficult to predict and I respect the 
job he had to do. However, the business community said that if the 
finance minister was to err, he should err on the fast side and not on 
the slow side. It is better to err by cutting quicker than by cutting 
slower.
<P>
	He is cutting slower. He is trying to ensure that he keeps his 
support in Ontario. He is not telling the truth to Ontarians. We 
cannot afford to make the payments for the programs that we are 
delivering at their current levels. We have to reduce them. We have 
to help the needy, the truly needy. We have to start helping people 
to become more responsible for themselves. The way to do that is 
to be honest with them. The way to do that is to tell them that 
somewhere down the road, if we bite the bullet now and learn to 
live with less, we can lower spending and then we can begin to 
lower taxes. That is what we have to achieve.
<P>
	The finance minister also promised in the election campaign that 
he would get rid of the GST. The Prime Minister said they would 
kill it and that they hated it. The Deputy Prime Minister said that 
she would quit if the Liberals did not get rid of the GST. That was 
addressed at the hearings as well. People were saying: ``Let us do 
something about the GST''. Two years ago the recommendation 
was to harmonize with the provinces: combine it, have it at one 
rate, hide it and the people would forget about it.
<P>
	No. Any tax should be visible. As a matter of fact, not only 
should taxes be visible but our spending should be visible. We use 
income tax too much to deliver social and economic benefits when 
we should be taking those tax breaks out of income tax and putting 
them in a spending envelope under direct spending as they did in 
New Zealand.
<P>
	Then we would have politicians and bureaucrats who could be 
held accountable. Then we would have a politician saying: ``This is 
what we will spend on welfare. Here is my envelope. It is a $5 
billion program''. The deputy minister and the bureaucracy could 
help the politician do that. That would create an incentive for 
bureaucrats to succeed. They could actually receive a  bonus if they 
helped the politician achieve the objective. The morale in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17726"> 17726 </A></B>
<P>
public service is very low. I critique the departments of Revenue 
Canada and Customs and Excise and I could tell stories that would 
scare people.
<P>
	In the next budget I would like to see a solution to the GST that is 
better and different from harmonization.
<P>
	The finance minister is doing a disservice to the country if he 
will not accept complete responsibility, present a balanced budget 
and tell Canadians when they can expect tax relief. I hope in the 
next budget he will not be accused by opposition members of 
having selective hearing in committee.
<P>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	He should have listened to that committee the way I listened to 
that committee. I know what he has to do. We know what he has to 
do. Let us hope he has the courage and the conviction to be honest 
with the Canadian people and deliver a budget that is tough but fair 
and that he cuts out this crap about draconian reform measures.
<P>
	Compliments of the season to everyone in the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first off, I 
wanted to wish you, Mr. Speaker, and my colleagues a merry 
Christmas and a happy New Year on behalf of my constituents.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The people from St. Boniface wish everyone a merry Christmas, 
a happy New Year and the best of the holiday season.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	As the member for St. Boniface, I am pleased to speak on this 
prebudget consultation initiated by the Minister of Finance. This is 
something new, it has worked for quite a while now and it yields 
results.
<P>
	I met business people in my riding to ask them questions and get 
their opinions and viewpoints. Groups of advisers, young people, 
women, adults also keep me informed on such matters. I will share 
a number of their observations with you and my colleagues this 
afternoon.
<P>
	Before I begin, I would perhaps briefly describe the political 
context we find ourselves in at the moment. In one corner, we have 
the official opposition, the Bloc Quebecois, which is trying to 
separate Quebec from Canada. This is their grand mandate, their 
top priority. In the same corner, however, and this is part of the 
political context, we have the Reform Party, often described as 
Darth Vader's party.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is described as the Darth Vader party, the slash and burn, the 
fear, the gloom and doom party. I would like to attend one of its 
Christmas lunches. I expect its members  would be talking about 
what they do in New Zealand. They would be telling their 
grandchildren that they had better enjoy the turkey on the table as 
there may not be one later as a result of the debt. It must be quite a 
get-together.
<P>
	This is the same party that is lusting for power. It wants power so 
badly that it is prepared to do virtually anything to get it. I would 
suggest it is losing. Why? It was in the same corner as the Bloc on 
the national unity question. It is the first time in the history of 
Canada that a supposed federalist party has not co-operated with 
the government. Why? It is quite simple.
<P>
	Reformers thought that was it. They thought there was no other 
way to go in terms of their own personal objectives than to try to be 
seen as a viable party. Therefore they abandoned the people of 
Canada. That is really very unfortunate.
<P>
	The finance minister has hit every target he has set and has gone 
beyond. Have they ever admitted it? No, of course not. Why not? It 
is because it is a desperate party. The most recent poll shows the 
Liberals have over 50 per cent popularity in the polls. The 
Progressive Conservatives are next at 15 per cent. Then the Reform 
and the Bloc are tied. The Bloc in Quebec has the same percentage 
of support from Canadians as does the Reform Party. That is why it 
is a desperate party.
<P>
	We have talked about new politics. In one article the leader of 
the third party referred to the Prime Minister as having a screw 
loose. That is the new politics. Rather than talking about creating 
jobs, national unity or the deficit and debt, they asked several 
questions in the House of Commons about the coat of arms because 
we added a ribbon that enhanced it. Those are the kinds of priorities 
they have set.
<P>
	This is the kind of political context within which we find 
ourselves as the Minister of Finance prepares to bring forth the 
budget. When the Minister of Human Resources Development 
brought forth a policy and a meaningful initiative in terms of child 
care, what did they do? About 10 days ago they thought it was a 
great idea. Today they tried to score political points and it was not a 
good idea.
<P>
	I have a final example of this contexte politique of which I 
speak. Some 11 members of the Reform Party voted for a veto for 
British Columbia. The others did not want it for British Columbia. 
However they did not vote for the veto in the main amendment. 
That party is having some real difficulties getting its act together.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	When I talked to the people in my constituency most of them 
talked about a lot of taxes. Many felt that they were overtaxed. 
There is not much surprise there. Virtually everyone believed that a 
wealthy person could avoid paying his or her fair share and wanted 
me to bring that to Parliament. Most felt that rich Canadians should  
not be allowed to pay little or no tax. That comment was made 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17727"> 17727 </A></B>
<P>
frequently. Most felt that rich corporations should not be allowed to 
pay little or no tax. There were many comments about banks, from 
their perspective, not paying their fair share. If banks are paying 
their fair share, they had better get out there and do some work 
because very few people I met thought that was so.
<P>
	There was little agreement with respect to what was meant by a 
rich person. I indicated that they felt that rich corporations and rich 
people should pay their fair share and they indicated perhaps those 
with an income in the neighbourhood of $55,000. They did not 
define that with respect to corporations but are in the process of 
doing so.
<P>
	There was a unanimous feeling that people earning profits on 
their investments in Canada could avoid all or some Canadian 
taxes. They wanted that perception brought to the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	Over 75 per cent of the people who responded to my question felt 
that those who had student loans and were now working but had not 
paid back the loans should be pursued by every single means 
available to the government. This was a point which really grated 
on them. They felt strongly that if someone owes the government 
money and is in a position to pay it back, then they should.
<P>
	They were pleased with some of the actions the government has 
taken with respect to family trusts. They want to make sure that 
continues, that there is no way for those who have a lot to be 
shielded from fair taxation and that they contribute to the Canadian 
economy.
<P>
	All participants believed that there is a significant black market 
economy in Canada that should be stamped out. Some people 
thought it was probably large enough that if those people started to 
pay taxes according to the rules then we would not need further tax 
increases and we might be able to have tax decreases and at the 
same time eliminate the deficit. That is how strongly they felt. I 
understand this is a contentious issue. I also accept and appreciate 
that it is poorly quantified and we are not sure of how large it is.
<P>
	They were concerned as well that elected representatives receive 
a just remuneration, but that it be just and not overly generous. 
They feel it is time for everyone to tighten their belts.
<P>
	Another interesting point is that they wondered whether or not 
inheritance taxes were something the government should take a 
look at. Again, I share what they said with the House.
<P>
	The auditor general has a great deal of credibility. Therefore 
whenever the auditor general raises any issue with respect to 
wastage or other similar matters they believe that governments 
must follow that up very carefully.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would now like to share with you another point they have often 
made, the whole issue of the GST.
<P>
	During the election campaign, the government promised major 
changes. The people I spoke to clearly indicated that they wanted 
these changes to be made. Some of them agree with the chartered 
accountants, who favour a single national sales tax. According to 
them and to my constituents, there would still be significant 
advantages. They claim, for example, that Canadian businesses 
would save at least $400 million a year on regulatory compliance 
costs. They also maintain that provincial governments would save 
$100 million a year on administration costs. That is a lot of money.
<P>
	They mention other benefits as well. They feel that the time has 
come to implement a national sales tax because, and I quote: ``The 
federal government is committed to replacing the GST; several 
provincial governments have come out in favour of harmonizing 
the sales tax so that they can reduce their own costs-the business 
community, in particular small and medium size businesses, would 
benefit from a much simpler tax system; and the public wants 
governments to eliminate overlap and duplication''.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	This organization made these comments, which are supported, I 
must add, by my constituents.
<P>
	I have some final remarks.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	My advisers, the people with whom I talked, pointed out that 
large organizations no longer are involved in growth in terms of 
employment. They believe that small and medium size businesses 
create jobs and that therefore they have to be favoured.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	They claim that ``the system'' is promoting job cuts because 
there is no incentive to keep those who are working. They think that 
exemptions and tax reductions are required perhaps mostly in the 
early days of a venture, when setting up a business. They think that 
incentives-not so much tax incentives as grants, because these are 
supposedly more practical and easier to manage-are needed.
<P>
	They add that research and development ventures should be 
encouraged because they promote the development and production 
of unique products sold not only in Canada but also abroad. They 
argue that this activity should be facilitated through tax measures. 
They would want us to cut through government red tape-too much 
paperwork, too many forms to fill out. They want us to promote the 
idea that it is a good thing to create your own job.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17728"> 17728 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	They talked about grow bonds and asked: What about mentors 
for entrepreneurs? Do banks lend enough to small and medium size 
businesses? They pointed out that in service to entrepreneurs those 
kinds of programs that are available are not always the most 
relevant or the best. They asked whether or not cuts in training, if 
they were to occur, would hurt the Canadian economy. They made 
the same point with respect to research and development.
<P>
	They want to make sure that we protect the current successful 
businesses. They want to make sure that they are able to transfer 
their businesses to their families without significant loss or 
difficulty. They point out that the U.S. and other countries are 
providing great tax breaks to Canadian companies that want to go 
there.
<P>
	Finally, they want us to talk to influential people in the business 
sectors that are creating jobs, to see how they are doing it, so that 
we can do it.
<P>
	I could speak about this for hours because my constituents gave 
me a lot of good advice but unfortunately, I have to share my time.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I wish you the very best of the holiday season.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to speak on this prebudget 
debate and provide some input on what I believe we should see in 
the minister's budget come next February. May I start by indicating 
there are four principles that the government and the minister 
should follow in formulating this budget.
<P>
	First, there is a recognition by most members of this House and 
by most Canadians that the deficit is too large, that it is not 
sustainable in the long run and it must be reduced and eventually 
eliminated as quickly as possible. That is the first principle.
<P>
	Second, the fiscal actions undertaken by the government should 
concentrate on the expenditure side and should not entail general 
tax increases.
<P>
	Third, in the formulation of the budget the government has to 
remember that it has a dual responsibility. Yes, it has a fiscal 
responsibility, but also it has a social responsibility to individual 
Canadians and to society at large.
<P>
	The fourth principle that should be followed is that the actions 
undertaken in the budget, as are many of the actions taken by this 
government overall, must have as their primary focus economic 
growth and job creation.
<P>
	Our government clearly recognizes the need to act on the deficit. 
Looking at the record, it is very clear. When we took over 
government the deficit was almost 6 per cent of our gross domestic 
product. The following year it went down to 5 per cent; the 
following year it is going down to 4.2 per cent; the year after that it 
is going to 3 per cent. As the minister announced in his testimony 
to  the finance committee, he has set the target for 2 per cent in the 
fiscal year after that.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	That is a 66 per cent reduction in the short period that we have 
had an opportunity to control this government. It is not the slash 
and burn the Reform Party would want to see us undertake. It is 
responsible economic management and the emphasis is on the 
word responsible.
<P>
	An important point is the minister pointed out in his budget 
presentation that in fiscal year 1997-98 our borrowing needs as a 
government will have been reduced to $7 billion. That is the lowest 
borrowing needs of any government since 1969. We are going to be 
accomplishing something that has not been accomplished in almost 
30 years.
<P>
	As far as reducing the deficit, as I mentioned earlier, there are 
two tracks to take. There is the expenditure side and we want to 
reduce expenditures. But we also want to see increased revenue, 
not by increasing the tax rate, but by bringing growth to the 
economy so that no individual taxpayer is paying more but that 
there are more taxpayers. That is the key to eventually controlling 
our deficit, economic growth and ensuring that there are more 
Canadians working and more taxpayers.
<P>
	Obviously our goal is to bring the deficit to zero. As I said earlier 
we are going to do it in a responsible way and not in a slash and 
burn scenario that members of the third party would like to see us 
undertake.
<P>
	Our actions in the last two years have certainly indicated our 
commitment to this. The minister in his February budget last year 
announced a 19 per cent decrease in government operating 
expenditures. He announced a 14 per cent reduction in the civil 
service. These are real fiscal measures that are leading to a reduced 
deficit.
<P>
	To arbitrarily slash and burn when we are dealing with our 
budget is not appropriate. There are things that we spend money on 
that are important, that are investments in the future and things that 
we have to continue. For instance, there is the expenditure on the 
research and development tax deduction. Sure, the government can 
save money by totally eliminating that but those savings are false 
savings. It might save us something for the first year or the second 
year. If we stop research and development it is going to have a very 
negative impact on our ability to compete and a negative impact on 
our ability to generate jobs and income in the future. We have to be 
careful that we do not simply slash and burn but that we remember 
there are important things that government undertakes that we need 
to continue to spend money on.
<P>
	There is something this government will not do and something I 
know the minister will not do. That is to follow the advice of the 
Reform Party or to follow the  advice or the actions of the 
Conservative government in Ontario to substantially reduce expen-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17729"> 17729 </A></B>
<P>
ditures on social programs, not so that the deficit can be controlled, 
but rather so that tax decreases can be passed on to the most 
wealthy in society. That is something we will not do as a 
government. That is not responsible control of our deficit. It is not 
responsible fiscal management.
<P>
	As I said at the beginning of my speech, the government has a 
fiscal responsibility. We do have an obligation to bring the deficit 
under control. However, we have to remember that we also have a 
social responsibility to individual Canadians. It is important to 
remember that behind every line on the federal budget there are 
real Canadians, real people who are impacted by those changes.
<P>
	To simply do as the third party has suggested, to slash and burn 
without any consideration for what the impact on those people is 
going to be is not acceptable. It is not responsible fiscal 
management. It is quite easy to go down the list of expenditures 
and look at an arbitrary number and simply strike it out. We cannot 
do that.
<P>
	We spend money on medicare. We spend money on our old age 
security system. We spend money on an employment insurance 
system. We do it because it is right. We do it because it is 
important. The suggestion that we should just simply slash and 
burn is not acceptable.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	Another principle is that we have to work toward job creation. 
As the minister has said on many occasions, it is not a 
contradictory concept. Bringing the deficit under control, bringing 
fiscal management to the country will help in job creation. A lower 
deficit will lead to lower interest rates. Lower interest rates will 
lead to more business investment. It will lead to more consumer 
confidence. It will lead to more consumer spending. It will lead to 
more jobs. It will create a climate in which small business men and 
women can create jobs. It is important for job creation that we 
control the deficit.
<P>
	Our policies for job creation work. Since the government came 
into power it has created 450,000 new full time jobs. The 
unemployment rate has dropped by 1.7 per cent. We are making 
progress. There is much to be done, but it is important for 
Canadians to realize we are making progress.
<P>
	If we compare that progress with the previous government, 
which said during the election campaign that there would be 
absolutely no opportunity to increase employment until some time 
in the next century, we realize how well this government is doing. 
However, as I said, we still have much to do.
<P>
	I will repeat the four principles which I believe the minister must 
take into account when formulating the budget. First, the deficit 
must be reduced as quickly as possible. Second, the actions he 
undertakes should  emphasize growth strategies, expense 
reductions, and he should stay away from across the board tax 
increases. Third, we must act in a manner which fulfils our fiscal 
responsibility but also fulfils our social responsibility. Fourth, our 
actions must encourage economic growth and job creation.
<P>
	We have a long term vision of economic prosperity. We do not 
have a vision which simply slashes and burns without any kind of 
responsibility for expenditures. We will ensure the deficit is 
brought under control. We will also ensure we invest in Canada, in 
our children and in our children's children.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before leaving the Chair, I 
would like to take this opportunity to wish you all a merry 
Christmas and a happy New Year.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in this debate on prebudget consultations and to 
draw the attention of this House to certain statements made by the 
Minister of Finance in tabling his economic and financial update 
this past December 6.
<P>
	In tabling the document, the minister said ``Our fundamental 
problem is still a debt that is growing faster than our economy. 
Twenty years ago, the federal government's debt to GDP ratio was 
19 per cent. Ten years ago it was 50 and today it is close to 75 per 
cent''.
<P>
	This spiralling rise in the debt began, as we all know, during the 
long Liberal reign between 1968 and 1984. In 1970, Liberal finance 
minister Edgar Benson reported an annual deficit of $800 million. 
In 1976 the figure was $6.3 billion, and at that time the Liberal 
finance minister was Donald Macdonald.
<P>
	When the present Prime Minister took over the finance portfolio 
in 1978, the annual Canadian deficit reached $12.6 billion, or 5.2 
per cent of that year's GDP.
<P>
	But the record for catastrophic management, leading the country 
to the brink of bankruptcy, goes to the ineffable Marc Lalonde, who 
was then Prime Minister Trudeau's right hand man. When he was 
Minister of Finance in 1983, Mr. Lalonde chalked up a deficit of 
$32.4 billion, or 8 per cent of the GDP, while the next year he hit a 
record high of $38.3 billion, or 8.6 per cent of the GDP. That year 
the deficit exceeded 50 per cent of the government's fiscal receipts 
of $75 billion.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	After that, the Conservatives tried to put the brakes on the 
relative size of the annual deficit, but were unable to reverse the 
trend toward indebtedness year after year that had been started by 
the Liberals.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance has today given us a sermon on the 
virtues of thrift, telling us ``Yes, we will reach a zero deficit''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17730"> 17730 </A></B>
<P>
	How can the people of this country trust a Minister of Finance 
whose party made its name by starting Canada on this downward 
slide of successive annual deficits, this vicious circle of endless 
debt? It is a bit like putting a professional safecracker in charge 
of a vault, and giving him the keys to boot. How can one believe 
a minister whose party has led this country to the brink of social 
and politicalruin?
<P>
	The minister promises us a deficit of 2 per cent of the GDP in 
1997-98. The federal deficit has never been less than that since 
1974, one might well point out. What is more, the Government of 
Quebec's deficit was already 2.4 per cent of the GDP in 1994, $4 
billion-far too high.
<P>
	Quebec's deficit was still under the 2 per cent level in 1988, 
1989 and 1990, but even that resulted in far too great a debt. In 
other words, the federal government's efforts to get their deficit 
down below that 2 per cent of GDP figure will still leave it far too 
high, given the accumulated debt to date.
<P>
	This promise to get the deficit down to $17 billion by 1997-98 
comes from the mouth of a Liberal minister. When we look at his 
party's record on government administration for the past 25 years, 
we might as well kiss that promise goodbye.
<P>
	Recent economic trends do not coincide with the picture painted 
by the Minister of Finance. After a strong increase in 1994, 
economic activity in Canada has been stagnating since early 1995. 
As Statistics Canada pointed out: ``Except for increased exports, 
the economy remains weak. Domestic demand continues to 
languish for the third consecutive quarter''.
<P>
	The weaknesses in Canada's domestic economy are visible 
everywhere: business investment, housing starts and so forth. 
When the latest economic and financial update was presented, the 
finance minister also announced that he would meet his 
pseudo-target of a $32.7 billion budget deficit for 1995-96 and 
$24.3 billion for 1996-97. He even talks about bringing the federal 
deficit down to $17 billion in 1997-98, when the next federal 
election is due.
<P>
	The Unemployment Insurance account will show an annual 
surplus of about $5 billion for 1995-96 and each subsequent year. 
As was pointed out by my Bloc Quebecois colleagues who spoke 
previously, by including this surplus in its consolidated revenue 
fund, the federal government is in fact using it to artificially reduce 
its annual deficit.
<P>
	Without this surplus, the actual deficit for 1995-96 would be 
$37.7 billion instead of $32.7 billion, as forecast. With $37.7 
billion, the federal deficit is not that far away from the historic 
highs of $40 billion and more we saw all too frequently in the past.
<P>
	To defend the minister's decision to use the surplus in the 
unemployment insurance account to balance the  budget, the 
Liberals claim that in 1986 the auditor general had already 
suggested including the unemployment insurance account in the 
federal government's revenues and expenditures.
<P>
	What the Liberals failed to say is that since 1990, in other words, 
after the auditor general made his recommendation, the 
government has no longer contributed towards the financing of the 
unemployment insurance account which is now fully funded by 
employers and workers. And in that case, what justification is there 
for the federal government to grab a surplus that, in fact, belongs to 
the workers and their employers and should be used to alleviate the 
impact of unemployment? The government could reduce premiums 
and increase unemployment insurance benefits instead.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	Not so. The government is using this surplus as a source of 
revenue to hide the true level of its deficit and its failure to govern 
responsibly. The unemployment insurance account's surplus 
belongs to the middle class, to the workers and employers who are 
the heart and soul of our economy. At a time when the government 
is cutting assistance to the unemployed, it turns around and attacks 
those who still have jobs by taking even more of their hard earned 
money in a desperate attempt to clean up the federal government's 
finances.
<P>
	This cowardly trick masquerades as a new tax that the average 
taxpayer has trouble understanding or even calculating. This looks 
more like another of the government's clever accounting strategies. 
Meanwhile, the government talks about openness and balanced 
budgets while it is doing everything to keep the truth from the 
taxpayers.
<P>
	To meet its pseudo-target of $17 billion in 1997-98, the 
government will make cuts totalling several billion dollars. The 
finance minister was not coy about his plans to cut old age security 
in a review already announced in the budget last February. With my 
party colleagues, I want to make it clear that we strenuously object 
to such cuts in old age security pensions. We favour other ways to 
fight the deficit, and I will elaborate later on.
<P>
	After attacking the middle class which is already overtaxed, the 
Liberal government is going after those who have worked all their 
lives to enjoy a well earned rest in the twilight of their lives. Where 
is the compassion the Minister of Finance crows so much about?
<P>
	The third part of this failed deficit struggle focuses on the 
provincial governments. The federal government is reducing its 
deficit at the cost of increasing provincial deficits. It is not really 
going at the total deficit, which continues to be borne by the same 
taxpayers, it is shifting it to each of the provinces.
<P>
	It is the old policy of dumping on the neighbour, who in turn 
dumps on his neighbour, and so on. The latest budget cuts in 
transfers to the provinces will mean a  shortfall for the provinces of 
$2.5 billion in 1996-97 and of $4.5 billion in 1997-98. The 
provinces will have to look for money elsewhere. Federal policies 
will force these same provinces to increase their deficit or to cut 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17731"> 17731 </A></B>
<P>
services to the public, since the cuts to the transfer payments will 
reduce their revenues precipitously.
<P>
	During the referendum campaign, the Liberal big guns tried to 
link a no victory to political uncertainty and its negative effect on 
financial markets. They were wrong, since, in his recent testimony 
before the Standing Committee on Finance, the Governor of the 
Bank of Canada confirmed there was uncertainty, expressed in the 
difference in the long term interest rates in the United States and 
Canada, and said it was related Canada's excessive debt.
<P>
	Permit me to quote the Governor of the Bank of Canada, who 
said the following on October 12, 1994: ``Had Canada not had a big 
debt, the uncertainty over Quebec would have caused concern 
socially, but not financially for investors. The political uncertainty 
adds a cause for concern only because of the size of the debt and the 
deficit. The political uncertainty is due much more to the Liberal 
government's inability to limit the country's debt than to 
Quebecers deciding on their political future.
<P>
	Canada's Prime Minister should not forget that, following the 
unilateral patriation of the Constitution in 1982, and the scuttling 
of the Meech Lake accord, Canada's political uncertainty will not 
be resolved through the passing of a motion vaguely recognizing 
Quebec as a distinct society, a purely symbolic, even folkloric, 
recognition without either value or scope.
<P>
	Everything with this Liberal government smells of 
improvisation, both the behaviour of the Prime Minister in the final 
hours of the Quebec referendum campaign and the tabling of the 
Minister of Finance's financial and economic update on December 
6.
<P>
	By way of conclusion, I would add that the official opposition 
absolutely does not share the opinion of the Liberal majority on the 
progress made in deficit reduction.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	The official opposition dissociates itself completely from the 
approach of the Liberal government, which consists in cutting its 
aid on the backs of the unemployed and dumping its deficit into the 
backyard of the provinces.
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois believe that the fight against the 
deficit must be based the following conditions. The federal 
government must: cut the annual budget of the Department of 
National Defence by an additional $1.5 billion, starting this year; 
review all tax conventions signed with countries considered to be 
tax havens; completely review of the tax system and eliminate tax 
inequities favouring big business and high income  taxpayers; 
establish a real minimum income tax on business, which is 
intended only for profitable businesses that avoid paying one cent 
of income tax and, finally, stop funding the Hibernia project and 
turn its share over to the private sector.
<P>
	No real and serious attack on the deficit can start without this 
price being paid.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I take this opportunity to wish the people of Canada the 
best for the season from the constituents of Windsor-St. Clair. I 
congratulate my colleagues on the end of the term and thank them 
for their co-operation over the year. I wish them the very best and 
of course yourself as well.
<P>
	Election day 1993 gave us a tremendous majority and with that 
came a mandate for change. Windsor and Essex County is one area 
in which there was a tremendous Liberal vote. The ridings of 
Essex-Windsor, Windsor West, Essex-Kent and my own riding 
of Windsor-St. Clair voted overwhelmingly Liberal and remain 
overwhelmingly supportive today of the Liberal government.
<P>
	That is not to say there is not room here in a prebudget debate for 
us to set out a little shopping list of things we are concerned about, 
that there is not room to say the people of Windsor have their 
concerns and they want to communicate to the Minister of Finance 
and to the government those concerns.
<P>
	Windsor is a special place. It is the centre of my universe. It is 
special because of the way its people relate to one another, try to 
take care of one another and relate to the rest of the nation. People 
who do not know the community tend to think of Windsor as a blue 
collar town, as perhaps a kind of rough, tough and ready border 
city. They are right, it is, but it is also a very sophisticated and very 
beautiful community.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Sophisticated?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Cohen:</B> I hear noise from the member from Halifax-Holt 
Renfrew. I could put Windsor up against Halifax any time.
<P>
	Windsor has a tremendous industrial base which has brought us 
out of the recession ahead of many other communities. The big 
three in the auto industry, Ford, General Motors and Chrysler, have 
provided us with a stable base of jobs over the last little while. The 
products we produce in Windsor, ancillary to and which feed the 
auto industry, have resulted in a tremendous tool and die industry 
and a tremendous mould industry which now exports a large 
percentage of its products.
<P>
	In addition to the big three other industries thrive in Windsor. 
Our newest, the Northern Belle Riverboat Casino, which opened 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17732"> 17732 </A></B>
<P>
yesterday morning as an extra  venue, has been a tremendous boon 
to us and a real jump start for the diversification of our economy.
<P>
	Windsor used to be a pass through on the way to the rest of 
Canada. It is the biggest border crossing in North America. People 
would nod at Windsor and keep going. Now Windsor is a 
destination. This means a lot of change in the way we do business, 
change in the other kinds of attractions that many creative 
entrepreneurs in Windsor are developing, and change in many 
aspects of the hospitality industry.
<P>
	The casino is worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year to 
Ontario and millions to the federal government as well. To put it in 
perspective, the casino attracts a minimum of 17,000 people a day 
to our city. Of those 17,000, roughly 80 per cent to 85 per cent 
come from the United States. That is offshore money coming to 
Canada, being spent in Canada and employing thousands of well 
paid union workers, all of whom are paying income tax, property 
tax, provincial sales tax and GST to government coffers. Funds are 
being generated for all three levels of government in order to 
reduce deficits and in order to give all three levels of government 
another source of revenue.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	In terms of the casino and its operation in Windsor I cannot urge 
strongly enough upon the Minister of Finance and the government 
to stay away from the impulse to tax the proceeds of casino 
gambling. This is foreign money coming into the country. 
Essentially we have discovered a way to tax Americans. We have to 
stick with it and keep this money here and keep those people 
coming to the biggest single tourist destination in North America.
<P>
	Another industry in Windsor that needs looking at by our 
government is the distillery industry. Within the city of Windsor, in 
the township of Maidstone in the riding of Essex-Windsor, and in 
the town of Amherstburg, also in Essex-Windsor, we have two 
distilleries. Hiram Walker operates a plant in my riding of 
Windsor-St. Clair, which used to be called Windsor-Walkerville 
after Mr. Walker. It operates a storage area in Maidstone township 
where it is the biggest municipal taxpayer.
<P>
	The Seagram company operates a distillery in Amherstburg. The 
beverage alcohol industry produces hundred and hundreds of jobs 
in our communities. Yet this is a commodity which is so heavily 
taxed by provincial government and to a certain extent by the 
federal government that it is not operating any more on a level 
playing field with other forms of beverage alcohol such as beer and 
wine.
<P>
	In addition, because the taxation level is so high, the problem of 
smuggling has increased in terms of beverage alcohol, particularly 
in terms of distilled spirits. The federal government needs to take a 
hard look at this, as do all the provincial governments, in an effort 
to reduce  crime, in an effort to increase revenues from excise tax 
by actually being able to collect it, and to equalizing the playing 
field among all forms of spirits so they can compete adequately.
<P>
	Another major employer in the city of Windsor that could use a 
look at by our government is our university. The University of 
Windsor is a major employer in our community, again employing 
hundred and hundreds of people. It is a major contributor to the 
skills level in our community. Our community, fast becoming a 
place of high tech industry, requires high tech jobs.
<P>
	The university has worked in partnership with the federal and 
provincial government and with private industry to produce 
research and development facilities and to produce good, well 
trained employees in order to benefit and promote the economy of 
not only our community but of the entire country.
<P>
	Small business in Windsor has always been entrepreneurial. It 
has been exciting and forward looking. It employs thousands and 
thousands of people. I urge my colleagues in the government to 
take a hard look at what we can do for these types of industries, for 
these types of workplaces, for these creators of jobs.
<P>
	The city of Windsor, the town of Tecumseh and the village of St. 
Clair Beach, all of which are in my riding, are successful right now. 
They are not selfish places. We are not a community that begrudges 
help to other communities. We are vitally interested in the unity of 
the country, vitally interested in the well-being of the entire 
country, every province, every region from sea to sea.
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	We are not perfect. We need help. We are concerned about social 
problems, as are other Canadians. I will outline a few of those.
<P>
	Windsor, like every other community in Canada, needs help with 
child care. We all need to move forward in this area. Child care 
needs to be a part of the basic social fabric of the country. Single 
mothers are out of work. Child care would allow them the 
opportunity to get training and to get back to work while they know 
their children are in a safe and healthy environment.
<P>
	It takes the activity of government to do that. Unfortunately in 
Ontario we do not have a provincial government which will do that 
now. However, we do have a forward thinking federal government 
which made some announcements yesterday that should help this 
situation. I hope the budget will also stress the need for child care.
<P>
	Windsor has always had a tremendous record in terms of charity 
and in terms of charitable giving. Windsor likes to share its good 
fortune with others. However, Windsor lives in the shadow of the 
United States. Perhaps the most stunning landscape for visitors to 
Windsor is the city of Detroit which looms on our horizon.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	It is important as we consider the broadcast industry over the 
next year in Canada to remember that communities like Windsor 
will suffer if we do not take good care of both private and public 
broadcasting.
<P>
	These are a few things which concern my constituents. I am 
pleased to have had the opportunity to bring these concerns to the 
attention of the government.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I appreciate the opportunity which has been given to all members 
of the House to speak freely on their concerns about the upcoming 
budget and to provide advice to the Minister of Finance as he works 
toward bringing down a budget for 1996-97.
<P>
	Clearly the concerns of my constituents, like those of people 
throughout Canada, are on the tremendous debt and deficit and the 
kind of future we are leaving to our children if we do not deal with 
the debt and deficit.
<P>
	Having sat in Parliament since 1988, having listened to budget 
after budget in which targets were set for deficit reduction and for 
bringing the debt under control, and having never seen those targets 
met while the deficit and debt increased, I am pleased to note the 
success our government has had in meeting and exceeding its 
targets for deficit reduction.
<P>
	Some argue we should be going faster and doing more. They 
advocate in the name of deficit reduction destroying many of the 
programs which reflect Canadian values, many of the programs we 
regard as defining ourselves as a nation; our commitment to look 
after those in need, our commitment to sharing as a society with 
our fellow citizens and among the different regions of the country.
<P>
	Canada has never looked only to its own self-interests. We have 
recognized that a child in a small poor community in 
Newfoundland has as much right to be educated and fed as a child 
growing up in a well-off neighbourhood in downtown Toronto.
<P>
	What we have tried to do and what my constituents continue to 
urge me to do is balance deficit reduction with societal values. We 
need to continue to develop a country which is concerned about its 
human resources as well as its fiscal resources. While we do not 
want to leave our children a debt that they cannot manage, neither 
do we want to leave them a meaner society that they will not want 
to live in. That is the difference between us and some of the 
measures advocated by others, notably by the Reform Party in this 
House.
<P>
	I want to speak about a couple of other issues. The government 
has been committed to pension reform, to ensuring that in the 
future we will be able to meet the commitments to pensions for 
seniors, to pensions working Canadians have built up over their 
years of work so that they do not enter retirement in poverty. I want 
to urge the government to take into account, as it does that, the need 
for fairness and for equity among different  groups in society, 
between men and women and to start correcting some of those 
economic inequities that have marked western society.
<P>
	I want to mention the CBC which ties our nation together and 
gives us a sense of identity and a better understanding of ourselves. 
My constituents are concerned about the cuts which have been, in 
their view, diminishing the ability of the CBC to fulfil its mandate 
to the nation.
<P>
	Above all I want to refer to the continuing importance my 
constituents put on the need for jobs, for the kind of economy that 
will allow young people to use their talents. I also want to refer to 
the importance of the announcement made in terms of keeping our 
commitment to child care so that women with children, families 
with children, are not prevented by the interests of their children, 
by the interests of providing good care for their children from 
participating in the economy.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Should I ask the member

<P>
	The Missionary Church is an Alberta corporation incorporated in 
1927 by the Government of Alberta.
<P>
	The purpose of the bill is to merge the two churches into one 
corporation under the name Evangelical Missionary Church, 
Canada West District. This merger would amalgamate the two 
churches as one corporation under the laws of Canada and would 
set out the power, status and administrative terms of reference of 
the new corporation. A de facto amalgamation has already taken 
place and the church is now functioning under the name of the 
federally incorporated church as provided for in the bill.
<P>
	The merger of the two corporations would result in both groups 
combining the resources of the ministries to better meet mutual 
goals. It would have a positive impact on the members of the 
churches involved as well as the larger public in which they serve 
and minister. With this background information I believe the bill 
can be dealt with expeditiously to permit the amalgamation to go 
forward immediately.

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the Immigration and Refugee Board 
should be dismantled and its functions subsumed into the Department of 
Citizenship and Immigration where refugee claims would be heard and decided 
by well trained and accountable immigration officers.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I stand today to address private 
members' motion No. 389, calling for the dismantling of the 
Immigration and Refugee Board, which I will refer to as the IRB.
<P>
	This motion is my response to more than two years of inaction 
on the part of the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, two 
years where he has skirted issues, avoided questions and refused to 
take responsibility for the inadequacies which exist within his 
portfolio. He has brought forward legislation which has juggled the 
status quo and made minuscule changes. However, he has not 
addressed the legitimate concerns of Canadians who want the 
system fixed.
<P>
	It must be hard for old style political parties and old style 
ministers to see past the trough of political patronage and grasp the 
concept of popular opinion. Since the time of Confederation the 
political machine in Canada has been rife with corruption and a 
harbour of patronage. The latest Liberal instalment is yet another 
chapter in this patronage book. Many initiatives are undertaken to 
accommodate campaign contributors regardless of the cost of 
public funds or public safety. This minister is out of touch with the 
average Canadian so I want to take this opportunity to tell him 
about them.
<P>
	Canadians are remarkable people. Our selfless commitment to 
helping those less fortunate has gained us the admiration of the 
world. Canadians want to provide a safe refuge for those who 
through no fault of their own are in legitimate danger of 
persecution. This is our home and we are happy to share it with 
those in need. However, this hospitality has its limits.
<P>
	No one likes being taken advantage of and that is exactly what is 
occurring today. Many of those who have come to our land seeking 
asylum are fugitives, some are war criminals and others have not 
been straightforward in disclosing their present situation. Our 
current system does not allow for a thorough scrutiny resulting in a 
heightened risk to Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	We did not arrive at this situation overnight. There has been a 
long stream of inept decision making which has brought our 
humanitarian efforts to the disastrous state that exists today. 
Contrary to the routine embellishments of the immigration 
minister, there is plenty that can be done to rectify the situation. It 
involves some creativity,  hard work and may upset some of those 
who have been getting fat off the overburdened taxpayer. This 
criteria alone would cause the minister to run away in fear. Yet we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17735"> 17735 </A></B>
<P>
with the Reform backbone are willing to make the changes in the 
interests of Canadians.
<P>
	Let us look at the function and make-up of the IRB. The IRB was 
created in response to the Supreme Court of Canada 1985 ruling in 
the case of Singh v. the Minister of Employment and Immigration. 
The supreme court had ruled in Singh that all refugee claimants 
were to be granted oral hearings in accordance with standards of 
fundamental justice and that the prior practice violated those 
standards. This board was also empowered to hear the appeals of 
those who had been ordered removed from Canada.
<P>
	These terms of reference were honourable at the time. In theory, 
the IRB would be a determining body able to sort out those seeking 
asylum under the United Nations definition of convention refugees 
from those simply seeking entrance to Canada. From this point on 
the trouble starts.
<P>
	Let me start by addressing the make-up of the board. The IRB 
which is comprised of approximately 235 amply remunerated 
appointees is both larger and better paid than is appropriate. This 
body incurs an operating cost of almost $80 million a year, not 
including the cost of legal aid and social services which result from 
its decisions. By dismantling the IRB and subsuming this function 
into the Department of Citizenship and Immigration, the system 
would become more accountable, more cost effective, more ethical 
and would fulfil our humanitarian obligations.
<P>
	Like all other appointed quasi-judicial bodies, the IRB is 
autonomous in its decision making practices. The minister of 
immigration has stated that his only means of recourse for 
incompetent members is not to renew their appointment. This is not 
an acceptable form of recall. This process could take as long as five 
years and falls outside the mandate of an elected government. 
Those making decisions on behalf of Canadians should be directly 
accountable for their actions.
<P>
	Without the direction of the House of Commons, the IRB is 
pursuing its own mandate regardless of the wants and needs of 
Canadians. Many of those who land in Canada as refugees should 
have been considered as immigrants; others should have been 
denied entry altogether. We as Canadians have an obligation to 
accommodate only those who qualify as convention refugees under 
the definition outlined by the United Nations.
<P>
	The United Nations definition of a convention refugee is one 
who, because of membership in a particular political or social 
group, religion, race or nationality cannot return to his or her home 
country for fear of serious persecution. The UN estimates that as of 
1993 there are 20 million displaced persons in the world. Of  these, 
only 60,000 are genuine convention refugees. The UN reports that 
25,000 of the 60,000 who were in need of immediate resettlement 
were settled worldwide. Thirty-five thousand were not settled.
<P>
	Canada accepted 25,000 refugee claimants in 1993. That number 
is the same in 1994 and it will even be higher in 1995. Therefore, 
either we settle every single refugee in the world, or the formula for 
determining status in Canada is flawed. I believe it is the latter.
<P>
	We have a clear definition laid down by the UN. Unfortunately, 
the IRB interpretation of that definition has created considerable 
uncertainty regarding the determination of refugee status. The 
average acceptance rate for the industrialized countries has 
traditionally hovered at about 14 per cent. Canada's acceptance rate 
is presently hovering between 70 per cent to 90 per cent. Clearly 
the definition of refugee has undergone a radical expansion in 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1750 )</B>
<P>
	Some may argue the merits of having such a high approval rate. 
However the ramifications of these practices is far reaching and not 
as noble as one may think. I will address this issue later in my 
speech.
<P>
	The IRB has redefined its mandate and practices outside of that 
in its inception and that of any other practice exercised by 
signatories of the UN convention. There must be a clear formula 
for refugee determination. It must be followed in all cases.
<P>
	Unless a nation has proven itself to be a systematic violator of 
the terms of the UN treaty, then that nation should be considered a 
safe third country for the purposes of refugee determination. Right 
now with this minister of immigration we are accepting refugees 
from the United States, from England, from Germany and even 
from Israel. It is absolute absurdity. Yet that is what is happening in 
this country.
<P>
	Currently the majority of cases heard by the IRB involve inland 
claimants. Those are people who enter Canada and seek refugee 
status. Many of these people have paid their way to Canada and 
only seek refugee status because of Canada's liberal practices. 
Canada operates under the legal fiction that there are no safe third 
countries. As such, virtually all migrants regardless of their 
previous country of residence are granted refugee hearings upon 
request.
<P>
	I believe that it is entirely appropriate and does not contravene 
the Singh decision to deny claimants refugee hearings who come 
from safe third countries. This is in accordance with the definition 
of the UN. This opinion is shared by Canadians but not by the IRB.
<P>
	The practices of the IRB have caused two streams of 
immigration into Canada: those who qualify as immigrants and 
those who slip through as refugees. There are two losers in this 
scenario: the legitimate  refugee who is not granted access to 
Canada and the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17736"> 17736 </A></B>
<P>
taxpayer who is forced to support huge bills which result from 
appeals, legal aid and social assistance.
<P>
	These claimants who do not have a legitimate claim to seek 
asylum in Canada carry a huge price tag. The average cost to the 
taxpayer per claimant in terms of legal aid, court time and social 
assistance is between $30,000 and $60,000. Multiplied by the 
25,000 refugees accepted annually, and as I pointed out it could be 
as high as 32,000 this year, the bill is well over $1 billion.
<P>
	That amount comes close to matching the total budget of the 
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. With that budget 
the UNHCR manages to care for, settle and repatriate five million 
displaced persons a year. In other words, Canada spends the same 
amount of money on a few thousand cases as the UN does on five 
million. There is definitely a problem here.
<P>
	The primary goal of Canada's refugee system is to provide 
humanitarian relief. Therefore a reduced emphasis on inland 
processing is needed in order to focus a greater reliance on 
overseas selection. Overseas claimants are confined to refugee 
camps surrounded by barbed wire and armed soldiers. These 
people have been denied the most basic of human needs and yet 
their plight is forsaken by those who abuse the Canadian refugee 
system.
<P>
	In addition to the humanitarian gains inherent in this approach, 
the cost to the taxpayer would be substantially reduced. Contrary to 
the exorbitant costs attributed to inland claimants, the cost of 
resettling overseas claimants averages between $2,500 and $3,000 
per claimant. This is fair. It is ethical. It is what the IRB was 
established to do: help those most in need. But the IRB is not doing 
that.
<P>
	One may ask: Why dismantle the IRB? Why not just change 
their mandate? It is not that simple. The IRB is a hotbed for 
political patronage appointments. Merit is not always a factor, nor 
is it a motive. The IRB is unresponsive to the interests of Canadians 
and has become a representative of special interests from the 
immigration industry, perpetuating a system which drains public 
moneys for its own gain.
<P>
	The Liberal government, specifically the immigration minister 
and the parliamentary secretary have been supporting that 
patronage system and certainly support the drain. The more the 
merrier as long as the taxpayer is paying. This is accomplished by 
broadening the definition of refugee beyond either what the people 
of Canada or the United Nations for that matter have ever 
proposed.
<P>
<B>(1755 )</B>
<P>
	In many instances the IRB members have been confused about 
the terms ``persecution'' and ``prosecution'' by allowing fugitives, 
terrorists, outlaws and political dissidents into Canada under the 
guise of  refugees. Some of these undesirables are believed to 
channel Canadian social assistance funds back to political regimes 
which perpetuate violence, genocide and drugs, not the elements 
which tug at the heart strings of generous Canadians.
<P>
	Under current guidelines, refugee hearings conducted by the IRB 
are to be non-confrontational. In other words, board members and 
staff must take pains to avoid engaging in questioning, introducing 
evidence or employing a tone that would suggest to the claimant 
that the onus of providing proof of legitimacy lies with them.
<P>
	It is a privilege to be granted access to the best country in the 
world. There needs to be a system of determining refugee status 
which is thorough, efficient, cost effective and fair. The IRB is not. 
Hence the fact is that it must be dismantled.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, you may ask what will serve in its place. I am 
glad you asked that because no responsible piece of legislation 
should ever be presented unless it is well researched and includes a 
plan of implementation. I appreciate being asked that question. I 
assure you that this motion includes both. I am proposing that the 
IRB be entirely dismantled and replaced by a body of well trained 
immigration officers who have the ability individually to determine 
refugee claims. These officers would receive intensive training in 
refugee acceptance guidelines.
<P>
	This measure would establish government policies and 
procedures which would need to be followed in each and every 
case. The performance of these officers would be scrutinized and 
regularly reviewed by departmental officials under the jurisdiction 
of the deputy minister of citizenship and immigration, thereby 
implementing the element of accountability which has been absent 
from the present model.
<P>
	Some may argue that replacing the IRB with a body of trained 
immigration officials directly accountable to the deputy minister 
will lead to political intervention in the determination process. Let 
me concede that this could be a valid argument. However, Reform 
proposes that members of the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Refugees would monitor refugee acceptance guidelines in 
Canada and would act as a check and balance in the process.
<P>
	As I mentioned before, our mandate to accept and resettle 
convention refugees is obligatory as a signatory to the treaty. The 
UNHCR would be able to inform the minister and Canadians about 
questionable trends in refugee processing. This intervention would 
end the pandering of the immigration industry interests which is so 
prevalent thus far. Immigration officers would be empowered to 
investigate and question the legitimacy of all claimants in the 
interests of Canadians.
<P>
	The decision of verifying and accepting a claim would be 
rendered by individual hearing officers rather than by  an IRB 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17737"> 17737 </A></B>
<P>
board member. This method of intervention would ensure a full 
disclosure of information, including that which is incriminating.
<P>
	Why should we provide asylum for those who have committed 
crimes in other lands? There are far too many needy claimants in 
the world to take risks on those with chequered pasts. By 
empowering the immigration officials with fact finding abilities, 
there is a greater chance of weeding out those who are not 
deserving of asylum here in Canada.
<P>
	Let me take a moment to recap. The IRB is ineffective in 
determining refugee claimants as described in the United Nations 
definition of a convention refugee. The IRB has a history of 
catering to the immigration industry, lining the pockets of 
immigration lawyers, advocacy groups and organizations with 
taxpayer dollars.
<P>
	The IRB has broadened the Canadian definition of a refugee to 
the point that anyone entering Canada has a nine out of ten shot at 
being a refugee. Of those who reach Canada, only 1 per cent are 
ever deported. This is a joke. It undermines the immigration and 
refugee system in the eyes of Canadians. The IRB has routinely 
cost the Canadian taxpayer $80 million a year. This is a disgusting 
display of partisan patronage and it must stop now.
<P>
	One would think that the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration would embrace a plan such as this. It would restore 
integrity accountability to a portfolio which is severely lacking. It 
would demonstrate to the Canadian public that he cares about its 
situation and is responsible with its hard earned tax dollars.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	It would portray him as a minister concerned with the safety of 
Canadians and dedicated to Canada's humanitarian obligations. 
There is only one problem. He would have to fire all his friends. 
That is a serious obstacle for the minister and indeed the entire 
Liberal Party.
<P>
	The only jobs, jobs, jobs they care about are the patronage jobs. 
We on this side of the House see things a whole lot differently. We 
want to make the immigration system effective, accountable and 
ethical. We want governments to implement programs which serve 
Canadians without the added expense of patronage jobs. We want 
the refugee determination process to be conducted by well trained, 
non-partisan immigration officials.
<P>
	This is not a Christmas wish list. It is the bare minimum to be 
expected from a responsible government. Our refugee 
determination plan would result in the following. The number of 
persons accepted as convention refugees through the inland 
determination process would be sharply reduced. The number of 
self-declared refugees arriving at our ports of entry would be 
sharply reduced.
<P>
	The Government of Canada would work closely with the UN to 
identify and bring to Canada substantial numbers of convention 
refugees from around the world who are in most need of 
immediately resettlement. These refugees would be determined by 
overseas Canadian officers and would undergo medical and 
criminal checks before being transported to Canada.
<P>
	This system would restore the ethical characteristics which are 
part and parcel of the humanitarian efforts. Bureaucrats and their 
friends would no longer profit from policies meant to aid the 
politically oppressed.
<P>
	I am bringing forth a motion which is in the best interests of 
Canadians by implementing a more effective system of refugee 
determination without the pomp and circumstance of bloated 
patronage appointments and pandering to special interest demands.
<P>
	I urge my colleagues on both sides of the House to listen to their 
constituents, to use common sense and support this motion.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it gives me 
great delight to take part in the debate.
<P>
	To the hon. member for Calgary Northeast, it appears from his 
comments he is almost as familiar with his material as he is with 
the facts. It warms me greatly to think of all those briefing sessions 
I attended with the hon. member in which clearly he did not get it.
<P>
	It gives me great pleasure to stand in the House today and do 
something. It is always good when one gets to do the job one was 
born for. It is a delight for me to stand in the House today and 
attempt to cast a little light into the darkness that is the Reform 
Party policy in the whole area of immigration, in particular with 
regard to refugees and the Immigration and Refugee Board.
<P>
	With regard to the board, it interests me that the hon. member 
and all in his party who can get their heads around the immigration 
question seem to think everything is supposed to be perfect. Never 
on this side do we claim it is perfect. We do, however, claim it is a 
very good system and it works well.
<P>
	I am not sure, and I would never attempt to get into the so-called 
minds of my colleagues on the other side, what their actual 
thoughts are with regard to this.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is insulting
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Someone said that is insulting. It was intended to 
be. I am glad the member grasped the intent as it was thrown across 
the floor.
<P>
	That the IRB is not perfect does not mean we should close the 
doors and begin experimenting with alternative and very expensive 
forms of status determination. We do not throw out something 
without dealing with it. That is what we are doing. We are dealing 
with it and we are dealing with it well.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17738"> 17738 </A></B>
<P>
	Since it was created in 1989, the board has evolved and grown 
to meet the changing needs of the times. Evolution and growth 
to meet changing needs of times I realize are things our hon. 
friends in the third party have a little difficulty with.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	The challenge has been to maintain objectivity and efficiency in 
the system in the face of changing world conditions. We have made 
a lot of progress and we continue to do so.
<P>
	Before I talk about what the government has done it might be 
best to remind my hon. colleague why we have an IRB in the first 
place. It was not an arbitrary invention. It evolved in response to 
some very concrete and important needs and concerns. This may 
come as an overwhelming flash to some of my friends in the 
House, but evolving in response to concrete needs and concerns is 
all in the process of good government.
<P>
	First and foremost there were serious charter concerns raised 
about how we previously ran our refugee determination system. 
The charter of rights and freedoms provides that everyone has the 
right to life, liberty and security of the person, and the right not to 
be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of 
fundamental justice. This is where we get serious, because those 
are magnificent words. They are words I am very proud of in the 
Canadian context.
<P>
	In 1985 the Supreme Court ruled that refugee claimants are 
entitled to a hearing on the merits of their claim in accordance with 
the charter right to fundamental justice. The court pointed out in 
the Singh case that claimants had a right to an oral hearing before a 
decision maker where questions of credibility were at stake.
<P>
	The opportunity to be heard is only one element of fundamental 
justice. Another is the importance of ensuring the decision maker is 
both unbiased and impartial; called rights of natural justice.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> And Liberal.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Perhaps the word Liberal might rub off on the 
member yelling it, although I doubt it. To be Liberal is to be 
honourable and to care and to be open minded.
<P>
	While the government has no interest in denying protection to 
those who need it, there is a requirement for justice to be done and 
for justice to be seen to be done. This means the possibility that 
decision makers are seen as simply doing the will of the 
government of the day must be avoided. That is why the creation of 
an independent body was seen to be so important. It reinforces both 
the reality and the perception of impartiality.
<P>
	There is another compelling reason for having an independent 
body devoted to refugee determination status. This work calls for 
particular skills, for particular  expertise. It requires a knowledge 
and understanding of refugee issues.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Which they do not have.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> The hon. member, is yelling ``which they do not 
have''. I am thinking of some of the members of the IRB whom I 
have come in contact with at consultations and at meetings and 
whom I have seen both in my years as a member of Parliament and 
before. I am thinking of the expertise, the knowledge and the hard 
work. I am thinking of some of their constituents and of people 
across the country who work hard. It is really unfortunate that duly 
elected members of Parliament will say the kinds of things this 
crew is saying about very good members of the Immigration and 
Refugee Board. I say shame.
<P>
	Departmental officials could be trained to do the job but current 
members are specifically selected because they already have the 
qualities the job calls for. By having an independent body we can 
specifically recruit the best people for the job.
<P>
	I presented the reasons for having an Immigration and Refugee 
Board but now I would like to turn to recent changes we have made 
in the refugee system. My early assertion that we are fixing the 
system is no idle boast. Canada does not turn her back on those in 
need. That is a tradition we are proud of, a tradition the government 
is working to preserve.
<P>
	We are not alone. The world forces of migration affect all 
countries. It is unfortunate again that the hon. members opposite do 
not take the opportunity from time to time to travel as members of 
Parliament, as representatives of Canada, and see why the United 
Nations has called this the greatest country in the world and to see 
what can only be described as a horror in certain parts of the world.
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	If they take that opportunity, as I hope they will in the limited 
time they have here, they will understand why we are so justly 
proud in Canada of our immigration and refugee programs.
<P>
	The forces of world migration affect all countries. European 
nations are confronted with the same challenges we face. That is 
why the government is working hand in hand with foreign 
governments to find ways to address the root causes of migration.
<P>
	International groups like the international organization on 
migration are an important vehicle for co-operation and for 
positive change. However, if we are to continue to be a welcoming 
country, and we will, a haven in a dark and oppressive world, we 
need a system that is efficient, fair and affordable.
<P>
	Over the past few years we have heard concerns over the 
methods of appointment to the board and to some extent over the 
quality and consistency of decisions. We  also realize the in Canada 
refugee determination system has to be streamlined to keep pace 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17739"> 17739 </A></B>
<P>
with world developments. It is with this in mind that the 
Department of Citizenship and Immigration reviewed its policies 
over the last year and the minister introduced important changes.
<P>
	Planned changes to the Immigration Act reduced the number of 
people on refugee hearing panels from two to one. The annual 
savings from this measure alone will be $5.7 million. This money 
will be targeted for the selection and settlement of refugees from 
abroad, and that is a good thing which I am proud of.
<P>
	The minister announced the creation of an advisory committee to 
assist in the selection of all IRB members. This advisory 
committee will be chaired by Gordon Fairweather, a man whose 
name rings with integrity in this country.
<P>
	These are only a few of the things we have done to change and 
improve the IRB. In Canada we are proud that we are generous. We 
are proud we have a full and fair refugee and immigration system.
<P>
	I would like to say to you, Madam Speaker, to the members of 
the IRB and, in the spirit of generosity and the season, even to that 
lovely clack on the other side, and also to my good friend the hon. 
member for Bourassa, Merry Christmas.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate on Motion M-389, tabled by the 
hon. member for Calgary Northeast and proposing the dismantling 
of the Immigration and Refugee Board. The Reform Party member 
is proposing that the IRB be dismantled and that refugee claims be 
heard and decided by immigration officers.
<P>
	Thus, the refugee determination process would become the 
responsibility of the Department of Citizenship and Immigration. 
The IRB was established on January 1, 1989, following a 1985 
Supreme Court ruling in the Singh matter. The highest court in the 
country then ruled that all refugee claimants had the right to an 
impartial hearing according to the principles of natural justice. In 
other words, a purely administrative hearing process for refugee 
claimants was found to have violated the standards of natural 
justice and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	In becoming a signatory to the Geneva Convention on refugees, 
Canada pledged to protect people in distress and not send them 
back to a country where their lives or their freedom would be in 
danger. As regards refugees, the Immigration Act recognizes the 
need to fulfil Canada's legal obligations on the international scene, 
and to maintain our traditional humanitarian attitude towards 
displaced and persecuted persons.
<P>
	Contrary to what happens in the case of immigrants, when 
Canada rules that a claimant is indeed a refugee, it does not grant a 
privilege: it recognizes a right. The refugee determination process 
must remain separate from the immigration policy. The decision to 
grant refugee status or to refuse it must be taken by an independent 
body. The process must be objective and non political. The asylum 
seeker has the right to be judged by a fair and impartial tribunal.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	The rules of natural justice stipulate that those who make the 
decision must be neutral and impartial. The principle of equity 
must also be applied. I believe the IRB meets that requirement. 
However, I have strong criticisms to make regarding this 
administrative tribunal. I will mention two.
<P>
	On numerous occasions, the IRB was accused, rightly so, of 
being a haven for patronage appointments. I myself asked 
questions in the House regarding that problem. At the request of the 
Bloc Quebecois, the Standing committee on Citizenship and 
Immigration reviewed the appointment of several board members. 
We have found that the Liberal Government mimics almost exactly 
the patronage style of the Conservatives they criticized at the time. 
This erodes the credibility of the IRB still further.
<P>
	The other serious problem within the board relates to the length 
of time it takes for a case to be heard. The process ought to be a 
rapid one, but I recently visited the Montreal IRB where people 
have to wait more than six months until their hearing. Last 
September, in Quebec, close to 11,000 claimants were waiting for 
their IRB hearing, nearly half of the total 23,000 claimants in all of 
Canada, not to mention that this past October alone, another 1,200 
new claimants were added to that figure in Quebec.
<P>
	This problem must be solved. The turnaround time must be 
shortened, and must include a proper hearing and the possibility of 
a review. The flaw in the present system lies precisely with the 
appeal process, or rather the lack of it.
<P>
	In Quebec there are currently some 16,000 refugee claimants. 
The total figure is decreasing in Canada, but has risen 40 per cent in 
Quebec. Quebec has no jurisdiction over refugee matters; it is the 
federal authorities who control entry and the refugee determination 
process. It generally takes between 18 and 24 months, although 
sometimes it may drag on for several years-far too long.
<P>
	The Canada-Quebec agreement calls for the transfer of federal 
funds to the province for immigrants and permanent residents. As 
long as refugee claimants have not been accepted, Quebec foots the 
bill.
<P>
	I might add that some 15 per cent of recognized refugees cannot 
get permanent resident status because they cannot afford the $975 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="17740"> 17740 </A></B>
<P>
immigration fee required  for each application, or because they 
cannot obtain official identity papers from their country of origin. 
In the meantime, they receive help from Quebec Social Services.
<P>
	The cost of the various public services provided to refugee 
claimants by the Government of Quebec is over $200 million just 
for this current year.
<P>
	I believe that Ottawa ought to reimburse that amount to Quebec, 
indeed all costs relating to those seeking asylum, since it is the 
federal government that controls this process. This is a necessary 
measure if Quebec is to continue its humanitarian tradition of 
welcoming refugees.
<P>
	I add that, in the medium and long term, immigrants and 
refugees contribute much more than they receive at the start.
<P>
	I would like to say a few words about the draft agreement on 
asylum seekers initialled November 27, 1995 by representatives of 
the American and Canadian governments. The document is causing 
a lot of controversy among NGOs involved with refugees. It fails to 
properly protect the rights of those seeking asylum. The United 
States interprets the definition of refugee more narrowly than does 
Canada.
<P>
	I have tabled a motion whereby the Standing Committee on 
Citizenship and Immigration would hear witnesses and prepare a 
report on this agreement.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	I therefore ask the Government of Canada to delay the final 
signing of this agreement, planned for February, to enable the 
committee to conclude its hearings. In any case, the agreement is 
not supposed to come into effect until the end of 1996.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois opposes the abolition of the IRB. Despite its 
shortcomings, which we have criticized on a number of occasions, 
it has an important job to do in connection with the international 
obligations provided in the Geneva convention on refugees, of 
which Canada is a signatory. It is the highest administrative 
tribunal in the country deciding on applications for asylum in 
Canada.
<P>
	For all these reasons, we will vote against Motion No. 389.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to wish Merry Christmas and Happy New 
Year to all my colleagues in this House and to all members of staff.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
during the past 50 years, Canada has welcomed more than 200,000 
refugees.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Madam Speaker, are we not going in rotation?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> We are doing what the list 
dictates and it is government, opposition, government, opposition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> When it is our motion? Is that correct?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Returning to debate. The 
hon. member for Saint-Denis.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Bakopanos:</B> I am sure we are all proud of that. There are 
people in this House today who have experienced the privation and 
dangers to which claimants of refugee status testify they have been 
exposed. I am referring to persecution, sorrow and fear.
<P>
	There are places in this world where the mere fact of saying what 
you think can land you directly in prison, without due process, or 
even worse.
<P>
	There are places where the colour of a person's skin or the ethnic 
origin of his parents may sign his death warrant. Today we live in 
an age where the terms ethnic cleansing and genocide have 
unfortunately become part of our vocabulary.
<P>
	Every day, regional conflicts and political and social 
confrontations continue to force whole communities to flee their 
country. The challenges created on a world scale by the increase in 
massive migrations are still with us, and there will be further 
challenges.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am proud to say that in Canada we have chosen to confront 
these issues head on. It has long been recognized both here and 
abroad that Canadians care and take their responsibilities as good 
citizens of the world very seriously. That is why we accept the 
international obligations we took on when we signed the 1951 
Geneva convention relating to the status of refugees and the 1967 
protocol.
<P>
	By signing those agreements we promised to protect those in 
need, to open our arms and hearts to victims of oppression and 
misery. A key element of our strategy to deal with the refugees was 
the creation of the immigration refugee board in 1989.
<P>
	The IRB on behalf of Canadians reflects our commitment to 
promote a peaceful and humanitarian response to global issues of 
conflict, mass migration and human rights violations. The board's 
goals and challenges have remained constant: to identify those in 
need of Canada's protection and to adjudicate fairly and efficiently 
all immigration appeals, inquiries and detention reviews. I am 
happy to say that over the last six years the IRB has been up to the 
challenge it has has undertaken.
<P>
	Yes, there have been problems. There have been times when the 
judgment of the IRB has been questioned. There have been times 
when the integrity of the system  has been placed in doubt. But does 
that mean we should scrap the whole thing and start again with 
<P>

<B><A NAME="17741"> 17741 </A></B>
<P>
something new and untested? No. That is the key word these days. 
No.
<P>
	This type of haphazard tearing down is inefficient and uncalled 
for. It is also typical of the style of argument which members 
opposite advocate. They are always trying to tear down but are 
never willing to build up. This kind of negativity does not 
accomplish anything. Instead of saying there are some things we do 
not like so let us destroy it, why not say there are some very good 
things about the system, now let us make it better.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	Since coming to Ottawa the Reform Party has tried to discredit 
an immigration program which has made Canada what is it today. 
They have made a practice of fearmongering and creating the 
impression that immigrants and refugees come to this country to 
take advantage of our social programs and wreak havoc on our 
justice system.
<P>
	I wish to state for the record that these accusations and 
insinuations are an insult to the immigrants that have built this 
country, including myself. Canada's refugee determination system 
is renowned the world over. Countries ask for our advice based on 
our experience and leadership in the refugee determination system. 
However, I suppose the hon. members are not looking at that at all. 
The hon. member prefers to focus on the sensationalist cases that 
hit the front pages of the newspapers and serve to justify his 
reasons for dismantling the IRB.
<P>
	The government believes in upholding the institutions that 
distinguish Canada from other countries and we will continue to do 
just that.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	There were excellent reasons to justify the existence of the 
Immigration and Refugee Board.
<P>
	The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled that the charter of rights 
and freedoms guarantees refugee claimants the right to a hearing. 
Consequently, we need an authority that is in a position to hear 
claims for refugee status in a manner that is fair and balanced.
<P>
	When it was proposed to create this authority several years ago, 
Parliament opted for setting up a tribunal that would operate at 
arm's length from the government. The aim was to put in place a 
professional body that would not be influenced by political or 
ideological considerations.
<P>
	To guarantee the objectivity and impartiality of the hearing 
process, it is necessary to have a tribunal that is impervious to 
political partisanship.
<P>
	Furthermore, appointees to the board must be professionals with 
the requisite training to grasp all the nuances and particular 
circumstances that are a factor in refugee cases. We have already 
said that determining  refugee status is one of the most difficult 
forms of arbitration. This is a task that is emotionally extremely 
demanding and which requires an overriding concern for justice 
and fairness on the part of the appointee.
<P>
	IRB commissioners are selected on the basis of the 
qualifications they will need to carry out this important and often 
demanding task. Each commissioner brings to his or her job a 
different perspective and a special knowledge of the international 
community.
<P>
	In the past, the process for appointing commissioners has raised 
a number of concerns. Aware of this, the government has decided 
to form an independent advisory committee that will check the 
qualifications of all aspiring commissioners.
<P>
	Mr. Gordon Fairweather will chair this advisory committee, 
whose members are to ensure that only qualified candidates are 
presented to the government. Furthermore, committee members 
will have to ensure that they strike a balance between the objective 
criteria of the commission and increasingly strong public pressures 
for increased political responsibility.
<P>
	Another recent event which the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration announced on March 1 this year was the decision to 
drop one of the two commissioners at hearings for refugee status.
<P>
	The reduction in the number of employees at the Refugee Status 
Section, from 175 to 112, will represent an annual savings of $5.7 
million. The money saved will be used to assist refugees.
<P>
	These are only a few examples of our government's commitment 
to improving a system that has already produced good results. 
Unlike our critics, we believe that past successes should be 
considered when seeking solutions to today's problems, instead of 
complaining and taking drastic measures.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In order to maintain its relevance and efficiency, the board 
continually assesses its performance and examines ways to 
improve. The IRB has willingly undertaken an ongoing process of 
critical self-examination of policies, practices and procedures.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	Contrary to what the hon. member would like us to believe, the 
IRB is an accountable organization and strives to improve its 
operations in order to meet its goals. In recent years the board has 
concentrated on developing and identifying best practices.
<P>
	An example of the best practices is the adjudication division's 
use of video conferencing in certain cases. Another example of this 
positive development was the introduction of guidelines to 
examine claims from women refugees fearing gender related 
persecution. Canada was the first country in the world to undertake  
such 
<P>

<B><A NAME="17742"> 17742 </A></B>
<P>
an initiative. This reinforces our image as a world leader in 
upholding the rights of women.
<P>
	We have a system which is continually evolving and developing. 
It is a system which builds on its successes and learns from its 
mistakes. It is a system which will continue to serve the interests of 
Canadians and Canada both now and in the years to come. For all 
those reasons, I cannot support the hon. member's motion.
<P>
	I would also like to take this opportunity to wish everyone 
listening to us tonight and all hon. members a merry Christmas and 
a happy new year.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
Pursuant to Standing Order 93 the order is dropped to the bottom of 
the order of precedence on the Order Paper.
<P>
	Is there unanimous consent to proceed with the late show 
question now?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
