<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Established in 1996  by her parents, Doug and Lorna Martin, the Lori's Room Fund honours the memory of Lorna-Lynn Martin, a young woman who struggled against a particularly virulent form of cancer, which eventually caused her passing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The endowment fund is used to create healing environment rooms that support patients at St. Joseph's. Through the refurbishing and refurnishing of the rooms, St. Joseph's hopes to make Lori's Room more like a residential setting that is more conducive to rest, relaxation and healing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cancer has affected us all in one form or another.  As a result, over the past few years the support for the Lori's Room Fund has been overwhelming, with the support of many family members, friends, staff and members of our community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to extend congratulations to all participants in the Lori's Room Fund.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the victims came from nearby communities like Enderby and Lumby, some from Calgary, Alberta, and Richmond, B.C., and others from as far away as Korea.  This outdated, winding road is a disgrace, yet it is Canada's national highway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Taxpayers Federation announced on May 15 that last year the government collected $4.76 billion in fuel taxes, but only spent $119 million on roads and $65 million on infrastructure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has the Liberal government done?  It has put an average of 97.5% of fuel taxes collected in the last five years into general revenue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, the government should save lives and fix this killer highway.</p>

Twenty individuals from all walks of life, including business representatives, local politicians, representatives from churches and the  media, educators, students and artists gathered to discuss Canada's place in the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In brief, here are some of the highlights from this energetic dialogue. Participants wanted to encourage multiculturalism without sacrificing their own traditions and beliefs. Participants felt that our nation must continue to focus on fostering friendships with countries through peacekeeping, education and foreign aid. They felt that Canada is well respected globally and said it is vital that we remain distinct in the field of globalization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, irrespective of their views, they had one thing in common: an overwhelming sense of pride in our great land.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to publicly thank everyone who participated in this insightful discussion.  It was indeed an excellent opportunity presented by this government to involve all Canadians in addressing long term foreign policy issues.</p>

This centre helps disadvantaged people in the area and organizes various social and cultural activities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The money will be used to give 10 young people, aged 16 to 30, an opportunity to plant seeds and maintain a garden using organic methods to control weeds and insect pests.  This experience is expected to be very enriching for these young people, and as a consequence, will not only improve the centre's infrastructures, but also beautify the natural environment. It is an excellent initiative that will raise awareness and help young people take responsibility for their own personal growth, right in their community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and long live Canada.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a past president of the FCM,  I have seen a significant evolution in its relationship with the federal government. Prior to 1993, few, if any, federal cabinet ministers addressed the conferences.  Gone are the days when federal representatives ignored FCM issues. Today we have a significant recognition by Ottawa that in order to have competitive communities, the theme of this year's conference, there needs to be a healthy and ongoing interaction between governments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is this government that has embraced and implemented the national infrastructure programs.  It is this government that established the green municipal fund, strengthening and protecting the natural environment of communities.  It is this government that dealt with the payments in lieu of taxes issue.  It is this government, through CIDA, that has advanced and promoted municipal expertise around the world through FCM international programs.  And it is this government that has regular contact with FCM representatives, including contact with the Prime Minister and many cabinet ministers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This government continues to be a strong partner with municipal governments across the country.</p>

He is right. This is a genocide. Three and a half million people have been killed. This weekend, another 350 were hacked to death. Rape is endemic, anarchy rules, and in fact most of the killers are actually children under the age of 16.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uganda, Rwanda, Zimbabwe and other countries support this conflict, and international corporations are prepared to pillage the resources of this country and turn a blind eye to the atrocities. This cannot continue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada must wake up and call for a large, international peacemaking force with aggressive rules of engagement and massive humanitarian assistance for medication and food, and it must stop all government to government assistance to Rwanda, Uganda and other countries supporting this conflict.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We ignored the genocide in Rwanda. Will we ignore the genocide in the Congo?</p>

<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud to say that gay rights have made much progress within Quebec and indeed within all of Canada, yet homophobia is still quite present in our society and even at times in this very House. Mark my words, one day homophobia will be considered much like racism and sexism: a hateful expression of one's own prejudices.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has a deserved reputation for its appreciation of diversity and difference. That is why I invite all Canadians to join together in celebrating National Fight Against Homophobia Day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to congratulate Fondation Émergence, which has worked hard for recognition of this important day. Your work is important and this House appreciates it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to acknowledge the extraordinary work done by   Foundation Emergence and its president, Laurent McCutcheon, in launching this campaign.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the theme “From tolerance to acceptance”, this day should make everyone reflect on   behaviour—unintentional perhaps—that has homophobic undertones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our society prides itself on its openness, tolerance and acceptance. It is time, more than ever, to prove it and accept the fact that thousands of our fellow citizens are homosexuals. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot remain impervious to homophobia. To ensure  justice and equality, any excessive behaviour has to be denounced. I am calling on all my colleagues to  take advantage of this day to pursue the fight against homophobia.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the first Clean Air Day in 1999, we have seen its profile increase significantly. Canadians are responding to the call to action through a wide variety of community events. One of these activities is the commuter challenge, where communities compete with each other to log the most kilometres using sustainable transportation, to reduce air pollution levels and greenhouse gas emissions. There is also the Clean Air Day sustainable transportation awareness campaign, delivered in 65 communities by the Canadian Urban Transit Association.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean Air Day is also a time to praise and encourage Canadians to take action all year round to reduce air pollution and the emissions that lead to climate change.</p>

If we really want to know about secret deals we need to talk to Liberals. The Liberals have secret meals, where they cook up secret deals, which they stamp with secret seals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider the not-so-secret secret prime ministership of the member for LaSalle--Émard. Backroom deals are the order of the day. Look at how his government in exile has divided the Liberal caucus on election financing, aboriginal governance and missile defence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we have to love the coincidence of three of his supporters all sitting on the transport committee and all pushing to make changes that benefit the shadow PM's shipping empire, all of it sealed with a secret handshake and signed in invisible ink. And what of his alleged blind trust? It is a miracle: the blind can see.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the former finance minister hunkers in his bunker and laughs maniacally as he sticks pins in a doll that looks remarkably like the Prime Minister. Nothing is as it appears to be.</p>

The purpose of this day is to raise awareness about the scourge that is homophobia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, there has been progress mainly on human rights issues. Unfortunately, there are still far too many prejudices and reservations in our society about homosexuals, who are no different than anyone else. They fully contribute to the success of our society, just as heterosexuals do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fundamentally believe that everyone is equal. Everyone must be treated with respect and understanding. We, as Canadians, must take our responsibilities and strongly condemn any homophobic act or statement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I applaud Foundation Emergence and any organization that lends a sympathetic ear to gays and lesbians in Quebec for their commitment to fighting homophobia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of the Progressive Conservative Party, I am asking: when will there be a day against all forms of homophobia in Canada? Soon, I hope. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the contrary, the approach of the  member for LaSalle—Émard is to direct things from outside, through intermediaries, without getting personally involved. He avoids accepting his responsibilities so as not to displease and to win at all costs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister should remember that every single Liberal member in Nova Scotia was defeated in 1997 because one minister cavalierly did not listen to the voters in the province.  They went from every seat in the province to zero seats because of one minister.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was your ruling, Mr. Speaker.  The parliamentary research branch has informed me that despite your stern warning and contrary to your explicit instructions, the justice minister has on four more occasions failed to table his statement of reasons for avoiding the laying of his regulations before Houses of Parliament, as required by subsection 119(4) of the Firearms Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four orders in council identified by the Library of Parliament are: SOR/2002-440, 5 December 2002, regulations amending the importation and exportation of firearms regulations; SOR/2002-441, 5 December 2002, regulations amending the authority to export or import firearms regulations (businesses); SOR/2002-444, 5 December 2002, regulations amending gun show regulations; and, 5 December 2002, regulations amending the public agents firearms regulations.</p><A NAME="T1515"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1515"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1510"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1515)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While you ruled that the member for Surrey Central did not have a prima facie case of privilege, mainly because there is no deadline in the Firearms Act for the minister to table the statement of reasons, the situation we have today is different.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister is now in a clear contempt of Parliament, because not only has he shown complete disregard for the legislative requirements of this House, just as his predecessor did, but he has ignored your very clear instructions in your previous ruling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask  the Speaker: At what point does the minister's disregard for the legislative requirement of an act passed by this House become contempt?  How many times does the minister have to be caught before it becomes  contempt?  Sixteen times last time.  Four times this time.  If not this time, will the minister be in contempt the next time we catch him?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, how can we expect ordinary Canadians to obey the Firearms Act if the justice minister himself does not, cannot, or will not, regardless of what you say or rule?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Speaker rules that these four new violations of section 119(4) of the Firearms Act by the Minister of Justice constitute a prima facie case of breach of privileges of this House, I am  prepared to move the appropriate motion.</p><A NAME="T1520"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1520"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1515"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1520)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-586445"></A><a HREF="#Int-586446"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-586438"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon.

I indicated that I wanted these questions answered within 45 days pursuant to Standing Order 39.  On March 27, the department advised me that these questions could not be answered on time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In checking with the Journals Branch vis-à-vis referring these questions to committee, my office was informed that as far as they are concerned the questions have been answered.  I am aware that the Speaker does not judge the quality of the answer, but the government clearly indicated to me that the questions could not be answered on time and gave an explanation why. While I appreciate the heads-up from the department, I would submit to you, Mr. Speaker, that the standing orders require the government to explain its reasons to a committee  and not to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I will read the questions and answers into the record.  The questions are as follows. Question No. 162 reads:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Since the inception of the Canadian Forces Service  Income Security Insurance Plan, SISIP, how many soldiers have requested and how many actually qualified for Accidental Dismemberment Benefit from SISIP for injuries sustained while in a Theatre of Operations or a Special Duty Area for which members would be in receipt of both the Canadian Forces Superannuation Act,  CFSA, Pension, or a return of pensionable contributions, and the Pension Act pension?</small></td>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The response was as follows:</p>

<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Three key public and private sector institutions hold the requested information: the Department of National Defence, Veterans Affairs Canada and Maritime Life.

As a result, the information requested cannot be gathered during the time period allotted to respond to Order Paper Questions.</small></td>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question No. 163 reads:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing Order 39(5) reads as follows:</p>

<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matter of the failure of the ministry to respond was referred to me personally.  Standing Order 39(5)(b) provides for the matter to be referred to the committee.  It is the committee that has the authority to subpoena officials.  It is the committee that has the authority to send for documents. And it is the committee that has the authority to either make recommendations or absolve the department for its tardiness.  What good is it to advise me? And how does that satisfy Standing Order 39?</p><A NAME="T1525"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1525"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1520"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1525)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the Journals Branch has erred in concluding that the notice from the government advising me that the questions cannot be answered on time is an answer. If that is considered an answer, then the process is useless. The government must explain its reasons to a committee of the House of Commons.</p><A NAME="Int-586450"></A><a HREF="#Int-586453"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-586447"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Geoff Regan (Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the point of order the member has raised. I know you are familiar with this process, Mr. Speaker, and with the rules that apply, and I know there are others who have gone before me in my role as parliamentary secretary to the government House leader, outstanding members who have held this role in the past, and who are familiar with the fact that the branch of the Privy Council Office that handles these matters is often overwhelmed with the number of requests for documents and the amount of paper they have to go through. In fact,  I have gone there to sign written answers to written questions when the stack of paper involved is so high and sometimes requires several boxes to contain the answer, and of course numerous copies of the answer are required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in fact true that sometimes there are great difficulties posed by these questions and by answering them.  In fact, sometimes it is entirely impossible to answer these questions within the 45 days given and requested by the members.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to refer you, Mr. Speaker, to page 443 of Marleau and Montpetit, which states:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The guidelines that apply to the form and content of written questions are also applicable to the answers provided by the government. As such, no argument or opinion is to be given, and only the information needed to respond to the question is to be provided in an effort to maintain the process of written questions as an exchange of information rather than an opportunity for debate.  It is acceptable for the government, in responding to a written question, to indicate to the House that it cannot supply an answer. On occasion, the government has supplied supplementary replies to questions already answered. The Speaker, however, has ruled that it is not in order to indicate in a response to a written question the total time and cost incurred by the government in the preparation of that response.</small></td>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though, Mr. Speaker, of course that cost and time is very, very significant.</p><A NAME="T1530"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1530"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1535"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1525"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1530)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-586453"></A><a HREF="#Int-586458"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-586450"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Speaker: </b>I am not clear on what is being requested of the Chair in the circumstances of this case.  I think the hon. member for Calgary Northeast in his original submission suggested that he knew it was not normal for the Chair to comment on the adequacy or otherwise of an answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is he asking that his questions be referred to a committee? If so, perhaps he could propose that to the House and see if there would be agreement on the part of the House to refer the questions to the committee. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternatively, and I am guessing out of the blue here, he could put the questions back on the Order Paper without the 45 day time limit, without starring the question, in effect, or indicate instead of starring making it oral. He could put it on without the 45 day request and then wait for the answer, which would then have to be prepared and sent to him. Maybe it is in the course of preparation now.  I could not tell that from the answer the hon. member read into the record, and I do not think he could either because the answer was not clear on the point, of course.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the hon. member might try asking the House, if that is his desire, if the House is willing to refer the question to the committee. I have no idea what the parliamentary secretary wants. I could not tell from  his submission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that these answers are sometimes quite expensive, but the hon. member for Calgary Northeast is well known for his enthusiasm for saving money, so I do not think he would want to press a question that was going to cost millions to answer. Maybe we can work something out here with discussions between the parties and come back to the House with a proposal on this. I am in the House's hands.</p><A NAME="Int-586458"></A><a HREF="#Int-586459"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-586453"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Art Hanger: </b>Mr. Speaker, certainly I am willing to work something out in reference to the reply to these particular questions, but the matter still comes down to this point.

He read the answer into the record. His having got an answer, it is not for the Chair to comment on the quality of the answer or whether in fact it is really an answer to his question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have made suggestions as to how he might resolve the matter. I suggest that he have a chat with the parliamentary secretary and maybe between them they can come up with a solution that would be acceptable to everybody in the House, and maybe on consent something else could be done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that from my own experience as the parliamentary secretary and having done that work before, but not with these rules, admittedly, I was usually able to arrange some accommodation with hon. members. I know the parliamentary secretary would be enthusiastic about doing so with the hon. member for Calgary Northeast. Perhaps we could leave it at that. </p><A NAME="Int-587460"></A><a HREF="#Int-587532"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-586459"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Art Hanger: </b>Mr. Speaker, I will confer with the parliamentary secretary.</p><A NAME="Int-587532"></A><a HREF="#Int-586461"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-587460"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Speaker: </b>I thank the hon. member.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your letter of April 26, 2002, referred to an earlier communication of November 29, 2001, reminding members of the principles governing the use of mailing and particularly with reference to their use on behalf of various groups. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been brought to my attention that the member for Vancouver East and the NDP House leader used her free mailing privileges to advertise a weekend seminar event in Ottawa featuring classes such as “Anarchism 101” and “Cuban anti-terrorism and the U.S”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The weekend seminar also featured “confronting U.S. imperialism”, “class monopoly”, “radical cheerleading and street theatre” and “tools to energize and deal with burnout for social activists”. The agenda also advertised “Kick-Ass T's--Make your own protest shirts” and, in anticipation of president George W. Bush's visit to Canada, which unfortunately was cancelled, there was a workshop called “Revolutionary knitting: plan to  prepare and organize for Bush's visit on Monday”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mailing by the member for Vancouver East to promote this seminar was reported in an article in the <i>Ottawa Citizen</i> on page A5 on May 12, 2003.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that members of Parliament use their franking privileges to communicate with Canadians about their work and the work of the party right across Canada. This is a well accepted principle, but not to advertise somebody else's seminar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have specifically stated in your letters to members that facilitating communications between other groups and constituents via the member cannot be tolerated using taxpayer funds. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an affront to this House that a member would abuse her privileges, but to use these privileges provided by a parliamentary democracy to attack the very principles of parliamentary democracy through the promotion of anarchy and violence to the point of training people in anarchy and street  violence  and the destruction of our society is an absolute and intolerable affront to this House.</p><A NAME="T1535"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1535"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1540"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1530"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1535)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-586467"></A><a HREF="#Int-586468"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-586461"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Speaker: </b>I am having real difficulty understanding what the point of order is here.</p>

The board will conduct the necessary investigation. It will speak to the hon. member for Vancouver East. Everything will be done. If money is owed, it will be decided by the board. However  it is not a point of order for the Speaker to decide in the House.</p>

The petitioners believe that one Canadian child in four dies before birth as a result of induced abortion and that in the absence of Canadian law, abortion on demand is available during all months of pregnancy.

<center><b>Question No. 212--</b></center><b>Mr. Ted White</b>:<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the fact that the Minister of Natural

					 line-ups at Ottawa airport and to proceed directly to security inspection via
					 the airline staff entrance: (<i>a</i>) under what authority was this done;
					 (<i>b</i>) does this permission extend to the bypassing of the normal public
					 security lines at other airports in Canada; (<i>c</i>) does this permission
					 extend to all other ministers of the Crown; (<i>d</i>) does this permission
					 extend to members of the House who are not ministers; and (<i>e</i>) if not,
					 why not?</p><b>Mr. Marcel Proulx (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport, Lib.)</b>: <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to (a), air carriers may offer priority
					 service to Executive and VIP customers or passengers who are late for their
					 flight. No authority is required since this is a customer service provided by
					 air carriers and no bypassing of security occurs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerning (b), (c) and (d), as indicated in (a) above,
					 this practice does not involve bypassing security, and therefore, requires no
					 special authorities or permissions. Further questions with respect to each air
					 carrier’s customer service policy should be directed to the

					 investigation on a yearly basis for its duration; (<i>c</i>) what is the
					 financial cost related to the investigation on a yearly basis; (<i>d</i>) how
					 many transatlantic flights were taken by persons pursuing the investigation;
					 (<i>e</i>) were any payments made to informants for information provided to the

<center><b>Question No. 216--</b></center><b>Mr. Peter MacKay</b>:<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the April 22, 2003 closure of the Northern
					 Cod Fisheries in Zones 2J, 3K and 3L and the Gulf Fisheries in Zones 3P, 4R and
					 4S and the South Coast Fishery in Zone 3Ps, what measures has the government
					 taken to preserve cod stocks in Zones 3M and 3N, zones containing the nose and
					 tail of the Grand Banks and the Flemish Cap?</p><b>Hon. Robert Thibault (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.)</b>: <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cod stocks in the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries
					 Organization (NAFO) area, Division 3NO (Tail of the Grand Banks) and Division
					 3M (Flemish Cap), are under NAFO moratoria. Bycatches of these cod stocks in
					 fisheries directed at other stocks in the NAFO area are restricted to 5%. A new
					 definition of directed fishery was adopted at the 2002 NAFO annual meeting that
					 will help to deter vessels from exceeding this bycatch limit and reduce
					 bycatches of these stocks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the coastal state contracting party to NAFO, Canada
					 contributes to the development of conservation and management measures in the
					 regulatory area. These measures include 100% observer and satellite tracking
					 coverage on all vessels as well as mandatory dockside inspections for every
					 vessel fishing. Vessels fishing in the regulatory area are subject to
					 inspection by NAFO fisheries inspectors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All vessels fishing in the NAFO regulatory area are
					 also subject to strict conservation measures designed to promote effective
					 management of stocks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DFO continually monitors the activity of foreign
					 vessels in the regulatory area through the NAFO inspection program and analysis
					 of observer reports. It assesses vessel compliance within NAFO measures and
					 continues to highlight instances of non compliance by NAFO members in order to
					 reduce bycatches of moratoria species, misreporting and exceeding of
					 quotas.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not totally unaccustomed to making speeches that are interrupted and  resumed later.  Sometime in December four or five years ago I was giving a speech which was interrupted. When I resumed the speech the following December,  a year later, I started off by saying “When I was interrupted,  I was   saying” and I carried on. I shall do the same thing today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday I was speaking to the  motion that has been sent to us from the Senate.  I used to be an educator. I know  it is important to always review what has gone on before so that it sinks in a little better, so  for a quick review,  I was speaking  about the importance of the Senate being elected.  I spoke of the fact that we know of some senators who work diligently and hard and we have respect for them, but we would like to give them more respect by having them elected. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The senators have worked on Bill C-15  and they have sent one amendment.  That amendment, as I stated yesterday, is sort of a bookkeeping one.  It was something that was overlooked in this place.  It is  that the person who is registering as a lobbyist is required  also to state what the nature of his or her relationship was to the government earlier if they were a public office holder in their previous life.  I talked a little bit about that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I talked about the fact that it is not acceptable in our modern day and age that decisions as to what contract is let should be dependent in any way on a friend of the minister or deputy minister being able to schmooze, to smooth talk the person into choosing one contract over another. Those decisions should be made as objectively as possible based on the specifications for the contract and based on the value for the dollar. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know it is not always the lowest price tendered that is the best buy for the taxpayer. Just as when anyone of us  buys an appliance, we do not necessarily go only on the price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recently bought a microwave.  I do not know what happened but  my wife put something into the microwave which  fried the thing. It was more expensive to fix it than to buy a new one, so I bought a new one.  I did not go just on the lowest price.  It would have been a little, dinky thing that would have almost been invisible in the cupboard and would not have had the features.   I looked at what we wanted and  what we needed and I bought the best one for the dollar.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect government to do that as well. Whether it is buying helicopters or computers, it needs to study the issue and make sure that it gets the best value for the dollar on behalf of the taxpayer.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I notice that there are many people on the Liberal side of the House who are listening intently. They are not objecting at all to what I am saying. They agree fully with what I am saying.  There is no objection over there whatsoever.  That is because  they are all looking forward to a wonderful long speech by  the member for Elk Island.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a bit of a challenge here in the sense that I have unlimited time, as you correctly stated, Madam Speaker, when you allowed me to resume.  If I am going to speak longer than my colleague from Red Deer, who I think  holds the record in the House for the longest speech, which  I think was  some 33 hours,  I guess  I still have another 32 and a half hours to go before I have exceeded that.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am excited about the enthusiasm that is shown for the prospect of such a wonderful, long speech.  However, I think  it would probably be fair to others in the House to allow them also to make their statements, because in this particular case we are dealing with the amendment that has been sent by the Senate.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In as much as  it was an oversight and the individuals in the other place detected it and have sent back an amendment to correct it, I would recommend to all members of the House that we  support this particular amendment and  get it into the bill. Then we have the bill to deal with and undoubtedly, we will be giving some substantial speeches on that when it is finished. </p><A NAME="T1555"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1555"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1550"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1555)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are serious flaws with this whole  lobbyists thing. I would like to see the Lobbyists Registration Act changed so that not only is there disclosure, but certain activities would be precisely defined as being  not permitted. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would encourage the government in  the next revision of the Lobbyists Registration Act to strongly consider looking at some of the objections. As I said in my speech yesterday in terms of this little review that I am doing, we owe it to Canadian taxpayers and to Canadian voters to manage the affairs of government so that once again, after a dearth of 50 years or more, the people of Canada will be able to say that they  are proud to be Canadians and that they  are very happy with the thoroughness, the integrity and the high level of ethics with which their government business is done. That has been lacking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why in 1993 the Liberal government came in  with a pledge to have an independent ethics commissioner and to restore the concept of trust in our government. The Liberals ran on that platform. What have they done? Regrettably, they have not fulfilled that promise. We have, only now, some timid legislation moving us toward an independent ethics commissioner, but it still is inadequate in the sense that the individual will still be appointed by the Prime Minister. We would like to see that changed very substantially.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see the government's record of  a number of shenanigans, if we can call them that,  shenanigans from Shawinigate to Chicoutimi. There are  contracts that have been given for advertising, and the deals with the hotel involving the Prime Minister. That is so unfortunate. It ought not to be. We need rules and regulations in place precisely to prevent those things from happening. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a person such as  the Prime Minister or one of the ministers  does not have the built-in ethical antenna to prevent that kind of behaviour, then we need rules that will impose correct behaviour on them. Unfortunately, that is necessary. I propose that  we in Canada's Parliament move very quickly  to have that kind of a system so that, as I said,  Canadians will be able to say with sincerity “We trust our government. We know that occasionally it makes little mistakes, but the big mistakes should not happen and cannot be allowed to happen continuously”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members can tell, I would have very little difficulty carrying on in a further discussion, but I am aware that other members of the House are also interested in debating and therefore I will cede my time. I look forward to hearing what other members of the House have to say on this important topic.</p><A NAME="T1600"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1600"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1555"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1600)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-587166"></A><a HREF="#Int-587495"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-586826"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, Lib.): </b>Madam Speaker, you know how much I admire and respect the member for Elk Island and his prowess as a debater in the House, and with the regret that I must feel in telling you that he has spoken for nearly an hour on the issue before the House, this amendment, and he clearly has demonstrated he has not done any homework on the amendment.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never addressed what the amendment was all about and regrettably missed in his speech addressing an issue that is before the House, because of Bill C-15 and this amendment, that is vitally important on two fronts, and especially important to an opposition member.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have before us is the Senate improving an amendment that was brought in at report stage on the Lobbyists Registration Act by a government member, against government wishes, that was put in the House to a vote.  The government voted against it and backbench Liberal MPs joined with opposition MPs and passed that amendment.  I believe it was the first time in possibly more than a decade, if not longer, that an unfriendly amendment passed at report stage in the House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is so remarkable about what we have before us now is that this amendment amended the Lobbyists Registration Act to require that in-house lobbyists, when they registered with the registrar of lobbyists, had to declare whether  they were former public office holders.  It addressed an extremely important issue.  We are familiar with the high profile lobbyists who might have been former politicians, and they are usually obvious out there when they act as lobbyists and lobby the government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the problems in the lobbying industry, one of the problems of transparency, one of the problems of fairness has been the fact that sometimes mid-level bureaucrats, people who are relatively anonymous, leave their employment and within a year, which is according to the conflict of interest guidelines, suddenly appear as lobbyists and wind up lobbying the very people who were their former colleagues. The problem that arises when this occurs is that these people obviously have significant advantage when they lobby.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the difficulties in the industry and among people who hire lobbyists to lobby government, because lobbying government is a legitimate enterprise, and one of the problems is that if one company hires a lobbyist and another company hires a lobbyists and that second company hires a lobbyist that includes a person who formerly worked for the department in which the company is seeking a contract, then that particular company has a tremendous advantage. In order to even the playing field it should be made possible, and this was done by my  amendment, that anyone can refer to the list of lobbyists that is cut by the registrar of lobbyists to determine whether a person who is lobbying was a former office holder. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I point out that there is anecdotal evidence that this is a major problem in contracting out.  It has been a problem in the Department of National Defence.  Indeed, I acted on this issue because of complaints in my riding where I had a firm that was competing for a contract, a federal government defence contract, and after that contract was won by another firm, it discovered that other firm had employed a lobbyist who had been working with the very people who were deciding on the merits of which firm would get the contract and which would not.  Therefore, it was an unfair playing field.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately I was never able to bring this issue adequately before the committee.  I had reasons why I was unable to bring this issue before the committee at the committee  stage of debate on the lobbyist registration bill, so I introduced at the last moment a report stage amendment that would require in-house lobbyists to register as former office holders when they applied for registration to the registrar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, the point is this, and I regret that the member did not deal with it in his speech, is that I introduced the amendment and the government circulated a note to the effect that it did not support the amendment.   Nevertheless many of my colleagues on this side of the House and of course the opposition supported the amendment and it passed.</p><A NAME="T1605"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1605"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1600"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1605)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The really good news, and why the amendment that is before the House is so important from the Senate, is naturally the bill passed third reading and went to the Senate and the issue of this amendment came up. What was pointed out to the Senate committee that studied the lobbyists registration bill was that my amendment only dealt with in-house lobbyists and it did not deal with consultant lobbyists, the one being professional lobbyists and the other being people who would be hired by a firm and so employed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senators listened to debate from witnesses that argued for my amendment and the expansion of my amendment to consultant lobbyists and those who argued against.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Senators in their wisdom sided with my original intent and what they did was they composed an amendment of their own that brought in not only in-house lobbyists but included consultant lobbyists. I should add that they not only made this change and proposed this change in committee, they also convinced the minister.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister appeared before the committee, and we can read the Senate <i>Hansard</i> to see this. The Minister of Industry, having first opposed the amendment when I introduced it in the House, told the Senators that on reflection and based on the evidence that the Senators had heard from the various witnesses they dealt with, he now supported it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have now before the House is an amendment to the Lobbyists Registration Act that builds on the initiative of a backbench MP who used his opportunity, his privilege in the House to move an amendment, and got the support of his colleagues, got the support of the Senate and now it is before the House and will undoubtedly pass.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think what is so important to bear in mind here is the demonstration that backbench MPs on the government side and opposition MPs when they have a good amendment and can get the support of the House can get it into law.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more important than that I think, is the story I have just told is a fine demonstration of how the Senate, that other place, can work effectively. If we read the Senate <i>Hansard</i>, we will see that the Senators did due diligence and in one sense they did better due diligence on this issue than was done in this House. The result is an amendment that is before the House which increases the transparency and levels the playing field among lobbyists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say only one other thing. In fairness to my friend, the member for Elk Island, I share his feelings that much more work has to be done with the Lobbyists Registration Act. It is a very imperfect piece of legislation even as it stands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the reasons why I felt obligated to move an amendment of my own was because I did not feel that enough was being done to the legislation to strengthen it, to increase the level of transparency, to actually improve our ability as members of Parliament, as the media and as ordinary citizens to see not only who the lobbyists are but to see who are being lobbied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really lobbying is a legitimate enterprise as long as it is done openly, above board and with transparency. However what we also need very badly is to be able to see who, particularly in the lower levels of the bureaucracy, are being wined and dined with the intent to influence them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that while the lobbyists registration changes that are the entire package of Bill C-15 are an advancement, there is still a long way to go. In that sense I agree wholeheartedly with the member for Elk Island and some of the criticisms he presented in his speech. I only wish that he had dealt a little b with the amendments at hand because really, as they say in the media, it was truly a good news story.</p><A NAME="T1610"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1610"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1605"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1610)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-587495"></A><a HREF="#Int-587551"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-587166"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Richard Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Canadian Alliance): </b>Madam Speaker, I could not wait to get to my feet and point out to the hon. member that he was in error when he indicated the member for Elk Island spoke for an hour. In fact he spoke for 30 minutes.  I know it is kind of hard when one is a Liberal sitting on the other side of the House, hearing some reasoned opinions and some very logical and common sense opinions coming from the official opposition. The member for Elk Island is eminently equipped to make such pronouncements and statements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In support of that, the hon. member just spent the last 10 minutes basically concurring with what the member for Elk Island said. He talked about how the government had to start to make a concerted effort to get the best value for the money it was  spending overall. That is what the member just said and that is what the member for Elk Island said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I want to thank the hon. member  across the way for concurring with  my colleague. We certainly wish that member had  a ton of influence on his own party that type of attitude toward government procurement would prevail in that party. Unfortunately it does not and that gives my colleagues, particularly the member for Elk Island, ample material to be critical of how the government runs its operations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to thank the member opposite for supporting my colleague.  I also want to  thank my colleague for pointing out some very reasoned and logical opportunities for the government. We trust that the member opposite will aggressively encourage the government, his party, to adopt a lot or all the recommendations about which my colleague from Elk Island  talked.</p><A NAME="T1615"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1615"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1610"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1615)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-587551"></A><a HREF="#Int-587616"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-587495"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John Bryden: </b>I stand corrected, Madam Speaker,  about the time the member for Elk Island spoke. He spoke for half an hour. I can assure him it certainly felt like an hour. I would suggest that the reason why it felt like an hour was that there was very little in his speech that was actually substantial. Try as I might, I cannot remember, and I did listen the entire time, a single, clear suggestion that he made on how to improve the Lobbyists Registration Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I put to him that he could have said, for example, as  I did in committee when I proposed to the ethics counsellor, that mid-level bureaucrats keep a telephone log of all the lobbyists who make representations to them, and that telephone log would be available through access to information or any other means that would be available for the public to see who precisely, what lobbyists and what individuals in the bureaucracy, are being approached.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we well know that deputy ministers and assistant deputy ministers are approached by lobbyists and we well know that there are senior politicians and senior bureaucrats who become lobbyists. What we do not know is those people who are in the lower levels of bureaucracy, who are, shall we say, the nameless policy-makers, who may be approached by their colleagues who have become in-house lobbyists, who are also nameless. They get together and it is sort of a little old boys' school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have proposed that change. I think the first time I did it was in 1994. It was rejected by the government at the time and by the committee, I regret to say. I proposed it again when the bill came up for review recently. You know, Madam Speaker, you have to take the bones that are available to you, and I do believe that the government heard the message of the amendment, heard my colleagues who supported it, because the backbench MPs, the soldiers, shall we say, of democracy, are very aware that there is a problem in the lower levels of the bureaucracy, in the lower levels of the lobbying firms, and that it needs to be corrected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our job  here is to make those suggestions. The member for Elk Island had an opportunity to make a very clear suggestion like that, and I really regret I did not hear it. I am sure he has some other ideas of his own and maybe we will get a question from him.</p><A NAME="Int-587616"></A><a HREF="#Int-587664"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-587551"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance): </b>Madam Speaker, he should have listened.  Instead of repeating all the points I made, I simply invite him to read about a page and a half in <i>Hansard.</i> He will see that in fact  I did make a number of suggestions, including among other things that certain lobbyists' activities should not only be made transparent, they should actually be made illegal. It is wrong for an ex-MP to come in here and smooth-talk the minister or the deputy minister with whom he has had intimate relationships, if we can say that, in terms of communication and so on, and to then use that relationship in order to bend the decision making. That should actually be against the rules, in my view. It is not useful to getting the taxpayers their money's worth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also believe, if I  myself am not mistaken in my recollection of what I said, that I made other suggestions. I also gave the hon. member, indirectly at least, some accolades for having put forward this motion, and I did say that the Senate had done something that should have been done on this side, precisely the same as he just mentioned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the hon. member on one hand said that the member for Elk Island did not say anything substantial in his speech, he said a lot of the  exact same things, so should I now say his speech was not substantial? I would not want to do that. He is an honourable member, I like him, I like what he said, and I would encourage him to continue the good work over there. I know he is very lonesome over there with the Liberals, trying to bring more integrity into government operations, so I wish him well in that continued work. He will not be out of a job for quite a while.</p><A NAME="Int-587664"></A><a HREF="#Int-587688"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-587616"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John Bryden: </b>Madam Speaker, I thank the member and again I stand corrected. Obviously there was a lot of content in what the member said, but I regret that it was, shall we say, spread out in such a long period of time that perhaps it was just somewhat difficult to grasp all of his tremendous points as readily as I might have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is simply my failure. I realize that he is a very well qualified speaker in this place, but try as I might, it is hard to recover the content of his speech of the other day. I will return to <i>Hansard,</i> look up exactly what he said and take note of it, but I suspect it will not be a page and a half of <i>Hansard.</i> I suspect it will be about four pages of <i>Hansard.</i></p><A NAME="T1620"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1620"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1625"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1615"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1620)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-587688"></A><a HREF="#Int-587723"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-587664"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Richard Harris: </b>Madam Speaker, all rhetoric aside, the fact remains that these Liberals unfortunately have been in power now for almost 10 years. When they arrived, this mess was predominant. The very same situation we are talking about today in which we are trying to make some changes was predominant and in fact it was overwhelming the system. That was almost 10 years ago. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has had 10 years to clean up the deficiencies in the system. In spending the taxpayers' money, the Government of Canada and the people in the bureaucracies who have the power to make decisions and make purchases have had 10 years to clean up the deficiencies in that process and they have not done it. That is what is so upsetting. It is as if the government has considered it a very low priority while all over the country taxpayers have been crying out for years for the governments of the day to recognize taxpayers' money not as their money but as a sacred trust, money that belongs to the taxpayers of Canada, and saying that governments had a responsibility to provide the most fiscally responsible management of that money that they possibly could. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 10 years we have not seen that. That is why we in the opposition and my colleague from Elk Island welcome opportunities like today's to be critical of the government but at the same time to search out members opposite, like the member from Ancaster, who such a long riding name  I cannot remember all of it, and to encourage him and members who think like he does and like we do, to put as much possible pressure on their government and the powers that  be in the cabinet that they possibly can. I want to commend the member for his aggressiveness and I hope it will be infectious throughout the backbench members of the Liberal government.</p><A NAME="Int-587723"></A><a HREF="#Int-587740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-587688"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John Bryden: </b>I will just point out in reply, Madam Speaker, that I know the opposition made no effort to make amendments in committee and made no effort to make amendments at report stage.  In fact, Bill C-15 breezed through committee with hardly any comments or obstacles.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I would say to the member opposite that I am willing to serve, I am willing to do the role of the opposition, but it is lonely here when it takes a Liberal backbench MP to criticize his government and the opposition is silent.</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-587740"></A><a HREF="#Int-587909"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-587723"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </b>Madam Speaker, I simply wanted to say that I found the discussion between my colleagues from the Canadian Alliance  and the Liberal party over the last 30 minutes very interesting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot just said that the opposition did not propose any amendments. He must have meant that the Canadian Alliance did not propose any amendments, because the Bloc Quebecois moved a number of them. He should be careful not to generalize when using the word opposition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did some very serious work on Bill C-15. I also wanted to come back to an idea raised by the member for Elk Island. He mentioned that it might be important for senators to be elected. I would like to use this opportunity to say that one way we could significantly limit the influence of lobbyists on Parliament Hill, and this brings me to the position of the Bloc Quebecois on the Senate, is to simply abolish the institution. That is what we propose. I think that that would put about a hundred lobbyists out of work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Senators have direct access to ministers and members of Parliament. There have been blatant examples over the years. Senators are often called in to move issues forward with the government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have before us today is a simple amendment that comes to us courtesy of the Senate, an amendment we support. However, with respect to Bill C-15 as a whole, we are pretty dissatisfied with how things have turned out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We proposed amendments and we provided solid  arguments to support them. The members opposite often tells us, “Propose amendments, that is the procedure, that is how we proceed in the House”. However, what we have often seen is systematic rejection of all  amendments . In fact, the government always has a majority in committee. When the word comes from on high, even if an amendment is excellent and even if we provide solid arguments to support it, the dice are often loaded and the amendments are rejected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to clarify my longstanding view, one that I continue to hold, about the parliamentary system, and how a society has to work in terms of elections, and how elected officials must work, once they have been elected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is somewhat familiar with how an election campaign works. The various parties that are contending for power present their platforms. There are people on a team, under a same banner, led by someone that everyone knows, who is the leader of the party. These people  present their vision for society to the voters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The campaign lasts a certain amount of time and in the end a government is elected. This government tries to stick to its platform, which does not always happen and is why there is such cynicism among the public. The government often has to say, “I am dropping this, I am giving up that. I have looked at the state of public finances and I have to say that at this time I can no longer do what I promised.” This is often what happens and what causes people to become cynical.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is more to it than that. If we look at the truly positive side of those who are in power, those who have been elected in our society, in my view they have very important responsibilities. They represent the public. They are the ones who have been chosen by the public to run the nation, to manage taxes and to make sure that bills are introduced and that society progresses. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone is somewhat familiar with the composition of the government. There is the cabinet—commonly referred to as the executive—that has the responsibility of planning, through its bills, how it will adhere to its platform and how it wants to move  society forward, since it was elected by the public. This is a very important first level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If these people can be influenced, they can decide how and in what order bills are introduced. There is a lot at stake. One must never lose sight of the fact that the government, whether at the executive or legislative level, is there to serve the public.</p><A NAME="T1625"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1625"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1625)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If that were the case with the current government, things  might be okay, but as we exercise our profession of member here, we realize that it is not the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the executive is very important. In this respect, the Prime Minister's Office is very important, too, because it gives some impetus to the cabinet and it is often the PMO that will say to the government House leader, “We would like you to introduce these types of bills in the following order”. After that, the House leader does his or her work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we come to the legislative branch. Once the executive, the cabinet, has decided  on the content and order of introduction of the bills, the bills go through various readings in the House: first, second and third. There is an intermission between second and third reading, at which time a committee studies the bill more thoroughly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that stage, too, the legislator can be a victim or can have contact with all kinds of people. Sometimes he or she is in contact with people who appear as witnesses before the committees, and who defend a certain point of view. In this regard, we, the legislators, must have a clear idea of the kind of services we want for society. We also have to learn how to handle the various representations made to us. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone knows the judicial authority. It has a special power in a society. After the executive and legislative have legislated, if there are any grey areas, the judiciary must intervene. Its representatives are better protected than we are because of judicial restraint. I think a lobbyist would have a big problem if he went to a Supreme Court Justice and said, “I want to meet with you to convince you to render a decision in a particular way”. In principle, this is not done. It is impossible, because of judicial restraint, and that is a good thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also the whole question of the power of the media.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Speaker, I believe the alarm has just gone off.</p>

<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-588141"></A><a HREF="#Int-588253"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-588136"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </b>Madam Speaker,  just now, my hon. colleague from Elk Island was saying that an entire year went by before he could finish his speech. I probably hold the record for having my speech interrupted five or ten minutes by a fire alarm. That is always fun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know if my subject was too hot, but I was explaining the importance of the various levels of government and talking about the power of the media. I do not think that lobbyists will convince journalists because, given their ethics and their code of conduct, they cannot do this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of these famous lobbyists is known, but some facts are needed to understand how they proceed. The fact that Bill C-15 has come back to the House with amendments from the Senate shows that it took some effort. However, over the years, these people have wielded undeniable power. Clearly, those earning $300,000 or $400,000 per year to  lobby must provide results and their employers must ensure that they benefit from this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has somewhat distorted the democratic process in the House of Commons. This happens elsewhere too, probably in other Parliaments around the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we could talk about lobbyists forever, but also about political party financing, which is also a major problem. Those who contribute the most to federal parties' campaign funds are probably the ones best able to hire the most competent and most expensive lobbyists. That is where the problem lies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, it is not surprising to see, when it comes to bills that interest the ten biggest contributors to the Liberal Party, a certain number of lobbyists are involved, trying to win the government over. If the bill seeks a reform that goes against the interests of these donors, the lobbyists try to convince the government to change its approach and protect the company for which they work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, this creates a number of distortions. I think that the average citizen does not have the same power as the President of Bell Canada or the lobbyist hired by Bell Canada. This, to some extent, circumvents the democratic workings of Parliament, both with regard to the executive branch, where the ministers and the Prime Minister can be subject to pressure or have meetings with lobbyists, and with regard to backbenchers like us. Obviously, we are sometimes solicited by lobbyists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes people talk about getting together for a meal but nothing ever comes of it. However, lobbyists often take it one step further and say, “When you organize a cocktail party, would you like us to help?” One thing leads to another and if they are not careful, people get caught in situations that are not democratic in our society and they empower lobbyists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were  disappointed by this bill. We will support the bill, as amended by the Senate, but our problem is that Bill C-15, as a whole, does not suit us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said at the beginning of my speech, we put forward many amendments that were defeated. Among other things, there is the obligation to disclose meetings with officials and ministers. There are officials such as deputy ministers or senior officials, who can become victims of lobbyists. When I say victim, I mean they can become influenced by these individuals and become convinced that such and such a bill or policy could be detrimental.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If they were required to disclose the names of ministers they meet with or the fact that they met with the Prime Minister, this would give us a primary indication of the people who rub shoulders with ministers, the Prime Minister or senior officials in a department. This could alert us to what is going on and allow us to better control the situation. The amendments we put forward to address this were defeated. </p><A NAME="T1655"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1655"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1655)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as disclosing the amounts devoted to lobbying, everyone listening will understand that a $4,000 lobby campaign is not the same as a $400,000 one.   The latter will be far more intensive.  Moreover, in the bill this is referred to as  the intensity of the lobby—that is what we called it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is certain that, if  a lobbyist is paid $400,000 a year and has a $4 million budget at his disposal for a campaign—and this is a plausible figure because there are some among the top 10 contributors to the Liberal Party who can afford that—understandably, the lobbying can be intense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher the figure,  the more the lobbyist is paid, the more it is felt that there will be pressures on the government, departmental officials, ministers, the Prime Minister or MPs, in order to sell their idea, block a reform, or change it in such as way that it will not affect the organization for which he works. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is, therefore, an important point for us, and the reason we introduced our amendments.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as disclosure of the amounts is concerned, this too was turned down.  Another point that could be addressed—and which I touched upon here—is lobbyists' fees.   There are often differences. Lobbyists can be consultants or paid lobbyists.  Some have an annual salary.  Understandably, if one person earns $40,000 and another $400,000, this affects the intensity of the promotion campaign or lobbying that is carried out.  Once again, this has been dropped from the bill.  It is not there. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there are the fees with strings attached, about which there have been scandals.  We had the sponsorship scandal in which certain companies could get back a percentage of what was going to be charged to the government. This too was turned down.   It is not in the bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the disclosure by lobbyists of their positions, it is also important to know which person on a list of lobbyists has held a high-level position in the federal administration.  These are, unfortunately, all things that were left out of the bill.  Today we find ourselves dealing with a totally wishy-washy bill that does not provide  what is needed to protect society. This is most unfortunate.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had examples, like the sponsorship scandal I just mentioned. There is also another aspect. I am the defence critic for my party, and hon. members should see all the lobbying going on for the replacement of the Sea Kings. There are many lobbyists representing various companies. Four big consortiums have submitted proposals to the government. Members should see what these lobbyists are focusing on. Even if I am only a backbencher, I often meet with these people,  and they tell me, “You know, our approach is the best. Our proposal is the best    overall”. All these people are moving in our circles and the ministers' circles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is strategic air transport. The government indicated it needs aircraft to transport troops to any theatre of operations around the world. So, the number of aircraft required  is being considered. All major strategic air transport companies are  consulting together and hiring people to meet with us, sometimes to appear   before us and to convince us that Boeing or Airbus, for example, is the best option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lobbying causes a great deal of distortion. As I said earlier, it is unfortunate that the amendments we proposed were all defeated. Certainly, the amendment coming back from the Senate fosters a bit more transparency.   It will ensure that people who have held senior management positions in government are required to provide some background. This will give a better idea of where they are coming from and probably where they are going as well. This is the kind of thing  we would have liked to see expanded on in the bill. Unfortunately, it was not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are even lobbyists being hired by the Prime Minister now. </p><A NAME="T1700"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1700"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1655"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1700)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier I mentioned the Sea King example. The Prime Minister's office hired a lobbyist to advise him on the matter. It was a lobbyist from Eurocopter, which provoked a great deal of mistrust among government officials because the individual was working in the Prime Minister's office. I do not know if he is still there because this goes back about two years ago now. This person worked for Eurocopter, one of the consortiums bidding on the Sea King contract two years ago, and he was brought into the Prime Minister's office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it is easy to understand all of the mystery surrounding lobbyists. How many are there? What do they do? How much are they paid? Whom do they meet? None of this is taken into account in the bill, and all of the amendments were rejected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not take issue with the amending act from the Senate. It will add transparency; however, we would definitely have liked to see much more transparency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to have had this opportunity to express my views. I know I was interrupted by an alarm, but I feel that, like my colleague, the member for Elk Island,  I was able to summarize my thoughts. I am now ready to answer questions from my colleagues.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-588253"></A><a HREF="#Int-588286"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-588141"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance): </b>Madam Speaker, I want to respond to something the member said early on in his speech before our little outdoor break.  In his opening statements he commented on  the Senate and said that  it was his view that the Senate ought to be abolished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to add a little light to the argument against that,  I would like to point out to him that one of the big grievances that we have in the outlying areas of this country, whether it is Newfoundland and Labrador, the Atlantic provinces or way out west where we come from, is that we are totally electorally overrun by the huge majority in Ontario and Quebec. We have a lot of respect for them  and, yes,  in this House we have representation by population, but the fact is that when there is an election 60% of the members of Parliament come from those two provinces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We currently have 301 members  and I believe 178 of them come from Ontario and Quebec.  We think that if the Confederation is to work smoothly, and for those of us in the outlying regions being defined as outside of Ontario and Quebec, we need  some way to balance that power, which is where a triple E Senate would come in.  It  would have an equal number of senators from each province, or at least from each region, and   they would be  elected to give them legitimacy. However right  now bills cannot become law unless they pass both Houses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We  could even have some other rules  engaged there.  However   if it is a good rule or a good law that is being proposed, I think  the senators, who would represent all  the provinces equally, would agree to those laws because they would be  good for the country. If there were a deliberate attempt, as we have seen on numerous occasions, by  the central Canada government to  ride roughshod over those of us in the more distant regions, a triple E Senate  would provide a good balance of power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason we are   promoting the continuation of the Senate  is to improve it by making it equal and by making it elected so that it can actually do its work.  We would still have  population representation here in the House of Commons and Ontario and Quebec would continue, we expect, to dominate this place.</p><A NAME="T1705"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1705"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1705)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

It is true that one could discuss the Senate at length, and whether or not it should be elected. For our part, we suggest abolishing it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he is looking for equity in votes and in the way  power is exercised, we think it is not necessarily attainable through the Senate, since an elected Senate will cause other kinds of problems I would like to tell him about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There would be a certain division and overlap of powers. I am a Bloc Quebecois member from the riding of Saint-Jean and if there were a senator who was not from my party—from any party at all, if he is not with the Bloc—he would always contradict me in some way: me, the elected member. He could neutralize some of my authority. Things are no better if you create constant dissension between the elected senator and the elected member for the riding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I were in his place, I would be working instead for proportional representation in the House of Commons. It is true that under our system the person with the most votes is elected. We have seen some situations, for example, such as in 1997 when the Progressive Conservative Party received more than  20% of the votes, but only had two members in the House of Commons. That is a problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully agree that people should be free to discuss the ways a vote coming from British Columbia could be equivalent to a vote coming from Ontario. It might be possible to do this with proportional representation, or in combination with another model; it could also follow the current model. The Canadian people could elect someone based on the proportion of votes received. There are many ways to do it. It is a debate that is going on in Quebec at present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, to go from there to saying we could now elect the Senate, which would compete with the elected members of the House of Commons, I have a problem with that, although I am always ready to discuss it with my hon. colleague when the occasion arises.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-588303"></A><a HREF="#Int-588329"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-588286"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I certainly want to assure the House that of all MPs in the opposition, the member for Saint-Jean leads in his concern for transparency and accountability, and he has been active on that file in many ways.  His very presence  in the House on this debate on the amendments to the Lobbyists Registration Act is an indication of his passionate desire to further legislation that calls for transparency, not just to make the Government of Canada operate more efficiently but to ensure that the Government of Canada leads the world in terms of transparency and accountability.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the member for Elk Island, the member for Saint-Jean and myself would agree that while Bill C-15 has brought in some improvements to the Lobbyists Registration Act, they fall far, far short of what could be done, and I think all three of us will continue to campaign to get the government to bring in better amendments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to comment very briefly on the issue of the Senate and direct a question to the member for Saint-Jean on that issue.  I certainly do not agree with abolishing the Senate.  I have great reservations, as the member for Saint-Jean has, on having an elected body because if the Senate were an elected body, then it would greatly diminish the power and authority of the House of Commons and it would make it eminently more difficult to do business as Parliament.  We would have to have a separately elected president as they have in the United States to have two elected houses if we were going to have a workable situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the member for Saint-Jean, if he suggests that the Senate be abolished, why would we even be here debating today because the Senate has addressed an amendment, it has improved upon that amendment, an amendment by a backbench MP, and has returned it to the House.  I would submit that the Senate has done a very fine job, at least in this instance.</p><A NAME="T1710"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1710"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1715"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1705"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1710)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-588329"></A><a HREF="#Int-588348"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-588303"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Claude Bachand: </b>Mr. Speaker,  I too would like to congratulate my hon. colleague from Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot for seeking transparency; he is clearly concerned about this concept. The excellent work he has done with regard to access to information shows too that he is concerned about this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, he is talking about the example before us today. Even if we recommend abolishing the Senate, it has not been abolished. There are currently two Houses, and the Upper House considers all the bills from the House of Commons. Sometimes, the Senate returns the bills with amendments, as is the case today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I say that we want to abolish the Senate, this raises another discussion about whether having two Houses is mandatory. Some countries have a second House, others do not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have faith in the elected representatives of the people. Those sitting in the House of Commons are elected, they are invested with electoral and  democratic powers by the voters, who are responsible for putting us here. I think that if they have put their trust in us, we could, at the least, consider in full all of these bills, without submitting them to the consideration of a second House.  We have sufficiently debated them in committees and elsewhere to make this kind of amendment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no obligation, today, to adopt the Senate's amendment. The House could say that it does not consent and that would be the end of it. So, in terms of the second House, we are prepared to discuss the matter because, as things currently stand, senators are appointed by the Prime Minister, and as I was saying earlier, there are some one hundred lobbyists in the Upper House currently. Should it be desirable to get rid of some of them, it might be a good opportunity to say that we are abolishing the Senate. But I am interested in continuing this discussion with my hon. colleague on this matter.</p><A NAME="Int-588348"></A><a HREF="#Int-588357"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-588329"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Serge Marcil (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I have heard what my colleague from Saint-Jean has said.  In a way, he is not wrong, but even one of the  greatest sovereignists in Quebec, Mr. Lebrun, has described the Canadian parliamentary system as the finest parliamentary system there is.  Churchill said that, while not perfect,  there was nothing better. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all countries, be it France, England, the United States, Canada, any of the major countries, there is a second chamber.  There is a reason for this.  I was one of those who questioned senatorial appointments.  I would likely prefer to see them elected rather than appointed, except that I do see the Senate as having a role to play.  It is the one to balance things out for the regions, compared to the House. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quebec can elect 75 members, and Ontario 101.  For Prince Edward Island and the west, however, the situation is a bit different.  Thus its role becomes more important, but the role of those who  are in the Senate should be that of wise men and women.  Perhaps there ought not to be any partisanship when senators are appointed; perhaps they would need to be appointed the same way judges are.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this instance, I find that the amendment proposed by the Senate is justified.  It is one, moreover, that had been raised by an Alliance MP at the time, and the Senate reworked it.  The senators found a flaw and have proposed this amendment, which is totally in order today.  </p><A NAME="Int-588357"></A><a HREF="#Int-588365"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-588348"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Claude Bachand: </b>Mr. Speaker, I do not want to persist with my colleague from Beauharnois—Salaberry on the purpose of the amendment before us because we support it. Nor do  I want to engage in a big debate on the Senate either. I do not think that was the purpose of the amendment. However, I am still interested in continuing this discussion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, senators are appointed on a partisan basis by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister does not appoint many people who are not Liberals. At present, the equity that my colleague speaks of does not exist. There are 28 Progressive Conservative senators and the rest are all Liberals, except for a few independents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I maintain my argument that the Senate should be abolished and that perhaps there should be a review of how to restore the balance of power with  election to the House of Commons under a system of proportional representation.</p><A NAME="T1715"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1715"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1710"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1715)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

It has been very interesting to listen to the comments by the members. I especially was interested in the comment by the member for Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot who said that it would be better if the government brought forth better amendments. The very distinguished member for Saint John and I were just talking about these amendments.  Right now we think perhaps there is another that could be made to the registration act, and that would be an amendment to include ministers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the member for Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot would support this amendment if we were to move it. Therefore we will talk about it right now and see where it goes. It ties in with another subject we have been talking about and that is the softwood lumber issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, the Minister for International Trade recently put on the table in Washington an offer with which hardly anyone in Canada agreed.   We do not know where it came from and why the offer was put forth because we cannot identify who the minister was representing. He should be representing Canadians, the Canadian provinces and the softwood lumber association but we have a hard time finding out exactly from where this came.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps an amendment should be considered to ensure that ministers, if they were to lobby on behalf of a private sector or something like that, should have to register.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister talked about a Team Canada approach and working together with a unified program and everything, but we cannot find who he is representing.  We would like to know who he represents.  Perhaps this should come under an amendment to the Lobbyists Registration Act so ministers, if they did happen to represent someone else, should have to register.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister often stands up and says that they  represent the regions. He has often said that they represent the Maritimes because it wants them to do certain things. However recently it  became very clear that he did not represent the Maritimes. Four Atlantic provinces wrote a letter to him dated May 30, just days ago, about his proposal to drag Atlantic Canada into the quota system for softwood lumber. The four Atlantic premiers said:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Certain of Canada's actions have ignored the conditions specific to the region, and have thus been contrary to Atlantic Canadian interests</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would think that the minister would represent interests of all regions. Therefore we wonder who he is representing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the premiers go on to say:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The most recent, and possibly most serious, of these actions is the unilateral offer made on May 23 by the Government of Canada to the United States. This offer includes Atlantic Canada with the rest of Canada in a two-year interim arrangement, where we would be restricted by a tariff rate quota.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have never had tariff rate quotas and the four Atlantic premiers are saying that they do not  agree with what the minister is doing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will explore this more. The minister is not obviously representing Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia or Prince Edward Island because the premiers have all signed a letter to him just days ago saying, “Don't do this”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, we do not know who the minister is representing.  The letter goes on to say that this unilateral Canadian offer is unacceptable to both industry and government. Therefore the minister does not represent the industry in Atlantic Canada.  We have to hone in on whom he is representing because we really do not know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has said in the media that he represents the Maritime Lumber Bureau and he is acting on its behalf. That is strange because the Maritime Lumber Bureau just wrote  him a letter on May 29, just days ago, and sent a copy to all the Atlantic ministers and most of the MPs. This letter could not be clearer. It states, “We were excluded from the quota system and we must again be excluded from any attempt to allocate quota”. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is diametrically opposite to what the minister is trying to do. He is trying to drag Atlantic Canada into the quota system. Therefore I guess he does not represent the Maritime Lumber Bureau.  He said he did.  He said that he was asked to work on behalf of the Maritime Lumber Bureau and speak on its behalf, but based on this letter from the Maritime Lumber Bureau, it appears that he does not represent it. Therefore we still have not found out who the minister represents in this case.  </p><A NAME="T1720"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1720"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1725"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1715"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1720)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just spoke to the Maritime Lumber Bureau in Fredericton at its annual meeting. The directors passed a motion authorizing the executive of the Maritime Lumber Bureau to take whatever action is necessary to prevent the government from going ahead with the offer that was  tabled in Washington, for some strange reason on behalf of someone who we still have not found yet. A motion was tabled at the Maritime Lumber Bureau's annual general meeting which  says that the executive is  authorized  to take whatever action is necessary,  through liaison or action with  members of Parliament, or just lobbying, or whatever the law allows. The directors of the Maritime Lumber Bureau are authorizing the executive to take legal action against the government to redress this situation where the government has put an offer on the table in Washington with which  nobody in Atlantic Canada agrees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is not Atlantic Canada, maybe he represents the people from Alberta. Amazingly enough to me, we have a copy of a letter that the Alberta Softwood  Lumber Trade Council sent to the minister which says that the people in Alberta  absolutely oppose this offer. They  are against it completely, for different reasons than Atlantic Canada, but they are against this quota system which  drags them into the system again. Again, the Minister for International Trade obviously is not representing the people of Alberta.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</b> Who is he representing?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Bill Casey:</b> That is the thing. We do not know who he is representing. That is a good question. We do not know who he is representing. That is what we are trying to explore here and find out. If he is only representing a small number of companies, then perhaps he should be registered under the Lobbyists Registration Act, so that we know who he is representing. He does not represent the people of Atlantic Canada. He does not represent the governments of Atlantic Canada. He does not represent the people from Alberta. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe he represents the people from British Columbia. But no, yesterday in the newspaper, the British Columbia minister of forests, Mike de Jong, said that B.C. wants no part of the proposed Canadian quota scheme aimed at resolving the softwood lumber trade war with the United States. Mr. de Jong said that he has told Ottawa that British Columbia is not interested in that deal, period. He went on to say that he will not support a new Canadian plan to resolve the lumber dispute if it involves a return to the quota system. He said  that he has concerns not so much about what is being discussed at this stage, but about what it might lead to. The article went   on and on. He said  all kinds of things. There are a host of problems that emerge when trying to assign quotas based on historical quotas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have just gone through six of the ten provinces. I do not know what the other provinces are saying. They have not said yes or no, but strangely enough today, I asked the minister in question period if he would stand and name just one province that supports what he is doing. He said he has a team Canada approach, that he has wide support, that he is in consultation with all the provinces and all the industries and all the associations. I asked him to  name just one. I asked him to name one province. I asked him to name one association. He did not name one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe it is the business community, but holy mackerel, here is a letter dated June 2 from the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, which   represents 105,000 small and medium size businesses. The federation  took the time to write to that very minister on June 2 to say that over 1,200 of its members operate businesses in the logging and forestry services and wood products businesses. Its members also totally oppose the offer that somehow was put on the table in Washington. The Canadian Federation of Independent Business took the time to write to say that it does not want to be part of that and the 1,200 businesses that it represents and the thousands and thousands of employees do not want the government to do this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another thing  and that is the way it evolved and the way it happened.  At 4:30 on the afternoon of Wednesday, May 21, the Minister for International Trade met with representatives of the governments of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, P.E.I. and Newfoundland, and also representatives from the Maritime Lumber Bureau, for a briefing and an update on the negotiations. There was not a word about the offer which was dated the very next day, Thursday, May 22, which dragged everybody from across the country into the quota system and took away the exemption that Atlantic Canada has had for 17 years. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a word was said. On  Wednesday afternoon  they had a meeting and on Thursday, the minister, or the department, sprung this proposal on everybody. Before they did that,  before they told anybody, they  took it down to the U.S. Then on Saturday, the government called and told one industry in Atlantic Canada about this. That was the first word they had.</p><A NAME="T1725"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1725"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1720"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1725)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just imagine how you would feel, Mr. Speaker, if you sat in this room thinking you were being treated fairly, having   gone  to all the trouble of coming  here from Atlantic Canada to be briefed by the minister himself and not being told what the government was  going to do the very next day.  They were kept in the dark totally about what  the government was going to do the next day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister has also broken trust with the industry and the governments in Atlantic Canada.  I cannot imagine why the government presented this proposal, which again drags Atlantic Canada into the quota system and takes away the  exemption it has  had for 17 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Maritime Lumber Bureau spent millions of dollars and spent years negotiating this with the United States.  They never  have accepted a cent of government money.  They did it all themselves.  Yet the government has  put  this proposal on the table  which   takes away the 17 years of hard  work and millions of dollars by the Atlantic Canadian industry, with no consultation, no input, no opportunity to object.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I do not know who the minister is representing.Today the minister has been  quoted in the newspapers.  He is saying things that we cannot nail down.   If we find out who he is representing, perhaps we should move an amendment and have him register under the Lobbyists Registration Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's <i>Edmonton Journal</i> quotes him as saying: </p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Our team Canada approach is very solid.  We don't have to be in total agreement on every comma.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not about commas, and there is no agreement.  He says that we have agreement,  that  our team Canada is very solid. Team Canada is completely split.  He is going one way and  six of the ten provinces are going exactly diametrically the opposite way.  There is no team Canada.  There is no unified approach.  There is no agreement on this.  In fact there is more disagreement by far than there is agreement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he is saying that he is representing team Canada, it just is not true.  Again, we are still trying to find out whom he represents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we come east.  In an article in the <i>Halifax Chronicle Herald</i>  he said: </p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The Maritime [Lumber] Bureau has also asked us  to work on their behalf.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Maritime Lumber Bureau said  exactly the opposite.  The Maritime Lumber Bureau said “We want the minister to do the opposite of what he is  doing” and he stands in the House or says in the media that he is acting on behalf of the Maritime Lumber Bureau.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Maritime Lumber Bureau said just a couple of days ago, on May 29, in a letter addressed to the minister “We were excluded from quota and we must again be excluded from any attempt to allocate quota”. But he, all by himself, or his department, went  down to Washington and put on the table down there, without asking anybody, a proposal that drags everybody back into the quota system,  exactly against the wishes of the Maritime Lumber Bureau.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to ask ourselves, where is the team he talks about?  Where is the unified position?  He talks about everybody being together and representing everybody, but I cannot find out whom he represents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not represent the people in Nova Scotia. They have said so.  He does not represent the people in New Brunswick, as the very distinguished member for  Saint John has pointed out.  He does not represent Prince Edward Island.  He does not represent Newfoundland, as the very distinguished member for St. John's East pointed out to me a minute ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He does not represent any of the governments and he does not represent the industry. They have all said  that they want to go in a different direction than the one the minister is going in. He does not represent Alberta. He does not represent British Columbia. Who does he represent?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deal was  written on May 22.  It was given to the Americans on Friday, May 23.  On the following Monday, I met with the minister to  ask why he would do this. Why would they table such a proposal which sabotaged 17 years of work by the Maritime Lumber Bureau and the entire Atlantic industry?  He said that it really was not a government proposal, that it was  transmitted on behalf of the industry.  I  said that it was  not the industries that I know of because they are totally opposed to this.  He said  that  it was the five major companies.  I think it was five; he either said five or six,  I do not recall exactly.  He said it was either the five or six major companies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he is not representing the people, if he is not representing the governments of the provinces, if he is not representing the softwood lumber industries, perhaps he should register under the Lobbyists Registration Act.  Perhaps we should move that amendment.</p><A NAME="T1730"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1730"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1735"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1725"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1730)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-588674"></A><a HREF="#Int-588543"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-588365"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair): </b>I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member.

It fixes some essential procedures here in the House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Surrey Central has worked tirelessly on behalf of his constituents and for the people of Canada to bring a greater degree of democratic accountability to the House of Commons. He has spent many long hours in the House and in various committees in the pursuit of parliamentary reform.  This bill is a product of his experience and hard work as co-chair of the scrutiny of regulations committee. It should be given very careful consideration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the bill is to provide for a disallowance procedure for statutory instruments or delegated pieces of legislation which are more commonly known as regulations. Disallowance is one of the traditional means for a legislature to oversee the creation of regulations. A disallowance procedure would give parliamentarians an opportunity to reject a statutory instrument made by a delegate of Parliament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is significant to note that 20% of laws in Canada stem from legislation debated and passed by Parliament. The remaining 80% of laws are made up of regulations. As opposed to legislation, regulations receive virtually no debate in the House of Commons or Senate. There is no public input or study and there is no media scrutiny.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Standing Joint Committee for  the Scrutiny of Regulations carries out the only scrutiny, which is very limited, of regulations in Parliament. This committee, although generally misunderstood, is an essential watchdog protecting democracy, controlling bureaucracy, and holding the government to account. The committee does not judge regulations on the basis of policy matter, general merit or necessity. Its study of regulations is instead limited to the questions of validity and legality. Members follow uniform and clearly defined criteria in their examination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the joint committee agrees that a regulation should be revoked, it makes a report to the House of Commons containing a resolution to the effect that a regulation or part thereof should be revoked. Once that report is tabled in the House the applicable procedure will depend on a decision by the responsible minister. Unfortunately, the current disallowance procedure is seriously defective. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The procedure currently practised resulted from a recommendation of the special committee on reform of the House of Commons back in 1986. Before that time there was no general disallowance procedure in place at the federal level in Canada. The government of the day placed the disallowance procedure in the Standing Orders with the intention it would remain there on an experimental and temporary basis until such time as a decision could be made to its effectiveness. If successful, it was the intention of the government to implement a statutory procedure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last 16 years we have seen the effectiveness of having a so-called temporary disallowance procedure, but still nothing has been done to give it a statutory footing. The current procedure, because it is contained in the Standing Orders, limits the possibility of disallowance to the statutory instruments that are made by the governor in council or by ministers of the Crown. As a result, the considerable body of delegated legislation created, for example, by the CRTC, the Canadian Transportation Agency or the National Energy Board is not subject to the disallowance procedure provided in the Standing Orders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All members would agree that it is desirable that all statutory instruments subject to review by Parliament under the Statutory Instruments Act be subject to disallowance. There is no reason why a regulation made by the governor in council or a minister can be disallowed by Parliament while a regulation made by some other delegate of Parliament cannot.</p><A NAME="T1735"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1735"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1730"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1735)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another defect of the current procedure is that it relies on the cooperation of the governor in council or the minister concerned to carry out a disallowance after the House of Commons has ordered it.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In itself, an order of the House of Commons cannot effect the revocation of a regulation.  The authority that made a disallowed regulation must still formally intervene in order to revoke that regulation following the creation of a disallowance order. While the House could deal with the matter as one of contempt, there are no other legal sanctions or even consequences that arise from a failure to comply with the disallowance order.  An order of the House of Commons that a particular regulation be revoked is not binding on the author of the regulation and cannot be enforced by a court. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Placing the disallowance procedure on a statutory footing, as this bill recommends, would remove the need for a regulation making authority to take subsequent action to give effect to an order of this House, thus eliminating the potential for conflict between Parliament and the executive.  The procedure would also be made more efficient as there would no longer be a need for the House of Commons to address an order of the cabinet ordering the revocation of a statutory instrument.  The legislation itself would now deem a disallowed instrument to be revoked by eliminating the need for further action by the governor in council, or the minister who adopted the disallowed instrument. Compliance with the disallowance decision would be improved by eliminating any possibility of a regulation making authority not complying with the disallowance order of the House.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By providing a clear  legislative basis for the current disallowance procedure, Bill C-205 would, first, allow Parliament's authority to extend to all instruments, subject to review under the Statutory Instruments Act, instead of only those made by the governor in council or minister.   Second, it would remove the necessity for additional action on the part of the regulation making authority in order to give effect to an order of the House that a regulation be revoked.  This disallowance procedure is important to restore transparency and protect democracy in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-205 reflects the all party consensus of the Standing Joint Committee for the Scrutiny of Regulations on the need to strengthen parliamentary oversight of the hundreds of federal regulations made each year pursuant to legislative authority delegated by Parliament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This private member's bill should appeal to all members of the House,  regardless of partisan affiliations.  Currently, the powers of the governing party, and particularly the executive, are sweeping.  If members are to provide the necessary checks and balances, they must be accorded certain rights.  Their views are crucial to the continued functioning of Parliament.  Accepting these small changes to the scrutiny of regulations would be a significant first step in our efforts to make Parliament more responsive to Canadians. I urge all members in the House to give the bill very careful consideration and to pass it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, we on this side of the House are trying constantly to improve the democracy in this place by allowing MPs to be more effective in performing their duties here.  One of the things that needs to be emphasized is that so much of what happens here concerns enabling legislation.  We pass enabling legislation which then allows for a lot of regulations to be made. In effect, we are now saying that those regulations must be more carefully scrutinized.  There must be a process, a mechanism, to ensure that those that are disallowed, those that are scrutinized, have the proper attention given to them.</p><A NAME="T1740"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1740"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1745"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1735"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1740)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to thank the member for Surrey Central for all the work he has done on Bill C-205.  Many people listening to this may not be fully aware of the significance of the bill.  Let me assure everyone listening that this is a very important step in improving democracy in the House.  I again thank the member for bringing Bill C-205 forward.  I look forward to everyone passing the bill.</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-588673"></A><a HREF="#Int-588727"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-588574"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, I welcome this opportunity to speak to Bill C-205, which is specifically designed to strengthen parliamentary control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take this opportunity to thank my colleague from Surrey Central for bringing this important question to the House for debate. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of the Standing Joint Committee on Scrutiny of Regulations, I obviously want, and it is my duty, to ensure that our rules are efficient and respectful of democracy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to point out that the purpose of the bill before us today is to provide a legislative basis for the disallowance procedure for statutory instruments by enshrining it in  the Statutory Instruments Act. The current procedure set out in the Standing Orders of the House considerably limits our responsibility as parliamentarians to efficiently oversee delegated legislation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Bill C-205, the disallowance procedure will now apply to all statutory instruments, which  seems to me to be very important, given that it is currently  limited to regulations made by the governor in council or by a minister of the Crown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many regulatory organizations, such as the CRTC or the Canadian Transportation Agency, escape our purview. If we want to extend the control we have over delegated legislation to all statutory instruments, it is imperative that it be provided for in an act, in addition to the Standing Orders of the House; all the more reason to pass this bill. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many have been hesitant to  have such organizations come under the control of Parliament, because of potential interference in organizations which are operating at arm's length to some extent. I do not think that it will prevent them from managing their affairs appropriately and in accordance with their mandates. On the contrary, I think that these organizations should be accountable, since they are publicly funded.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our committee already reviews the bylaws of these organizations. It would therefore only make sense that we could repeal them. However, these organizations must not forget that they have regulatory power only because it was delegated to them by Parliament. We must never lose sight of the fact that the  function of Parliament is to ensure the proper  use of public funds and to legislate. It is normal, indeed essential, that Parliament have the right to  oversee the use made of this delegated power and hold these organizations to account. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We vote on  bills in the House, but we delegate the responsibility for regulating several aspects of these bills. These are aspects that can have a major impact on our constituents. Regulations can mean life or death  for projects, individual rights or the economic survival of businesses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we consider the fact that the lion's share of the law that governs our society is contained in regulations, and not in the acts themselves, it becomes critical to ensure that regulatory power, this delegated power, is exercised in accordance with the purposes for which it was delegated and that the intent of the legislator has indeed been respected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One specific aspect of this bill that caught my attention is the fact that after having voted in support of a resolution in the House, the text will be repealed within 30 days, whereas under existing procedure, it is simply an order of the House calling on the government to repeal the text in question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that the government has discretionary power to decide when it will repeal a regulation and also to decide whether or not it will repeal it. There is no legal way of punishing the government for violating an order of the House. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect that also deserves our attention is the fact that prior to using a disallowance procedure, there are all kinds of exchanges, letters and even promises made by the government before it amends the regulation in question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Years can go by from the moment a regulation is deemed to contradict the spirit of the legislation and the time the government finally decides to amend it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Regulations, which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Canadian Heritage referred to during a previous debate, is a good example to illustrate that the government is not always quick to respond.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Standing Joint Committee on the Scrutiny of Regulations tabled a report recommending that certain articles of the regulations be repealed, more than  seven full years had gone by from the time of the initial discussions with the government on the matter. That means that during this time, the government or the department or the organization continues to enforce the regulation illegally, which is an abuse of power. That is extremely dangerous in terms  of democracy.</p><A NAME="T1745"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1745"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1750"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1745)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that respect for our democratic institutions is extremely important. As it happens, I had the honour of being a guest speaker at the seminar on Parliament in the 21st century. I have also taken part in other events and published articles on democratic institutions and the importance of making changes that contribute to increasing the public's confidence in  and satisfaction with their representatives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One aspect that seems very serious and may have negative consequences for our democracy is the excessive concentration of power in the hands of executives. For instance, the governor in council and cabinet ministers have been given impressive regulatory power. But they hold this power directly from Parliament itself, and because of this, they must be accountable for the way they exercise this power. If the executive exercises its powers without respecting the spirit and the letter of enabling legislation, Parliament should have a legal means of intervening, and that is precisely the purpose of the bill before us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our system and our rules must be flexible enough to permit members to play their role to the fullest and to preserve in this place the rights and freedoms of those we represent. My fundamental belief is that members should have much more power within Parliament. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings us back to the very essence of our role as parliamentarians. We must never lose sight of our prerogatives, especially that of creating legislation. Of course, this is a complex task, and the very technical aspects of regulations and many other considerations make it necessary for us to delegate some of this power. But make no mistake, the supremacy of Parliament remains, as does our duty as parliamentarians to ensure it is respected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on this principle, I fail to see why anyone would deprive us of the fundamental right to maintain control over this delegated legislation. No doubt Bill C-205 will be one step closer to the preservation of our parliamentary supremacy. The more democratic this control, the healthier our democracy will be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are pleased to give our support to Bill C-205.</p><A NAME="T1750"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1750"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1745"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1750)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill introduced by the member for Surrey Central would provide a statutory basis for the current disallowance procedure and extend the application of that procedure to regulations made by persons or bodies other than the governor in council or ministers of the crown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-205 is in keeping with a long-standing all party consensus of the Standing Joint Committee for the Scrutiny of Regulations for the reform of the current disallowance procedure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to take a few minutes to deal with one particular feature of the bill.  I refer to proposed subsection 19.1(10), which provides that a disallowed regulation is deemed to be repealed at the expiration of 30 days following the day on which the disallowance of the regulation was adopted by the House. It has been argued that this provision would create a situation in which the government would be deprived of the flexibility it needs to consider the implications of a disallowance ordered by the House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A comparison between the procedure proposed in Bill C-205 and statutory disallowance procedures in other jurisdictions or with negative resolution procedures in existing federal statutes will show that the suspension of the effect of a disallowance for a full 30 days that is proposed in Bill C-205 is unique. In most other jurisdictions, as well as in federal statutes, a regulation is repealed immediately upon disallowance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of these various precedents, including federal precedents, I would argue that in suspending the effect of a disallowance resolution for 30 days, Bill C-205 would provide for far greater flexibility than any other similar procedure.  It is precisely in order to preserve the ability of the government to establish an appropriate alternative temporary regime where one is needed that Bill C-205 delays the effective date of revocation by 30 days.  That provision strikes an appropriate balance between the need to have a disallowance procedure and the need to give a regulation making authority sufficient time to formulate an alternative course of action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also of interest to note that the usual notice and comment period for proposed regulations following pre-publication in part 1 of the <i>Canada Gazette</i> is 30 days.  If the government considers this a sufficient period of time for citizens to assess and comment on a proposed regulatory initiative often involving many pages of regulations, one wonders why a similar period, which is in addition to the minimum of three weeks provided before a resolution becomes an order of the House, would not be sufficient for civil servants to assess and react appropriately to the disallowance of a statutory instrument.  Are members expected to believe that our public service is incapable of dealing with a proposed revocation within a period of 51 days while it is perfectly possible for their Australian or Quebec counterparts to do so within 21 days?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her intervention, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Canadian Heritage emphasized the argument that a statutory disallowance procedure would deprive the government of the flexibility needed to gauge the impact of revocation.  Revocation might create a legal vacuum, it was said, and the government could find itself hard pressed to determine the alternative legal measures required to fill the legal vacuum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interestingly, the parliamentary secretary chose to illustrate her argument by referring to the disallowance of section 58 of the “Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Regulations” by the House on October 3, 2001.   That particular case provides an excellent example of the approach taken by the joint committee with regard to disallowance.</p><A NAME="T1755"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1755"><!-- Hour: 5--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1800"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1750"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1755)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First I would note that the disallowance of section 58 of the fresh fruit and vegetable regulations did not create a legal vacuum, and this was no accident.   In electing to disallow section 58, which provided for cancellation of a registration, the joint committee deliberately left section 57 in place, knowing that this section would allow the suspension of any registration where an establishment was found to have contravened the applicable regulations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The standing joint committee was very careful to propose the disallowance in such a way that the repeal of section 58 would not impair in any way the enforcement capability of those administering the regulations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government took a full eight months to comply with the disallowance order of the House, a delay that many would say is not acceptable.  The decision to proceed with the amendment of other regulations at the same time as it complied with the disallowance of the House was a decision the government made.  It was neither required nor inevitable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective parliamentary scrutiny requires effective parliamentary control.  At present there exists a gap between the two, and Bill C-205 is intended to bridge that gap by ensuring that all regulations are subject to oversight by the House of Commons.  This can only be achieved by the means of legislation and this is what Bill C-205 is about.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been much talk lately of a democratic deficit.  Full parliamentary control of delegated legislation, with such exceptions as are warranted, would significantly reduce that deficit.  It is simply an anomaly for the House of Commons to have the authority to disallow a regulation important enough to be made by the governor in council or a minister, but to lack any authority with regard to a regulation made by secondary delegates such as the Canadian Transportation Agency or the CRTC.  When they exercise regulation making powers, those entities are exercising a power that was given to them by the House and the House has a right to control the exercise of that power in appropriate circumstances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to congratulate the hon. member for Surrey Central on Bill C-205 and I want to state that we support the bill.</p><A NAME="Int-588778"></A><a HREF="#Int-588811"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-588727"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Paul Harold Macklin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to speak to the  bill today, which relates to the important responsibilities that parliamentarians have to oversee the exercise of the delegated law-making powers.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past 30 years these responsibilities have in large part been discharged by the Standing Joint Committee for the Scrutiny of Regulations. It has performed an invaluable service to the House and to the Canadian public in its review of statutory instruments made under acts of Parliament. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee examines thousands of statutory instruments each year and carefully notes any concerns they raise in terms of the committee's review criteria.  These criteria focus on legal concerns rooted in the rule of law and the Canadian Constitution, particularly the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee carefully and diligently pursues its concerns and deals with the concerns of the authorities entrusted with that power to make regulations and other statutory instruments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the ways of ensuring that  its concerns are addressed is through the disallowance procedure in chapter XIV of the standing orders of the House.  These procedures have worked well.  The government has complied with all eight of the disallowance resolutions adopted by the House. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fully support the principles of parliamentary scrutiny of regulations underlying Bill C-205, as well as the need to recognize the disallowance procedures in law.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as I noted during the last session in the debate on Bill C-202, it gives rise to a number of concerns.  These concerns have to do with how disallowed regulations are to be revoked, particularly  the timeframe for revocation and the challenges it might pose for the making of replacement regulations to fill gaps that may be left by this revocation. I also noted concerns about ensuring proper public notice of revocation and extending the disallowance procedures to statutory instruments made by non-ministerial bodies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I drew the attention of the House to the absence of a role for the other place in the disallowance resolution. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we have before us a  proposal to substitute another bill for Bill C-205. I am pleased to say that the new bill addresses the concerns that I  previously mentioned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that the government is committed  to ensuring that parliamentarians have an effective role in overseeing the exercise of delegated legislative powers. Not only has it implemented the eight resolutions under the existing disallowance procedures in the standing orders, the government recently amended the cabinet directive on law making, which is available on the website of the Privy Council Office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendment addresses the treatment of concerns raised by the Standing Joint Committee for the Scrutiny of Regulations. It establishes a series of requirements for government departments, which  is extraordinarily important in the process of governance. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are to have one or more designated persons to whom the standing joint committee may address its inquiries.  All inquiries are to be coordinated by a departmental tracking office to facilitate timely responses to all correspondence from the committee. Each department is to establish appropriate timelines for responding to inquiries.  If a time line cannot be met, the committee is to be advised of the need for an extension.  If an inquiry involves a legal issue, the department's legal services unit is to be consulted. Each deputy minister is to receive a status report from their departmental tracking office on a regular basis.  A copy of the status report is to be provided to the minister's office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe that these procedures will go some distance toward improving the government's accountability to Parliament on regulation making. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These steps that have been taken   clearly demonstrate the government's commitment to the principles underlying the parliamentary scrutiny of regulations.  It is extraordinarily important and I urge the adoption of the bill.</p><A NAME="T1800"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1800"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1755"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1800)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-588811"></A><a HREF="#Int-588865"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-588778"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance): </b>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to conclude the debate on Bill C-205, an act to amend the Statutory Instruments Act, or  the disallowance procedure for statutory instruments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I begin the debate I would   like to take this opportunity to thank  members from all five parties in the House who have contributed to the debate, particularly those members who have signed the supporting letter in support of the bill. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to extend my appreciation to the co-chair, the vice-chair,  the general counsel and the very hard working staff of the Standing Joint Committee for the Scrutiny of Regulations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice    for his hard work and cooperation on this issue.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regulations play a significant role in our lives, whether good or bad.  Every day everyone is affected by statutory instruments, commonly called regulations.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As many of my colleagues already know, disallowance is one of the traditional means at the disposal of the legislature to control the making of delegated legislation by giving legislators an opportunity to reject a subordinate law made by a delegate of Parliament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Variants  of the disallowance procedure have been in existence in other Commonwealth jurisdictions for many years.  The bill is intended to provide a legislative framework for a similar procedure at the federal level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would  provide a legislative basis for the procedure that is currently set out in our standing orders and would  extend the application of that procedure to regulations made by agencies or bodies other than the governor in council or ministers of the crown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might add that Bill C-205 is consistent with the recommendations made by the Standing Joint Committee for the Scrutiny of Regulations, which I co-chair, and many others, for the reform of the current disallowance procedure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parliament of Canada is the source of all legislative authority that is delegated, not only to the governor in council and ministers, but also to various other regulation-making authorities, such as the CRTC and the Canadian Transportation Agency.  When they exercise that delegated authority to make regulations, those entities are exercising a power that finds its source in the House of Commons and in Parliament.  Parliament therefore has not only a right but a responsibility to control the exercise of those powers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For well over 30 years now, regulations made pursuant to the enactments of Parliament have been subject to parliamentary oversight and scrutiny.  The members and the staff of the Standing Joint Committee for the Scrutiny of Regulations have painstakingly reviewed thousands of federal regulations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However effective parliamentary scrutiny must be accompanied by effective parliamentary control.  This was not always the case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gap was partly addressed in 1986 when the government of the day agreed to be bound by standing orders providing for a disallowance procedure.  However, because of the non-legislative nature of our standing orders, the current procedure could only deal with a portion of the regulations   subject to parliamentary scrutiny.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the current procedure was first implemented, it was stated to be an experiment, and with its success leading to a statutory disallowance procedure.  The experiment has been a success and this success justifies us in extending the scope of the disallowance procedure in order that parliamentary control coincides fully with parliamentary scrutiny. This can only be achieved by means of legislation, and this is what Bill C-205 is about.</p><A NAME="T1805"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1805"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1810"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1800"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1805)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The procedure set out in  the bill has been endorsed by the Standing Joint Committee for the Scrutiny of Regulations. I am proud to recognize that Bill C-205 is really a work of the collective efforts of  members of all parties in the House, particularly those who now sit on the scrutiny committee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than three decades after the enactment of the Statutory Instruments Act, I believe   the time has come for the Parliament of Canada to give itself the means to ensure full democratic control of federal delegated legislation. If passed, the legislation will be  a major historic milestone in restoring accountability and in democratic and parliamentary reforms.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By placing the current  disallowance procedure on a statutory footing it will make it possible to close the gap between parliamentary scrutiny and parliamentary control. It will also ensure that the procedure is legally effective.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This legislative proposal has been carefully designed to allow parliamentarians to exercise their responsibility for the effective oversight of regulations, while  providing the flexibility required by regulation-makers to respond appropriately to a disallowance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am  happy to say that the concerns raised by some members earlier did not go to the principle of the bill but focused on some perceived practical difficulties with the bill as it stands now. These comments have been very useful, and I am pleased to report that the members of the Standing Joint Committee for the  Scrutiny of Regulations have had discussions as to how the bill might be improved.  A consensus was reached among all members on proposals for amendments that will  address the issues that were raised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have always said,   this is a non-partisan issue. It is the responsibility of all  members of the House to make sure  parliamentary control over  delegated legislation always applies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should the House agree to send the bill to the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights I can assure the members that it is my intention to propose those amendments in order to address the concerns raised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-205 is intended to ensure that parliamentarians are in a position to exercise their responsibility for the effective oversight of the exercise of the legislative powers they entrust to various delegates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will conclude with   two main issues.  First,   the disallowance procedure has to be on a statutory footing, which the bill would accomplish. Second,  the delegated authority to make regulations has been applied to the issuing of statutory instruments by governor in council, ministers, agencies and boards, but   that Parliament's scrutiny only be applied to the regulations or statutory instruments made by the governor in council and ministers and not those made by  the various agencies and boards. Knowing   that 80% of the laws in this country are made by regulations or statutory instruments, it is very important that Parliament have the authority to scrutinize and review the regulations made by all agencies and boards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, with the adoption of the bill, 100% of the federal regulations will be coming under the scrutiny of Parliament. I urge all the members to vote to send the bill to committee.   I thank members in advance for their support on this important initiative.</p><A NAME="T1810"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1810"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1815"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1805"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1810)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-588865"></A><a HREF="#Int-588885"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-588811"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair): </b>Is the House ready for the question?</p>

This is the issue around a CPP disability case for a Regina man named Mr. Foster. I want to raise it again in hopes of coming to some sort of understanding of the government's actions in this case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, here it is. Mr. Foster is a 60 year old man from Regina who has been unable to work since having two strokes in the late nineties. After four years of denied applications, appeals, poverty and illness, Mr. Foster finally was advised that the review tribunal had accepted his appeal, yet incredibly he has been told by her department that it will overturn the appeal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Foster worked for 32 years as a caretaker of an apartment building before suffering his strokes, and he contributed to CPP throughout that time. He first applied to CPP disability in 1999 but was rejected, saying that he could still do light work. His next appeal in March 2001 was denied, citing lack of new evidence. Mr. Foster then tried to get a neurological assessment but it would cost $1,000, which he could ill afford.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Mr. Foster already was quite discouraged. He started the process in 1999 and about two years later he was not much further ahead. His wife had severe diabetes and they were living off her disability income, which was not enough. In 2000 they were forced to declare bankruptcy. His adviser was worried because Mr. Foster's mental capacity was starting to deteriorate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, after a cognitive screening by an occupational therapist, which essentially stated he was unemployable, Mr. Foster's appeal was accepted on February 10, 2003. After almost four long years, Mr. Foster finally got what he deserved in the first place, namely his CPP disability, except that Mr. Foster was advised recently that the minister would try to overturn his successful appeal with no explanation. It is the explanation that I am hoping to garner today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the details of this case seem tedious but I outlined them to show the lengthy and unnecessary process which persons with disabilities are forced to go through. I wish I could say that this case is unique, an anomaly, but that is just not true. The one uniqueness of Mr. Foster's case is that he persevered in his appeals for four years, thanks to the support and persistence of his adviser and his family. Most applicants do not have the strength to go that far, but it should not be so difficult to obtain this support in the first place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the minister explain to me how it is that her department has come to the conclusion that Mr. Foster does not deserve the support of the CPP program, a program into which he has paid throughout his working life in the sincere hope that he would never have to access it? Why on earth is the department denying this man what is rightfully his and to what he is entitled?</p><A NAME="T1815"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1815"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1820"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1810"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1815)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-588911"></A><a HREF="#Int-588942"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-588885"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker,  the hon. member for Dartmouth will understand that, for reasons related to privacy, I cannot comment on this individual's case. However, I can confirm that, last year, less than 2% of applications for leave to appeal to the Pension Appeals Board were made on the minister's behalf.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canada pension plan disability benefit represents an extremely important part of Canada's social safety net, and it provides handicapped Canadians who are unable to work with income support until they are entitled to their retirement pension.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each year, we pay benefits totalling $2.8 billion to 280,000 persons, as well as to 90,000 of their children. We know that severely handicapped Canadians face challenges. Our goal is to provide disability benefits to each eligible individual who applies. Only those applications from individuals who do not meet the eligibility requirements set out in the Canada pension plan are turned down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Subcommittee on the Status of Persons with Disabilities has undertaken an in-depth review of the  Canada Pension Plan Disability Program. I want to thank the subcommittee for this work and for its broad consultation with Canadians, because the government is looking forward to  studying this report as well as the suggestions and recommendations it contains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the program's administrators, it is absolutely imperative that we make sure that decisions are founded in law. Only when a serious error in law has been made do we seek the authorization to appeal a decision made by a     review tribunal in favour of a client.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the determination of eligibility for  CPP disability benefits is a complex process requiring the  careful assessment of many factors. To ensure that their decisions are fair    to the client, the CPP staff often has to request additional medical information, which may further delay the processing of applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To encourage those eligible to apply, we must enhance the understanding the public has of the Canada Pension Plan Disability Program. In recent years, the approval rate of      initial applications for disability benefits has increased. In 2001-02, we approved 38% of all initial applications, compared to  32% in 1999-2000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will continue to ensure that all clients who meet the program's eligibility  criteria are treated equitably and receive the benefits they are entitled to.</p><A NAME="T1820"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1820"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1815"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1820)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

At the end of that period, he won a review tribunal appeal.  At that point, it seems to me that it is up to the government to respect the decision of the tribunal and to give this person, who is in a very vulnerable state, the assistance that he needs. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we cannot be there for people who are severely disabled, then this program is a sham.  It is not working.  Clearly we need to ensure that it is working for Canadians.  It is not working now.  I hope that message is being sent loud and clear.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also sending, to more than 26,000 general practitioners, guides that outline the medical conditions required for disability benefits. We also phone applicants to explain our decision in their case before we send them a letter. </p>
