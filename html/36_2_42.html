<A NAME="LINK7">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
establish a National Highway Policy in partnership with the 
provinces to ensure the long term viability of our national 
highway system in light of the nature of our country, our 
geography and our culture which demands a consistent and uniform 
highway system. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to stand before 
the House today to debate Motion No. 102.  I would like to point 
out that this is the last private member's motion of the century. 
I brought this motion to the House two and a half years ago and I 
always wondered why it was held up so long.  I now know why.  The 
best has been kept until the last.  What a way to end the century 
by talking about a new highway system to lead us into the new 
millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My motion is very simple.  I call on the government to establish 
a funding program to restore and improve the national highway 
system.  It has truly fallen into disarray over the last few 
years with no funding program in place, no long range planning, 
no planning at all and no arrangement for the provinces or anyone 
to plan ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present situation we have for funding highways in the 
country, which needs highways so desperately, is a very ad hoc 
system.  Currently, the Department of Transport and the 
parliamentary transport committee estimate that it will take $17 
billion to restore our highway system.  This is not to improve it 
but just to restore it and make up for the money that has not 
been spent on the highways over the last seven or eight years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is agreed that approximately 38% to 40% of our national 
highway system is now in a declined situation, which is not up to 
standard and not acceptable.  Seven hundred and ninety bridges on 
our national highway system have been identified as in need of 
major strengthening and repair.  There are no current funding 
programs available.  This is the situation we presently have in 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The old policy we had up until approximately 1993-94 was a 
program where the federal government would sign agreements with 
the provinces on an ad hoc basis.  They would negotiate them 
one-on-one and come up with a 50:50 program to fund highways in 
some provinces but not do the same thing in others. 
This was very inconsistent and very short term with no long range 
planning.  It did not allow the provinces to plan for 
communities, traffic patterns, or to take advantage of our free 
trade programs and everything else that we have established in 
the country and that are so important.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is wrong with not having a highway funding program?  I want 
to hone in on Atlantic Canada for a minute because it is a true 
example of what can happen without a highway funding program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Atlantic Canada, with no money to build highways and no 
program, the provinces got creative and established toll highways 
in both Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.  These two provinces 
target the traffic from other provinces for revenues to their 
coffers.  A lot of people have complained about these toll 
projects.  It is not just a matter of paying the toll.  Part of 
the deal for both the highway in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick is 
that the legislatures in their respective provinces passed 
legislation to prevent people from using public highways that ran 
parallel to the toll highway.  Even though the taxpayers pay for 
these highways, they cannot use them.  They are forced onto the 
toll highways by legislation even though these are provincially 
and federally funded highways that were built decades ago.  This 
is very offensive to the people.  This is not only offensive to 
the people and to me, but also to all three auditor generals. The 
auditor general of New Brunswick, the auditor general of Nova 
Scotia and even the Auditor General of Canada have taken 
exception to these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general of Nova Scotia was the first to point out 
the problems.  He blew the whistle on the Nova Scotia toll 
highway when two ministers, one federal and one provincial, 
transferred $26 million from the federal-provincial highway 
program to their own ridings.  I will not go into the details, 
but the auditor general blew the whistle and forced them to put 
the money back into the highway fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Was that Dave Dingwall? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  It was Dave Dingwall, and Ritchie Mann 
who was the minister of transportation in the province of Nova 
Scotia.  They transferred these funds in a very inappropriate 
manner and the auditor general of Nova Scotia blew the whistle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal auditor general has also blown the whistle on toll 
highways.  The auditor general has written a whole book on the 
highway program in general but on the toll highways in 
particular.  It goes on and on and lists different things that 
were done and not done and that should not have been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are a couple of comments the auditor general made. 
“Transport Canada has failed to exercise the controls entrenched 
in the agreements under which these investments were made.  We 
found that it has failed to discharge the leadership 
responsibility to co-ordinate information for the government on 
federal highway spending overall”.  In other words, the federal 
auditor general said that it was chaos.  He honed in particularly 
on the toll highways in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just two weeks ago, the auditor general of New Brunswick joined 
the auditor general of Nova Scotia and the Auditor General of 
Canada. In his report he accuses the provincial Liberal 
government of New Brunswick of not even giving adequate 
consideration to options or anything else, that it just dove into 
this toll highway system for entirely political purposes.  The 
auditor general has listed a long range of failings in the New 
Brunswick highway deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Wasn't that Doug Young? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Yes.  The report of the New Brunswick 
auditor general, Daryl Wilson, yesterday leaves little doubt that 
the former Liberal government painted itself into a corner with 
the Moncton to Fredericton and Moncton to Saint John toll highway 
deal by failing to explore several alternative options.  Again, 
when there are no federal funding programs, no national standards 
and no set of rules to follow, the provinces will get creative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have two inappropriate deals in Atlantic Canada, one in Nova 
Scotia and one in New Brunswick.  Again I say, this is not only 
me finding fault, it is all three auditor generals.  There are no 
more auditor generals to find fault with it.  Everyone of them 
have found fault with these programs.  That is what happens when 
we do not have a federal funding program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is really serious now.  It is getting to the point 
where action has to be taken.  Two years ago, the minister said 
that highway refunding was a top priority for him, but he has 
done nothing about it.  As I said earlier, 38% of Canada's 
national highway system is now deemed in need of major repair, 
estimated at $17 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we have this problem?  For one thing, highways do not 
deteriorate on a straight line basis.  They stay solid for some 
time.  When they start to deteriorate, they deteriorate quickly. 
If they are not maintained, they will go beyond the point of no 
repair and then must be replaced. 
Because there has been very little maintenance in the last five 
or six years on highways in Canada, we find ourselves with some 
very serious problems.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason is that there has been no funding program for the 
last five years.  I believe the last programs were signed by the 
Conservatives.  I am not sure of that, but I think that is 
exactly right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next government policy that has caused these problems is the 
policy to reduce the number of trains that take heavy freight and 
heavy tariffs from coast to coast.  By reducing the train routes 
and tearing up short lines all over the country, it has forced 
traffic and goods onto the highways.  This means bigger trucks, 
more trucks and more damage to the highways.  That is another 
government policy that has built on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another one is simply that the international truck traffic has 
tripled in 10 years, up 300%.  Again, that means more trucks, 
bigger trucks, more damage, worn out highways, rutted highways, 
broken highways and unsafe highways.  Although I talked about 
Atlantic Canada a lot earlier, this is not only Atlantic Canada. 
I have just picked a couple of highways that are particularly 
infamous for their problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec highway 75 from Quebec City to Chicoutimi is an example 
of a very dangerous highway.  This highway has not been fixed and 
instead of fixing it, they have increased the policing to make 
sure people go real slow because the highway is deficient, not 
adequate and cannot handle the traffic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Alberta, highway 2 south and highway 1 east, which was 
designed for much less traffic than they experience now, cannot 
handle it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, of course, there is the infamous highway 401 in Windsor 
where there have been so many tragic accidents.  Even in the new 
territory of Nunavut, there is no road link and no highway system 
at all.  This is an issue that goes coast to coast, involves 
every province and every territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was first assigned the duty of transport critic, I wrote 
every minister of transportation in every province and asked them 
what their number one problem was.  Every single one of them who 
answered said that highway funding was the number one problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Potholes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Potholes, right.  Potholes on the road to 
the millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general also agrees that it is the number one 
problem. He confirmed that it will take $17 billion to restore, 
not improve, our highway system to a standard that is acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two years ago, the minister laid out highway spending as his 
number one priority.  It has not happened.  Nothing has happened. 
There have been Department of Transport studies and even 
Federation of Canadian Municipalities studies.  A couple of years 
ago, the transport committee wrote a very indepth report stating 
that the highways needed a great deal of repair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that even the Liberal members of parliament, 
about a month ago, wrote a report called “Catching Tomorrow's 
Wave”, calling for government investment in highways.  They 
condemned toll highways.  These were written by Atlantic Canadian 
members of parliament.  I do not know where they were when the 
Liberals were building these toll highways, but we did not hear 
anything from them then.  Now they have discovered that those 
highways are not good for the economy and are not an appropriate 
way to fund highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our number one competitor in the global economy has recognized 
the problem.  The United States has just recently identified and 
dedicated $36 billion only over six years to improve the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where we are is that we do not have a system at all.  Our system 
is in disarray.  Our highway funding system was abandoned years 
ago.  Our competitors are getting ahead of us and that is where 
we are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Where's the gasoline tax in this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  My proposal is very simple and it does 
involve the gasoline and diesel tax.  It amounts to dedicating 
15% of the gas and diesel oil tax to a highway funding pool. This 
pool would be available to the provinces on the condition that 
they match it dollar for dollar. In this way, it is user pay 
because the taxes are only paid for by the people who buy gas and 
diesel oil.  It will leave 85% for the Minister of Finance to put 
in general revenues.  It will allow long term planning by the 
provinces so they can plan five, ten and fifteen years ahead and 
know they will have funding available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A tax of 15% on gas and diesel fuel yields about $700 million a 
year.  If that is matched with the provinces' equal contribution, 
it would come to about $1.4 billion a year to go into highways. 
Spread over 10 to 12 years, that would restore our highway 
system, our bridges and our main transportation system to the 
level it should be as identified by the auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would not mean any new taxes.  It would provide safe 
highways. It would make us globally competitive and would 
certainly address our transportation needs.  User pay is 
politically acceptable. It is a great plan.  It is nice and 
simple.  I advocate this as my proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I close my remarks, I wish everybody a merry Christmas 
and a happy new year to the staff, all members of parliament here 
today and all citizens watching on television.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to have 
this opportunity to discuss the issue of national highway policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion by the hon. member for Cumberland—Colchester is 
another indication of the importance that Canadians attach to our 
national highway system.  Indeed, the concern about Canada's 
surface transportation infrastructure is shared by all.  Ensuring 
the mobility of persons and goods across Canada is critical to 
the quality of life for individual Canadians and to maintaining 
Canada's competitiveness in the global economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically the highway system has played a major role in the 
development of the Canadian economy.  The recent Speech from the 
Throne credited our highway system, along with other achievements 
such as the national railway, the postal system and national 
cultural institutions, for providing the foundations for our 
quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister also touched on this aspect in his response 
to the Speech from the Throne.  He mentioned that Canada has been 
characterized as a triumph of will over geography and economics. 
This is indeed true of Canada's surface transportation system. 
The building of the Trans-Canada Highway and the railway system 
are the most obvious examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Highways are indeed the backbone of Canada's transportation 
systems.  Highways, roads and streets play a vital role in 
Canada's internal trade and international commerce, from the 
initial shipment of raw material to the delivery of final 
products to the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Studies show that highways support about 90% of all intercity 
passenger trips and 75% of Canadian freight shipments by value. 
Approximately 4.5 billion vehicle kilometres of this travel occur 
on the national highway system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The importance of transportation to our industrial sector is 
indisputable.  In particular, transportation represents a large 
portion of the export costs of traditional Canadian commodities; 
for example, 45% for coal exports and 30% for lumber exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that highway infrastructure is very costly to build 
and maintain.  We also are aware that the existing system is 
deteriorating rapidly and that rehabilitation costs will continue 
to rise the longer we delay our efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The challenge before governments is to ensure a proper balance 
between a safe and efficient surface transportation system versus 
other competing government priorities.  We need to acknowledge 
that significant benefits can be gained from such strategic 
investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The council of ministers responsible for transportation and 
highway safety commissioned a multi-year national highway policy 
study in 1987.  This study established a national highway system, 
which accounts for approximately 24,400 kilometres of Canada's 
existing highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study also concluded that the estimated cost of upgrading 
this national highway system amounted to approximately $14 
billion in 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June 1997 a federal-provincial-territorial working group, 
again under the auspices of the council of ministers for 
transportation and highway safety, was formed to update the 1988 
national highway policy study.  The new study, entitled 
“National Highway System—Condition and Investment Needs 
Update”, was released in December 1998.  The study found that 
federal-provincial-territorial governments had invested over $8 
billion in capital improvements in the national highway system 
since 1988 and that annual expenditures on the system were 
currently twice the levels reported in 1988. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study concluded that despite a doubling of annual 
expenditures in the last decade, and correction to some of the 
deficiencies of the system, the condition of the national highway 
system had not improved significantly.  When measured against the 
same standards used in 1988, the length of the system judged to 
be deficient had increased by 30%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of correcting the identified current deficiencies of 
the national highway system was estimated at $17.4 billion in 
1998, an increase of over $3 billion in less than 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In support of increased funding to rehabilitate the national 
highway system, the study provided an indication of the benefits 
that would accrue from an upgraded highway system.  Over a 25 
year horizon, the expected present values of benefits of the 
highway system investment program were estimated to exceed $30 
billion, comprised of $22 billion in travel time savings, $5.8 
billion in highway safety improvements, $2.9 billion in reduced 
vehicle operating costs and $1.3 billion in network benefits.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reduced congestion and improved highway conditions could be 
expected to reduce the number of fatal traffic accidents by up to 
247 per year and injury accidents by up to 16,000 per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Improving the national highway system would also be expected to 
reduce fuel consumption by up to 236 million litres per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study further indicated that a review of literature and 
international experience provided strong evidence that investment 
in highways can generate significant productivity growth and 
support economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although they have jurisdictional responsibility over most of 
the national highway system, the provinces and territories have 
indicated that their governments cannot fully fund the repairs 
and improvements that are urgently needed.  They have asked the 
federal government for financial assistance to help preserve and 
develop the existing highway system.  This is something which I 
know the Minister of Transport has been seriously studying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the recent annual conference in Quebec City in August, 
premiers and territorial leaders called on the federal government 
to initiate an infrastructure improvement program in which 
highways would be a major component. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The August 11 communique enunciated six principles for an 
infrastructure investment program.  The premiers and territorial 
leaders indicated that infrastructure investment should be 
flexible enough to address other transportation priorities, such 
as trade corridors, border crossings, intermodal facilities, 
urban transit and intelligent transportation systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his August 11 press release in response, the Minister of 
Transport welcomed the agreement by the premiers and territorial 
leaders on the development and maintenance of a strong 
infrastructure base, with transportation as a key component.  He 
indicated that the development of a strategy to renew Canada's 
national transportation infrastructure in a sustainable fashion 
has been a top priority for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister agreed that governments should look beyond the 
rehabilitation of key highways of national significance.  He also 
agreed with the need to address other transportation issues, such 
as those identified by the premiers and territorial leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Discussions concerning highway investments have also taken place 
at the federal level.  In June 1996 the Standing Committee on 
Transport received a reference from the House of Commons to study 
the economic relationship, efficiencies and linkages among 
transportation, trade and tourism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recognizing that highway transportation will remain the dominant 
mode in support of Canada's economic activities, the committee 
chose to focus primarily on the renewal of our national highway 
system and its relationship to trade and tourism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its final report, submitted in February 1997, the Standing 
Committee on Transport recommended that the federal government 
make a long term commitment of at least the current level of 
annual federal expenditures on highways to finance a national 
highway renewal program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on both sides of the House know that the issue of tolls 
has been a major concern for the hon. member for 
Cumberland—Colchester.  I would like to inform the House that a 
great deal of work has been done on this issue this past summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Officials from Transport Canada have been exploring with their 
provincial and territorial counterparts the terms and conditions 
of a proposed highway toll policy that would be applicable when 
the federal government contributes to a particular highway 
project.  If and when federal highway funding becomes available, 
the minister would be prepared to outline a policy on tolls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member for Cumberland—Colchester is aware, the 
recent Speech from the Throne announced a five year 
infrastructure program to improve physical infrastructure in both 
urban and rural regions across Canada.  The Speech from the 
Throne clearly identified transportation infrastructure as a 
component of this program, but it is too early in the process to 
speculate on details.  What is quite evident is that the $17 
billion needs of the national highway system are far in excess of 
what the federal and provincial governments can collectively 
address. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, when combined with the needs for other 
infrastructure programs, such as roads, bridges, transit, sewer, 
water, tourism and so on, funding requirements for the entire 
system are really significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both the Speech from the Throne and the Prime Minister's speech 
in response stressed the need for collaboration as the issues 
facing our diverse society grow in their complexity.  The Prime 
Minister stated that the role of a national government today is 
to represent the future to the present.  It is to focus on those 
areas where it can make a real difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The development and maintenance of a strong basic 
infrastructure, as well as a knowledge infrastructure, is a key 
component of a competitive economy for the 21st century.  All 
aspects of the infrastructure plan must be well planned to meet 
the needs of the modern economy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Motion No. 
102, presented by my hon. colleague from Cumberland—Colchester. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the sentiment of my colleague's motion, but I 
really do not think it goes far enough.  It views our highway 
system as a parochial system.  Going into a new century, we have 
to look at what is really needed, and that is a seamless, 
integrated, continental transportation policy.  Canada has to be 
a player in the development of that policy.  There is no doubt 
that highways are a key component of this integrated 
transportation continental system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a little concerned.  Once again we have heard the 
parliamentary secretary speak about the studies; the years of 
studies that governments, provincial and federal, have been 
doing.  I believe that Canadians want us to stop the studies.  We 
have all the information that we need.  Let us get on with 
improving our highway system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our Trans-Canada Highway is the counterpart for the American 
interstate highway program.  The commitment that the U.S. federal 
government has made to its highway program is in the 
neighbourhood of $218 billion over six years, and it is financing 
the program through gas taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our country the government does not transfer the revenues 
that are collected through gas taxes to the transportation 
system, to the highway system and to the users, the people who 
pay the tax to the system they use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about commercial traffic, which has increased, as 
my colleague has said, 300 times or 30 times or 3 times.  The 
number is irrelevant.  The system is gridlocked because of the 
increase in commercial traffic.  It is not only commercial 
traffic; it is also tourist traffic.  In Canada we encourage 
tourism.  It is one of our largest industries.  Tourists must be 
able to access those things that we are selling.  There is growth 
in commercial traffic, there is growth in tourist traffic, and 
the government is studying the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to talk about reality.  Government last year collected 
$4.5 billion in gas tax, but it spent only $150 million on 
highways.  That is 3% of the revenue that was generated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our current highway system is dilapidated and dangerous.  When 
polled, 83% of Canadians identified safety as the number one 
issue when talking about the national highway system.  They feel 
that their personal safety is at risk when they travel our 
national highways.  That is a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We only have to look at Highway 17, which is 30 miles west of 
Ottawa.  It is part of our national highway system.  It is called 
the killer strip because of all the fatal accidents that happen 
at the point where the lanes go from four to two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February 1997, when considering the national highway renewal 
strategy, the transport committee found that upgrading the system 
would reduce traffic fatalities by 4% and prevent an additional 
2,300 personal injury accidents.  If we were to transpose that 
into our health care system, the savings would be astronomical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report states that every dollar invested in safety related 
road improvements would save $2.70 in crash costs.  That is not 
in health costs; that is in crash costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For six years the government has been talking about 
infrastructure, but rather than putting money into our 
transportation infrastructure it chose to put the money into such 
things as recreational facilities like bocce courts. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1030"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I ask, how does a bocce court give a foundation to the 
economic well-being of our country?  It is nice to have those 
recreation facilities and they are needed in communities, but the 
priority of the federal government should not be in recreation 
facilities.  It should be in maintaining and improving our 
national highway system which leads into a continental highway 
system and which increases our economic output and the economic 
stability of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Highways are not just pavement.  They are an integral part of 
our economy and the continental economy we have developed through 
the free trade agreement and NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is getting to the point where the government can no longer 
delay.  I was at a conference in Niagara. There was great concern 
over the congestion in that part of Ontario that services the 
free trade agreement and NAFTA commerce over the Ambassador 
Bridge, the Peace Bridge, Fort Erie and all those areas.  The 
gridlock that is occurring in that part of Ontario around 
Toronto, Sarnia and Windsor is starting to create not only 
hazards but delays and congestion that costs all of us consumers 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also costing the environment. When trucks are lined up 
trying to go over a bridge or trying to get from point <I>A</I> to 
point <I>B</I>, they are idling and putting a lot of emissions 
into the air.  I would think that from an environmental point of 
view improving our highways would certainly be advantageous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of our transportation system also includes urban areas. 
That congestion in urban areas has to be dealt with as well. 
Highway 401 is one of the busiest stretches, if not the busiest 
highway in the world.  Traffic has increased dramatically, 
especially the truck traffic, but the infrastructure has not 
increased or changed at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A person can now drive from Toronto to Miami and hit only 14 
stoplights.  Thirteen of them are in Windsor.  If we could spend 
some energy on trying to get that flow of traffic going, I am 
sure the economic benefits to our country would be enormous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government announced in its throne speech that it was 
finally going to do something, but it is talking about spending 
the next year, 2000, talking to the various players and the 
provinces before it actually does anything or spends any money. 
That is not good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time that the federal government sat down with provincial 
and municipal governments and worked out an integrated, seamless, 
transportation policy that includes all levels of government and 
the various modes of transportation.  We need to think planes, 
trains and automobiles as well as ships and put them all into one 
transportation policy.  We need to figure out how they can 
enhance each other, how they can be made more efficient and how 
they can operate on a continental basis rather than on a country 
basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we in the official opposition are calling for the 
federal government to work with the provinces, the municipalities 
and the private sector, as well as our NAFTA partners to plan, to 
implement and to figure out some way of funding a seamless, 
integrated continental transportation system for the 21st 
century.

Motion No. 102 put forward by the hon. member for 
Cumberland—Colchester. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I want to say that this motion should be deemed

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has a comprehensive transportation policy with very 
specific priorities and goals. Members may remember the meeting 
of Canada's premiers held in Quebec City last autumn and 
hosted by the premier of Quebec, Lucien Bouchard. The premiers 
unanimously agreed to ask the federal government to start 
reinvesting in a national highway strategy. They did not ask the 
federal government to intrude in areas of provincial 
jurisdiction but only wanted Ottawa to do its share where the 
national highway system is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the highways in my area of Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean lead 
outside our region. 
I am referring to highway 175 as well as highway 169 in the Parc 
des Laurentides. I have often put questions to the Minister of 
Transport in this House and I have sent him letters asking him 
to reinvest in this national highway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1996 the Canadian government has refused to renew the 
strategic highway improvement program. In Quebec, half of the 
costs of this program were covered by the province and the other 
half by the federal government. Ottawa did not renew its 
financial contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like the former Quebec transport minister, Jacques Brassard, and 
the current Quebec transport minister, Guy Chevrette, I have 
asked the transport minister again and again to renew the 
program. 
Each time, the Minister of Transport's answer was that we needed 
a national agreement. There was national agreement at the last 
meeting of the premiers and leaders of the territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand why this government always ignores every 
region's concerns about the infrastructure necessary for 
regional development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many years ago, this government stopped subsidizing the 
railways. What happened? An increasing number of heavy trucks 
travel our highways. Heavy trucks crowd our highways. Access is 
more difficult and there are fewer opportunities because our 
system was not really designed to handle the effects of 
globalization, as I said, in the Parc des Laurentides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government withdrew its financial support for railways, 
airports and shipping. What happened? All major firms are now 
shipping their products by truck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Highways are under provincial jurisdiction. This government 
withdrew from an area where it should have been working with the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the proposal is the obvious solution but I 
encourage the member to demand that the government let the 
provinces implement the agreement, which is part of his 
proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have to stop thinking that the government has the 
authority to intrude in all areas under provincial jurisdiction. 
Ottawa needs to understand what the provinces expect from it. It 
collects taxes in each and every province, so it needs to 
contribute to highway improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that I will support the proposal provided the 
provinces are in charge of its implementation. I hope the 
government will listen to us. In 1998, all provincial transport 
ministers submitted a five-year proposal to the federal Minister 
of Transport. It was a comprehensive proposal whereby, over a 
five-year period, the federal government and the provinces would 
have invested $16 billion in a joint national highway building 
and improvement plan.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, the government, through the Minister of Transport, 
told the provinces that they would have to talk to their finance 
ministers and their premiers. It is always the same old song we 
get from the government through the Minister of Transport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we move toward the new millennium, the government is bragging 
about the astronomical surpluses it is expecting after slashing 
transfers to the provinces and bleeding the middle class dry. It 
has refused to index the tax tables. It grabbed the EI 
surpluses, which actually belong to workers and employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the federal government must start acting and stop 
prevaricating constantly adding new conditions to the legitimate 
and justifiable requests of the provinces and the population of 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope this motion will serve as a wake-up call to the 
government, whose ears must be stopped up. I think it is normal 
and that the provinces ought to have full jurisdiction. Then and 
only then will I be able to support the motion of my hon. 
colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take the opportunity to wish all my hon. colleagues in 
this House and everyone listening to the debate a happy new year 
and a very pleasant holiday season.

<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
commend my hon. colleague from Cumberland—Colchester on his 
motion.  Numerous members have talked today about the substandard 
highways we are dealing with and about the disrepair of our 
highways, that it is going to take $17 billion to bring them back 
to where they should be.  For example, there should be four lanes 
when the traffic warrants so we do not have the killer highway 
that is just outside of Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that people nationwide realize there is a 
problem.  The Federation of Canadian Municipalities has been 
pushing to have dollars go into a national highway policy as well 
as into assistance with other infrastructure and highways 
throughout the country. The government has failed to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another area in which the government lacks any vision 
whatsoever.  It lacks any sound vision as to where Canada should 
be going.  It is literally letting the nation fall apart in front 
of us with the underfunding of health care, the underfunding of 
education, with the EI surplus where dollars have been taken away 
from the EI fund and from the unemployed, those not able to get 
enough work.  Money has been taken from the Canada pension plan. 
The government sings its praises on a wonderful surplus but fails 
to put anything back into the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Cumberland—Colchester indicates it would be 
done with the partnership of the provinces.  I do not think there 
is any question that if we are going to have a nation where the 
people can go from one end to the other, whether it be north, 
south, east, west, in any direction they choose to go, they need 
to feel comfortable and safe when they are travelling our highway 
system.  They want to know that when they go through Saskatchewan 
there will be safe roads, that when they hit Manitoba they can 
continue on the same.  They do not want to hit that provincial 
boundary and say, “Now we are going through New Brunswick, we 
are going to hit a toll highway, we are going to have to pay for 
it and my taxpayer dollars have already done that”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want to know that highway is safe.  In order to not pay to 
go on that highway they will have to go on an unsafe road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians deserve to feel safe throughout the country, and they 
have in the past, but over the last 10 or 15 years it has 
gradually deteriorated.  The point I want to make in that regard 
is it started during the time that the party of the member for 
Cumberland—Colchester was the government of the country. It 
failed to put funding in place as well.  I do not want him to 
feel that it is all hunky-dory and rosy on his side over there 
and just blame it on the other side because they are both at 
fault.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Both those parties have failed when they had the opportunity to 
ensure that funding was there.  If they want to use the gas 
taxes, by all means let them do it.  In the past my party and I 
have not supported dedicated taxes.  However, government time and 
time again does not put dollars into services and infrastructure. 
Then we start to think that we need legislation which says the 
government has to put money there.  It will have to do that.  It 
has failed to show Canadian people a true commitment to providing 
for the country, to ensuring that the dollars are going where 
they should be going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians do not argue about paying taxes.  I do not know about 
the people here, but if I pay my taxes and education is there, 
health care is there, and we have decent roads and decent 
services, we will not hear Canadians complaining.  They do not 
mind paying for what they get. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all work hard and we do not want everything for nothing.  We 
will pay our taxes but we want services in return.  When our 
money goes to the federal government and we do not get it back in 
any kind of service that is when we get disgruntled.  That is 
when we get parties like the Reform Party saying “Scrap the 
taxes.  Scrap everything”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the hon. member from the Reform Party say?  No money is 
to go into recreational facilities.  Can hon. members imagine 
putting no money into recreational facilities?  It is common 
knowledge that every dollar spent in recreational facilities for 
youth in our communities will save $7 in the future on problems 
that may result from children not having somewhere to go and 
getting into lives of crime because they do not have things to 
do.  When they become adults a good number of them will end up in 
jail because they did not have enough things to do when they were 
younger.  This blanket statement of no funding for recreational 
facilities is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a cohesive country where we have dollars supporting all 
these different programs: infrastructure, recreational 
facilities, highways and post-secondary education.  We need 
funding in all those areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I commend the hon. member and support his motion, I 
wanted to make those points.  We had a much similar debate just a 
few weeks ago with the suggestion of dedicated taxes.  As I said, 
the problems are there.  There is probably about a $17 billion 
cost to improve our national highway structure.  We certainly 
need a national highway policy and we need a national 
transportation policy.  There is no question.  We heard it all 
here today.  With all of us knowing it, surely some good can come 
out of the discussion we have had over and over again and we will 
see the government make a real commitment to the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, this is the last day of the 1900s and to end it in 
Private Members' Business with a discussion on roads is one of 
the most significant moments in this parliament, because this 
parliament has demonstrated throughout this century that it is 
one of the finest political institutions in the world and one of 
the most democratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the permission of the member for Cumberland—Colchester, I 
would like to make a few remarks that pertain more to the end of 
the millennium than they do to roads.  Some years ago I found 
myself alone travelling in Tunisia and I came across a ruined 
Roman city in the mountains, right on the edge of the mountains 
in Tunisia, next to the desert.  This city probably had a 
population of about 20,000 or 30,000 and it was far more dramatic 
than Pompeii. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those Canadians who may have travelled in north Africa, they 
will know that the Roman ruins and Roman cities are very well 
preserved in north Africa.  One can actually walk down the 
streets of these cities and feel as though one is back 2,000 
years, because the streets are there, the shops are there and the 
aqueducts are there.  The only thing that is missing is the 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that 2,000 years ago the world was not that much 
different than it is today.  In fact, there are eerie 
coincidences between the state of the world 2,000 years ago and 
the state we find the world in today.  I point out that at that 
time, the time of the city that I walked through, Rome ruled the 
world.  Rome was the superpower and from Rome it ruled all the 
civilized world.  Roman culture was everywhere.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out that we have the same type of situation now, 2,000 
years later, when we have another superpower, the United States, 
that not only is its political influence felt everywhere but so 
too is its cultural influence.  That was precisely the situation 
that existed 2,000 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed Rome was known for its military might.  Not only was it 
tremendously far advanced in the military technology of the day, 
in the type of weapons the Roman soldiers used and the catapults 
and the other kinds of siege weapons that the Romans had 
developed, but it had a tremendous martial spirit so the quality 
of its soldiers was what basically kept the peace in the world of 
2,000 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot help but be struck by the parallel that the United 
States again has a similar military power, an all pervasive 
military power.  Yet we have to remember that pervasive military 
power has been tested, as it was later in Rome, in places like 
Yugoslavia and Somalia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has been found, as was the case 2,000 years ago, is that 
all the military technology in the world does not save a nation 
when it has problems with its soldiers losing the esprit de 
corps, shall we say, and that happened in Rome.  We see that 
again happening in the former Yugoslavia and Somalia where 
despite all the technology the Americans and the United Nations, 
if you will, were not able to control the type of independence 
movement that occurred in these countries.  Indeed, that is 
precisely what happened in the Roman world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we had a kind of global free trade 2,000 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order to ask a question of relevance here.  If this individual is 
speaking on a national highway's program, I fail to see the 
connection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I understand the hon. 
member's point of order but, as the hon. member said earlier, he 
has the contentment of the member for Cumberland—Colchester to 
deviate a bit from the subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  I am sorry that the Reform Party takes 
such an attitude when this is a very historic moment.  I will go 
quickly through it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two thousand years ago global free trade existed.  It is what we 
had in the Roman world, tremendous prosperity because based on 
Rome the entire world was in a situation where trade was centred 
on Rome and Rome became very wealthy but prosperity existed all 
around the Mediterranean rim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to you, Madam Speaker, we have precisely the same 
situation now.  We remember what happened to Rome.  Eventually 
global free trade in Roman times collapsed.  I suggest to you, 
Madam Speaker, we have to remember as we go into the next 
millennium that what we see before us in terms of global free 
trade is only temporary.  We should be worried as Canadians and 
people of the world of the consequences when eventually global 
free trade collapses in this world in this millennium.  We will 
see it, I am sure, in the coming years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have the parallel of climate change.  Two thousand years 
ago in the Roman world in north Africa the desert was green.  Of 
course the reason why the cities are empty in north Africa is 
that there was a major climate change that occurred after the 
year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally is the parallel and so singular between 2,000 years ago 
and today is the fact that 2,000 years ago there was a vacuum in 
religion.  There was a vacuum in organized religion.  They 
accepted gods as being set aside for the rationalism of 
Hellenistic Greece, of Aristotle.  We know that the world as it 
existed then had fragmented into cults and we know then that led 
to the foundation 2,000 years ago of two great religions, because 
2,000 years ago was the birth of Jesus Christ and a few centuries 
later Muhammad arrived on the scene and we now, 2,000 years 
later, have two great religions of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just wanted to take note that we are entering into the new 
millennium.  It is an exciting new millennium and I think that 
this country of all the countries is the best suited for it 
because we leave this century stronger than when we began. 
I believe our democracy and this parliament has demonstrated with 
the civility of our debate, even in the independence questions, 
that we are a model to the rest of the world and that we stand 
the best chances—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
again we have switched Speakers.  I welcome you back to the 
chair.  I want to say how pleased and honoured I am to be 
sponsoring the last private member's motion of the century.  It 
is even called Motion No. 102.  Highway 102 goes through my 
riding, which is kind of coincidental. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Wentworth—Burlington questioned whether his 
speech was relevant.  He was talking about the roads of 2,000 
years ago.  I thought that was relevant because a lot of the time 
when I am on the highways in Nova Scotia they feel as if they are 
2,000 years old, considering the condition they are in.  That is 
why we are here today to talk about a federal-provincial funding 
program for highways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a coincidence, in my previous presentation I talked about 
toll highways.  While I was speaking, the new premier of New 
Brunswick, the honourable Bernard Lord, announced that he agreed 
in principle with the highway development company, Maritime Road 
Development, the company of former minister Doug Young.  They 
have agreed in principle to take the tolls off the New Brunswick 
roads which is a big step, considering the auditor general's 
reports both federally and provincially are against this concept. 
That leaves Nova Scotia with the only toll highway left on the 
Trans-Canada Highway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During some of the comments I was thinking that there should be 
a caution sign at the beginning of any toll highway in Nova 
Scotia for politicians that reads tolls can be hazardous to our 
health.  In New Brunswick the Liberals put tolls on the 
Trans-Canada Highway and they were soundly defeated in the next 
election.  In Nova Scotia the Liberals put tolls on a highway and 
in the next election they were soundly defeated.  In Nova Scotia 
there were 11 federal Liberal MPs before the last election and 
they were all defeated.  A government should be very careful 
before it puts tolls on highways in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to come back to the point that we definitely need a 
highway funding program.  We need a national transportation 
system program that the provinces and all parties involved can 
use for long range planning; predicting the future; planning 
their communities, their routes, safety issues and certainly 
pollution issues; and planning all other things that are 
appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said in the motion, because of our geography it is of the 
utmost importance for Canada to have a proper transportation 
system, especially a national highway system.  It should be a 
priority, as the minister has said over and over again, but he 
has not done anything about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing this debate we urge the minister to make it a 
priority and actually do something about it because there is a 
total vacuum of transportation policy with respect to our 
national highway system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank all colleagues from all parties for participating in the 
debate.  I really appreciate it.  We have heard some excellent 
debate and some excellent ideas.  I wish one and all a merry 
Christmas and a happy new year and a great century.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, at 
the Calgary Zoo today the environment minister will be pointing 
out some endangered species that are moving toward extinction, 
particularly in Calgary.  He will likely be pointing out that the 
dodo bird is gone but a related species, the Joe-Joe bird, is 
also nearing extinction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Joe-Joe bird, sometimes called the Clark, is more 
comfortable nesting in the capital region, but it has recently 
attempted a migration to the west.  Strange, self-destructive 
behaviour is unique to this bird particularly in the west.  The 
top down feeding approach of the Joe-Joe bird means it can never 
contact the grassroots which is so essential for nourishment in 
the west.  The future does not look good for the Joe-Joe bird. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the environment minister does not fail to mention the 
great similarity between the Joe-Joe bird and the gobbling Grit 
goose.  The Grit goose is like the Joe-Joe bird in that its 
behaviour threatens its survival.  The Grit goose takes from 
others and overeats to the point where it cannot move and 
eventually dies from its own weight.  Surprisingly, the eggs that 
are laid by the Joe-Joe bird and the Grit goose are so similar 
that we cannot tell them apart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps some endangered species are not worth saving.  The loss 
of these two might actually help the Canadian environment.

Speaker, today marks the last day of sittings of the 36th

for our country, for all of the bounty, benefits and privileges 
of the good life that we as Canadians enjoy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Sault Ste. Marie it is also appropriate to 
give thanks for all of the forces that have shaped my hometown of 
Sault Ste. Marie, for all of the efforts of the many people who 
have grown our city into an extraordinary community. I 
particularly recognize one man, an American, whose efforts grew 
the population of Sault Ste. Marie from 3,000 to over 30,000 in 
just eight years. 
Francis H. Clerke established a steel mill, paper mill, power 
plant, street car system and much more. These are the industries 
our town continues to depend on to this day.  May his spirit take 
up permanent residence in our city and may his can do attitude 
infect the future generations of the citizens of Sault Ste. 
Marie.

on this last parliamentary day of 1999 I would like to share with 
the House the dream that I and my colleagues have for the new 
millennium and for the century about to begin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a dream that someday soon and the sooner the better,

be valued above all other values and not be always secondary to

we are now cruising complacently toward planetary ecological 
disaster and that creation will in fact be preserved for endless 
millenniums to come.

political struggle and New Democrats commit ourselves to do just 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said that, Mr. Speaker, may I take this opportunity to 
wish all members of the House a Merry Christmas and a Happy New

democratic institutions of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-20 resembles the unilateral patriation of the constitution

Lotbinière at the time, already had what the people of Quebec 
needed.  In his now famous motion, he said “This House is of the

to break away from the Confederation set up in 1867 if, in the 
other provinces, it is felt that Quebec is an obstacle to the 
Union, and to the progress and development of Canada”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Amazingly, 
Mr. Speaker, one-third of all the donors to the Prime Minister's 
1997 campaign got federal government grants, loans or contracts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the case of Fermco Industries is particularly interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fermco gave more than $6,000 to the Prime Minister's campaign 
and to the Liberal's campaign.  Even though the company is in a 
Bloc held riding, the Prime Minister's office intervened to 
ensure it got a transitional jobs fund grant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other than $6,000 in donations, why would the Prime Minister's 
office intervene in the local affairs of the Bloc member? 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, earlier this morning, the federal government announced 
almost three quarters of a billion dollars in assistance to 
alleviate homelessness and help prevent homelessness.  The 
program is working in co-operation with the other levels of 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know why the hon. member did not get up and 
congratulate the government for this initiative instead of making 
these useless insinuations and innuendoes.  It just shows how 
bankrupt his party is of any real interest in helping Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we are wondering why the Deputy Prime Minister did not 
get up and answer the question.  Let us try again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fermco's TJF grant came through despite strong objections by 
senior human resources officials.  The Prime Minister's office 
did an end run around normal procedures and ensured that a major 
donor got a just reward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister, of course, says that he was just trying to 
create jobs.  However, is it the common practice of the Prime 
Minister to intervene on behalf of all TJF applicants or just 
when they donate thousands of dollars to his campaign? 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the common practice of the government is 
to work with communities with high unemployment to ensure that 
they have the opportunities that the rest of Canada has to 
benefit from the successes of our great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it right for us to invest in communities in Quebec to ensure 
the their citizens have opportunities to work?  It is.  Is it 
right for us to invest in communities in Atlantic Canada to 
ensure their citizens have opportunities to work?  It absolutely 
is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it right for us to invest in communities in northern British 
Columbia to ensure that citizens of Canada have opportunities to 
work. It is, and we will continue to do so. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, two non-answers and the government is asking the 
questions when it is supposed to be answering them.  Let us try 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has a pretty impressive investment plan 
going.  If a company wants federal government money, all it has 
to do is donate to the Prime Minister's campaign.  It does not 
even have to be in his riding.  There is a 33% chance that the 
company will hit the jackpot and, boy, are the rewards sweet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fermco donated over $6,000 and ended up with $200,000 in a TJF 
grant despite the fact that a senior official had strong 
objections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the Prime Minister, is there a threshold on the amount a 
company has to donate or will the Prime Minister bend the rules 
for any size donation? 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  We have 
heard the unwarranted, sleazy slur typical of— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I ask the hon. Deputy Prime Minister to stay 
away from words like sleazy on a day like this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray:</B>  Yes, Mr. Speaker, I will stay away from 
the word, but it is still an unwarranted slur.  It is unjustified 
to suggest there is any improper link.  The hon. member should 
not be saying things like that because they are wrong and 
unwarranted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the Prime Minister wants to do the right thing for 
every part of Canada, including Quebec, including ridings held by 
the Bloc and including ridings held by Reform members.  That is 
why he is the Prime Minister.

Mr. Speaker, if 50% plus one were the only way of defining

then be right, that 50% plus one should apply in all 
circumstances, including the case where more than 50% plus one, 
and very probably much more than 50% plus one, of Northern 
aboriginal populations were to vote to stay in Canada?  They 
would then have the right to stay.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the fact that we have a virtual moratorium on building

If approval is given for the sale of a Canadian reactor to 
Turkey, it will be located in a safe location, a long way from 
any of the difficult locations where there have been earthquakes.

Why is it that we have a virtual moratorium on building nuclear 
reactors in this country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bit like the way in which we now sell insecticides and

maximum of two years, plus one year in the community under

as less accountability.

my question is for the Minister of Transport.  On August 27, 
1998, the Department of Transport signed an agreement with the 
Halifax International Airport Authority which included the 
statement: “Transport Canada agrees to continue to be 
responsible for the pyritic slate runoff existing prior to the 
transfer date.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked this question on Wednesday and the minister said there 
had been another agreement signed but did not answer my question.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on 
a question of privilege for which I have already given the Chair 
notice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question of privilege arises from news reports on Wednesday, 
December 15 in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>, Edmonton <I>Journal</I> 
and <I>National Post</I> each of which made reference to the 
report of the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans tabled 
Thursday, December 16 in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw the Speaker's attention to the following quote which 
appeared in each of these newspapers cited. 
It stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To accommodate the treaty right the government should encourage 
native participation in the fishery through a program which 
provides native fishermen with a down payment on a licence and 
vessel and a competitive loan to cover the outstanding value of 
the assets purchased.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each newspaper identified that statement as one section of the 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would draw to the Speaker's attention the recommendation 
section of the Reform Party's minority report as appended to the 
committee report.  In that section there appears a quote on page 
43 which is identical to the one I have read. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I further point out that even I as chair did not have access to 
that minority report until Thursday, December 16 and that 
appeared in the paper on Wednesday, December 15. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would draw the Speaker's attention to the fact that in two of 
the newspaper accounts, the title of the report for which that 
quotation was supposedly extracted was provided to the media as 
“The Marshall Decision and Beyond:  Implications for the 
Management of Atlantic Fisheries”.  That title as provided to 
the media is of course the title of the report as tabled in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Neither the title of the report nor the contents of the Reform 
Party's minority report were disclosed in any way by the 
committee in public session.  Both of these were provided to the 
media without the consent of the committee and therefore in 
violation of the rules of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my contention that providing the media with what was 
attributed as being part of the standing committee's report has 
violated the privileges not only of the members who dedicated 
themselves to the work of this committee but to all members of 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My remarks are not directed toward the contents which were 
contained in the Reform Party's minority report.  My concern is 
that someone provided the media with that minority report and 
obviously implied that what they were providing was part of the 
committee's report.  That was done, I would submit, intentionally 
and maliciously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by saying that this unfortunately is not the first 
time a report of the standing committee on fisheries has been 
leaked to the media prior to its being tabled in the House. The 
difference this time is that there appears to be little doubt, in 
fact absolutely no doubt, as to the source of the violation of 
the privileges of the members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Speaker finds that I have a prima facie case of 
privilege, I am prepared to move the appropriate motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleagues, on this particular point that 
is being brought forward, I notice that no member is named in 
this question of privilege.  As such, we cannot get any response 
from one of our members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said a few times in the House and outside that the House 
itself and its members must look to each other with the type of 
respect so that this type of thing will not happen, as in any 
other leak of documents.  Unless and until the procedural 
committee or indeed the House informs me as to what can be done 
about this generally, we have to rely on the members themselves 
to police themselves to see that this does not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I appeal to all hon. members that if they are on 
committees and there are reports, that if they have possession of 
these reports they should not be releasing them until the 
committee that they are with approves the report so that it can 
be released hopefully in the House, but at least not prematurely.

about it, but on the same day that we are talking about leaky 
condos, we call attention once again to the leaky parliamentary 
culture that we have here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to make the point that it is not just committee 
reports that are being leaked, that is reprehensible enough, but 
there has also been a persistent strategy on the part of the 
government to leak its own proposals before parliament gets to 
know about them. 
We get a kind of tit for tat culture here.  It is not good for 
the institution.  It is not good for anybody.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do 
appreciate this because I have been on the finance committee now 
for two years.  I think every committee report has been leaked 
beforehand.  Even the most recent one on the prebudget hearings 
was leaked the day before. The quotations in the paper said “a 
Liberal member who did not want to be identified said” and there 
were direct quotations from it.  It is a great problem and I 
really wish we could solve it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise to reintroduce 
this bill.  It was previously on the Order Paper in the last 
session of parliament.  It seeks to re-establish tax equity for 
Canadian residents who pay taxes on social security payments 
received from the U.S. government. These taxpayers have been 
forced to incur an 85% tax increase as a result of the fourth tax 
protocol between Canada and the United States. There are seniors 
on fixed incomes who cannot afford this outrageous increase. This 
bill would rectify that problem.

a bill which I introduced in the last session.  It had been 
debated but was not deemed votable notwithstanding the fact that 
it has the support of the Royal Canadian Legion and all the 
veterans' organizations in Canada.  We have also received the

</I></B></P><P align=left>This will probably not be a very popular bill in this place, but 
it will be popular among Canadians because it seeks to eliminate 
the special provision in the Income Tax Act which allows 
politicians alone, elected members of parliament, senators, MPPs, 
et cetera, to exempt the equivalent of a third of their taxable 
income from the taxes we impose on everyone else. It essentially 
calls for the same standard of taxation in terms of the laws that 
we impose on all Canadians.  I think that this is in the interest 
of equity.
