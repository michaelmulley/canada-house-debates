</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
this historic budget day I am pleased to present a petition 
signed by a number of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the House 
that our police officers and firefighters are required to place 
their lives at risk on a daily basis and that employment benefits 
of police officers and firefighters often do not provide 
sufficient compensation to families when one of them loses their 
life in the line of duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They would also like to point out that the public mourn that 
loss of a firefighter or a police officer killed in the line of 
duty and wish to support in a tangible way the surviving families 
in their time of need. The petitioners therefore ask Parliament 
to establish a public safety officers compensation fund for the 
benefit of families of public safety officers who are killed in 
the line of duty.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>QUESTIONS ON THE ORDER PAPER 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
following question will be answered today: No. 58. 
.[Text] 
<Question No. 58—<B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the minister of National Defence indicate when and how 
many civilian and military jobs will be terminated as a result of 
the national defence planning guidelines of 1998 and whether these 
jobs will be replaced by tenders from the private sector? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence):</B> The 
defence planning guide, DPG, 1998, did not direct any new military 
personnel reductions.  Nor did it assign any new civilian 
workforce reductions.  However, DPG 98 mandates the continuation 
of reductions resulting from departmental strategies to cope with 
previous budget reductions and to meet the personnel targets of 
approximately 60,000 military and 20,000 civilians assigned in 
the 1994 white paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian forces and the Department of National Defence must 
be able to deliver the missions which the government defined in 
the 1994 defence white paper in the most cost effective way 
possible and within the constraints of available funding. The 
department is embarking upon new initiatives that may impact upon 
employment in the support functions of the department and the 
Canadian forces. Options being considered are various alternative 
service delivery, ASD, mechanisms such as: inter alia, private 
sector contracts; in house bids; employee takeover; partnering 
and collaboration between government and the private sector; and 
privatizing. Our reviews of ASD initiatives will allow for fair 
consultation and involvement of all stakeholders and interested 
parties including management, employees, unions, industry, local 
communities, and other government departments.  Principles are 
in place to guide decision making on ASD initiatives, and the 
review of these initiatives from analysis to implementation may 
take up to 24 months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is too soon to tell what the impact upon jobs will be, but 
the Department of National Defence and the Canadian forces are

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will be using the 20 minutes or whatever portion of 
time you deem I have remaining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset I wish to indicate that I will endeavour to stay 
as relevant as possible during my remarks today.  I know how 
important it is to the Speaker that we remain on topic when we 
address bills and that is my intention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was unfortunately cut off from further debate on Friday, 
I was at that part in my presentation where I was talking about 
Bill C-19 as it relates to farmers and as it relates to the 
transport of farm products and commodities throughout the land. 
At the end of my remarks I said that despite government claims to 
the contrary, Bill C-19 will not guarantee that grain will be 
transported to its destination.  I will pick up where I left off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was just a couple of years ago in 1995 when western farmers 
saw rail traffic come to a grinding halt.  Now these farmers are 
haunted by the very real possibility of another rail strike or a 
lockout this spring because the agreement that brought an end to 
the 1995 strike expired in December.  Bill C-19 will do 
absolutely nothing to stop that from happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I discovered during debate on Bill C-4, an act to amend the 
Canadian Wheat Board Act, which was rammed through the House 
under closure, this government gives farmers little priority. 
Farmers are not getting the attention and substantive legislation 
they deserve from this Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On many occasions we have seen work stoppages in the national 
transportation and grain handling sectors.  In 1987 there was a 
five day dispute between the railways and their union.  Late that 
same year there was a 42 day work stoppage between Prince Rupert 
Grain Ltd. and the Grain Workers Union which resulted in some 
very heavy financial losses.  In 1991 there was a 16 day dispute 
between the Department of Transport and the public service union. 
As I mentioned earlier there was a 20 day work stoppage in 1995 
during a dispute between the railways and their unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all of those cases the federal government followed through 
with back to work legislation.  This is a patchwork method of 
ensuring the continuation of essential services.  Both management 
and unions have little incentive to negotiate in good faith. Both 
parties come to rely on back to work legislation as a way to 
eventually end the work dispute but it is divisive and simply 
means that labour disputes will flare up again all too soon. This 
will certainly be the case this spring if the rail workers and 
management cannot come to an agreement.  Grain farmers will be 
saying “Here we go again”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These stoppages in our transportation system have very serious 
ramifications for our reputation on the international stage as a 
reliable shipper of farm commodities.  As agriculture critic for 
the official opposition I can say that— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am being heckled by members 
across the way which is a standard operating procedure in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers are very cognizant of these serious ramifications and 
Canadians are very aware that when these stoppages occur our 
international reputation is greatly damaged.  We all want to 
protect against this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been several occasions where back to work legislation 
appeared to be the only alternative to end a dispute and provide 
relief to those losing thousands, even millions, of dollars due 
to work stoppage.  It is not the only alternative available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not Reform's policy to simply criticize a policy but to 
proactively come up with concrete alternatives and legislation 
that will provide substantive change. In the case of labour 
disputes, we are confident that final offer selection arbitration 
is the best hope for getting a settlement.  It requires both 
sides to act in good faith and lessens some of the bitter 
aftermath of a strike or a lockout.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government members in the House take the time to 
listen while I elaborate on this process.  It is an excellent 
alternative to back to work legislation that they will find 
attractive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back to work legislation undermines the collective bargaining 
process.  Final offer selection arbitration kicks in only after a 
union and an employer cannot come to an agreement.  Together they 
must agree on and recommend an arbitrator or arbitration 
panel.  The union and the employer must give the arbitrator a 
list of the issues they cannot agree on and a list of the 
issues they have agreed on.  For the disputed issues the 
arbitrator receives from each party a final offer for settlement. 
The arbitrator will then select one of the final offers.  His 
offer is binding on both parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this means is that both sides will be forced to make 
reasonable offers.  Each will want the arbitrator to pick their 
offer or they will be forced to live with the offer made by the 
other party.  Therefore to provide a better chance that the 
arbitrator accepts their offer, I believe that both the union and 
the employer will make a good attempt at being more than 
reasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This concept is simple and it avoids prolonged work stoppages or 
back to work legislation.  The entire nature of the collective 
bargaining process can be improved in the long term.  Unions and 
employers will become more aware of the reality of final offer 
selection arbitration and will be more inclined to habitually 
negotiate in good faith.  As a result unions and employers will 
become more focused on negotiations instead of the political 
ploys and media stunts that are seen frequently in current labour 
disputes where back to work legislation looms on the horizon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to digress at this point and explain to viewers 
back home in a simpler way and use an analogy.  In business there 
is a common practice for partners who are in business together. I 
am sure you are well aware of this, Mr. Speaker.  You have been 
in business for a number of years in different enterprises over 
your working life in the real world.  I am certain you can 
appreciate what I am going to talk about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that when people enter into a partnership 
sometimes they are concerned about what may happen in the future. 
They enter into what is commonly referred to as a shotgun 
agreement.  How does a shotgun agreement work?  If you come to an 
impasse where one of the partners wants to leave the partnership 
and wants to sell his side to the other partner or see the 
business sold, the agreement protects the partner who is still in 
the enterprise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You have to make a reasonable offer.  Under the terms of that 
agreement, if you put too high a value on your half of the 
company, let us say you have a 50:50 share in a corporation, the 
shotgun agreement allows the other partner to say “that is too 
high, you pay me that amount and instead of me buying you out at 
<I>x</I> dollars, you buy me out”. This is similar in a way to 
final offer selection arbitration. It forces both sides in a 
potential dispute to be reasonable.  It forces them to come up 
with a reasonable offer, because there is a certain amount of 
fear that if they do not have the most reasonable offer the other 
side's offer will be accepted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I use that because a lot of farmers I am pleased to 
represent are well aware of shotgun agreements and how they 
work. It might better help them to understand what we are talking 
about when we talk about final offer selection arbitration and 
how that could force both sides to be more reasonable and force 
them to the middle ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has jurisdiction over approximately 10% 
of the labour force.  Federal legislation and the Canadian Labour 
Code affect 700,000 employees.  The federal government has an 
opportunity and an obligation, I suggest, to set an example in 
labour relations.  The advantages and benefits that would arise 
from the use of final offer selection arbitration by the federal 
government have the potential to resonate through the entire 
Canadian labour force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have said, there are a number of flaws contained in Bill 
C-19.  I am primarily concerned with the substance it lacks in 
order that farmers can avoid the dire consequences of work 
stoppages.  There are several aspects of this bill that are 
nothing short of alarming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 109.1 gives the Canada Industrial Relations Board 
authority to order an employer to release names and addresses of 
off site workers to union recruiters. 
I can hardly believe this government would consider this kind of 
legislation in today's society where we are supposed to be 
knowledgeable about the risks to personal privacy and safety.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under no circumstances should individual rights be compromised, 
particularly to initiate unsolicited contact from any 
organization or individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of Reform's amendments to Bill C-19 put forward by my hon. 
colleague would have at least given employees the freedom to 
choose whether their names and addresses were released. This is a 
fundamental right and I am astonished that I am even debating 
this issue in this House. How can this government justify 
violating an individual's right to privacy?  We should think 
about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other options available to ensure that off site 
workers have access to union information and activities without 
going to this extreme. This is certainly not the way to go about 
it. There is no evidence of fairness and balance in a bill which 
jeopardizes personal rights, privacy and safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to get to one other issue also contained in the bill that 
I am very concerned about. Under this section the minister will 
not guarantee Canadian workers under federal jurisdiction the 
right to participate in secret ballot representation votes to 
determine whether a union will represent them.  There is a 
section in this bill that will allow that.  We should just think 
about this for a moment. They will not get a secret vote. This 
bill is actually an attack on democracy and I feel very strongly 
about this. It kind of reminds me of another bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said at the outset, Mr. Speaker, regarding your concern 
about relevance, I do not want to digress too much but it is very 
similar to a bill that was recently rammed through this House 
with the use of closure, Bill C-4, the amendments to the Canadian 
Wheat Board Act, which I referred to briefly in my remarks 
earlier this morning. Why does it remind me of that bill? 
Democracy delayed is democracy denied, and freedom delayed is 
freedom denied. That is what happened with Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-4, this government and the Minister responsible for the 
Canadian Wheat Board had the opportunity to act and to grant 
farmers some freedom.  What did we see?  We saw them completely 
flout democracy and it has been denied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the minister if he intends to sit idly by and watch 
farmers be thrown in jail for protesting what they view as a 
fundamental issue of democracy and freedom, the right to sell 
their own product.  Obviously with the passage of Bill C-4 he 
does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, Bill C-19 gives the Canada Industrial Relations Board 
jurisdiction to certify a trade union that does not have a 
majority support “where, but for the unfair labour practice, the 
union could reasonably have been expected to have had the support 
of the majority of the employees in a unit”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine that.  What we see here is an attack on democracy. No 
secret vote, and it will be left to this Canada Industrial 
Relations Board to make this arbitrary decision to certify a 
union despite the fact that it will not have any clear signal 
whether the majority of the workers in that workplace wish to be 
represented by that union.  Think about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Neither the Canada Industrial Relations Board nor any other body 
has the capacity to rationally discharge a task which involves 
nothing more than wild speculation. If an employer has committed 
an unfair labour practice the board should sanction the employer, 
not deprive workers of their fundamental democratic right to vote 
on the wisdom of union representation. 
Certainly I am in agreement with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I see you are indicating, unfortunately. It is 
amazing how quickly time goes when a person is concerned about 
this legislation and the attack on democracy built into Bill 
C-19.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am curious that the member would take a position that seems to 
be contradictory.  On the one hand he talks about final offer 
arbitration or final offer selection as being the panacea to all 
the problems in the labour movement which would virtually 
eliminate strikes and take away collective bargaining.  It would 
simply put it into a “you put your best foot forward and I will 
put mine” and that will be the end of that.  Then with the same 
breath the member talks in terms of protecting the democratic 
rights of the workers he purports to be representing in this 
speech.  I find those two positions rather contradictory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly collective bargaining in the labour movement is a time 
tested tradition that ensures that the workers have their say and 
have the ability to negotiate for their future and their 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Reform Party would do in this case would be to strip 
the workers of their democratic right and then on the other hand 
try to pretend they are champions of their democratic rights 
because they want them to be able to vote on certification, even 
if 90% of them have signed cards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even Mike Harris in Ontario has not gone as far in the extreme 
as the Reform Party.  I wonder if the member might have some 
comments on those remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to add my 
comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The audacity of the member opposite knows no bounds.  It is just 
incredible.  This is the government whose answer to labour 
disputes is to legislate people back to work.  In the autocratic, 
top down way in which this Liberal government operates all we 
have to do is hearken back to pre-Christmas.  It is not that long 
ago.  Certainly the hon. member's memory should go back that far 
to the Canada Post dispute where the Liberals sat on their duffs 
and did absolutely nothing when they knew that dispute was going 
to flare up.  Everyone in the country knew it was coming but they 
did nothing. They knew in the end they would simply legislate 
them back to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the hon. member's answer on how to respect democracy 
and how to respect worker rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Final offer selection arbitration, despite the opinion of the 
member opposite, would augment the collective bargaining process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> It would destroy it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  It would not destroy it. It is shameful 
what this Liberal government will do with labour relations and 
what it is attempting to do with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member wondered if I would like to comment.  Yet I get 
up to comment and now he is saying he has heard enough because he 
does not like what he hears. Let me finish.  This is my time.  It 
is questions and comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member has 
raised such passions.  There are so many people who wish to ask 
questions.  We have to keep it moving.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask my hon. colleague from the Reform Party what he thinks 
about the fact that this bill contains no anti-scab provisions like 
those Quebec adopted in harmony in 1977. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a situation where consensus was lacking on this sensitive 
matter, even in 1985 when Mr. Bourassa's Liberals were elected, the 
Quebec premier refused to give in to the demands of Mr. Scowen, one 
of his MNAs, and even a minister at one point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later on, in 1991, the Conseil du Patronat, despite a 
judgement in its favour from the Supreme Court, backed down in 
light of the social peace and harmony that had reigned in Quebec 
since the passing of the anti-scab legislation in 1977.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The right to honour picket lines is a simple right that all 
private citizens may use should she/he desire.  However if you 
happen to work for a railway in this country you do not have this 
right and must face the humiliation and degradation day after 
day, time after time as long as the Canada Labour Code in its 
present form forces working class people to cross picket lines. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear my hon. colleague's opinion on the fact 
that this time the government lacks the courage to amend the Canada 
Labour Code in that direction. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his comments and his question.  Unlike the comment which came 
from across the way, he certainly brought forward some valid 
points.  Unlike the Liberals who rise in debate on this very 
important legislation, obviously the member has given some 
thought to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He refers to the fact that he does not see anything specific in 
the bill which deals with anti-scab workers.  I hate that term. 
It is very derogatory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My understanding is that the bill gives the real power to the 
Canada Industrial Relations Board, the CIRB, to decide on the 
question of replacement workers.  We have some concerns about 
that because the board will be under incredible pressure from the 
unions.  The unions will say that replacement workers in a strike 
situation should not be allowed, even if it puts the corporation 
in an untenable position, in a position where the corporation 
might actually have to close its doors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak not on behalf of corporations when I say that, but on 
behalf of the workers themselves.  We only have to look at the 
situation which developed in Edmonton where the meat packing 
plant had to shut down.  Ultimately who was hurt?  It was the 
workers themselves who were out of work and who lost their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I speak to this issue it is not only out of concern for the 
shareholders and the company, but for the workers themselves.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Labour, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to say to the 
hon. member that on June 2 the people chose Liberals to govern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we ran we heard about Bill C-19 on the campaign trail. 
There was a great deal of support for Bill C-19. I question the 
member being so vehement about it because he must have heard the 
same things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read a letter which I received from a farmer out in 
western Canada:  “Bill C-19 with section 87.7 is an important 
first step in preventing labour disputes from stopping the flow 
of grain out of our ports.  I urge you to facilitate the rapid 
passage of Bill C-19 with section 87.7 intact.  The future of the 
western Canadian grain industry will be very positively impacted 
by this step”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would urge the member to act on behalf of his constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is absolutely amazing, 
astounding actually, how Liberal members opposite can distort the 
facts and what is in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member had been in the House during my very brief 
speech on Friday, I referred to the fact that there are some 
people out there who are lobbying all members of this House to 
pass this legislation.  Why is that?  Because they say it is 
better than nothing. I said in my opening remarks that the 
official opposition wants to see legislation which is much better 
than just better than nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have serious concerns about this legislation.  The reality is 
that this bill does nothing to help move grain from the farm gate 
to the port.  History will show that is where the disruption 
takes place.  The Liberals brought forward Bill C-19 which 
narrowly defines how to settle a dispute problem at the port. 
They are holding it up as the be all and end all.  It is 
absolutely ridiculous and she knows it.

I will be sharing my time with my colleague, the hon. member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Orléans. I will therefore be making a 10-minute 
speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are debating Bill C-19, an act to amend the Canada Labour Code, 
Part I. This bill stems from another bill, Bill C-66, which died on the 
Order Paper last spring because, six months before the end of the 
traditional four-year mandate, the current Prime Minister decided to 
call an election, thus taking some opposition parties unawares. 
He saw what was happening in the maritimes and, sensing that the 
Employment Insurance Act was not going down too well, he chose to take 
the other political parties by surprise. Many bills, including this one, 
died on the Order Paper as a result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He probably made the right decision from an election point of view, 
since he kept his majority, although the actual number of Liberal 
members is lower. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite this delay, the problem with Bill C-19 is the same as with 
calling an election early: it leaves some unfinished business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many respects, as our critic on this issue, the hon. member for 
Trois-Rivières, indicated, there are many improvements, many positives. 
But there are also serious deficiencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are these main deficiencies? First, RCMP employees are not 
included. 
The bill does not address their expressed wish to become subject to the 
labour code, to be unionized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also falls short of the expectations of federal employees, the 
Public Service Alliance of Canada. Government employees are subject to 
the Public Service Staff Relations Act instead of the Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, federal public service employees do not enjoy the 
same kind of job security as their Quebec counterparts. 
There is not as much job security in the federal public service. One 
only has to look, for example, at the cuts being made in the Quebec City 
region by the defence department, which are affecting large numbers of 
people. Many federal public servants are left to fend for themselves, 
because these cuts have been made over a three-year period that will end 
at the end of March, with no replacement program and no early retirement 
program in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the federal government doing? It is in the process of 
privatizing its public service. The public service has been trying to 
continue to provide government services by contracting out, which is a 
strange way of doing things. This is not the object of today's debate. 
I just wanted to say that, unfortunately, the Canada Labour Code does 
not apply to these public servants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois opposes some of the proposed amendments to the 
Canada Labour Code because they do not meet Quebeckers' needs. I do not 
know if they meet the needs of people in the other regions of the 
country—I will leave it to the other parties to judge—but we want 
to protect Quebeckers' interests, even if the Canada Labour Code affects 
only 10% of unionized workers in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three groups of workers in Quebec. First, there are those 
who are not unionized and who, of course, are not protected by 
collective agreements. Nothing will change for these workers. Then there 
are those who are regulated by the Quebec labour code, which includes 
provisions prohibiting the use of replacement workers, commonly called 
scabs. Finally, the third and last group is those 10% of Quebeckers who 
are subject to the Canada Labour Code.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who are they?  They are people working in banks, in 
interprovincial and international transportation, airports 
obviously and all the airport transportation companies, all the 
airlines, broadcasting, telecommunications, harbour operations, 
longshoremen and grain handlers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take a closer look at the last two categories, 
because in the Quebec City region right now there is a strike 
that, for a number of reasons, has dragged on in the Port of 
Quebec.  The same parties may not always be at fault, but it is 
recognized that, since the introduction of anti-scab legislation 
in Quebec, strikes—and this is important—are 35% shorter than 
before.  Anti-scab legislation is therefore one way of limiting 
the length of strikes. It does not increase, but decreases, the 
length of strikes, a very important point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was listening to what the Reform member had to say. 
Although he is opposed, he said that strikes should not go on too 
long.  The very benefit of anti-scab legislation is that it 
prevents strikes from dragging on longer than necessary.  I 
remember some long strikes in Quebec, for instance that of the 
Ogilvie workers, because they are in the grain sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to another point.  Why grain and not potatoes? 
Why not butter?  Why not other food products considered essential, 
such as milk?  Why grain?  We Quebeckers import grain because we do 
not produce enough of our own.  We import, or receive I should say, 
western grain and then ship it to international markets through our 
ports, particularly those along the St. Lawrence Seaway, but we 
also use it to raise hogs, cattle, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, what has been the result in Quebec City?  There have been 
cases of violence.  The absence of anti-scab legislation affects 
not just the length of strikes, but the incidence of violence.  I 
am not condoning violence.  I do not think violence should be 
condoned.  But the fact remains that, when a strike drags on and 
scabs might be or are used, the result is almost always violence in 
labour relations. 
When violence occurs before a strike ends, there can be physical 
effects and problems in terms of labour relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a matter of just settling a labour dispute, but of 
settling it well.  The parties, and this is the advantage of a 
negotiated settlement, must reach a collective agreement that they 
both will honour following negotiations.  The resulting work 
atmosphere is better as is productivity.  The company is better off 
in terms of profits, and the workers are better off, because 
greater profits mean better benefits and collective agreements for 
the workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This should be the aim of the Canada Labour Code. 
Instead, measures in these areas remain for the most part unchanged 
and a practice that even Quebec employers have shunned since 1977, 
that is the use of replacement workers, will be allowed to 
continue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to have this opportunity to address this bill.  It is 
one of the most debilitating bills that has ever entered this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When all the countries in the world are moving away from this 
whole concept of forced unionism, forced compliance to join 
unions, Canada is going in the opposite direction. 
Some 101 countries have legislation to prohibit closed door 
operations like unions.  Canada and Australia are the only two 
countries that look in the other direction.  This bill is moving 
in the opposite direction to that of the rest of the world.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the dissertation of the Bloc member in which he 
talked about Quebec.  Knowing it is coming from the Bloc, 
everything is about Quebec.  There is nothing about the rest of 
the country although they sit in opposition.  I will ask the 
member from Quebec about his charter of rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The province of Quebec has a charter of rights and freedoms. 
Section 10 states that every person has the right to full and 
equal recognition and exercise of his human rights and freedoms 
without distinction, exclusion or preference.  Section 13 states 
that no one may in a judicial act stipulate a clause involving 
discrimination.  Such a clause is deemed without effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this bill there is a violation of human rights.  Part of that 
violation centres around the release of names to a union of those 
who are working off site.  The member over here called those 
individuals scabs.  I do not agree with that.  I think they are 
legitimate people trying to earn a decent living.  They are 
filling a vacancy— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The hon. member for 
Lévis in response. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am obliged to respect the 
opinions of the Reform member, because he is saying that we in the 
Bloc defend the interests of Quebec.  I will not deny it.  He is 
absolutely right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is here mainly to defend Quebec's 
interests. Our candidates ran only in Quebec—as you can see, we 
have no members from Ontario or the West—but we still maintain 
a dialogue with people from the other provinces, like those in the 
West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difference is obvious.  I am not saying my colleague does 
not represent his part of the country well, but there is clearly a 
different mentality. 
I have always maintained there were two countries within Canada, 
and the Reform member is confirming the fact.  Things are quite 
different in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it bothers me to hear people saying that giving more 
rights to workers as a group is a step backwards.  When we respect 
individual rights more, it is in fact a step forward.  This is not 
what we are seeing in the western world.  The 101 countries—I do 
not know where he got them from—but, generally speaking, the 
number of social measures in OECD countries is on the rise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of the Quebec charter of rights, he forgot a 
number of sections.  He might also have mentioned the United 
Nations' charter.  It supports freedoms of expression and of 
association.  Employees of a company have the fundamental right to 
join together in a union to collectively defend their individual 
rights. 
As individuals, they could never manage it on their own. 
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport—Montmorency—Orléans, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, right off I would like to say how much pleasure it gives 
me to speak to this bill, especially to two parts of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before my election to Parliament in 1993, I worked in labour 
relations for 16 years.  I was able to see, through my own 
experience, how a labour relations system should be built to ensure 
harmonious relations in an organization.  This is the aim. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1050"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT10"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT10"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1050

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aim primarily is to ensure the parties agree and that they 
provide for mechanisms to settle their disputes.  The situation 
would essentially be the same in a relationship or in a household 
when, in the course of a row, one person brings out the marriage 
contract and says it contains no provision for what the other wants 
and so the other does not need it or is entitled to it and so on. 
It would not be a pleasant situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not always carry a collective agreement around in our 
pockets.  What we are talking about is GCS, as we call it, good 
common sense, where the aim is to try to reach an understanding. 
Unfortunately, there can be hitches, as there are in a 
relationship, and if the hitches are major, separation has to be 
considered as a possibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I want to say to you is that Quebec is in the forefront 
in labour relations, despite what my colleague, the member for 
Calgary Northeast, may think when he cites various pieces of 
legislation.  I am not alone in saying that.  Our viewers are 
should read with papers on labour relations. Whether they be by 
professors from York University in Toronto or Simon Fraser 
University in British Columbia, everyone agrees that Quebec is a 
leader in labour relations.  Should we apologize because we are at 
the front?  Should we bring up the rear? The fact is, we are in the 
forefront. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In second place in the field of labour relations is British 
Columbia.  I believe that province elected 24 or 25 Reform members 
in the recent elections. 
My numbers may not be quite right, but there are a good many Reform 
members from British Columbia, another province leading the field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore hope that Reform members who, like us, must be in 
close touch with their constituents, will be representing the views 
of the majority of those who voted for them.  I have pointed this 
out at the beginning of my speech so that members will understand 
where I am coming from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I would like to mention a current situation that is 
clear proof of a misinformation campaign by our Liberal friends 
opposite.  As the transportation critic, I was phoned at home on 
the weekend by workers governed by the Canada Labour Code.  I also 
received faxes at the office.  Basically, the comments were as 
follows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read one of them:  “This week in the House, the Bloc 
Quebecois said it was not supporting Bill C-19, primarily because 
it did not contain antiscab legislation”.  That is true.  “The Bloc 
Quebecois' message was heard loud and clear this week”. That is 
true.  There is no longer a need to hold up this bill in the 
House. That is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another comment reads:  “I am worried by the fact that the 
Bloc Quebecois still intends to have four or five members speak in 
the House when the planned second reading resumes today, February, 
March 24.  If you must speak in the House at this point, please do 
not prevent second reading from wrapping up on Tuesday the 24th. 
There is no point in delaying a bill”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have many examples of comments that were faxed to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is going on is obvious. I asked the workers who 
telephoned me over the weekend why they were calling us.  The Bloc 
Quebecois is not filibustering over Bill C-19. 
We are simply here to express the unanimous position of the labour 
relations community in Quebec.  As proof, I will quote from the 
briefs of three central labour bodies, which were presented during 
hearings held in 1995 to examine this legislative reform before the 
standing committee responsible for labour issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CSN's brief reads as follows:  “To begin with, it should 
be remembered that antiscab provisions did not meet with unanimous 
approval when they were first introduced in Quebec.  These fears 
proved unfounded, so unfounded that antiscab provisions are now no 
longer questioned, and can be said to be generally accepted in 
Quebec”.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the FTQ's brief, “it is essential for workers under 
federal jurisdiction to be able at last to benefit from anti-scab 
legislation.  The federal code must be amended to include all 
those who work for crown corporations or private companies”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CLC stated it was their “firm opinion that employer use of 
replacement workers during strikes and lockouts imposes needless 
and harmful tensions on labour-management relations”. 
Unfortunately, I must reply to them on television because I have 
been unable to contact them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find the Liberals' misinformation campaign indecent, to say 
the least. They have managed to plant the idea into these 
workers' heads that the Bloc is responsible for delaying passage 
of Bill C-19.  We do not agree with the bill, but we are not 
filibustering on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not agree with the bill, particularly because there is no 
anti-scab clause.  There are five or six points in all on which 
we do not agree.  Our colleague, the hon. member for 
Trois-Rivières, illustrated those points very well yesterday. Why 
are we saying we do not agree with this bill because it contains 
no anti-scab clauses? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a wonderful motto in Quebec. Our motto is “Je me 
souviens”, I remember.  We remember the United Aircraft, now Pratt 
& Whitney, dispute at Longueuil, in 1976. 
We remember the numerous and endless postal conflicts over the past 
30 or 35 years, when fights actually broke out.  We remember the 
1973 conflict at Montreal radio station CJMS.  We remember the 
Nationair conflict, when they kept their flights going by using 
strikebreakers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We remember the Ogilvie Mills conflict, in which CSN members 
faced a multinational that was intent on crushing them.  We 
remember the Royal Bank—the poor old Royal Bank, with its billions 
in profits in 1997—and its conflict in Kénogami from 1980 to 1982, 
which lasted close to a year and a half. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Je me souviens”, I remember the strike currently going on in the 
Quebec City port. I also remember the recent strike of Air Alliance 
pilots, who worked hard to have their rights recognized, while their 
employer was renting aircraft from the private market to continue to fly 
people, even though the company's pilots were on strike. This is why I 
say to Air Alliance pilots that we agree Bill C-19 will correct certain 
things, but we also know that, as parliamentarians, we have a 
responsibility, which is to condemn injustices and to make sure the 
Liberals make good on their commitments. The Liberals use double talk: 
they say one thing when they sit in opposition, and another when they 
are in office. The Liberal government is talking out of both sides of 
its mouth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not the Bloc Quebecois. We are here to defend the position and the 
rights of Quebec's workers. 
It is unacceptable that the 115 000 workers who have the misfortune, if 
you will, of being regulated by the Canada Labour Code cannot enjoy the 
same protection as those covered by the Quebec labour code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should workers governed by the Canada Labour Code be treated 
like second class citizens? This is totally unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that Air Alliance pilots, who are currently involved in a 
dispute with Air Canada pilots, will benefit from the bill. Therefore, 
it is out of the question for the Bloc Quebecois to unduly delay this 
legislation. As parliamentarians, we have a job to do and we hope the 
bill will follow its course. It will be referred to a committee that 
will hear witnesses who will submit briefs. The Bloc Quebecois will not 
delay the process in any way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we want first and foremost? We want social peace and 
harmony for Quebec businesses.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am rising to speak on behalf of my constituents at 
this point.  I have three questions for the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been at least two bills in the last week that have 
come before this House, extreme government bills, that have 
really polarized the people rather than bringing them together. 
The speech which was just given is a prime example of one region 
being pitted against another region through this bill, as it was 
through Bill C-4.  I want to give three examples and three 
questions to illustrate what I am talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Crow benefit was done away with by the Liberal government a 
few years ago with the intention that it would promote 
diversification.  We now have Bill C-19 before the House which 
works contrary to that.  The diversification is now beginning to 
take place.  Farmers are beginning to grow products besides the 
traditional grains.  One example is that they are going into the 
cubing of alfalfa, hay.  They are making these into cubes.  That 
is not included in this legislation, so it discourages farmers 
from trying to diversify because it is not included.  I do not 
know if that is an oversight by the government, but it is serious 
concern of the people in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They should not simply have a few products covered by this.  It 
should include all products.  Farmers do not just grow grains 
anymore.  The government should take that to heart.  My question 
is should all products not be included? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing the member talked about was strike breakers or 
scabs as some of the Bloc people are calling them— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I am sorry to interrupt 
the hon. member but we have only five minutes for questions and 
comments.  There is another to come.  We must give the hon. 
member time to respond. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member only had the time 
to talk about alfalfa; however, I would have liked him—but I am not 
surprised as you must maintain control over our proceedings—to ask me 
about strike-breakers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that I am much more interested in his opinion on the 
anti-stribreaking provision than his comment on alfalfa and growing 
alfalfa with other types of grain, or who should be in charge of 
applying the labour code. I will just respond briefly to the first part 
of his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week, three bills were introduced, showing polarization 
between regions of Canada. 
It is true that there are many provisions that cause a polarization 
between regions of Canada, and that is why we in Quebec consider at any 
rate that your country is not necessarily our country. That is why we 
say the current system does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the distinct nature of Quebec, we feel there should be 
new talks leading to a new partnership between the two sovereign states 
of Canada and Quebec. This polarization is becoming increasing clear, 
and the current Liberal government tends to prove it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking forward to the next referendum, when, three days 
before referendum day, the rest of Canada will come and tell us how much 
they care. I cannot wait to see that. After all the instances of 
polarization since 1995, they come and tell us “We love you, 
Quebec”. 
You mean “We love you, Quebec, when you are on your knees”.

thus far was the Canadian Industrial Relations Board and its 
powers, authority and how it plays out in the whole scheme of 
things when it comes to labour relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This board is set up much like the immigration refugee board. It

debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, today we are debating Bill C-19, proposed changes to the 
Canada Labour Code. I hope Canadians watching these debates will 
take special notice of what the government is trying to pull on 
us here, because this is a very important debate which has 
tremendous ramifications for Canadian workers, for the bargaining 
units that represent them, for business and job creators and 
therefore for the well-being of our society, particularly for the 
democratic rights and freedoms which we thought we enjoyed in 
this country and which the Liberals are substantially attacking 
with this terrible piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation completely violates fundamental Canadian values 
and denies basic protections to Canadian workers. This concerns 
the official opposition and I hope all opposition parties 
tremendously.  I hope government members will stand up and demand 
that this piece of legislation be taken away from the table of 
this House until the flaws and the damages that it would 
perpetuate on our way of life and on our democratic rights and 
freedoms are rectified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a real difference between this piece of legislation and 
the Sims task force review on the Canada Labour Code that 
supposedly was the basis for the legislation. The Sims task force 
reported. It did its work in 1995 and came out with a report 
called “Seeking a Balance”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is big on the word balance, and in this 
case of course the word balance referred to the quest for 
balanced labour legislation. Instead we have a piece of 
legislation that is terribly unbalanced and which will cause real 
harm to the workers of this country, the very people the labour 
code is supposed to protect. This is something we simply cannot 
allow to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the violation of the rights of workers, this 
piece of legislation will be completely injurious to the economic 
well-being of our country.  As we all know, industry is key to 
the competitiveness of our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because we have a small population we particularly need strong 
and vigorous exports, industries, development companies, all the 
kinds of economic activities that add to our national wealth. The 
government has done much singing and dancing about its supposed 
dedication to creating opportunity in this country. We have 
loudly publicized Team Canada visits to other countries, trade 
missions to expand export opportunities for Canadian businesses.

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a piece of legislation that has the very strong 
potential of completely reversing the whole thrust of this 
so-called jobs and opportunity strategy of the Liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a very real potential that existing jobs will be 
exported, not our products, our services, our knowledge or our 
technology.  Perspective jobs that could have come to Canada will 
simply never be realized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the labour climate in this country is such that companies and 
services find other locations in which to operate, it is very 
difficult to get those decisions reversed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have to tell the young people watching this debate that 
there is nearly 17% youth unemployment in Canada. There is a 
higher unemployment rate overall.  There are Canadians who 
desperately need the jobs this labour bill is going to 
substantially attack. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want security for our families, for ourselves and for our 
futures.  The best way to obtain that security, that quality of 
life and that peace of mind is to have stable jobs with stable 
incomes.  Yet what we have here is a piece of legislation that is 
going to make business think twice before continuing operations 
in Canada, expanding operations in Canada or even locating in 
Canada in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No wonder there is a tremendous brain drain beginning from our 
country to other countries which have a much more balanced 
approach to the way labour and labour relations issues are 
treated.  This legislation is an attempt to completely unbalance 
the way these issues are treated and we simply cannot allow that 
to happen without strong protest and without urging the Liberal 
government to rethink this bad piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are six areas at least, probably more, in which this 
legislation will be bad for Canadians, for their job 
opportunities and which will injure the interests of the workers 
of this country, the very people this kind of legislation is 
supposed to protect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could spend more than my allotted time on any one of these 
points.  I know many of my colleagues will be expanding on these 
points.  However, I would like to briefly touch on each of them 
so that the Canadian public has some idea of why we are so 
gravely concerned and so negative about this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, as I have already mentioned, the whole issue of 
democratic freedoms and process in our country is tremendously 
undermined by what is happening in this bill.  Secret ballot 
voting for those who would represent Canadian workers as 
bargaining units is not required.  If members can believe this, 
Canadian workers in federally regulated industries do not have 
the right to cast a secret ballot as to who they really want to 
represent them.  This violates the whole charter guarantee of 
freedom of association because you cannot be truly free unless 
you have a truly free expression of your will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian employees, if they are to have the right to freely 
choose a union to represent them in collective bargaining with 
their employer, must really have freedom.  The only way to ensure 
the choice is freely made is through the democratic process; that 
is, a board supervised, secret ballot vote in every single 
instance. 
Shockingly this basic fundamental right which is part of Canadian 
traditions, values and beliefs is entirely missing in this piece 
of legislation.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore this totally undermines the legitimacy of our 
bargaining units.  There are bargaining units and unions in this 
country with the best interests of workers at heart which want to 
protect them and speak for them and be a voice for them. Yet 
without being legitimately chosen according to the democratic 
traditions of our country their legitimacy is in question. 
Employee wishes will not be validated in the most basic way. The 
unions will not be sure they have support and legitimacy.  There 
will be no way for the unions to know if the workers are behind 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation proposes a card certification, that is, if the 
union organizers get enough cards signed by workers then they can 
be certified.  Imagine if members of Parliament were elected the 
same way.  Imagine that they went from door to door to solicit 
voters to sign cards saying “I will vote for you”.  Imagine if 
the candidate who had the most cards signed was elected as a 
member of Parliament.  Would we feel in Canada that we had 
legitimately expressed our wishes as to who we wanted to 
represent us by having to say yes or no to candidate <I>A</I>, 
<I>B</I> or <I>C</I> at the door?  Would we believe this was 
democratic? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is how the Liberals feel the Canadian workers should have a 
bargaining unit selected.  It flies in the face of every 
tradition we have.  It is an absolute travesty of democratic 
principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that in supervised secret ballot votes 
in the jurisdictions in Canada where they are required, the 
certification level is very high.  It validates unions, rather 
than stopping them from being able to do the job of representing 
Canadian workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example in Alberta from 1993 to 1994, the board processed 
205 certification applications.  Out of that number, 116 were 
voted on and 74% achieved certification.  That is consistent with 
what happened in other years in Alberta.  In fact there was 100% 
employee turnout in 33% of the votes held.  The average turnout 
for voting was 70%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Workers in our country want to participate in a free, fair and 
democratic manner in choosing who will represent them, but the 
Liberals have denied them that in this legislation.  It is a 
shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a tremendous privacy issue in the bill.  As other 
speakers have alluded to, employers can be forced by the board 
through this legislation to provide the names and addresses of 
off site employees to would be union organizers without the 
knowledge and consent of the workers.  As well, employers can be 
ordered to give electronic communications access to the workers, 
again without their knowledge and consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This comes from a government which claims to care about privacy. 
It is absolutely shocking. The previous justice minister pledged 
that by the year 2000 there would be a federal law to provide 
“effective enforceable protection of privacy rights in the 
private sector”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House of Commons standing committee on human rights devoted 
the better part of a year in the last Parliament to the study of 
privacy rights and visited several cities and heard from scores 
of witnesses representing every shade of opinion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In April as the House was rising for the election the committee 
released its report “Privacy:  Where do We Draw the Line?”. The 
report is nothing less than breathtaking in its scope and depth. 
It recognizes that privacy is a fundamental value to Canadian 
society and not a “token to be bartered for social and economic 
benefits”. One committee member describes privacy as an 
associative right, one that is essential to free association, 
such as trade unions, free speech and to our very autonomy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a strong validation by this very government in the 
strongest possible terms of a commitment to privacy. Then what 
they actually do, as so often happens with these Liberals, is 
they do something to completely and utterly violate the fine 
words that they are very fond of quoting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If your walk does not match your talk, you have a credibility 
problem.  This government has no credibility now when it comes to 
a stated commitment to protecting privacy because it has been 
completely violated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact Mr. Phillips, the privacy commissioner told the Senate 
committee when it was studying the former iteration of this bill 
that the provisions of this labour bill are completely and 
absolutely unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where will there be protection for Canadian workers' privacy 
unless the opposition, and members of the government who care 
about privacy and about that value we all hold so strongly in 
this country of individual liberty, force the government to 
rethink this bad piece of legislation? This bill is completely 
bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the whole idea of the remedial certification where any 
breach of labour practice by employers means that the other side 
automatically wins. This calls for judgment calls on the part of 
an unaccountable board which until just recently was headed by 
someone whose judgment was so bad that he spent $700 of 
taxpayers' money on lunches in places like Paris. These are the 
people who on behalf of Canadian workers are making decisions 
that are based on nothing more than wild speculation.  This is 
completely unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the whole idea of replacement workers.  We should 
be under no illusions that the unions regard this provision of 
the act as a complete ban on replacement workers, given the 
board's past history.  Where is the balance? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, businesses will take note that they absolutely have no 
recourse to keep their businesses going in the collective 
bargaining process.  They are simply not going to feel that doing 
business in this country has enough checks and balances, 
protections and safety to make it worthwhile for them to locate 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who loses?  Workers lose and Canadian young people lose because 
we have such an unfriendly atmosphere toward the very things we 
need the most, which are job creators and people who take 
advantage of economic opportunity. We tie their hands and gag 
them with red tape and expect us to have good jobs with good 
incomes.  It will not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation eliminates the need for unions to report on 
their financial status.  These organizations deal with millions 
and millions of dollars of workers' money.  There will be 
absolutely no accountability, no regulations, no way workers can 
be assured there are checks and balances on the discretion of 
these individuals who have statutory rights to require them to 
pay hard earned dollars into the organization that they did not 
even freely choose. They may not even have wanted to be part of 
that organization, yet there is no accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something too that is very disturbing, and I wish I had more 
time to talk about it, are the provisions in the bill that will 
effectively allow the minister by order in council, with no 
democratic debate and no open discussion, to suspend open 
tendering of contracts in the federally regulated sector. 
What again could be more injurious to the collective bargaining 
process and the freedom of operation in this country than that 
provision which effectively says that there cannot be a free 
tendering process in contracts in the federally regulated sector?

</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to members of this House to look at this legislation. 
It violates not only basic democratic principles, not only the 
basic privacy of workers but also the very freedoms and 
legitimacies of business and labour that give a viable and 
dynamic aspect to our economic life here in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not going to rest until these very serious issues for 
Canadians are dealt with.  This is a bad piece of legislation. 
This injures Canadian workers.  It violates their rights.  It is 
going to limit economic opportunities for workers and for all 
Canadians.  We cannot sit by while this happens.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to make a comment and ask the hon. member a question on 
strikebreakers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before she spoke, I listened to the Bloc member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Orléans speak about strikebreakers in 
Canada.  He said: “I remember”.  He mentioned a number of strikes 
in Canada involving the use of strikebreakers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He forgot the latest strike in Canada, the one at Canada Post. 
The Minister of Labour refused to use strikebreakers.  Now that is 
an example of leadership by a Canadian minister who listens to 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the hon. member tell us whether she agrees that, during a 
work stoppage, the union or management will have to maintain 
essential services in order to avoid immediate and serious risks to 
the health and safety of the public and whether the legislation 
should contain anti-scab provisions, which is the case in Quebec at 
the moment, because good relations must be maintained between 
employers and unions? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in the post office 
strike the government had a far heavier hammer than strike 
breakers.  It had legislation and brought it in to stop the 
strike.  If that is not breaking a strike, I am not sure what is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need in this whole area is balance.  The only recourse a 
business has if the business cannot keep going during a lawful 
strike is to either let the business go under, as happened just 
recently with Maple Leaf Foods, or cave in to whatever demands 
are being made in the bargaining process, no matter how 
unreasonable or economically injurious they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that what the member is suggesting happens, that the hands of 
one of the parties in the bargaining process be completely tied 
behind their back with no recourse? Is that the kind of balance 
the Liberals are suggesting happens or are the Liberals just 
saying “If it really gets bad, we will just legislate everybody 
back to work and we will not have to worry about the whole 
issue”? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is completely hypocritical and it is not going to help good 
labour relations and peaceful work experiences in the Canadian 
economy for workers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK25"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my, my, my.  Listen to the Reform Party talk about 
unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being a labour activist for many years and being part of the 
Canadian auto workers for the last 18 years, I have to say that I 
take offence with the Reform Party when it says that unions are 
not democratic.  The fact is they are probably the most 
democratic organizations in this country, if not more so than 
this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have worked with them.  I can guarantee that the CLC for 
example which covers 2.3 million unionized workers is the most 
democratic organization in this country.  If members do not 
believe that, I encourage them to spend a weekend with unionized 
workers to understand exactly what is going wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most offensive things that happens to bargaining and 
to unionized people is when employers have the right to scab 
labour.  The member was talking about the fact that unions make 
unreasonable demands but she does not mention the fact that some 
employers make unreasonable demands on their labourers. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1130"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to argue this point in light of both facts.  When we go 
to arbitration or any kind of labour relations, which I have done 
for many years, the use of scab labour, the threat of scab labour 
and the threat of back to work legislation deflate rank and file 
workers.  It is unacceptable that scab labour is still allowed. 
My party and I would definitely vote for any legislation that 
outlaws the use of scab labour or forced back to work 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my most humble opinion anything that would violate a union is 
the Reform Party.  We are the only federal party in the House 
with a staff that is unionized, has an association and bargains 
for its rights in Ottawa.  No other official party in the House 
allows its staff to organize or unionize.  We encourage our staff 
to organize and unionize under an umbrella. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would love to see the Reform Party encourage its staff to do 
the same so its staff can argue in balance for fair wages and 
fair compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wish the hon. member 
had listened to my remarks.  I said that the legislation was 
completely undemocratic, that it violated democratic principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A union can operate very democratically.  I am glad to hear the 
member has had experience in a union that does.  If a union is 
not democratically chosen, what democratic legitimacy does it 
have in the first place, no matter how it operates after the 
fact? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about unreasonable demands being made by 
employers.  Unreasonableness is not the sole purview of employers 
and management.  It is unfortunate but true that unreasonableness 
sometimes rests in the bargaining unit, in unions.  What will 
protect workers in a balanced way from being pulled apart by 
these two competing interests?  Only balanced legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see why the hon. member wants to ensure that his union bosses 
and the unions that pay most of the money to keep his party going 
have full and free flight in whatever they want to do.  I 
understand why he is flying the flag of the unions and his union 
bosses.  I can perfectly understand that, but who cares about the 
workers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who cares to ensure that workers who want to keep their jobs and 
good relations with the people offering them economic opportunity 
also have some reasonable freedoms and some cards on the table 
when it comes to the bargaining process? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bargaining unit must be free and fair and able to stick up 
for the needs of workers.  The other side that wants to provide 
long term employment and economic opportunities must have some 
cards to bargain with.  We are asking for balance that protects 
workers and serves their interests and not just those of the 
union bosses of the NDP. 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it might come as some shock to many workers in Canada to hear the 
Reform Party supposedly defending them.  It is a little 
difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said that the legislation is in effect a ban on 
replacement workers.  That is not true.  In the legislation there 
is a right for a business to keep working, but if it uses 
replacement workers to bust a union the board has the authority 
to outlaw it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member would try to perpetuate that somehow there is a 
total ban on replacement workers and it is exactly the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On democratic principles the board shall have a vote on between 
35% and 50% of the cards signed by the rank and file. That is 
what they say they want.  If there is clear indication that 
members want to certify with a union and there are in excess of 
50% of the membership signing cards, the board has the authority 
to certify without a vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear.  If there is any indication whatsoever of 
unfair labour practice on the part of the union organizers 
intimidating people to sign cards, the board can either deny 
certification or require a full vote.  The member should put the 
facts on the table so we are clear about what we are dealing 
with.

prejudices and misconceptions about Reform to give any credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure the people of the country that the official 
opposition has a commitment to protecting the interests of 
workers no matter what the myths and the misconceptions are on 
the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We understand why they want to see everything in black and 
white.  That is simply not the case.  Reformers are workers. 
Reformers are union members.  Almost half the union members vote 
for Reform in federal elections.  We are committed to their 
protection and that is exactly what we are trying to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Sims report which gave rise to this piece of legislation 
states explicitly:

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only in exceptional circumstances that replacement workers

</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the report of the government indicated.  We need to 
make sure there is not a ban on replacement workers.  The

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to rise today to speak to Bill C-19, to amend the 
Canada Labour Code, part I. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my presentation I will briefly outline Bill C-19, although 
that has been well done by members who spoke before.  I want to 
speak a little about unions and their roles in Canada.  Then I 
want to focus mainly on the impact of the legislation on the 
grain industry.  I will focus most of my comments on the impact 
of the legislation on farmers and their families and especially 
on what is missing from the legislation that will have an 
incredibly negative impact on farmers and their ability to access 
markets and earn a living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other speakers before me have done a good job of outlining the 
bill.  Some members have done an excellent job in pointing out 
some of the flaws in the bill.  The member for Calgary—Nose Hill 
did an excellent job in making it clear that it is an important 
piece of legislation that should not be taken lightly and has to 
be reconsidered.  She did an admirable job of pointing out some 
of the key flaws in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start by talking a bit about unions.  I received several 
letters on the bill, as did the member for Guelph—Wellington. 
One thing that concerned me in many of the letters was the 
negative comments of people against unions.  Many said that 
unions should not be allowed anywhere in the grain industry. That 
is too bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say very clearly that unions serve a very useful role. 
They have a purpose and they are necessary.  If unions are not 
present in certain industries, some businesses would take 
advantage of labour.  That is a concern.  It is unfortunate a few 
unions that have not acted in a responsible way have turned the 
feelings of people against them. 
That is an important concern.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To help improve the unions, their effectiveness and their 
acceptance, certain things must happen.  We need better balance 
between labour and management, which is something the bill does 
not offer.  It also does not offer the protection needed for 
innocent third parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill deals to some extent with grain at the ports and the 
moving of grain out of the ports.  It affects farmers in a small 
way, in a positive way, but it does very little to protect 
farmers, people in the forestry industry and people in the mining 
industry.  It does not protect any of the people affected in a 
negative way as third parties.  These are the people who have no 
say in the unions or in management.  Yet their livelihoods are 
affected to a great degree as a result of work stoppages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need better protection for innocent third parties.  A little 
later I will focus on one particular group, grain farmers who are 
innocent third parties in any dispute which stops the movement of 
grain from the local elevator to being loaded on a boat in 
harbour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about farmers and how they are affected by 
work stoppages.  We have debated several times since we came to 
the House legislation concerning labour and management disputes. 
Since 1956 we have had nine major disruptions in the grain 
industry.  It began in 1956 and went right through to 1972, 1974, 
1975, 1982, 1986, 1988, 1991 and 1994.  There have been over a 
dozen other labour-management disputes involving grain handling 
and transportation which have ended up in back to work 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1998 stoppage 30% of the country's grain exports were 
stopped dead.  How many grain handlers in the union were involved 
to stop 30% of the export of grain?  There were 69 grain handlers 
involved who were unhappy with their working conditions and 
stopped the export of 30% of the grain.  This affected in a very 
personal way the lives of grain farmers who were unable to move 
their grain to market.  I believe that demonstrates the 
seriousness of the situation, the seriousness of the legislation, 
and the seriousness of the flaws in the bill which will do very 
little to change things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Growing up on a grain farm, I remember going to school during 
times of work stoppage and speaking with friends.  My friends at 
school, who also grew up on farms, were mostly quite poor.  That 
was the situation then, although people did not complain about 
it.  We certainly had the necessities of life.  My neighbours and 
friends during the times of work stoppages felt the negative 
impact in a way that we could see and hear in our discussions. 
They were unable to get the new footwear or the new clothes they 
needed. 
Their parents, in many cases, were struggling to put food on the 
table.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These work stoppages are connected with reality.  They have an 
impact on people's lives.  This legislation does not do what has 
to be done to stop the impact which these work stoppages have on 
farmers and others who are captive to the labour-management 
relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 87.7 of the bill will make a little difference.  The 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Labour referred to a 
letter she had received from a farmer with respect to this 
section of the bill.  This section will ensure that the grain 
that gets to port is loaded on to a ship. That is not entirely 
true because more and more of our crops are moving through bulk 
handling facilities where that would not be the case.  When using 
the bulk handling facilities there is no requirement to load the 
grain on to a ship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the definition of grain that is used in the 
legislation is the same as that used in the Canada Grain Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Yorkton—Melville referred to the fact that 
it will not have any impact at all on many farm commodities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers are trying to diversify.  Government has encouraged 
farmers to diversify.  They can no longer depend on wheat alone. 
The farmers have done a good job in doing that.  They have 
started to produce all kinds of alternative crops.  It used to be 
that wheat, barley and oats were the main crops on the prairies, 
as well as some rye and some flax.  Now canola rivals wheat in 
terms of the value of the crop being sold.  There are many other 
crops such as peas, lentils and alfalfa.  The member referred to 
alfalfa being cubed and sent mostly to Asian countries, but 
alfalfa is not covered at all in this legislation because under 
the Canada Grain Act it is not a grain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers have diversified.  They have done what they thought they 
should do.  Their reward with this legislation is that the new 
diversified crops which they are producing to earn a reasonable 
livelihood most years will sit wherever they are in the system 
and will not be moved.  They will be denied the income from these 
commodities until an agreement is reached between labour and 
management.  It will take a long time to fix up the system once 
it has been thrown out of whack by a work stoppage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people are being punished for the work they have done and 
the changes they have made to try to better provide for their 
families and to make their businesses more viable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to the letter the parliamentary secretary received from 
a western farmer who supports this bill.  She quoted from the 
letter to show that we should be supporting the bill.  However, 
part of the quote was really not all that supportive.  The farmer 
said this is a good first step.  To me that would indicate there 
is an awful lot more which needs to be done.  This is the best 
she can do to show support for the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I am in government I will not be satisfied with simply 
providing a good first step.  We have to go further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the Reform Party has been proposing over the last 
four years. 
We dealt with the first back to work legislation in 1994. I think 
it was my second speech in the House of Commons. We had only been 
down here a couple of weeks. We talked about ending work 
stoppages in the grain handling system right from one end of the 
system to the other, not just ensuring that grain that gets to 
port gets loaded on the ships, which is all this legislation will 
do. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1150"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we proposed is using final offer arbitration to end work 
stoppages.  We have talked about this on several occasions in this 
House and I believe it is a process which must be put in place to 
end stoppages such as the frequent stoppages we have seen in the 
grain handling system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, this type of collective bargaining should be used 
when there is a third party which is completely captive to labour 
and management. In this case there are thousands and thousands of 
grain farmers across the country who are captive to union and 
management, yet they have no say at all in the negotiations. They 
have no place at the negotiation table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The type of situation we are talking about is for grain movement 
but also for movement of coal, potash, forestry products, many 
resource areas in particular where they are captive and are 
affected very directly, not in some indirect way. Their 
livelihoods, their incomes depend on these products moving to 
ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet in this legislation government says for grain, as defined by 
the Canada Grain Act, it will make sure it keeps moving as long 
as it gets to port.  Then the member for Guelph—Wellington has 
the nerve to stand up and say they have done a great job and 
refers to the farmer who wrote the letter saying it is a first 
step.  That is completely unacceptable and I think the member 
should expect more. It is from her government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, Reform not only critiques legislation, points out areas 
that we think are not right and that could be improved, we also 
present alternatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the Reform alternative in dealing with 
commodities where the producers are captive shippers and yet have 
no place at all at the bargaining table. What we propose is the 
use of final offer selection arbitration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to work through the process. The purpose of a strike 
is to force a settlement. That is the reason that union members 
choose to strike from time to time, to force a solution. Final 
offer arbitration puts the onus on both sides to reach an 
agreement, to arrive at a solution.  It allows the collective 
bargaining process to take place right through to solution. It 
can be used equally by labour and management. It does not favour 
one over the other and it can provide a permanent solution and it 
is a just and effective dispute settlement mechanism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that this final offer selection 
arbitration, in spite of the way it is presented so often by 
members from some parties, does not favour one side over the 
other. It is not something there for business to use against 
labour, not at all. It is as useful for one side as the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is how it works. If and only if the union and an employer 
cannot reach an agreement by the conclusion of the previous 
contract, the union and employer would provide the minister with 
the name of a person or persons they jointly recommend as an 
arbiter or an arbitration panel. Then the union and the employer 
would be required to submit to the arbitrator or the panel, 
depending on what they choose, a list of matters they have agreed 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no need for more negotiation on these matters. They 
have reached a settlement. In many cases before a situation comes 
to strike many of the issues have been settled, so those are 
taken out of the process at this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also submit a list of matters still under dispute, and 
those are the issues which must be presented to the arbitrator or 
to the panel. For these disputed issues, each party would be 
required to submit a final offer for settlement. 
The arbitrator or panel selects either the final offer submitted 
by the trade union or the final offer submitted by business, by 
the employer.  In this way any work stoppage is completely headed 
off.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That sounds like a more complete solution to the problem than 
saying if we get the grain to the coast and loaded on the ships, 
the system can be backed up in every other aspect.  It may take 
months to really sort the situation out and it usually does. 
There could be sales lost, which there always are, to the point 
that Canada now is looked on as an unreliable supplier of grains 
and other commodities affected often by labour disruptions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that does sound like a far more reasonable solution to 
the problem.  It is the solution that we have been encouraging 
now for four years, a solution which I do not believe was 
seriously considered by this government, and I think it should 
be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I close by saying that farmers and other captive shippers 
deserve a mechanism which will ensure them as captive shippers, 
as people who really have no place at the table and yet their 
livelihoods are affected so directly, that they have something 
better than this legislation.  They deserve a system of final 
offer selection arbitration and that is what Reform will give 
them when we have a chance, if this government does not see the 
light before then and give it to them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have a moment 
to respond to the member.  He quoted me a number of times on one 
particular letter I read.  I could read to him a hundred letters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I attended hearings with the Minister of Labour in Vancouver.  I 
heard directly from farmers.  Some of them had tears in their 
eyes saying to me please pass this legislation, it is important 
legislation for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard for me to understand the member when he says he is 
for the people, that he wants to protect them. These are the 
grassroots people, the farmers in his community.  I am taken 
aback by how callously he throws one letter aside.  I am puzzled 
by that.  They are the very people he says he wants to protect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have an excerpt from another letter.  This one is from a 
farmer in the hon. member's area: “Grain has been used by 
various groups as a political football in order to achieve their 
own ends.  This revision shows recognition on the part of 
government of the importance of a consistent and reliable supply 
of grain to our international customers.  I urge your support for 
the bill and in particular section 87.7”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only say to this House these are the things farmers are 
telling me.  When I am urged by farmers that this is an important 
point for them, I think we must respond.  As the government we 
are trying to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member did say that the other letter I referred to said 
it was an important first step.  Sometimes we have to walk before 
we run.  That is what we are trying to do, but we are trying to 
do it with balance and with care.  We believe this is a good 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
her comments and questions and for reading from another letter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe farmers would have tears in their eyes because their 
very livelihood is affected by these stoppages that happen again 
and again.  That is exactly what I was talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was growing up, these were my friends and neighbours.  I 
was in no way throwing aside the comments made in the letter.  I 
was saying she was interpreting them loosely when she said that 
person was saying this legislation solved all the problems. That 
is nonsense.  It does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the quote from the other letter which said what farmers want 
is to provide a reliable supply of grain to their customers, that 
is exactly what they want. That is what this legislation will in 
no way deliver.  All it will do is ensure that if grain makes it 
to the coast it will get loaded on the ships. 
That is only a short part of travel for grain.  It has to move 
right from the elevator system to the coast first.  That is more 
often than not where there is a problem.  What good will it do to 
have these changes to ensure the ships are loaded when in many 
cases the grain never gets to the coast because of a work 
stoppage of some type?

</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to put it right through the complete grain system.  It 
should be in other areas where people have no place at the table 
and are affected directly.  That is what we want to do and that 
is what we are calling for.  The letters are important, but let 
us interpret them accurately. 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I congratulate the member for Lakeland on his presentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the PC Party have a lot of concerns, but this part of the 
legislation has not been visited in 25 years.  I believe we are 
very close, but I think with more consultation we can all come 
forward with good solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two questions for the member.  We have concerns about 
replacement workers, as does the hon. member, and about off site 
workers and certification not requiring the majority of votes of 
employees.  As was mentioned last week in the presentation on 
their behalf and on behalf of the other parties in the opposition 
there were some problems in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question on work stoppage at ports.  We support the 
section that would prevent labour disputes, other than those 
between employees, stopping the flow of grain at the ports. Would 
the hon. member see this section going a little further and make 
it apply to elevators in western Canada and in Ontario? Potato 
farmers and the pulp and paper industry could be affected as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another section in the bill, section 7 dealing with the power of 
the CIRB to determine seniority, affects pilots.  The board has 
the power to determine the question of seniority.  This is 
troublesome for airline pilots as seniority determines their 
progression and promotion in ways that are drastically different 
from others industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give the board the power to change the practices that are 
used worldwide in the aviation industry could cause undue 
problems.  I would like to know the member's comments on this 
section. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I apologize to the 
member.  I did not get the last question. I certainly encourage 
him to repeat it later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to support for section 7 which would ensure that the 
grain that gets to the coast is loaded on ships, certainly we 
support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member indicated, we would like it to go an awful lot 
further.  That is why we have been suggesting we should use final 
offer selection arbitration to ensure that there would be no work 
stoppages right from the local elevator, or whatever type of 
gathering facility, through to the loading of the boats and that 
the collective bargaining process goes through to completion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the process allows.  That is important because we 
do not want to interfere with collective bargaining.  We think 
that is extremely important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our final offer selection ensures that without stoppage there 
can be an agreement that makes sense.  We know that each party 
will present a reasonable offer when they know the arbitrator or 
the panel will choose all of one or all of the other with no 
mixing and matching as happens in many forced settlements now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be all of one or all of the other.  Two very reasonable 
offers will be presented.  Both will be very close.  Whichever 
one is chosen, I think both parties will be relatively happy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We certainly encourage that type of mechanism.  It goes much 
further.  It will not only deal with grain because I do not think 
it is fair.  My heart is with grain farmers.  I grew up in that 
type of setting.  My neighbours and friends were and still are 
grain farmers.  It has to go into other industries that are 
affected in a similar way.  The legislation discriminates 
unfairly in that regard as well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, why 
does the hon. member think the NDP has now become a party that 
represents big union bosses rather than workers?. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Labour unions now represent over $1 billion in terms of forced 
dues.  They are massive corporations, indeed one of the biggest. 
We see a lot of union bosses sitting in the NDP ranks.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member comment on why the NDP has lost touch with 
the workers?  Why does it represent only union bosses? Why is it 
anti-democratic? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP does not believe in secret mail ballots for union 
leadership and having them mandatory across the land.  It does 
not believe in democratic choice.  The NDP government in British 
Columbia revoked the opportunity for people to vote in secret 
ballots for certification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the NDP against the worker?  What has been the change? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is an excellent 
question.  Tommy Douglas would be rolling over in his grave 
seeing what the members of the New Democratic Party are doing in 
this regard.  He believed in democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Democracy has been taken out of the union movement.  The New 
Democratic Party seems to be protecting union bosses, as the hon. 
member just suggested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of what is not in the legislation is fairness in voting. 
When a union is being established every individual should be 
given a fair democratic chance to express his or her will. 
Clearly the New Democratic Party has abandoned what many of the 
founding members of its movement would have supported in terms of 
the importance of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one time that party was a grassroots party, but clearly it 
has become a big union boss party now.  That is why many union 
members are voting Reform. That movement will continue and 
expand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The time for 
questions and comments has expired and with that the first five 
hours of debate have also expired.  We will now proceed to 10 
minutes of debate with no questions and comments.

<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, upon reading Bill C-19, we wondered why the 
government, which is in its second mandate and which introduced this 
legislation in the previous Parliament, is proposing such an incomplete 
reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that the federal government, having seen firsthand—during 
the last Parliament—what the Ogilvie Mills workers went 
through because there was no anti-scab legislation, failed to address 
the concerns of these workers, particularly since the issue was dealt 
with some 20 years ago in Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has its own anti-scab legislation, like British Columbia. 
After creating some kind of a balance in the baragaining process, it was 
noticed that disputes were not as long and as bitter as they had been in 
the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We expected the government to do the same with this bill which, 
after all, is the outcome of lengthy reflection. Reforms to the Canada 
Labour Code are few and far between. The fact is the government did not 
make the changes required to make it a code that would truly give equal 
opportunities to both sides in the bargaining process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's debate in the House makes me realize that, in Canada, there 
are many different societies, many different ways of seeing things. For 
Quebeckers, this debate is somewhat unreal, since we settled the issue 
of replacement workers a long time ago. 
Even the Conseil du patronat decided not to appeal, because it could see 
that, in terms of social peace, the situation was good enough, that we 
had an acceptable compromise, and that both sides were pleased with the 
results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, the federal reform should have included a true anti-scab 
policy, not the very weak provisions found in the bill. These provide, 
among others things, that businesses could be held accountable for 
hiring replacement workers only in cases where the union's 
representative capacity is undermined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, any employer can say “I am hiring scabs, but I 
certainly do not question the union's representative capacity. Look at 
the unions. Their members are picketing. I respect them. I respect them 
so much that I have scabs come in to replace them on the job”. 
The proposed system would allow and even condone such a situation. I 
find it unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, this is a fundamental reason to oppose the bill, 
because it does not have the required provisions to make this an 
adequate reform. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1210"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill contains other provisions that are not so great either. 
For instance, under section 108, the minister may interfere in the 
bargaining process, by ordering a vote on the employer's latest offers 
if the negotiations stall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will change the rules of the game. 
I think it will put undue pressure on the minister and allow management 
to put on the table slightly less generous proposals than those required 
to come to an agreement with the union. For the collective bargaining 
process to work, both sides must use their respective leverage to come 
to an agreement that is a mutually acceptable compromise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case, any chance for a compromise will be swept aside 
because management will not have an opportunity to put its best offer 
forward since the minister may order a vote. That will directly 
interfere with labour relations and could eventually lead to a 
deterioration of labour relations within the organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other aspects that do not seem acceptable to us. No 
effort was made in this legislation to provide for the transfer of 
administrative responsibilities from the minister to the federal 
mediation and conciliation service. There is nothing to this effect in 
this bill, which may lead to a subjective interpretation of the various 
situations by the minister. This is another important point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will raise one last point, which seems very significant to me. 
The government would not allow appointments to the labour relations 
board to be made from lists submitted by labour or management. This 
reflects a lack of co-operation we might have expected. 
If the government had agreed to allow the parties to submit joint 
lists, when people whom both the employer and the union had agreed 
on had arbitration or other decisions to make with respect to 
labour relations, they would be on much more solid ground. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister did not go along with this position.  He 
preferred to hold on to his discretionary right to appoint people, 
but not necessarily with the agreement of both parties.  Obviously, 
in cases of disagreement, the minister could have had the final 
say. However, if there were the possibility of agreement between 
the union and the employer regarding the appointment of certain 
people, this would surely have meant that much more credibility for 
labour relations officers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, there are a number of aspects of this bill that 
should have been examined much more closely. 
This is not a government in its first few months in office.  It has 
been in power for over four years and has seen labour relations 
close up.  When in opposition, it favoured anti-scab measures that 
it did not have the courage to include in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, the government has listened to some lobby groups. 
This is the downside of how our political parties are funded.  In 
any event, the odds are that this was what opened certain doors and 
left the way wide open in the bill for more painful situations, 
situations that are difficult for workers, for their families, and 
for employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aftereffects of allowing strikebreakers to be hired, of 
making it legal for these people to work to the detriment of those 
who took the decision to strike, are important.  I think the 
federal government would have done better to pay much more 
attention than it has to the particular situation in Quebec, where 
anti-scab legislation has been in effect for over 20 years.  There 
are fewer work disputes, they do not last as long, and a better 
balance has been achieved.  It is an example Canada should have 
followed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When deciding whether or not to opt for sovereignty in the 
next few years, this is something Quebec's workers will have to 
bear in mind. 
When all Quebeckers are governed by the same labour code, they will 
have a chance at better benefits than those in the Canada Labour 
Code, because Quebec society is different, because it has decided 
to have its own distinct relations between workers and employers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government's bill lacks this significant component 
of Quebec society, one of the cornerstones of all labour relations. 
I believe all workers covered by the Canada Labour Code who work in 
Quebec at the present time would be prepared to accept having the 
federal legislation contain the same conditions as the Quebec code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is somewhat peculiar that Quebec will have three types of 
coverage for workers: the Canada Labour Code, non-unionized labour, 
and the Quebec Labour Code for all the rest. 
Especially when we see the Canadian code applied to sectors in 
which agreement could not be reached, such as Ogilvie Mills, could 
an effort not be made to resume discussions and ensure that the 
Canada Labour Code will include measures as generous and effective 
as those in the Quebec code?

thank you for the opportunity to take part in this debate on the 
amendments to the Canada Labour Code, Bill C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill deals with a number of important areas I want to talk 
about.  There is the fact that unions can be certified without a 
majority of workers being consulted or voting. They can also 
release the list of employees working off site without their 
consent.  This bill also deals with section 87.7 which ensures 
that grain currently at port at the facility will be loaded over 
a 72 hour period in spite of the fact that there may be a 
labour-management problem there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, what I want to deal with today is what this bill 
does not include.  I will come back to the other areas in a 
moment.  I want to focus my remarks essentially on the missed 
opportunity by this government in that it is revising the Canada 
Labour Code but it is not including a number of areas that are 
essential to ensure the delivery of product to market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my critic area which is international trade, I know how 
important it is to have credibility in having prompt product 
delivery at market so that it can be picked up and delivered to 
countries that require our goods and services. Unfortunately that 
is not happening very well now.  I would submit that the current 
labour-management process which has been in place for some time 
is not working very well at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All too many times when there are labour-management problems 
which result in the withdrawal of services or lockouts third 
parties are affected very dramatically.  I am thinking of grain 
farmers in particular. That is one area I know very well. There 
have been a number of withdrawal of services over the last 10 
years and it has hurt the grain industry to a very big extent. My 
colleague from Prince George—Peace River talked about it but I 
want to outline this again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1987 there was a work stoppage between the railways and their 
union.  Five days were lost.  Late that same year there was a 42 
day work stoppage between the Prince Rupert grain terminal and 
the grain workers. There were heavy financial losses.  In 1991 
there was a 16 day dispute between the Department of Transport 
and the public service union.  There was also a work stoppage of 
20 days in 1995 between the railways and their union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are not just figures on paper. These are very real 
concerns for people who have product that they want to deliver to 
market.  It is also a very real concern for countries such as 
Japan that are looking to take delivery of a product that it has 
bought and sent vessels over to ports like Prince Rupert and 
Vancouver but cannot pick up the purchased product because of the 
labour-management problems.  These labour-management problems 
result in more days lost in productivity time second only to 
Italy in terms of all of the industrial countries in the world. 
This simply is not good enough. 
In fact we never make up for that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The demurrage charges last year at the Vancouver and Prince 
Rupert terminals as a result of strikes cost grain farmers in 
western Canada something in the neighbourhood of $50 million. 
These grain and oilseed farmers are struggling to begin with. 
They are struggling because market prices are not that high. They 
certainly cannot afford to have work stoppages which affect them 
and which they have nothing to do with.  They have nothing to do 
with them, yet their product is being held back from market which 
results in massive costs.  Opportunity is lost, but there are 
massive costs in terms of demurrage charges alone of over $50 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means the farmers have to pay ships to wait in the 
Vancouver harbour while we sort out an archaic system of 
labour-management in this country.  From a trade perspective it 
is hurting our credibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was involved in the canola industry, Japanese 
representatives purchasing Canadian canola made the case on many 
occasions that they are going to look elsewhere. I know they have 
done that because Canada is becoming known as not being a 
reliable supplier of product. They liked the canola.  They liked 
the quality of it and the good cooking oil it made, but they 
could not stand the disruption in service.  It has cost us very 
heavily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to speak about a couple of aspects of the bill which 
I mentioned earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has been telling the grain sector that it 
has done it a tremendous service by putting a provision in the 
Canada Labour Code which will allow grain companies to continue 
loading a vessel at port in spite of a strike or lockout.  That 
is a good provision but it is a half-baked measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we cannot get the goods to the terminal, and there have not 
been any changes made to the Canada Labour Code which would allow 
that to happen, it is a half-baked measure.  It simply does not 
go far enough.  The major disruptions which have taken place in 
the past 10 years have meant that grain and oilseed products 
could not get to the terminals at all, let alone worry about 
those products being loaded onto vessels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a red herring.  I admit that it is a small concession, but 
it is a lost opportunity to do something about a major problem 
which we have in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to deal with an aspect of the bill which is quite 
troubling and it has to do with the whole business of democracy. 
There is a major change which the Liberals are proposing.  There 
will be a process by which unions can be certified without the 
support of a majority of the employees.  That is fundamentally 
wrong.  It tramples on the democratic rights of Canadian citizens 
and workers and violates principles which are fundamental to our 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will no longer be secret ballots, a fundamental right 
which is enjoyed by every Canadian.  We have the right to cast a 
secret ballot in favour or against a piece of legislation. 
Whether it be a plebiscite or a vote in the House of Commons, 
provincial legislatures or municipal councils, the secret ballot 
is a fundamental right. We are moving away from the secret ballot 
with the amendments which are being made to the Canada Labour 
Code.  It is a fundamental flaw in the bill and a reason not to 
support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another issue which is along the same lines and is 
equally troubling.  Workers' names can now be released to those 
conducting certification drives without the workers' knowledge or 
consent.  That does not sound right to me.  It seems to me that 
if people are being asked to join a union they should know that 
their names are being released. It is a fundamental principle of 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned by what is not included in the bill.  The bill 
does not deal with labour-management problems in terms of getting 
goods to the market. 
It does not deal with final offer arbitration.  There is still a 
process in the grain sector and which we have seen in Canada Post 
on many occasions, where the ultimate result is that Parliament 
orders workers back to work.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe there should be a negotiating process under 
labour-management that takes place until the impending withdrawal 
of services either through a strike or a lockout. However at that 
point there must be a more enlightened process. There needs to be 
a process which says “We have not been able to arrive at this 
agreement over an 18 month negotiating period so maybe it is time 
to put in our final offer and let us see who is right”. In the 
end that is what is happening anyway.  The government is ordering 
workers back to work and implementing final offer arbitration in 
any case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us do it before we lose valuable time in too many days of 
lost productivity as a result of work stoppage. The final offer 
arbitration solution put forward by the hon. member for 
Wetaskiwin, our labour critic, is a very good move to try to have 
a more enlightened labour-management process in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to speak today in the debate on second reading of Bill 
C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the outcome of a long process of reforming the labour 
code.  I must say, however, that the minister's praiseworthy 
intention to reform the code in line with the expectations of both 
unions and management is, on scrutiny, nothing more than a cosmetic 
change.  Simply put, the Minister of Labour, like the entire 
government he represents, has only a limited view of what labour 
relations are all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government dares to call an in-depth reform of the 
Canada Labour Code represents nothing worthy of consideration, in 
my estimation. As a union member myself, I must say I know what I 
am talking about.  I must admit that the energy the Liberal 
government has expended in this bill is very perplexing to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot imagine how a government claiming that employment is 
the key element of its election platform could ignore anti-scab 
measures in its reform.  The use of replacement workers during 
labour conflicts is, in my eyes, the most heinous act imaginable. 
These underhanded tactics trample over the rights of workers 
aspiring to better working conditions, and the Liberal government 
is closing its eyes to this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what the purpose of this labour code reform really 
is. 
All insinuations aside, it does seem clear to me that, by 
presenting a legislative measure of this type, the Minister of 
Labour is serving interests other than those of the workers. The 
Liberal Party of Canada, which represents high finance and big 
business, cannot bring itself to introduce a bill that would 
improve the conditions of ordinary people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You are as familiar as I with the saying about not biting that 
hand that feeds you. This is what Bill C-19 is all about.  The 
Liberals could not introduce a bill that would rub big business the 
wrong way, because they are the ones greasing the wheels of the 
giant Liberal political machine.  As I said, the Minister of 
Labour's real interest lies more with defending the status quo for 
his party's financial backers than with defending honest workers 
and respecting their rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, clause 42 of the bill does forbid the use of 
replacement workers, but the minister is adding an interpretive 
framework to this, suggesting that scabs can only be used for the 
purpose of undermining a trade union's representational capacity. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1230"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This, in my opinion, comes down to saying that what cannot be 
done directly may be done in a roundabout way.  The Liberal 
government's forte is playing with word meanings and making sure 
that the legislation will be so complicated that it will be 
virtually impossible to interpret it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Minister of Labour and the rest of the cabinet had 
really wanted to demonstrate their desire to reform the labour 
code, the matter of replacement workers would have been dealt with 
head on, not via political doublespeak which undermines the 
credibility of Bill C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has workers' rights and the defence of 
their interests at heart.  My predecessor in this House, in fact, 
introduced a bill to that effect. 
But because of the Liberals' logic, the minister is not inclined to 
consider basic issues. Instead, he is coming up with a bill that is 
essentially window-dressing, to give the impression that he is acting on 
highly charged issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, if the minister and the federal government had wanted to 
adequately reform this part of the labour code, they would have looked 
at the anti-scab legislation passed in 1977 by the government of René 
Lévesque. When a labour dispute occurs, the clarity of the legislation 
greatly helps reduce the risks of negotiations breaking down, and of 
disgraceful or violent acts being committed. Just remember the sad 
episode at Ogilvie's. The federal government's refusal to consider the 
issue shows that the minister missed the boat and that the proposed 
legislation is just a small step forward for workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-19 also deals with many other issues that are just as 
important as replacement workers. They include the establishment of the 
Canada Industrial Relations Board, which will replace the Canada Labour 
Relations Board. This major element of the reform does not even meet the 
expectations of the labour organizations. Indeed, unions have said on 
many occasions that they want members to be appointed from lists 
submitted by both sides, as is the case for other government 
organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the only way to make sure the rulings of the Canada Labour 
Relations Board are never challenged. 
In the past, the appointments made did not always reflect the talent, 
the expertise and the knowledge to be expected from people who sit on 
this quasi-judicial tribunal. It can be expected that any controversial 
decision will be used as a pretext to challenge the competence and the 
impartiality of some members of the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the minister says he will consult. Indeed, it is 
important to do so when appointments of this nature are made. However, 
there would be much more of a balance if the minister used lists 
submitted by both management and the unions, to fill any vacancy that 
may occur. Again, the minister is merely pretending to act, much to the 
disappointment of all those concerned. He is keeping all the powers 
relating to appointments, in spite of the problems that this is likely 
to create. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last point I would like to cover before I finish concerns 
another major omission regarding the claim by the Public Service 
Alliance of Canada.  It has asked to be removed from the 
application of the Public Service Staff Relations Act and instead 
to be covered by the Canada Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did PSAC and its members make such a request?  Because 
under the Public Service Staff Relations Act they do not have the 
right to negotiate important provisions, such as job security, 
which is covered by legislation other than that governing labour 
relations.  This is the case as well for protection against 
technological changes, job classifications, appointments, 
promotions and transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a change in response to the request of the Public Service 
Alliance of Canada would also prevent the unfair treatment of a 
category of Quebec workers.  Three categories of workers will be 
protected by the Quebec legislation prohibiting the use of 
strikebreakers: those not unionized at all and those that are and 
are covered by the Canada Labour Code, who are unionized but have 
no protection against the use of scabs.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, Bill C-19 represents another fine opportunity 
missed by the Minister of Labour.  It could have been an 
opportunity to truly protect workers against the hiring of 
strikebreakers.  It could have been an opportunity to act on the 
request of the Public Service Alliance of Canada to withdraw from 
coverage by the Public Service Staff Relations Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister could also have put an end to discrimination 
against certain categories of workers in Quebec, who, depending on 
the legislation that governs their working conditions, will no 
longer be entitled to the same protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, as I have said, you do not bite the hand that feeds 
you.  That is no doubt what the Minister of Labour was thinking in 
formulating Bill C-19. 
He goes out of his way to avoid taking any advantage away from 
those who annually contribute so generously to Liberal coffers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-19 is nothing more than a lot of razzle-dazzle. 
Workers will not be fooled.  Neither will the Bloc.  No one is 
going to support a bill that, despite the fancy words of the 
government, does so little to protect and improve workers' rights.

<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I 
rise today to speak about Bill C-19, I want to continue with a 
theme introduced by my colleagues this morning. I thought one of 
the best ways to do that perhaps would be to read from a letter I 
received from a constituent to set the scene. I know one of the 
members on the Liberal side read from a letter, so I am going to 
do exactly the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This letter came to me from a very concerned constituent who has 
done quite a lot of research into Bill C-19 and is particularly 
concerned with the democratic aspects of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I can quote a bit from the letter just to set the scene: The 
Minister of Labour introduced Bill C-19 on November 6, 1997, and 
this bill contains most of the amendments that were incorporated 
in Bill C-66. Regrettably the revised version contains the same 
defects its predecessor displayed. The result is that the changes 
that would have made the labour code a better enactment are more 
than offset by the provisions which perpetuate undemocratic rules 
and introduce measures which will make Canadian enterprises 
subject to federal labour legislation less competitive”.  Bill 
C-66 was from the last Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This letter highlights three of the deficiencies in detail, 
although it mentions quite a number of them. I would like to 
outline a couple of those. The minister has not followed the 
recommendations of the Senate standing committee on social 
affairs, science and technology when it studied Bill C-66 when it 
was before the House previously. The recommendations made really 
suggested that this federal legislation should give the right to 
workers to participate in secret ballot representation votes to 
determine whether a union would represent them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial labour legislation in Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, 
Nova Scotia and Newfoundland currently mandates secret ballots. 
It is only the NDP in B.C., when it recently came into power, 
that removed this right to secret ballots. That caused quite a 
lot of outrage in B.C. not just from business people but from 
union people as well that this ability to have a secret vote had 
been removed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, it amazes me that the NDP in B.C. and the NDP in this 
House, which both claim to be democratic, are not up in arms 
about this taking away of the democratic right for members in the 
union to have secret ballots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard to think of anything less democratic than placing 
union members in a position of being unable to cast their votes 
in a secret ballot. It leaves members of unions wide open to 
coercion by overzealous union bosses and to delegates who perhaps 
are getting carried away with a particular cause and just force 
people, through fear or otherwise, to vote in a particular 
manner.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine if we ran federal or provincial elections that way. 
Canada would be the target of sanctions and criticisms from the 
entire free world if we were selecting people in ballots that 
were not secret. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder how Liberal members can sleep at night knowing they are 
going to be voting with the instructions of their whip for 
something so undemocratic.   The NDP members should be outraged. 
They should be jumping in their seats at this blatant attack on 
democracy against their union members.  They have already 
demonstrated, by their interventions during the speech by the 
Reform member for Calgary—Nose Hill this morning, that they are 
not interested in even trying to defend the rights of the 
workers, the people they claim they are representing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As one of my colleagues mentioned a little earlier, Tommy 
Douglas would be turning in his grave if he could see the NDP 
today.  Tommy Douglas represented my riding back in the 
mid-1960s.  Tommy Douglas was the person who achieved the highest 
ever percentage of votes in the riding of North 
Vancouver—Burnaby.  He actually got 52.4% of the vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second highest was achieved by Reform in the 1997 election 
when I got 49.9% of the vote.  While it was still 3% away from 
the record set by Tommy Douglas, it does show an interesting 
progression in my riding, to digress for a moment. How it started 
was with the NDP in the mid-1960s, then it moved briefly to the 
Liberals, then back to the NDP, then to the PCs and now to 
Reform.  It is certainly interesting that Reform today is 
representing a greater percentage that has ever happened since 
the Tommy Douglas days.  He would be turning in his grave today 
if he could see what is happening with the NDP failing to fight 
for worker rights in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could it be that the NDP likes this bill because it virtually 
guarantees forced union certification, which in turn means the 
compulsory extraction of union dues from workers, which in turn 
helps fill the coffers of the NDP?  Maybe the NDP is not as 
democratic as it likes to make itself out to be. Maybe the NDP 
does not actually stand for New Democratic Party; maybe it stands 
for the no democracy party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will return to the points in the letter because it is a 
communication from the real world, outside of this place.  It 
details problems that are in Bill C-19, this hastily thought out 
legislation that is being rushed through.  There is really no 
need to rush this through.  It has been 25 years since this 
labour code has been revised.  There really is no need to rush 
through these sorts of provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote one of the objections listed in this letter: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new bill gives the Canada Industrial Relations Board the 
jurisdiction to certify a trade union that does not have majority 
support where “but for the unfair labour practice, the union 
could reasonably have been expected to have the support of the 
majority of employees in a unit”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, no union should ever be certified without a secret 
ballot.  If there are problems in the way the procedure took 
place leading up to the ballot that should be dealt with in other 
ways.  To take away the right of free ballot for the workers, to 
punish the employer, is totally ludicrous.  I cannot imagine why 
or how this government could think that was justified in any way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To quote again from the letter: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Neither the Canada Industrial Relations Board nor any other body 
has the capacity to rationally discharge a task which involves 
nothing more than wild speculation.  If an employer has committed 
an unfair labour practice, the board should sanction the 
employer, not deprive workers of the democratic right to vote on 
the wisdom of union representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dangers associated with this type of law were demonstrated 
when the Ontario Labour Relations Board, ignoring the will of the 
workers, certified the United Steelworkers of America as the 
bargaining agent for workers in a Wal-Mart Canada Inc. store in 
Windsor.  The workers had voted 151-43 against union 
representation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine if we were conducting our votes in Canada that way. 
Imagine if we had a federal election where the chief electoral 
officer could decide that he did not like the outcome in a 
particular riding and that he would appoint some other candidate 
to be the MP other than the winning candidate, thereby taking 
away the right of the voters in order to rectify some perceived 
wrong that occurred during the campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely outrageous.  If that were to happen in a true 
federal election situation, the chief electoral officer would 
order another vote and therefore return the power to the people 
who have the vote, not take away that right.  That is another 
good example of why this is a terrible provision in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just to remind the House, the Senate Standing Committee on 
Social Affairs, Science and Technology presented its report on 
Bill C-66 on April 25, 1997.  The government has had plenty of 
time to review and think about the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report stated that the committee had “concerns about 
whether the recent use of a similar clause by the Ontario Labour 
Relations Board in the Wal-Mart case is in fact an appropriate 
use of such a measure”. The letter writer shares this 
reservation, keenly aware of the danger that this provision 
represents to the democratic values Canadians hold and cherish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to finish by mentioning that all of us in the House 
should be fighting the bill tooth and nail.  It tramples on the 
democratic rights of Canadian workers.  It violates the 
fundamentals of freedom of voting in society.  It somehow 
suggests that cards are a reliable indication of a worker's 
intent in the certification process.  Just the fact that we can 
get someone to sign a card is sufficient proof the person will 
also support the forming of a union in a ballot.  It is an 
absolutely ludicrous provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the legislation is passed it will eliminate the need for 
unions to report on their financial status.  This is 
unbelievable.  That would put them in the same class as 
charities, which the House is just beginning to recognize needs 
to be dealt with, where they are totally unaccountable for the 
way they spend their money and are unanswerable to the people who 
give them money to do their work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could speak about the bill for some time but I see my time has 
elapsed.  I will now leave it for my colleagues to take up the 
charge.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to stand in the House and not just ask 
questions but make further comments with reference to some of the 
questions I asked earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole matter of unionization of labour law has to be 
challenged in a much more significant manner than what has been 
happening in the past.  Every country in the developed world 
except for Canada and Australia, as I indicated earlier, has 
dropped compulsory unionization of its members and the forced 
payment of union dues.  They have legislation, for the most part, 
to support that kind of a position.  It actually is a protection 
of rights and freedoms of the individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is funny that Canada has not embarked on this matter in a 
very substantial way.  However, listening to the comments of the 
Bloc, the NDP and certainly the Liberals, since they are the ones 
who put the bill forward, there is no intention on the part of 
the government to proceed in that fashion.  Yet the economics of 
it would indicate this is the direction our country should be

</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I asked the Bloc member a question on the Quebec charter 
of rights and freedoms.  I know it may not have a direct impact 
on the bill, but there is still a charter argument in the bill 
which I will get to in a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec charter of rights and freedoms provides the following 
basic rights.  Bloc members have been arguing for their province 
in this regard.  It also applies to the rest of the country 
because we too have a Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
that guarantees freedom of association as a fundamental freedom. 
That choice should be whether or not an individual would want to 
become part of a labour movement and be subject to its rules and 
regulations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have gone through Bill C-19 and have noted that a lot of 
emphasis is placed on the formation of the Canadian Industrial 
Relations Board.  It appears the Liberals like these particular 
types of boards.  They actually take away the responsibility of 
the minister to address the major concerns that may arise within 
that portfolio.  In this case the board is a quasi-judicial body. 
It is not unlike other quasi-judicial bodies the Liberal 
government likes setting up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board will be the final arbitrator or the final decision 
maker.  There will be no recourse for employers if 35% or 40% of 
a shop's employees decides to unionize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Labour will wash his hands just like all other 
ministers do when they have nice quasi-judicial bodies set up in 
their portfolios.  They say “No, fellow Canadians.  It is a 
quasi-judicial body and is independent of any interference from 
the political arena”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have already made their neat little choices as far as who 
is going to sit on the board.  Board members will make any 
decision they want and there will be no recourse for those who 
are unhappy.  That is a travesty of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members are selected for the board.  They do not even have to be 
Canadian citizens.  They will be sitting almost like judges and 
making decisions that impact on those in the labour market. There 
should be some provision in the bill that board members at least 
be Canadian citizens. They will have the power to make the 
decisions much like judges do even though they will not 
necessarily have to follow the rules of evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will be making decisions on certification, for instance. If 
a trade union wants to certify, the board may grant it that 
certification in spite of the fact that there will not even be a 
majority.  Again the employer will have very little to say about 
it.  Or, the board, making a decision on behalf of an application 
by the union to determine what the employer is doing with off 
site workers who are not unionized, could be compelled to send a 
list of the names and addresses of the workers.  That will be 
done without the consent of the employee, the off site worker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That again goes far beyond the mandate any board should be 
given.  I have seen some of the actions within unions when things 
heat up.  They are possibly jeopardizing the security and safety 
of the individuals or their families.  I do not think that is 
appropriate at all.  If something did in fact happen, who will 
advocate on behalf of off site workers?  Who?  I do not know of 
anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That in itself is a violation of privacy and a violation of the 
right of the off site worker to remain anonymous if necessary. No 
board should have the right to pass that information on to 
someone else.

privacy area where information on the names and addresses of 
individuals will be freely passed on to a union representative 
and could jeopardize the security and safety of those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point my finger at the Liberal government.  It feels no

violators that may be released from prison and jeopardize the

when it comes to the protection of the privacy of individual

who jeopardize the security of our communities the government 
releases the names of sexual predators to the community so that 
children will not be abused.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, ding 
dong, the union is calling.  That is the way this should lead 
off.  Bill C-19 allows for union organizers to get the lists of 
off site workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that mean for all those people who right now are 
operating in a contract capacity or outside the certification 
process?  Their names, their addresses and their contact 
information will be given to union organizers.  Those organizers 
will have access to other information available on the 
corporations' computers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You ask, Mr. Speaker, by whose consent this is done.  It is done 
by the consent of union organizers but certainly not by the 
consent of the employees and not by the consent of those 
employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is all at the wish of the Canadian Industrial Relations 
Board.  I would like to delve right into this if I might.  The 
bill would change the name of the Canada Labour Relations Board 
and create this new beast, the new Canada Industrial Relations 
Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are they really doing?  What is the whole purpose behind 
it?  They will give it a little more power and they will give it 
a little less accountability.  As a result it creates a whole lot 
more abuse when the two of them are coupled.  That is exactly 
what they are doing with a whole lot of other tribunals and 
boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They try to remove the minister from accountability and remove 
the ability of members in the House, including Liberal members, 
to make accountable these quasi-judicial boards or these 
governmental bodies.  They make them less accountable.  The 
members have less ability to rein in these powers.  Yet the 
boards have more and more power put on their plates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak to some of the things the new Canada 
Industrial Relations Board will be able to do.  Point number one 
is that it will be able to certify a union without the majority 
of employees actually taking a ballot, without their majority 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we think about that, it is a fundamental violation of 
democracy, the idea that a majority of employees does not have to 
vote in favour of certifying a union for it to be certified at 
that site. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will refer directly to some of the important decisions that 
have happened regarding this issue and that a card based system 
is notoriously unreliable. 
The Canada Labour Relations Board has said so when confronted 
with two unions both claiming majority support in the bargaining 
unit. People can refer to Communications Workers of Canada v. 
Communications Union Canada, 1979. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT36"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT36"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1300

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The workers' cards are no more reliable when the contest is 
between union representation and no union representation. This is 
a great example.  Two unions tried to claim majority support by 
cards.  Each union said that by this card based system it was the 
appropriate union to certify the site. That is a clear 
demonstration of why the card based system does not work.  Two 
unions can abuse the same card process and each can say that it 
has majority support.  That is one fundamental flaw with the card 
based system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other fundamental flaw is that you can actually have a vast 
discrepancy in what is considered proper majority support. I 
refer to a recent Ontario Labour Relations Board decision with 
regard to the United Steelworkers of America as the bargaining 
agent for the workers in Wal-Mart Canada.  The workers voted 151 
to 43 against union representation.  That is 151 were against 
union certification and 43 were in favour of certifying the 
United Steelworkers of America.  Yet the Ontario Labour Relations 
Board went ahead and decided the steelworkers would represent 
that site. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is there competition between unions that would violate 
this system, where multiple unions claim they have enough cards 
to sign people up, but there are also unions winning 
representation in places where there is no legitimate vote and 
where a majority of people have decided against having the 
steelworkers as their representatives.  How is that democratic? 
It fails so many fundamental tests of what this law should pass. 
However, the Liberals are going to endorse this legislation which 
would give these powers to this governmental organization, the 
proposed Canadian industrial relations board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not make any sense to give these types of powers.  You 
can quote me on this one and I hope others do.  No government and 
no quasi-judicial body asks for powers that it will not use or 
does not want to use.  This case is just like the Canada Wheat 
Board case.  It is asking for powers that it will use and abuse. 
I have given two perfect examples of how those powers have been 
abused by similar quasi-judicial bodies and it will be done by 
the Canada industrial relations board, mark my words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those Liberal MPs across the way will have to justify to their 
constituents, businesses and employees that they have passed this 
bill.  They will go to their MP offices and say “Look what has 
happened to me.  Look what the new monster that you voted in has 
done to my business or to my job”.  Those MPs will have to 
justify it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only do they not require majority consent and not only are 
they tossing out the whole idea of a secret ballot, which is 
fundamental to the concept of democracy, the union organizers 
will be given information on off site workers against their will. 
Those workers will have no consent whatsoever in this process. 
There is no provision in this bill that people must be asked if 
this should be done, no provision for obtaining their consent. 
It will be done against their wishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard people in the House today refer to notice of a 
strike or a lockout.  They have referred to the grain handling 
situation.  They have said that a 72 hour notice of a lockout or 
a strike will be able to protect grain shipments in Canada.  If 
only every union obeyed the law and never had a wildcat strike. 
Unfortunately we have seen too many times that a union has 
violated the laws and has held a wildcat strike without a proper 
vote from the workers for the go ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen unions go against their own workers' wishes and 
order them out on the picket lines. This happens because we do 
not have sufficient penalties to ensure those people do not 
violate the law.  There is no sequestering of assets.  There is 
no provision for putting union bosses in jail if they order 
people on to the picket lines without an appropriate vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again the Liberal government has failed.  It has failed 
because this is not an appropriate guarantee.   It has told 
farmers in western Canada that this legislation has a provision 
to ensure their grain will not be held up in the ports.  It is a 
misrepresentation. 
It is pulling the wool over the eyes of Canadian farmers.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed the government cannot guarantee it because this law has 
no teeth and without teeth it will not be able to enforce it. 
Wildcat strikes can and will occur under this legislation.  There 
is little or no provision for ensuring they do not.  The grain 
can still be held up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Replacement workers are effectively banned by Bill C-19.  I am 
sure that Liberal and NDP members will say this is not the case 
because it will only happen when representational capacity is 
affected.  If we look at other quasi-judicial bodies which have 
made rulings on these things, indeed they have determined that 
representational capacity means any situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again when a quasi-judicial body asks for a power, it will 
use it and it will abuse it.  Therefore we can bet our bottom 
dollar that replacement workers in this country will not be able 
to cross picket lines.  Operations will not be able to continue. 
Employers will not be able to use employees who are not unionized 
to continue their activities during a lockout or a strike.  Shame 
on the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some other things in the bill which really get my 
goat.  One is the fact that the definitions are so vague. This 
will give significant powers to the Canada industrial relations 
board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bureaucrats have designed the legislation and Liberals have not 
accurately read what it will mean.  They have not looked at the 
fine print.  They do not recognize that the bureaucrats have made 
the legislation vague in certain areas so as to give more powers 
to the quasi-judicial body which it can then abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to touch on another area which has been mentioned 
today, that being the whole idea of representing a majority of 
constituents or union members.  Forty-six per cent of all union 
households in Alberta want voluntary unionism.  They believe they 
should have a choice as to whether they are forced to join a 
union or pay dues.  Sixty-two per cent of all Albertans are in 
favour of that concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Democrats speak about making sure they represent the 
majority of their constituents, but it is they who make up the 
party which only represents big labour.  It is over a billion 
dollar industry in this country and the NDP only represents the 
top echelon of the labour movement.  It no longer represents the 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill does not provide for secret ballots for union 
elections.  It has no provision for democratic choice.  I could 
go on and on.  The bill is flawed.  It has to be reviewed.  It 
should not pass as it stands. 
<P><A NAME="LINK37"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to commend the hon. member for Wetaskiwin for his 
comments on this bill, as well as the hon. member for Calgary 
West who just outlined the problems with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will focus my speech on an alternative and why I think this 
alternative can work. I understand that government members are 
arguing that it will not work.  I will offer suggestions to them 
as to why it will work. It will save this country billions of 
dollars every year. I would ask them to listen carefully.  They 
have probably heard about this in the House before.  I am talking 
about final offer selection arbitration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I practised labour law.  Prior to that I worked in industrial 
relations for a forest products company where we faced these 
problems every day.  For five years I was involved in the 
negotiating process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To put it in a nutshell, final offer selection arbitration is 
when two parties, party <I>A</I> and party <I>B</I>, have both made 
their very best offer.  They have come to an impasse.  If they 
cannot reach a negotiated settlement the arbitrator is forced to 
pick only <I>A</I> or <I>B</I>, nothing in the middle.  One of the 
two must be picked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Final offer selection arbitration does not hamper the 
negotiating process.  In fact it helps it.  There will be more 
agreements negotiated between unions and employers with this type 
of a process than without. When all the benefits of this process 
are realized I believe it will be welcomed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parties know what will happen if they do not reach a 
negotiated settlement.  They will come to the table with the most 
reasonable offer, an offer which is close to where it should be. 
Instead of coming to the table saying that they want $35 an hour 
when they would really settle for $20, they are going to start at 
a very reasonable settlement because they know that if they reach 
an impasse the arbitrator is forced to pick one or the other.  If 
they are too far away from what really should be the appropriate 
settlement, the arbitrator is going to be forced to go the other 
way.  That is fundamental.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard criticisms from the government side saying that 
this is not just about money, that so many other issues are 
involved in negotiations.  There is everything from medical, to 
pensions, to benefits, to working conditions, to hours and also 
to salaries and compensation.  I would suggest to members on that 
side of the House that it is the entire package the arbitrator is 
forced to accept, either <I>A</I> or <I>B</I>, nowhere in between. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The union and the company comes to the table with a package.  It 
is not strictly money we are talking about. Both parties will 
come to the table with a package that is very close to reasonable 
because obviously if they are at an impasse, they will want their 
package to be selected.  If they are way out in left field or 
right field their package will not be selected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give an analogy of how well this works.  The civil courts 
in British Columbia have somewhat of a similar system. The 
principle is the same on how it works.  Two people who are going 
to sue each other file a lawsuit in the supreme court. Let us say 
someone sues someone else for $100,000. The person being sued 
disagrees and offers $60,000 to settle out of court. The parties 
get together before they go to trial and make offers back and 
forth.  If they are unable to reach a settlement prior to going 
to court, then in the court the justice makes a decision and the 
party on the wrong side has to pay a premium of the court costs 
of the other party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, if the person who was being sued for $100,000 
made an offer for $60,000 and it was not accepted, and the judge 
made a decision of $59,000, then because they did not accept that 
offer the other party would have to pay their court costs because 
they were right.  I know I might be losing some people in this 
analogy but the bottom line is that it forces the lawyers when 
they are making their offers to be as reasonable as possible to 
what they think a judge would impose.  By doing that they come 
very close together and quite often they settle.  Exactly the 
same principle would work here in final offer selection 
arbitration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By doing that the unions and the companies will come to the 
table with very reasonable packages because they do not want an 
offer imposed on them.  Worse off, if their offer is so far out 
of range, they know that the arbitrator will be forced to select 
the other offer without question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the government members to listen to this.  Look at 
what happened just in the last year, the number of strikes we 
have had, the lost productivity and the lost opportunities for 
this country.  It was in the billions of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to have legislation that would assist companies and 
unions into a negotiated settlement.  I emphasize this because it 
does not take away anyone's right to a negotiated settlement. The 
only thing it changes in the whole process is the very last step 
of does an arbitrator impose a settlement if that situation is 
reached, or is there a mechanism in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This mechanism would force the arbitrator into choosing one or 
the other, as I have stated. Therefore, the parties would come 
together and it would be a better situation. It is such a simple 
system and would offer so much to our economy.  Our economy is 
growing and it would grow that much quicker. The lost opportunity 
is in the billions of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask members of the government to revisit this bill.  It 
is amending the Canada Labour Code and the government has missed 
probably the one biggest thing that it could do to assist the 
unions, to assist companies and more importantly to assist 
taxpayers and Canadians to make sure that we are not losing this 
economic opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, as we have heard from previous speakers, this is going 
against the principle of democracy with the secret ballots and 
replacement workers. 
It is beyond me why this government is addressing all these 
issues. It will be nice to find out what it is really up to.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, this is to offer a constructive alternative. The 
criticism from the government side is that this will not work 
because we are not just talking about money. I emphasize that 
this is not just about money.  This final offer selection 
arbitration or whatever name we might want to give it is the 
entire package that the parties bring to the table. This 
principle has been tried in other systems.  It has been proven 
that it works.  It will force parties to come very close to the 
middle.  I ask the government to take a look at this.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South—Weston, Ind.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to make some submissions 
with respect to Bill C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill was introduced in the last Parliament.  Because of the 
election call in June the amendments to the Canada Labour Code 
died and here it is again in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been listening very carefully to the comments that have 
been made by a number of speakers.  I share some of the concerns. 
I am particularly impressed with the comments made by the member 
for Saanich—Gulf Islands with respect to this notion of final 
offer selection arbitration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get to that, I wish to comment with respect to the 
concerns I have with the bill itself.  This is second reading of 
Bill C-19. Second reading will send this bill to committee for 
consideration.  I am sure that interested parties from across the 
country will come forward at the committee stage.  Hopefully some 
of the deficiencies in this bill will be corrected at the 
committee stage and there will be a willingness on the part of 
the government to listen to some of the concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that the Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour is 
present in the House today.  I know her to be an extremely 
hardworking member of Parliament. She is open minded.  She is 
receptive to change in order to improve bill. I am sure that 
rather simply defending some of the inadequacies in the bill she 
will play a leading role in convincing the government, the 
minister in particular, to correct some of these deficiencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a democrat believing in the principles of democracy, I have a 
concern that this new named board, the Canada Industrial 
Relations Board, would be able under certain circumstances to 
certify a union even though a majority of the workers in that 
bargaining unit are opposed to certification.  That does not make 
any sense at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are living in a democracy, if we believe in democratic 
principles, surely those principles should apply to the 
workplace.  If a majority of those in a workplace are opposed to 
the formation or the certification of a union, then it simply 
should not happen.  Frankly, I am surprised as well that certain 
members of this House who often talk about choice, who often talk 
about democracy and accountability, would be opposed to honouring 
that very basic principle of democracy, that the majority of a 
group should be listened to. I have concerns about the provision 
in the bill that allows for certification even though a minority 
of the workers would want certification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Secret ballots are important as well.  We all know that in union 
drives and in certain circumstances in labour relations members 
of a particular bargaining unit are afraid to speak out, to 
express their true wishes.  It seems that secret votes would take 
away the ability in certain circumstances for coercion to take 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are two of the major concerns I have.  I am sure the 
parliamentary secretary will be addressing those concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the comments of the hon. member for 
Saanich—Gulf Islands, I know it is a position that is shared by 
a good number of members in this House which is a constructive 
proposal on final offer selection arbitration.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems we have with labour relations in this 
country, and other jurisdictions share the same problem, is that 
it is adversarial in nature.  It is we versus them.  The system 
has developed over the years where employers are fighting against 
employees.  It is wrong.  We have come to a point in the history 
of this country and in the history of labour relations where we 
ought to find mechanisms and methods of removing some of the 
adversarial nature from labour relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This adversarial component is further entrenched in the 
legislation.  Section 9(1)(c) refers to the establishment and 
organization of the Canada Industrial Relations Board.  It says 
“not more than six other members of which not more than three 
represent employees and of which not more than three represent 
employers”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the make-up of the board we are further entrenching this 
adversarial nature so that we need union people on one side and 
employer people on the other.  That is not a healthy situation. 
The people who ultimately suffer, the people who are ultimately 
penalized are the public as well as workers.  The damage that 
ensues to companies in certain circumstances and in certain 
strike situations is irreparable.  We know of cases where 
companies have literally had to close down because of labour 
strife. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This notion of final offer selection arbitration is an attempt 
to diminish the adversarial nature of labour relations in this 
country.  As the member points out, the negotiations continue to 
take place.  That is very important.  Both sides will negotiate. 
When an impasse is reached, rather than shutting down the doors 
of the factory or utilizing that ultimate weapon on the part of 
labour, the strike weapon which does not help anyone, both sides 
are forced to submit themselves to final offer selection 
arbitration.  That would require, as the hon. member points out, 
both sides to be reasonable.  They have to be reasonable in their 
positions.  If they are unreasonable they run the risk of the 
arbitration panel selecting the package put forward by the other 
side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that some of the very basic principles of 
negotiation is that you ask for far more than you expect to get 
with the view to finding common ground at some point.  What this 
does is eliminate these ridiculous positions that are put forward 
on the part of labour and on the part of management.  What is 
requires them to do is put forward a package. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This makes good sense because this would avoid or eliminate a 
great number of strikes.  We are dealing with a very small 
percentage of the labour force.  This code applies only to 
federally regulated industries.  It does not apply to 
provincially regulated industries.  This notion of final offer 
selection arbitration could apply not only to industries that are 
federally regulated but to provincially regulated industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government will consider this proposal being put 
forward by members of the Reform Party and other people in this 
country.  It makes sense.  It is in the public interest.  I hope 
that at committee the government will be persuaded that we have 
to find mechanisms and ways to remove some of the adversarial 
nature of labour relations in this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in knowing the source of this bill I was quite 
astonished to find that there are a couple of minor points in it 
that actually represent good legislation and that I approve of. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1325"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT41"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT41"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1325
<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One is that there is provision in there for 72 hours notice of 
strike or lockout. This would allow shippers of perishable goods 
to get their materials out of harm's way and it would also allow 
ships to leave port rather than being trapped there in the event 
of a harbour strike. I like that in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also liked the provision that provides for maintenance of 
service in vital industries where public health and safety are at 
risk.  However, over and beyond that I have not found much in the 
bill to like. There are some things in it that make me almost 
apoplectic because this bill, no matter how you cut it, tramples 
on the rights of Canadian workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right at the top of my list is the privacy issue. During a 
certification drive under this bill, employers will be required 
to give union organizers lists of their employees complete with 
addresses and telephone numbers, without workers' consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian privacy commissioner, Mr. Phillips, has described 
this procedure as totally unacceptable. But that has not 
encouraged this government to back off. Anyone who thinks that 
having his or her name on a little list is not a threat to a 
worker should look back a few weeks to the attempt in British 
Columbia at recall where everyone who signed a recall petition 
had to provide his name and address. There are documented cases 
in northwestern British Columbia of workers being afraid to sign 
on to these recall petitions because their names and addresses 
would go directly to the union hall. We know where you live. This 
is not the way things are supposed to operate in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another anti-democratic feature of this bill is that secret 
ballots are not going to be a requirement for certification. 
Quite the contrary.  Filling out cards will be regarded as ample. 
They get enough cards signed, they are certified. No vote, no 
problem. If someone does not sign the card, maybe they know where 
that person lives.  This is not the way unions are supposed to be 
run. This sounds like the way the Teamsters operated in the bad 
old days before the ordinary workers regained control of their 
union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gets worse. This legislation opens the door for certification 
by the Canada Industrial Relations Board of a union on a work site 
without majority support. I do not suppose this should be a big 
surprise when we consider that this bill was drafted by the same 
political party that brought Hal Banks into Canada to whip our 
Canadian seamen into line a few years ago. Democracy forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for York—South Weston has previously stated, this 
bill preserves the adversarial nature of labour negotiations. In 
fact, it entrenches it even more deeply than it is now. The 
government should have had a bill to bring labour relations into 
the 21st century, not back into the 19th. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could have had provision in this bill for final offer 
selection arbitration. I am sure Mr. Speaker will know more about 
final offer selection arbitration before this day is done than 
virtually anyone else in Canada. Very few of us have failed to 
mention it because it is important. This is a tool to keep labour 
and management honest. It is a took to smooth the negotiating 
process.  Do away with this us or them idea, let's hit the 
bricks, fellows, let's give it to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ordinary, sensible, reasonable people can sit down and sharpen 
their pencils. If they reach an impasse, each one puts down their 
final offer. 
This is the best they can do; that is the best they can live 
with.  They hand it to the arbitrator who then selects.  That 
ends the dispute at least until the next negotiations come up. It 
is the civilized way of doing business.  It does not detract one 
iota from the rights of either workers or management, but it 
benefits the general public and, from an economic point of view, 
benefits workers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They do not have to hit the bricks.  They do not have to live on 
strike pay for weeks on end and possibly in the end get nothing 
for their efforts.  It is settled.  It is done.  Everybody ends 
up a little unhappy but everybody ends up with something they can 
live with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the wave of the future in labour relations.  I think it 
is coming.  It is an idea that in due course will take over 
labour-management relations.  I can only hope it will be 
reasonably soon.  I deeply regret that no provision was built 
into the bill for federally regulated workers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it certainly is a pleasure to follow my colleague in 
discussing the bill before the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at all the different forms of legislation there is 
a lot of good things in them.  If we look at the bill, it is 
essentially the same as Bill C-66 which died in the Senate after 
there was so much furore in the Senate over some of the issues 
that were brought forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the administration of the code, the Canada Labour 
Relations Board becomes the Canada Industrial Relations Board. It 
is a nice, simple change in name.  I do not know how much it 
costs in the bureaucracy to do that.  Somebody dreamt that one 
up.  It is sort of harmless although it probably cost a lot of 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The terms of the chair and the vice-chair are reduced from 10 
years to 5 years.  We can accept that.  Any government 
appointments that are reduced in numbers are certainly better 
than those that are increased in numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be a maximum of six permanent members, three 
representing employers and three representing employees.  That 
sounds fine.  Then it says “and as many part time members as the 
cabinet deems necessary”.  That surely scares me because we see 
defeated Liberal members like Anna Terrana getting appointed to 
the Immigration Appeal Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The many people who were defeated in the last election and the 
many people who do favours might get appointed as part time 
members to this board.  It is a nice way for them to make a few 
extra bucks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing I noticed in the bill, besides amending part I of 
the Canada Labour Code it revamps or renames the Canada Labour 
Relations Board and relinquishes Statistics Canada from the 
current method of reflecting union data.  Anything that reduces 
Statistics Canada cannot be all bad either.  As I said, there are 
some good things and some bad things in every bill, but this one 
certainly has some bad ones that stand out very clearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The representation successor rights section says that the CIRB 
can certify a union without support from the majority of 
employees.  This provision exists in a number of provincial codes 
used recently in Ontario to certify a union at Wal-Mart, despite 
the fact the majority of the employees voted against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That type of legislation is more than scary.  I come from a 
province that is very heavily unionized.  A lot of the unions 
work very hard and do a good job.  I had a restaurant at one time 
that was unionized.  It operated very successfully.  However, 
when I look at a majority not being able to get what it wants, it 
scares me.  When I look at a majority overruling the minority, it 
scares me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly the House would not be the same if we voted the same 
way the bill will allow votes to take place.  We are all elected 
with a majority, one more than the guy next to us.  That is what 
counts and is what we should look at in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What really scares me in the bill is that the CIRB can order an 
employer to release to a union representative a list of names and 
addresses of employees who work off site.  This clause has been 
tightened up but there is no provision for obtaining the 
employee's consent.  This clause absolutely astounds me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians watching the debate today will hear members on this 
side talking.  They will wonder why nobody on the other side of 
the House, nobody on the socialist side is talking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To allow a name to go out to anyone without the person's consent 
is beyond comprehension.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague who spoke before me made a great representation on 
what happened in British Columbia with recall legislation.  We 
heard stories from reporters that a lot of people were leery 
about signing it because their names would be made public.  When 
we vote our names are not made public.  To vote in privacy is a 
privilege and a right we all have.  Yet the legislation will 
allow someone to take a list of names and addresses, go to their 
homes and tell them what to do. It is unbelievable that any 
government would bring in this kind of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but relate the bill to other issues.  As the 
immigration critic for my party I asked the minister many 
questions.  I asked her about a triad leader in British Columbia, 
a major gang leader in the world who came into Canada illegally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government eventually proved that.  It hired a consultant to 
go to Los Angeles to find out how he got into the country.  It 
admitted that he got here and should not have got here.  After 
the government spent all that money to find out why that triad 
leader got into Canada illegally, I asked the minister a question 
in the House.  I said “When are you going to get rid of him?  He 
has a big house in Vancouver.  His family is living there.  He 
got into Canada illegally.  He is a criminal”.  The minister 
said to me “I cannot answer that question because of the Privacy 
Act”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This man was in our country illegally.  He was a crook.  There 
was a drive-by shooting at his house.  However the minister could 
not tell the people of Canada why he was here because of the 
Privacy Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the bill an employer will be compelled to release to union 
representatives a list of names and addresses of employees. Where 
is their privacy?  We give privacy to one of the biggest crooks 
in the world, who is not even a Canadian citizen, yet citizens of 
the country do not have enough privacy to keep their names and 
addresses from a union leader.  We should be ashamed this clause 
is even in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the same minister a question a few weeks ago about a 
couple of Haitians in Montreal who gang raped a young girl.  I 
said “What about deporting those people?”  The minister said 
“I cannot answer that question because of the Privacy Act”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two men gang raped a woman and we cannot get information 
about them because of the Privacy Act.  Yet in this bill—and I 
will continue to repeat it—the CIRB can order an employer to 
release to the union representative a list of names and addresses 
of employees who work off site. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of rights do those Canadian citizens have?  What kind 
of rights do landed immigrants have?  Their names can be given 
out to anyone, whether it is a union representative or a 
political party.  The next thing we will do is demand that 
everything be made public.  Our names will be published no matter 
what we do.  We will all go nuts, but the mail will get through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my constituency my postmaster said “If you want to get rid 
of junk mail, just put a sign on your mailbox and you will not 
receive it any more”.  That is my right.  If I do not want junk 
mail I do not have to receive it.  In this case someone can walk 
into the employer's office and say “Give me the list of your 
employees.  I am thinking of unionizing your shop”.  That is 
against the Privacy Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand why government members are not speaking.  We 
have asked the question and it will be asked again many times 
during this debate.  How can we allow anyone to walk into a 
company and ask it to release the names and addresses of its 
employees without affecting the Privacy Act?  We use the Privacy 
Act to protect crooks and thieves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a newspaper article which I would like to quote 
regarding a warrant that went out in Canada.  The article is by 
Tom Godfrey of the Toronto <I>Sun</I>.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP have broadened their hunt for a violent immigrant who 
was granted Canadian citizenship even though he was jailed for 
killing a man in Texas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fitzroy Ellsworth Dixon, 31, a landed immigrant from Jamaica, 
has been sought on a Canada-wide warrant since last December, 
said Sgt. Paul McIsaac.  Police stepped up the search yesterday, 
releasing a mug-shot of the fugitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>McIsaac said Dixon was convicted in Texas in 1992 for drug 
trafficking and involuntary manslaughter and jailed for five 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Apparently, he shot and killed a man in a fight over drugs”, 
McIsaac said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>McIsaac said Dixon was released from a U.S. federal prison in 
May 1994 and ordered deported to Jamaica. 
Dixon, instead of waiting in the U.S. to be deported, returned to 
Canada and applied for citizenship, apparently failing to mention 
his criminal record or that he had been out of the country for 
several years, McIsaac said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dixon was granted citizenship in February 1996, and the police 
didn't find out about his criminal past until he was arrested in 
Toronto for robbery in December.  He was convicted but released 
on probation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked questions about Mr. Dixon, and because of the Privacy 
Act we were not able to talk about him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people listening out there might be afraid because there was 
a warrant issued for this man.  I am very happy to say he was 
arrested in the city of Toronto yesterday.  Hopefully the 
minister will deport him.  However, when we ask questions about 
him, it is the Privacy Act.  We cannot talk about Mr. Dixon, the 
murderer, the drug man, because of the Privacy Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet what does this bill say?  The CIRB can order an employer to 
release to a union representative a list of names and addresses 
of employees who work off site.  It should be an outrage that 
anyone would even think of putting this kind of legislation 
before the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know every day that we debate in the House the freedoms 
of people, the right to privacy in Canada.  Nobody should be 
allowed to have my name and address or wherever I work.  It is 
not their right.  It is my right to my privacy when I go to my 
home. If I want to publish my name and address I do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even as a member of Parliament we can use our constituency 
office as an address.  We do not have to use our home address.  A 
lot of members do but it is their right and freedom to do so.  In 
this situation they are taking away the rights of all Canadians 
with this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I know there will be amendments so I will speak 
later. 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
privilege to address the House on Bill C-19, to amend part I of 
the Canada Labour Code.  Some eloquent speeches were made this 
morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not help but think of an experience I had during the 
last election campaign.  I went to a door that was answered by a 
young person.  We started talking about the upcoming election.  I 
asked him whether he would be voting this time.  He said “Yes, 
this is the first time I will vote.  I am proud of it.  I really 
want to vote”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We got talking about what the various parties represented.  That 
young person was aware and thrilled about the ability of being 
able to vote.  He was on fire because he wanted to get involved 
in the election.  That right to vote is being denied in this 
legislation to the workers of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose behind labour legislation is to create harmony 
between employers and employees, harmony that will result in 
increased productivity and greater efficiency and will create the 
goods and services we need.  That is what this legislation is all 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For some reason or other built into the legislation are not 
principles that create harmonization, not principles that create 
harmony in working together, but rather principles of 
confrontation, principles of invasion of privacy, principles of 
denial of the democratic process.  It is an indictment of a 
government that proposes this kind of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes beyond simply denying a vote.  It goes into the details 
of allowing a quasi-judicial board with no political or 
administrative accountability to do this.  I read directly from 
the bill.  “The board” that is the Canada Industrial Relations 
Board “may certify a trade union despite a lack of evidence of 
majority support”.  Is this not absolutely amazing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada saying that even 
though the people did not vote for the Liberals they would still 
be the government.  It would be terrible.  It is hard to imagine 
how anyone would dare to do such a thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then it goes into substituting a card for a ballot. 
My hon. colleague from Vancouver West has just mentioned how easy 
it is to intimidate someone by going to their door and asking 
them to sign a card.  We also heard the conflict that can exist 
when two unions are in competition with each other to get the 
members to come to them and they use the same process to prove 
that they are the winners.  That is the kind of situation we are 
in at this point. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interestingly enough the bill provides for and insists that 
there be a secret ballot when the members decide to strike, or if 
a group of employers want to lock out a group, that requires a 
secret ballot.  Is this not interesting, that which will affect 
my life as a member of a working union can be subject and open to 
everyone, but when it comes to whether or not I am going to vote 
for a strike it has to be done by a secret ballot.  There is a 
complete contradiction of principles here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to move to an area that was touched on so eloquently by 
the member for Vancouver West, which is the business of privacy. 
This list of names is now obligatory.  For what purpose will that 
list of names be used?  To send out information?  To appeal to me 
to become a member of this particular group?  To be bombarded 
with unsolicited mail from people we do not want to hear from? 
We have no way of knowing how this list of names will be used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that if the power is granted to get this access to 
information, how the information is used becomes completely 
unpredictable.  The points are very clear in the act as to how 
the list of names shall be used.  It states that the list shall 
be used for purposes relating to soliciting trade union 
memberships; the negotiation or administration of a collective 
agreement; the processing of a grievance; or the provision of a 
trade union service to employees.  That is what it shall be used 
for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is no guarantee that the list will be used like 
that.  It may be used for other purposes.  The access has now 
been given to private information.  Once private information is 
out there, it can be used in whatever way the individual who has 
it chooses to use it.  That is frightening.  The potential for 
abuse and misuse is severe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at another provision in this act which relates to 
the same thing.  It comes in clause 54 where the following 
provision is made: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For greater certainty, the following may not be disclosed 
without the consent of the person who made them: 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not everything that can be made public, but there are 
certain people who are protected from invasion of their privacy. 
The first one is: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) notes or draft orders or decisions of the Board or any of 
its members, or of an arbitrator or arbitration board chairperson 
appointed by the Minister under this Part; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) notes or draft reports of persons appointed by the Minister 
under this Part to assist in resolving disputes or differences, 
or of persons authorized or designated by the Board to assist in 
resolving complaints or issues in dispute before the Board. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One could argue that is privileged information in the actual 
negotiating process. And it is correct to say that.  That 
information should be private and it should be confidential.  But 
what is more secret, what is more private and what is more 
confidential than the names of myself and my family and the 
address of where we live?  It seems to me that has the same 
significance as do the notes and draft orders from the 
negotiating process.  The bill fails on that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area has to do with the replacement workers. 
I refer to clause 42(2): 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No employer or person acting on behalf of an employer shall use, 
for the demonstrated purpose of undermining a trade union's 
representational capacity rather than the pursuit of legitimate 
bargaining objectives, the services of a person who was not an 
employee in the bargaining unit—

point that if an employer is using a replacement worker for that 
purpose he cannot use that person and therefore this bill is 
absolutely sacrosanct and absolutely pure and great. Is that not 
a very interesting interpretation of this clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How will anyone ever be able to show clearly and without any 
doubt or equivocation that the person was hired to do one thing 
and one thing only, to destroy the union?  It is totally 
irresponsible and ridiculous to make a claim like that.  That is 
the protection.  That protection has such a big hole in it you 
could drive an 18 wheeler through it and you would not even know 
you had gone through the hole.  That is what has been done here. 
That is an absolutely irresponsible clause.  I do not think it is 
a good clause but even if it were, the way it is written makes it 
absolutely impossible to enforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will discuss the accountability of the proposed board.  A 
Liberal member made the point that the board is accountable, that 
it must submit an annual report to the minister.  Guess what the 
annual report contains.  It will be a statistical report that 
contains an analysis of those statistics.  Is that not 
interesting.  It will tell the minister how many members there 
were over various years.  There is no requirement for the board 
to report how much money it gathered, whom it gathered it from, 
how it was spent or to whom it was sent.  There is absolutely no 
accountability whatsoever.  My interpretation of the statement 
that the annual report will make the board accountable is 
nonsense.  It does nothing of the kind.  We take very strong 
exception to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to end on a positive note.  We want harmony between 
employers and employees.  This will make us a competitive nation. 
It will build our businesses and employ our young people.  In 
order to do that, my colleagues and I in the Reform Party have 
advocated the following phrase which members will have memorized 
if they have been listening:  We need final offer selection 
arbitration. That is what we need.  That will give people the 
kind of harmony we need.  It will avoid the confrontation that 
makes people fight. It will bring them together to say “Let us 
do this together”. 
<P><A NAME="LINK42"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is too bad this bill which was brought in by my hon. 
colleague has come before the presentation of the national 
budget.  I assure the House many people in Canada consider the 
passage of this bill as being more important than the important 
budget that is coming down today. The passage of this bill 
determines how negotiations will take place in the Canadian 
workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is tremendously interesting to note that the Privacy Act 
suddenly takes on a different meaning.  When we passed Bill C-4, 
the wheat board bill, we absolutely had to have it.  It is a 
public company, a government organization, but we will seal it 
up, we will lock it in, put the zipper on it.  It required 
privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have something where privacy is thrown out the window 
depending on who you want to benefit.  The benefit is if you want 
to protect the government organization, you want to protect the 
government business, you invoke the Privacy Act, but if you want 
to destroy something, you open up the Privacy Act.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would caution workers, I would caution companies to take a 
very close look at this bill.  Even if it does get passed, which 
we on this side hope it does not, I hope they will be able to 
come back to the government and say “You are violating a human 
public principle that we have had in Canada since 1867. You are 
about to wipe it out ”.  The government pretends it does not see 
it in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note that it says this board will have six permanent members, 
three from employees, three from employers and the interesting 
thing, as many part time members as who deems necessary?  As the 
minister deems necessary.  And how many are necessary, 20, 25? 
Let us see what the political decision is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the labour on one side and the employers on the other. 
Twenty people are brought in from the government to tip the 
balance.  The government will then determine whether it goes in 
favour of the employer or the employee.  And that is fair?  I 
cannot understand this government saying this bill is 
non-partisan when it opens the doors for more partisanship than 
we have every had in labour relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unions supported me in the June 2 election.  The reason they 
supported me was they understood that unless there was the type 
of policy which Reform is trying to introduce, their future was 
just about nil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to the clause that the board can end a stoppage if 
public health and safety are at risk.  The largest union in my 
constituency is the coal workers who supply the coal to the 
Saskatchewan Power Corporation.  They can never go on strike. 
They could let the 72 hours go by because supplying hydro would 
be considered in the interest of public safety.  The union 
workers who mine the coal could never be in a strike position and 
could never be in a strong negotiating position because all the 
government has to do is declare that it is not in the best 
interests.  We take away the right to strike from the largest 
union in my constituency.  And we say that the bill is designed 
for modernization?

have just come from the Reform youth convention. They wrote the

</I></B></P><P align=left>Number 10:  They do not know how to deal with people who care 
about policy and not just power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number 9:  Their idea of a young person is someone who should be 
seen and not heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number 8:  They are afraid of new ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number 7:  Because they cannot handle four snack packers let 
alone 260. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number 6:  Because when young Reformers talk about future 
senators, they are talking about a hockey team not a bunch of 
bagged out, slack jawed party hacks parked in patronage heaven. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number 5:  Because Reform youth want to see a balanced budget 
that offers real hope, not a transparent attempt to buy their 
votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number 4:  Because when Liberals and Tories see a Reform youth 
convention, they can envision a parliament with 260 Reform 
members in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number 3:  Because the national Reform youth convention means a 
convention with young people from every region in every part of 
this great country.

Mr. Speaker, you will notice that the Prime Minister did not 
answer the question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister wriggles, the Prime Minister evades, exactly 
like he did before the budget when we were supposed to see the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, to make sure the hon. member did not miss it, we 
outlined in dark lettering on the side of page 28 the following: 
“We will allocate our budget surpluses so that over the course 
of our mandate, one half will be spent to improve our programs, 
and one half will go to tax cuts and reduction of the debt”.  It 
is very clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we have a surplus we will have about a billion dollars.  Of 
course when we split it up there will be $500 million on one side 
and $500 million on the other side over the course of the

<P><A NAME="LINK84"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr.

of five years and we have done it in four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I will call the Minister of Finance to ask him to change 
the budget in case we balance it this year.  We should probably

are not going to get it.  The Prime Minister says “I am really

<P><A NAME="LINK91"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
regards the millennium fund, there is no indication that the government 
intends to respect the jurisdiction of the Quebec government, which has 
been administering, for over 30 years, a loan and scholarship fund that 
is much more elaborate than those of the other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, in December 1995, this government passed a motion on Quebec's 
distinct character and pledged to take note of it and act accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the Prime Minister, who said the motion meant something, 
stubbornly trying to duplicate Quebec's own program, through a new 
standardized Canada-wide program? 
<P><A NAME="LINK92"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
believe that one of Canada's top priority is to prepare our young people 
to face the challenges of the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we got our finances in better shape than anticipated for the 
year 1997-98, we decided to set some money aside to create the 
millennium fund, so that young Canadians, including Quebeckers, can 
attend the universities administered by provincial governments and thus 
prepare themselves to take their place in the 21st century. 
<P><A NAME="LINK93"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
takes some nerve. By the year 2002, the federal government will have cut 
$10 billion from post-secondary education, and the Prime Minister is 
telling us about a new program that is being condemned not only by the 
Quebec government, but also by the Quebec Liberal Party, the students, 
the teachers and the deans of universities. These people are unanimous 
in saying that the new program does not meet Quebec's needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given this new consensus in Quebec, why is the Prime Minister 
stubbornly refusing, in the face of all logic, to give Quebec the right 
to completely withdraw from the program, with full compensation, as 
provided in the agreements signed with Jean Lesage, back in the sixties? 
<P><A NAME="LINK94"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to see that the hon. member recognizes that Quebec's scholarship 
program is funded with federal money even though it is administered by 
the province. I hope they will tell students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time, we are in the enviable position of being able to 
help students. When the first ministers' meeting was held in 
December, provincial premiers asked us to make a special effort 
to help students deal with their debt load, and to help them 
continue to attend university. Such was the wish expressed by the 
premiers at the federal-provincial meeting—

said, and I quote: “It will be the policy of the Government to seek 
to clarify the federal government's responsibilities in relation to 
those of other orders of government, to eliminate overlap and 
duplication”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we to understand that the only original way the federal 
government has found of clarifying its responsibilities, of 
eliminating overlap and duplication, is to create a coast-to-coast 
program of millennium scholarships, a complete invasion of 
provincial jurisdiction?

out, there will be no duplication with what the Government of

Mr. Speaker, over the course of this Parliament we are using a 35 
second time limit for questions and answers. But as a result of 
prolonged applause or heckling at times, I am experiencing that 
members of our party and I suggest other members of the House are 
often cut off because they do not have time to get their 
questions out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the Speaker is cognizant of this but I would ask your 
indulgence at times when a person does not have the ability to 
put the question forward.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The hon. member's point is well taken.  The 
hon. House leader of the Reform Party brought this point up to me 
earlier on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have taken it upon myself that where there is either prolonged 
applause or non-applause I give a bit of room.  I hear where the 
applause starts and then I try to make the adjustment as close as 
I can.  I will go over a bit, but not too much.  This House has 
agreed that it will be 35 seconds for questions and 35 seconds 
for answers.  I try to come in under that basis but members will 
have to leave me a bit of room to manoeuvre.

<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
we have seen today two points of order asking for a unanimous 
consent in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently we saw in the House unanimous consent being asked five 
times in one day on the same issue.  Would it be the Speaker's 
intention to hear this point of order identical to the one we 
have just heard from the NDP and the Conservatives? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> Your Speaker would have to be clairvoyant to 
know what every member is going to say.  I would have to hear 
what every hon. member has to say before I would make any kind of 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In direct answer to your question, I will hear as many points of 
order as the House would want me to hear.  After I have heard up 
to a certain point where I can figure out what they are doing, I 
would put a question, for example whether there is permission to 
put a motion.  We would go from there. 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South—Weston, Ind.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I do not believe that the matter has been clarified.  It 
is important that the Speaker clarify this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point that was raised was that on occasion, given the rules 
of this House, unanimous consent is required in order to take a 
particular course of action.  The point is that once unanimous 
consent is not given to a particular proposal, is it possible for 
that same proposal or that same initiative to come forward time 
and time again on the same day? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me if unanimous consent is denied when the question 
is put ab initio that should be the end of the matter for that 
day.  Otherwise we are faced with a situation that defeats the 
whole purpose behind that rule that says you require unanimous 
consent in order to take a particular course of action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a single member of Parliament decides for whatever reason to 
deny unanimous consent in order to ensure that a particular 
initiative does not come forward on any given day, that person 
has to be glued to his or her seat for the entire day.  That is 
not in keeping with the intent of that rule. 
<P><A NAME="LINK189"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, instead of having a prolonged 
debate as to whether we should change the rules, I respectfully 
suggest to the House that in April we will be debating rules 
generally.  These are points hon. members might want to bring up 
at that time, either for or against a particular proposition.

agreement between House leaders to take place at some point in 
April. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that would be an appropriate time to make that 
contribution on the topic in question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Once again, the rules of the House are those 
that have been decided by the House.  I, like you, am bound by 
the rules.  There has to be a certain sense of fairness and there 
has to be a certain flexibility in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What if an hon. member brings up a point for unanimous consent 
and it is refused.  The other House leaders could come together 
and decide that maybe there was a mistake and the same point is 
brought up again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I give myself and all the Speakers, of course, the 
latitude to at least hear enough to find out which way this is 
going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope this would not be abused by members of the House where 
one or two or ten members would go through the whole thing.  I 
think once we got the feel of it, we could make the decision at 
that time.

amendments to other acts, be read the second time and referred to 
a committee.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to complete a few thoughts 
I had regarding this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time is a wonderful thing for having Canadians look back on a 
bill with some reflection.  Although we are discussing this bill 
at the present time, let us look down the road about a month's 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just like people now looking at the CPP, they now have some 
questions to ask about the government's investment board.  Just 
like people who have recently passed Bill C-4, the Senate decided 
it had better have a better look. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should have a permanent and fair resolution process in order, 
something that is far removed from the desires of the government, 
something that is far removed from the whims of the government at 
any time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly what Reform's position is, something that will 
get government out and allow the employees and the employers to 
have a peaceful settlement over the course of action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to draw one conclusion as it relates to some of the 
ambiguous terms of this.  It says that this board that comes 
together can have a work stoppage if public health and safety are 
at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Saskatchewan we can have blizzards at any time.  Many times 
we have blizzards without even the weather forecast coming in. 
The highway workers are on strike because public health or safety 
are not considered to be involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as my hon. colleague from Cypress Hills—Grasslands 
mentioned, what about ambulance services being involved?  The 
highway workers are on strike and the roads are blocked.  What if 
somebody dies on the way to emergency care? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This type of legislation does not solve anything now or in the 
future.  We do not need government interference.  What we need is 
for both parties to understand that they can rely on fair and 
equitable treatment to be in place and that the government's 
hands will be completely off.  There will be a final selection 
arbitration which will be an effective tool and will permanently 
resolve all the disputes we have had in labour issues under the 
previous administrations.

<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak to Bill C-19, 
the Canada Labour Code part I amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues have pointed out to the House some of the concerns 
we have as a party about the direction in which the bill is 
going.  I echo those concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot understand how a government with clear conscience could 
take away individual rights as guaranteed under the charter.  We 
have heard from my hon. colleague from West Vancouver—Sunshine 
Coast his concern about the sharing of names, addresses and phone 
numbers without the permission of individuals.  I do not know if 
people can understand and appreciate how serious a violation that 
is of the Privacy Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have had many conversations with the privacy commissioner on 
how difficult it is to protect the rights of individuals.  When 
we see a government deliberately bringing in legislation that 
challenges one of its laws, in this case the Privacy Act, we have 
to wonder in what direction it is going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians should have the opportunity to understand that the 
government is washing over issues.  It is changing the name of 
the Canada Labour Relations Board.  It is becoming the Canada 
Industrial Relations Board.  It is changing the term of the chair 
and the vice-chairs from 10 years to 5 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen what happens when the government appoints people to 
such positions for one year or ten years and then tries to remove 
them because they are not doing the job properly or they are not 
being accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This board will not be accountable to anybody.  Somebody will be 
replacing Ted Weatherill.  I do not know whether members have 
already forgotten about this individual who thought absolutely 
nothing of spending $700 for a dinner for two in Paris.  That is 
the kind of judgment that will be leading this board. I 
understand he will be replaced by somebody who is more frugal, 
who understands that it is not his money but the taxpayer's 
money.  Hopefully he will show greater leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a government appoints six permanent members and as many 
part time members as cabinet feels is necessary, it frightens me 
and it frightens Canadians.  We have seen organizations like the 
parole board and the refugee review board that have expanded on 
patronage appointments.  These boards are quasi-judicial and are 
not accountable to anybody.  We cannot remove the appointed 
people unless there is criminal activity or something as great as 
that.  They cannot be removed because they are incapable or 
incompetent to do the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is up to cabinet to determine how many of these people are 
necessary.  This removes from the House of Commons any ability to 
hold people on these boards accountable to Canadian taxpayers who 
are paying their salaries.  In many cases we are talking about 
substantial salaries.  We are not talking about a $7 per hour 
minimum wage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It concerns me how the government continues a practice I have 
seen over the last four or five years of removing responsibility 
from the elected body, the House of Commons, and placing it in 
the hands of the executive body of government.  By placing 
control and policy making in the executive branch of government, 
it is removing governance from the people of Canada. 
It is a very dangerous practice which the government continues to 
carry on.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canadians knew the degree to which this was occurring they 
would be very concerned to see that the governance of the country 
is being removed from elected individuals in the House of Commons 
who are accountable to the people, to a group of people who sit 
on the front bench and are not accountable to anybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is another concern I have with this legislation, along with 
many others we have seen passed by the Liberal government.  It 
goes in the wrong direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue that causes me great concern is that the Canada 
Industrial Relations Board can certify a union without the 
support of the majority of employees.  It flies in the face of 
democracy when a board, which is out of reach of anybody, can 
arbitrarily go into a business and declare there will be a union 
even though the majority of the employees do not want it.  That 
is arrogance at the very worst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think Canadians appreciate that direction from the 
government.  It is unconscionable to believe that the democratic 
principle of the majority of people making decisions that affect 
their livelihood is not being respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is throwing the weight of the executive branch 
over the elected branch, the elected House of Commons. The 
government is not respecting the privacy rights of every 
Canadian.  The government does not support the democratic 
principle of the majority making decisions.  What else will we 
see from the government?  Those are the basics of a democracy. 
The government does not show an appreciation for that.  Nor does 
it have any respect for that democratic process and principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we have in this piece of legislation?  We have a 
situation where an individual can belong to a company.  Maybe 30% 
of the employees decide they want to unionize for whatever 
reasons, perhaps because they have been pressured by individuals 
who know their addresses and phone numbers.  The next thing we 
find is that the company has closed and moved out of town like we 
saw in Montreal not long ago.  That takes jobs out of this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe I got the message wrong, but I thought the government was 
concerned about jobs for Canadians.  When a government starts 
bringing in legislation that drives the business community out of 
the country, the people who provide the jobs for young and old 
Canadians, what is the point? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government continually brings in legislation that forces 
the business community, either through legislative policies that 
interfere with the ability to operate a business in a profitable 
manner or through overtaxation, God knows how many business 
people such as the one I have spoken to over the years prior to 
the election, will actually leave Canada and go to the United 
States of America or even to South America. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is intent on creating jobs and creating an 
environment to encourage business, to encourage investment and to 
encourage the creation of jobs, it is certainly going in the 
wrong direction.  The government had better take another look at 
the legislation.  It had better make some amendments to it or 
maybe even scrap it.  I suggest it should do it tomorrow rather 
than leave it any longer.

count it a privilege every time I have the opportunity to speak 
in the House on behalf of the people of the constituency 
Kootenay—Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my constituency I have quite a mix of people in terms of who 
they work for and what their jobs are. 
I would dare guess that approximately 20% to 25% of my workforce 
works in a unionized workforce.  It is therefore important to put 
on record for them exactly how I see the bill and exactly how I 
see the impact there will be on workers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are companies and unions in my constituency.  Most 
important, there are the people who live and work in my 
constituency.  I am concerned primarily about the effect of this 
kind of legislation on the people in the unionized workforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is deep concern about the fact that clause 50 of Bill C-19 
allows the board to ignore the privacy interests of workers and 
to order an employer to disclose the names and addresses of 
“employees whose normal workplace is not on premises owned or 
controlled by the employer” if a trade union needs the 
information to solicit trade union membership.  The Canada 
Industrial Relations Board should not be allowed to do this. 
Clause 50 should be repealed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an issue in Canada of privacy of information.  It is not 
right that unions should be able to exercise their ability under 
clause 50 to access private mailing information of workers.  Why? 
Because we are not just talking about a union versus management 
situation.  We are really talking about, to a very great extent, 
a union versus union situation or a recertification process that 
might be undertaken.  The invasion of the privacy of the workers 
in my constituency is absolutely unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The board is prepared to rely on the inherently unreliable and 
undemocratic card based system, even though in union raid cases 
the board has said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Excellence has taught us in cases of union raids, a vote should 
be ordered so that the employees may choose freely, within the 
privacy of the polling booth, which union they wish to have as 
their representative. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That comes from a case between the Communication Workers of 
Canada and the Communications Union of Canada.  One would think 
that the board would realize a vote should be ordered in all 
cases and not just in the case of a fight between trade unions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statement of Professor Paul Weiler of Harvard University is 
compelling.  He states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A secret ballot vote has a symbolic value that a card check can 
never have.  It clears the air of any doubts about the union's 
majority and also confers a measure of legitimacy on the union's 
bargaining authority, especially among pockets of employees who 
were never contacted in the initial organizational drive. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A secret ballot, particularly in something as critical as whom 
the union will be representing or whether it should be certified 
or decertified, must be behind the curtain of a private ballot 
where each employee can make a choice without fear of coercion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not suggesting that there are any unions or union 
organizers in my constituency who would do that.  However we are 
talking about the entire country of Canada.  We are talking about 
a very large workforce.  Surely at some point there will be 
unfair, undue coercion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, we are in a democratic country where we can make 
choices about who will be elected to represent constituents in 
the chamber.  By the same token workers must have an uncoerced 
right to make the choice of who will represent them in the 
workplace or indeed if they are to be represented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Probably the most onerous part of the proposed legislation is 
that the Canada Industrial Relations Board will be able to 
override the vote should a vote take place.  I submit that 
neither the Canada Industrial Relations Board nor any other body 
should have the capacity to rationally discharge a task which 
involves nothing more than wild speculation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This section of legislation is targeted against employers who 
may become involved in an unfair labour practice. Again, nobody 
is without fault. Knives have a tendency to cut going in both 
directions. If some union organizers can get off base, surely 
from time to time some employers can get off base. But what is 
the remedy proposed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The remedy proposed is that the board would override the 
democratically expressed will of the workers. For example, the 
dangers associated with this type of law were demonstrated when 
the Ontario Labour Relations Board, ignoring the will of the 
workers, certified the United Steelworkers of America as 
bargaining agents for workers in a Wal-Mart of Canada store in 
Windsor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House should know that the workers voted 151 to 43 against 
union representation. The Ontario Labour Relations Board, having 
determined to its satisfaction that there had been unfair labour 
practices, then simply overrode the will of the workers. This 
kind of law is very dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the time I have had the privilege of being the Member of 
Parliament for Kootenay—Columbia, I have received many excellent 
representations from employers, from employees, from unions and 
from their workers. I have one such representation in my hand 
from some of the workers who are working with the Brotherhood of 
Locomotive Engineers. In the last labour dispute that was settled 
by back to work legislation, they have pointed out in a fair 
amount of detail exactly where they ended up getting the short 
end of the stick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, they have made the point that during the 
course of a year the locomotive engineers will actually be 
negative $8,700 of income as a result of that settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this kind of representation from them, particularly when 
I receive it from individual members, very seriously. I recognize 
that in the back to work legislation that was cobbled together at 
the last minute by the Liberals there were areas that gave 
disadvantages to the workers in my constituency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is simply proposing that rather than going into 
the band-aid approach and once again lurching forward to a point 
where there will be work stoppages, and unfortunately there will 
be work stoppages on the railway, with grain handling and other 
areas that are actually under the jurisdiction of this federal 
legislation, we recognize there will be work stoppages and we are 
saying that this legislation is grossly inadequate, does not 
answer the question and comes up with the problems that I have 
already detailed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports the concept of final offer selection 
arbitration. This is a preferred method of binding arbitration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In taking a look at this proposal, it brings a new fresh 
approach to this very contentious problem. It puts the workers 
and the companies on an even plane but, most important, it deals 
with the issue of the tremendous national negative economic 
impact should a work stoppage occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I implore the government to set aside Bill C-19 at this point or 
at least if it gets through the House and gets into the committee 
to seriously take a look at Reform's idea of final offer 
selection arbitration.  It would be good for the workers. It 
would be good for the companies. The most important thing is it 
would be good for Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I often think the role of government should be to reduce 
coercion.  If we are a free democratic society that believes in 
the freedom of individuals, then the government should have a 
role to reduce the lack of freedom certain individuals have in 
the workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had a varied work experience in my short lifetime. Having 
worked in locations with and without union agreements, it is not 
at all clear to me that the best place to work is where there is 
a union shop.  There are pluses on both sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember fondly decades ago being a student and working as a 
truck driver.  Members can see I picked up some of the truck 
driver characteristics and never lost them.  I had a wonderful 
experience working for a Saskatchewan firm.  I was able to earn 
$1 an hour and I made more money than I knew how to use. 
Educational expenses were reasonable in those days and I went 
year to year with a balanced budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I came out at the end without a debt.  I had only my taxes to 
pay when I got my first job.  That was my way of repaying the 
student loan which I did not have but which I am paying to this 
day, gladly so because my education provided me with a greater 
income and has provided me with the ability to pay higher taxes. 
I gladly pay them, to a limit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I worked in a non-union shop.  We were paid by the hour at the 
going rate.  I was paid less than most of the people I worked 
with because I was part time student help.  Some of the others in 
our shop were paid more.  I benefited greatly from the fact this 
was not a union shop.  I tried very hard.  Since I came from a 
farm in Saskatchewan I learned to work hard and never to complain 
about long hours.  As a result I ingratiated myself to the boss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since he had the flexibility not to give all the trips to the 
guys with the seniority, he gave me some of those long trips. He 
knew I could be counted on since I was one of those strange 
people who did not drink.  He knew that if I went on a trip I 
would find my way home again.  As a result I got priority over 
some of the others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that were a union shop there would have been trouble.  The 
union would have said that another individual had seniority and 
should be able to get the job.  Our business did well.  I say our 
business because I felt a part of it.  I was a good contributing 
member of the business. I did my best and we had a good 
relationship, a win-win relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I contrast that with other situations in which I have worked 
where the union was involved and where I got the short shrift as 
part time help.  The union was not there to help me at all.  The 
union was there simply to enforce a pecking order which had been 
established over time and gave no one the chance to move up in 
the ranks unless somebody older and more experienced died or left 
the business.  That does not provide for high motivation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not anti-union.  An examination of my work history will 
reveal that I have been a union steward, I was the president of a 
local in a place I worked.  We were forced members of the union. 
I remember being greatly offended by the fact that the union to 
which we were forced to belong actually used a portion of our 
union dues for political party contributions.  I will not mention 
which political party it was but members can probably figure it 
out. Unions have a symbiotic relationship with at least one of 
the parties in this country, a relationship I do not particularly 
agree with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The union was able to have a rule that the place where I worked 
required that I belong to the union, it required that I give it 
money and it required that I support a political party which is 
180° out of sync with my true beliefs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think other people would feel just as bad.  I sincerely hope 
those union members who are strong supporters, for example of the 
NDP, would be very offended if that union decided to give a 
strong political donation to the Reform Party.  I hope they would 
be offended and would say “you cannot do that, that is my 
money”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I am making is that we need to have more individual 
freedom.  I think that when the marketplace prevails we will find 
that a very good economic balance is reached between employers 
and employees 99.9% of the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember, again looking back before we were forced members of 
the union at the place where I worked, I was an instructor at a 
technical institute.  It was run by the Government of Alberta. It 
was before the union there was a forced issue.  We did not have a 
union when I first started there.  One year the institute had 
trouble getting instructors.  The economy was booming and the 
Northern Alberta Institute of Technology had the policy of trying 
to get the best.  That is I suppose how I got there. I was just 
wondering whether anyone was listening. It had trouble getting 
qualified instructors.  In the middle of the year without any 
negotiations suddenly there was an announcement of a pay 
increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later on we had a union.  The same issue came up.  The employer 
said they wanted to open the contract so they could increase the 
salary schedule.  The union said they could not do it because 
there was a union contract which goes for two years and it could 
not be opened unless they opened the whole thing.  It would not 
just open the money clauses. To me that is so totally absurd.  It 
is a total infringement of individual freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just given a couple of examples of when one is forced 
into a union where one loses one's freedom, loses bargaining 
position and to a certain degree loses benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to give the other side as well.  I have also seen 
situations where individuals have not been fairly treated. The 
contract has not been fairly applied to them for one reason or 
another or they have been mistreated by supervisors.  I was 
involved as the president of the local branch of the union. I 
went to bat. I think even if a person is innocent he deserves the 
right to a fair and prompt hearing, trial or whatever we want to 
call it. So we supported each other that way.  There is some 
merit in that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not read into it that I am anti-union.  What I want to do is 
make unions more democratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this bill we have before us today unions are strengthened. 
To me that is upsetting a balance.  It is an intrusion of an 
unnatural force in the relationship between employers and 
employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been involved in a number of cases where we have had 
contract disputes.  After we were forced members of the union for 
a number of years it was decided that our institute, the Northern 
Alberta Institute of Technology, would go to a board of 
governors.  I was honoured by my fellow staff members, 750 of 
them, to be selected as the founding president of the academic 
staff association at NAIT.  One of the first things we did was 
bargained away our right to strike because we found that nobody 
wants the right to strike.  If the right questions are asked they 
will say emphatically “I do not want the right to strike.  I do 
not want the right to be without a job and without an income. 
What I want is a fair income.  What I want is to be treated 
fairly”.  That is what they really want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the means to the end, the strike process has sort 
of juxtaposed itself into it and now there are members of the 
union and the NDP who claim that it is an indistinguishable right 
to belong to a union and to strike when that is not their primary 
purpose.  Their primary purpose is to achieve their monetary and 
job security goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I found that in my work as academic president when we made 
arrangements to have a dispute resolution mechanism, with time 
lines and arbitration, everything worked out a lot better.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will start off by recognizing the member for Wetaskiwin who 
worked so hard for our party on this bill and helped us prepare 
for today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-19 has been a topic of discussion certainly in my 
constituency.  I come from a constituency that is farming 
intensive, livestock, grain farms, dry land irrigations, 
especially crops.  It has a city with manufacturing and service 
industries. There is some concern with this bill and some of its 
the flaws.  The unfair balance of it has been pointed out to me 
by constituents and others.  I will address my comments to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Elk Island when he spoke of working for a dollar 
reminded me of the gentleman who was looking for a job and the 
boss told him he would pay him for what he was worth.  He 
immediately turned and left.  When the boss asked him where he 
was going, he said “I cannot live on that”.  But I am sure that 
was not my friend from Elk Island. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are trying to build up Canada and to get into more and more 
trade with the world.  Across the prairies we are looking at 
secondary processing of a lot of products.  We have to get those 
products to market, via the railways, trucking or whatever it 
takes to do that.  In order for us to become a reliable source of 
many of these products, we have to gain a reputation of being 
able to meet our commitments.  In order to meet our commitments 
we have to deliver in a timely fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a year ago this winter when we saw the grain not being 
able to get market, the problems that created and the cost that 
was incurred by farmers across the prairies and in my 
constituency.  It is important that we have a method in place to 
make sure that what is produced, what is manufactured can get to 
the markets.  We not only have to address the west coast ports, 
but a lot of things can happen to a product from the time it 
leaves the plant or the farm gate until it gets to that point. 
Some of those aspects are missing in this bill.  The government 
should have another look at that and address some of those 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the definition of grain, I had a letter from an organization 
in the west that deals with dehydrated alfalfa.  They pointed out 
to me that in this bill the grain is the product, and I will read 
it “the services they normally provide to ensure the tie-up, 
let-go and loading of grain vessels at licensed terminal and 
transfer elevators and the movement of the grain vessels in and 
out of a port”.  They are concerned with what that means.  Does 
it mean grain or does it mean other products?  They are really 
concerned that their dehydrated alfalfa products are not 
included. They would like to see that done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole idea that the government has control over grain was 
debated last week during the debate on Bill C-4.  In that 
legislation the government markets the farmers' grain for them 
and not necessarily for the best prices.  That was a concern and 
it continues today with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The record of tie-ups that have happened in the shipping 
industry goes on and on.  In February 1994 there was a tie-up for 
two weeks.  A year later Parliament had to bring an end to 
another dispute.  Two weeks after that, Parliament passed another 
bill to end another dispute.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is proposing final offer selection arbitration 
as a method to keep everybody working, to do the same thing that 
these work disruptions have done but to do it in a way in that 
everybody can benefit.  If we are truly to become a mover and 
supplier to the world of products that are produced right across 
Canada, we are going to have to do this. We cannot have these 
disruptions and our customers finding out that we have the 
product but we cannot deliver it to them.  That just will not 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see trade missions going all over the world.  The chamber of 
commerce from the city of Lethbridge was in Chile and elsewhere 
promoting products.  If we are going to have these people show 
initiative and entrepreneurship to move forward in this world, we 
have to enable them to get their product delivered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, we are not only talking about grain 
here.  We are talking about all products.  I hope the government 
will take this to heart and will have another look to realize 
that some of these things are missing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of disruptions in shipments has been tried to be 
quantified many times. We are looking at indirect costs of up to 
$500 million in grain sales alone in 1994.  It is wrong to take 
$500 million out of the economy of this country.  We are not 
convinced that this bill will address all of those problems and 
we hope the government will take another look at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect of the bill that has brought a lot of attention 
today is the access to off site workers' records.  We all have a 
strong opinion that what is ours is ours and nobody should have 
the right to access information about us unless we allow it. To 
have this in part of the bill goes against everything Canadians 
believe in.  One has the right to keep one's information to 
oneself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all of these things said and the fact that certification 
can take place without a majority is undemocratic.  There are a 
lot of things that need to be done.  The government has fallen 
quite short in providing us with a piece of legislation that will 
work for us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope that the government will take this bill back, have 
another look at it and bring it back in a better fashion.

have been waiting with bated breath to hear my comments about 
C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In looking at the problems of this House, members know exactly 
the one I am going to zero in on.  It is is going to be the top 
down nature, the way this place works, the way political parties 
work quite often, the way business quite often works and of 
course, the way unions quite often work.  It is my hope to 
emphasize in the House that the public are sick and tired of the 
top down administration they get in all parts of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public is asking for accountability.  They are asking for 
transparency. They are asking for grassroots input into what is 
happening that affects their lives. Certainly when it comes to 
labour legislation, an area that affects many people across this 
whole country, they feel they do not have that input.  A bill 
like this does nothing to reassure them that they can have their 
say about this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has a particularly bad record for listening to 
the people.  This weekend the Alberta winter games were in my 
constituency.  Thousands of people from all over Alberta were in 
our riding.  It went extremely well.  The only problem I guess 
was the plus-10 degrees and we had to haul snow in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the people said as I circulated around talking to them was 
first, to do something about that other place.  Everybody is 
upset about what happens in the Senate. 
Second, they talked about the debt, about that noose around their 
necks and the necks of their kids and their grandchildren. 
Everybody talked about that. Third, they talked about taxes. What

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point 
of order.  I am just wondering what this has to do with Bill 
C-19.  The member is launching into a speech about the debt and 
about the Senate. I am here to listen to debate about Bill C-19 
and members' concerns.  I think it is really, really important 
that we do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Certainly the parliamentary secretary 
is correct.  I know the hon. member for Red Deer is an 
experienced member and will make his remarks relevant to Bill 
C-19. I am sure he was about to get to the point of the bill.  I 
am looking forward to hearing his remarks.  After all, that is 
what he said he would speak about.  We look forward to what he 
says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, certainly I am getting to 
Bill C-19.  One has to set the stage for the major points one 
wants to make in an issue like this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about listening to the people.  When it comes to 
labour legislation, obviously the government should be listening 
to the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does Bill C-19 do?  Bill C-19 is an example again of that 
top down, more government, more bureaucracy, more of the same 
that people are sick and tired of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was just trying to point out to the hon. member how many 
people have talked about so many issues which the government just 
will not listen to. In half an hour we will probably have another 
example of where the government did not listen regarding the debt 
and regarding taxes.  That is what people are talking about. They 
are not talking about more spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member made me deviate and I got off on this other tangent, 
but I will now get back to what I was trying to talk about which 
is Bill C-19. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about democracy?  This legislation allows the CIRB to 
certify a union without support from the majority.  What kind of 
democracy is that where a government agency can certify a union 
even though the majority do not agree with it?  That is not 
democratic.  We have examples now of where the government will do 
this sort of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, this legislation orders employers to release to the 
union names of reps who are working off site.  Again they do not 
have to ask the employees about that.  They do not have to get 
permission. This is an intrusion on a person's rights as a 
citizen of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation does nothing to stop strikes.  It does nothing 
to help the workers who are simply trying to improve their lot in 
life. This again will be more of the same.  There is nothing here 
that will do anything to stop what both union members and 
citizens at large are opposed to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have an example in my riding. I have been asked to speak to 
union members.  They have invited me but they got a decree from 
head office that they could not invite me.  They were shocked by 
this.  “What do you mean we cannot invite this person?  We can 
invite anybody we want”.  “No you cannot”.  They cannot invite 
their member of Parliament to address them on the issues that 
interest them. That comes from the union, from the top down.  The 
union members are pretty upset about that and I do not blame 
them.  That is a lack of democracy.  That is the top down stuff I 
was trying to talk about, trying to make a point of for the hon. 
member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the world?  Where are we at in terms of the world? 
Obviously in the world, we are in competition.  The world has 
globalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been fortunate for 35 years to travel the world. I have 
been to almost every country. 
Most everywhere I have been they say “Canada has a labour 
problem, doesn't it?”

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most recently in Japan, China and Argentina I heard “Is Canada 
still producing grain?  Is it still in the marketplace?”  That 
is a pretty terrible question to be asked if you are a farmer in 
western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unreliability of our transportation system, of our 
distribution system and of our sales system is putting us behind 
our competitors.  Bill C-19 does nothing to help provide a fix 
for that problem.  That is what the farmers are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does not address the area of investment.  When 
investors are looking at Canada to invest money, to open 
businesses or to develop joint ventures which are so common in 
today's society they see antiquated, ambiguous labour laws.  They 
will point out the ambiguities and tell us they do not feel 
secure investing or dealing in Canada or with Canadians on joint 
ventures.  They do not know for sure how stable our labour force 
will be.  They have real problems with that.  It hurts us.  It 
hurts job creation and the whole investment area which is so 
important to us as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the solution?  It seems to me that the solution is to 
get back to the grassroots.  We must listen to the employees. 
There is no point in going after unions, saying they are good or 
bad.  Most of the membership are a very positive part of our 
communities.  The problem is the top down nature of labour 
legislation, the lack of working together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need government, business, experts and labour to work 
together for the good of Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo—Alberni, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
to begin with I would like to describe my riding because it is 
important to this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nanaimo—Alberni stretches right across the centre of Vancouver 
Island.  We have fisheries, we have forestry and we have 
retirement.  In the centre, Port Alberni, which is largely 
forestry oriented, a strong labour town.  It is a town with 
heart.  It is a town which has grown through the labour movement. 
It used to be a strong NDP community.  Now it is a strong Reform 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My background is that of a professional forester.  I worked in 
the forest industry for 25 years.  Yes, I was on the management 
side but labour and management together built a good union and a 
good foundation for that town. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this legislation a union could be certified with less than 
50% of the employees being in favour of it.  Frankly, it is nuts. 
I can see that members opposite are agreeing with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to fit into the Liberal idea of what democracy is.  If 
we can get about a third of the people, that is democracy and we 
will go with it.  Unfortunately that does not work in the rest of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quite amazed at this government.  Where are the Ontario 
Liberals?  There are strong unions within Ontario.  The auto 
workers come to mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am amazed that this legislation has been allowed to get this 
far without Ontario labour unions being up in arms. 
They should be solidly against this legislation, and I am sure 
they are.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members opposite are sitting there trying to decide why the 
labour unions are in favour of it when they are not. They are 
clearly in a dilemma. It is most interesting, in 25 minutes we 
are going to have a budget debate. I point out that labour unions 
are well paid people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the taxpaying public. You should hear them muttering over 
there, Mr. Speaker. It is very difficult for most Canadians to 
hear because they sound like hens in the hen house busy cackling 
away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is about investment. Investment in B.C. requires a solid 
base. There cannot be a government that ignores unions, that 
ignores the investment potential of any province, be it Ontario, 
B.C. or Alberta, because it will be at its peril. In fact, in my 
home province of B.C. we are in difficulty because the NDP 
provincial government has tried that. It is now having great 
difficulty getting foreign investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill died in the Senate, which I am sure most Canadians 
will understand.  However, the Senate does have its purpose. It 
killed this bill. It killed it for a reason. The reason was it 
did not work. So the new bill came in, and what have we got? Very 
much of the same type of legislation. It is a gloss over of the 
old type of legislation. I suspect that if this goes to the 
Senate it is not going to go anywhere either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has to realize that it has to listen up. Even 
the Senate cannot take this type of legislation. But it is going 
to try it again, to keep pushing. Maybe if it pushes it harder it 
will go through again. It is not going to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has tried it on a number of types of 
legislation. Look at endangered species last time in the last 
Parliament. It did not go through. Why?  Members on the 
government side could not vote for it. Look at the conference on 
global warming in Kyoto. Talk about a fiasco because this 
government did not have its groundwork in order. This is typical 
of this bill. Government has not done its homework. When other 
countries get together, where is Canada? We do not have our act 
together. We have not done our homework, very similar to this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest this bill needs major refurbishment and hopefully this 
government will listen up and do it before it introduces it 
again. 
<P><A NAME="LINK201"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-19 today, an act to amend the 
Canadian Labour Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, it is interesting, this being the only party speaking 
to this bill, how so many of us have— 
<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South—Weston, Ind.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, on a point of order, the hon. member wants to be 
accurate and he just made a statement that is simply not 
accurate. He said that the Reform Party was the only party 
speaking to the bill— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sorry, it does not sound like a 
point of order to me, it sounds like a point of debate. I think 
the hon. member for York South—Weston knows that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for York 
South—Weston does make a good point. In the last little while 
the speakers have all been from the Reform Party. Certainly the 
member for York South—Weston has spoken to this bill and my 
credit to him for that. I am sorry for making that impression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting how many members from this side have chosen to 
speak to this important labour bill, the biggest changes to the 
labour code we are likely to see in this Parliament, and how so 
many people have talked about the need for balance in labour 
legislation. I will add my name to the list with my little story. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1610"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT74"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT74"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1610

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a member of the IWA labour union for some 10 years.  I 
also spent an equivalent amount of time in management with the 
same union.  In the course of that 20 year experience working in 
the logging industry, much of it in a unionized setting, at the 
end of my career when I started on this career, if we can call it 
that, we never in the company's history had a case of a grievance 
going to arbitration in all those years of work. I know what it 
is like to work with a unionized crew. All my crews were 
unionized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The word balance is important. I sometimes wonder when 
legislation comes before the House of Commons if there would be a 
preamble to it that would describe for us what caused this 
legislation to be brought forward.  In other words, what was 
behind this bill, who was behind it.  What presentations were 
made to ministers or which pressure groups, which groups of 
people were behind this bill, were in favour of this bill and 
pushed this bill forward, these amendments, and where did the 
bill come from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I go through this bill and the summary of it to see what it 
is trying to accomplish and what the government says it is trying 
to accomplish, I do not see a balance as I had hoped to see in 
labour code changes in this country.  I have seen too many 
headlines from newspapers talking about Liberal labour code 
betrayal, last call to stand against the labour code, new labour 
code rules benefit unions, and on and on.  There has been a whole 
series of stories in the press and from people concerned 
basically with the balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak a bit about the need for that balance and 
why I do not think this bill contains it.  First, one of the 
sacred parts of the union movement is an ability to organize.  It 
is an ability that the Reform Party has as one of its basic 
platform principles.  It is the right for unions to organize, to 
strike peacefully, to go about their business of representing 
workers if those workers so ask them to.  It is the basic policy 
of this party and I think of every party in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this labour code amendment changes the balance from a secret 
ballot registration on who would represent a person at the 
bargaining table to if a person even signs a card that they are 
interested in it, it is taken as a fait accompli. Worst yet, when 
a certification vote is taking place those names are circulated 
without the permission of the employees to whomever would like to 
organize a union or a shop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, if you sign your name to it or if you vote in an 
honest election, that is fair game.  But when your name is given 
out without your permission to other people to use, for mail 
outs, for telephone calls, for what could even amount to 
harassment at times, that is not right.  I cannot support that 
portion of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the huge issue of what we call remedial 
certification.  In other words, if some employer breaks some 
technical portion of the certification process, in other words 
they put up a poster on the bulletin board and they should not 
have done it or they said something wrong in their company 
newsletter and somebody feels that it is causing an affront to 
the union organization movement, if this board decides that has 
happened, it is a done deal.  They are unionized whether 10% 
wanted it or 15% or 39% or 49%.  It is a done deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is unfortunate, given that most workers would rather have 
an honest vote in an honest situation where they can bring 
forward their complaints and also bring forward their union 
certification process without fear of intimidation or harassment 
on either side.  This tips it in my opinion to the wrong side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole issue of how we settle strikes in an industry that has 
a monopoly is not addressed properly in this bill.  There are 
some improvements from times past. For example, if a train load 
of grain is on its way to Vancouver, to my neck of the woods, 
this legislation gives a period that allows that grain to work 
through the system and get dumped in the terminal and shipped 
off. 
The trouble is that the following strike could go on 
indefinitely, holding grain producers and the country hostage 
while we wait for something to solve it. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1615"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether it is a postal strike, a grain handler strike or 
whatever it might be, we have seen too often when a monopoly is 
involved that we have needed an alternative way of settling those 
disputes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The dispute settling mechanism we have put forward is a form of 
final offer binding arbitration that is fair to the producers, 
the workers, the Canadian economy and Canadians affected by 
whether or not they are in the industry.  The legislation does 
not give us the option other than to come back here and go to 
legislation again as we did in the case of the recent postal 
strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be far better to have a permanent dispute settlement 
mechanism in place where there is a monopoly to protect all 
segments of society: workers, producers, consumers and the 
Canadian economy as a whole.  It would be far better to do it 
that way rather than to do it piecemeal every time there is a 
significant strike or problem in any industry like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill eliminates the need for unions to report on their 
financial status in a meaningful way.  It removes an important 
protection for workers who want to know where their dues are 
being spent.  They send a significant amount of money to unions. 
Unions use that money in the ways they see fit to promote their 
union organizations.  The real problem comes when there is no 
financial accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was the money spent to promote another union?  Maybe that would 
be something they would approve of.  Was it spent to support a 
political party?  Who knows?  We have seen ongoing court cases in 
the land of people who sent in their union dues only to find they 
were siphoned off and sent to a political party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That money may not have been used to elect you, Mr. Speaker.  It 
may not have been used to elect me.  However it has been used to 
try to defeat certain candidates and to elect others.  I grant 
they were largely unsuccessful but it is an affront to someone 
who is sending $30 or $40 a month to a union headquarters, 
assuming that it will be spent for proper purposes, only to find 
out it has been used in many ways to vote against the very things 
that might be promoted in the union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general there is a need for balance in the legislation.  The 
balance between union rights is very important.  As I mentioned 
the blue book refers to the principle of union rights to 
organize, to strike peacefully, to look after its members, as 
well as the rights of the Canadian economy, the right to secrecy 
and the right to protection of workers who do not want their 
funds misused. That kind of balance is not in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is too bad that privacy rights are not being looked after. It 
is too bad that final offer binding arbitration is not offered as 
an alternative in this package.  While there are some 
improvements, they are not enough to garner the support of the 
Reform Party and certainly not enough to garner my vote when the 
bill comes up for vote. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am happy to speak to Bill C-19 concerning amendments 
to the Canada Labour Code, specifically grain loading at ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my previous life I worked in a union environment in British 
Columbia, the most unionized jurisdiction in Canada.  I spent 20 
years on the coast of British Columbia working in logging 
operations.  In the area I represent of Vancouver Island North 
union workers are the backbone of the communities in my riding. I 
very much appreciate the balance in the workplace between 
management and union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I worked in logging.  Safety is a major concern in that 
industry.  It is one of the most dangerous occupations one would 
ever want to encounter. 
There are some specific jobs that are very demanding and 
hazardous.  The union certainly has a very large role to play in 
terms of safety.  Nothing brings us closer together than a 
serious accident and nothing can lead more to finger pointing 
afterward if there is not a strong balance—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I am sorry to say that 
there is a general din in the House and I am having difficulty 
hearing the debate at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  It is very difficult 
for members of the House to hear the debate that is proceeding on 
the floor of the House at the moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would particularly ask that hon. members and members of the 
public who are present to tone down the volume of noise so that 
members can hear the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a debate under way here and hon. members would like to 
hear it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan:</B>  Mr. Speaker, usually we can blame our 
colleagues, but I think in this instance the gallery is filling 
with people in expectation of the budget.  I appreciate the 
circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another very important aspect to what I did in the past 
in terms of the union environment I worked in.  We had sort of a 
forerunner exercise which dealt with the environment in 
environmental committees and joint union and management 
committees.  I became quite active in all of that because if 
everyone in the workplace is not on board we certainly cannot 
achieve or obtain the results we seek. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This became the basic building block in terms of bringing new 
practises into the forestry industry to introduce such things as 
proper treatments around stream sites, proper road construction, 
proper watershed management, and those kinds of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that there are very good workplaces and there are 
very bad workplaces.  I like to think I worked in some very good 
workplaces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to think about what the legislation is all about.  Whose 
interest is at stake here?  It is important to recognize that the 
public interest is at stake.  We do not want to replicate what we 
have had up until now in many jurisdictions in Canada where the 
labour environment has led us to strikes or lockouts and to very 
insoluble power gains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The community I live in is subject right now to a seven month 
strike or lockout, whatever we want to call it, at the Fletcher 
Challenge pulp mill.  It looks intractable.  It has a lot to do 
with the economics of business and some very important issues 
which divide union and management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has to be a better way.  Although I recognize the bill 
deals with a specific federal jurisdiction issue, and not an area 
of provincial jurisdiction, certainly is not a breath of fresh 
air in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the bill create harmonious relationships?  I do not believe 
there is anything in the new bill that will come anywhere near to 
accomplishing that objective.  Does it ensure against any 
stoppages en route to the port facilities?  No, it does not. 
There is nothing in the bill that deals with anything of the 
kind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have is one more vague and ambiguous labour law that 
will lead to further investor uncertainty, which we do not need, 
and does nothing to create a harmonious relationship. 
I find this to be very contradictory or very ironic, given that 
we were in the House yesterday speaking about the multilateral 
agreement on investment which, if we listen to the members on the 
government side of the House, is intended to lead to investor 
confidence.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot have contradictory philosophical underpinnings, but 
time after time we are seeing no philosophical or principled 
underpinning to any of the government actions.  Whether it is a 
multilateral agreement on investment, labour legislation, 
fisheries legislation or aboriginal affairs, it is always the 
same thing.  It is the Liberal fudge.  That is what we are 
seeing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the Canada Labour Relations Board that is 
revamped and renamed under the bill, I hoped we would have seen 
something invigorating, something refreshing, something in tune 
with the times, something accountable, maybe even something 
elected or democratically arrived at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we have here?  We have one significant change.  We agree 
that a 10 year appointment is too long.  An appointment is 
probably inappropriate but the timeframe was certainly wrong. Ten 
years have been brought down to five.  We certainly concur with 
that part of the legislation, but it is not going very far when 
we look at the length and breadth of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The labour relations board will have some basic powers.  It is a 
quasi-judicial board.  It is a board with a lot of power.  The 
flexibility is so great that it leads to uncertainty about what 
it might or might not do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that board members are appointed by cabinet tells me 
that it can be skewed in any philosophical direction the cabinet 
wishes.  There will be three members from management and three 
members from union.  That is not much of a guideline when we 
think about how government can fulfil its agenda simply through 
the appointment process.  We have seen it before and we know we 
will see it again from this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know who appoints them.  Do we know how much power they have? 
Yes, we do.  The board can actually order an employer to release 
to a union representative a list of the names and addresses of 
employees who work off site.  I like to think that my privacy and 
the privacy of Canadians is more valuable than to allow this 
non-accountable appointed board to overrule my privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point concerns me.  It has to do with the interpretation 
of representation.  We know that is also left to labour.

<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK208">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House approve in general the budgetary policy 
of the government. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Mr. Speaker,  I am tabling the budget documents, 
including notices of ways and means motions. The details of the 
measures are contained in the documents.  I am asking that an order 
of the day be designated for consideration of these motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also announcing that the government will, at the first 
opportunity, table bills to implement the other measures announced 
in this budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset, let me express, on behalf of the Prime Minister 
and Cabinet, our gratitude to the Standing Committee on Finance and 
the various committees of caucus.  Their hard work has been 
invaluable. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just say that this budget is in many ways the product of 
this caucus. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also thank the many who have taken the time from their 
day to day obligations to come forward and present their proposals 
on the shape this budget should take.  Yet again, they have proven 
the benefits brought to budget making by simply listening to the 
common sense of Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the first budget of a new mandate.  But if the mandate 
is new, our mission is not.  Our goals today remain what they 
were when Canadians placed their trust in us in 1993:  first to 
build a country of opportunity, of jobs and growth, one where 
every Canadian has equal access to the avenues of success; and 
second to safeguard and strengthen a caring and compassionate 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have always known that securing these goals would not 
be easy.  Canadians understood that fundamental problems require 
fundamental change.  They wanted clear priorities established and 
they wanted a long term plan to achieve them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 that plan was put in place.  We have pursued it for more 
than four years and it is paying off today. This budget marks a 
further stage in that plan.  It makes it very clear that our 
resolve will not weaken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget will demonstrate that we have left the era of 
chronic deficits behind and that we are now on an irrevocable 
course to reduce the debt.  It is a budget that will expand 
opportunity for all Canadians by making access to knowledge and 
skills more affordable.  It is a budget that begins to reduce 
taxes, starting with those who need it most, middle and low 
income Canadians.

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a budget that ensures that the balance of actions we take 
reflects the balance of priorities that Canadians share and that 
the values we heed are the values Canadians hold.  That is our 
commitment. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we came into office, the country's economy was in 
disarray. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The turnaround today is very evident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Job creation is accelerating.  Over the last four years, the 
number of jobs has grown by over one million.  In 1997 alone, 
372,000 new jobs, all full time and in the private sector, were 
created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, the unemployment rate stood at 11.2 per cent.  It has 
fallen since then and is now below 9 per cent.  While not 
satisfactory, the trend is clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consumer confidence has rebounded.  The economic recovery is 
now supported by strong domestic demand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Business confidence is at record levels. 
Investment is surging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stimulated by lower interest rates and renewed confidence, 
economic growth reached a level in excess of 3.5 per cent in 1997 
and, this year, continued strength is projected.  This would mean 
the best back-to-back performance for Canada in over ten years, the 
strongest performance of any G-7 nation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a volatile world.  Clearly the events in Asia will 
have an impact.  Nonetheless, let me simply say to Canadian 
business, consumers, employers and workers that there has not 
been a time in the past 25 years when our prospects have been 
better.  Furthermore, economic growth is helping to push the 
deficit down dramatically. What I am about to say is something 
that no Canadian government has been able to say in almost 50 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will balance the budget next year.  We will balance the 
budget the year after that.  We will balance the budget this 
fiscal year. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time in 50 years, we will have three consecutive 
zero deficits: a zero deficit this year, 1997-98; a zero deficit 
next year and a zero deficit in the year 2000.  We are at a turning 
point in our history. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This achievement is the accomplishment of Canadians, not of 
government. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT80"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT80"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1640
<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the outset it was Canadians who knew the dangers posed by 
financial mismanagement.  It was Canadians who called for firm 
action.  It was Canadians who united in a strong consensus that 
government simply had to get on with the job.  And it was 
Canadians who have shown great forbearance in shouldering the 
consequences of actions that have been very difficult.  Canadians 
can be very proud today.  This is their victory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that a new era lies ahead.  And because of that, we 
owe it to Canadians to repeat now what our principles will be as 
we go forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we will stay the course that brought us here. We will be 
frugal.  The battle to root out waste and inefficiency can never 
end.  Never again will we allow the spectre of overspending to 
haunt this land.  Never again will we let old habits return 
defining bigger government as better government, of believing 
that every problem requires another program.  Never again will we 
see Canadians undergo round after round of painful cuts in order 
to dig us out of yet another hole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have paid to see the movie “The Deficit”.  They do 
not want to pay again to see the sequel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we will be focused in everything we do.  The core 
priority of government must be to set the national agenda.  It 
can never again fall into the old trap of trying to be all things 
to all people, of having so many priorities that in fact it has 
none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we will be steadfast.  The challenges facing the country 
are deeply rooted.  They are not the stuff of quick fixes.  That 
is why as before, each budget will build on steps taken 
previously so that what may seem like small steps at the time 
will in the end become much larger steps, for we must look to the 
longer term needs of the nation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, we must work in partnership.  Acting alone, in 
isolation, is no longer on.  Working together respects the reality 
that we each have a role to play—whether as governments, 
business, labour or the voluntary sector. But we must work 
together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, we must be balanced and we must be fair.  Canadians 
know that there is more to taking care of the nation than simply 
taking care of the books.  Canada is not just a marketplace.  It is 
a community.  Our country is anchored in shared risk and shared 
benefits, 
in lending a hand knowing that, some day, we too may be in need. 
That is the spirit that built this land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was that spirit we saw when the country came together to 
help those devastated by the Saguenay flood.  It was there again 
when the Red River struck.  And it was there as hands reached out 
from across Canada to offer assistance in the aftermath of the ice 
storm last month. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian spirit of coming together is not something that 
only appears now and then in response to great natural disasters 
or disruptions.  It abides.  It is there in every community.  It 
is there in every corner of the country.  It is there every day. 
And it is there in the great national programs that have come to 
define who we are and who we want to become. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why this budget provides resources for the national AIDS 
strategy.  That is why we established a healing fund to address 
the terrible legacy of abuse suffered by so many aboriginal young 
people in residential schools.  And that is why we are committed 
without reservation to sustaining and strengthening the Canadian 
system of health care.

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 when the country's fiscal back was to the wall we took 
some very difficult decisions and we recognize this.  That is why 
the very first action we took when our progress on the deficit 
became clear was to increase the floor under the cash transfers 
to the provinces in support of health and other programs from $11 
billion to $12.5 billion annually.  This is the single largest 
expenditure accounted for in this budget.  Indeed, going beyond 
today's projections between now and the year 2002, the provinces 
will receive an additional $7 billion in transfer payments from 
the federal government for health and other programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frugality, focus, steadfastness, looking to the long term, 
partnership, fairness, these are the principles that underlie our 
plan.  What I would now like to do is to demonstrate how these 
principles will be applied to the sound economic management of 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we have said right from the beginning that one of the 
central economic priorities of government must be to ensure that 
monetary and fiscal policy work hand in hand so that they 
reinforce rather than run up against one another.  To that end, 
upon coming into office the government and the Bank of Canada 
agreed to hold inflation inside a range of 1% to 3% to the end of 
1998.  That policy has worked.  Inflation is under firm control 
and will remain so in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we are announcing today that we will extend the 
current agreement with the Bank of Canada for a further three 
years.  Canada has now established a reputation as a low 
inflation country.  It is a reputation and a reality we will 
protect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next, let me turn to the issue of the debt.  We have won a major 
battle.  We have not yet won the war.  More than 25 years of 
deficits have left us with a debt burden that is far too high. 
Every dollar that goes to service the debt is a dollar that 
cannot go to health care or tax relief.  Quite simply, the debt 
burden must be brought down and in fact that has already begun to 
occur. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best measure of the debt burden is to consider the size of 
the debt in relation to the size of the economy that supports it. 
This measure is called the debt-to-GDP ratio—what we owe in 
relation to what we produce.  The lower the ratio, the more 
manageable the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996-97, the debt-to-GDP ratio fell meaningfully for the 
first time in more than 20 years.  It will fall again this year 
even more and, over the next two years, the pace of improvement 
will continue. 
Our commitment is to keep the debt burden coming down steadily, 
permanently, irrevocably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be brought down through the implementation of a 
two-track strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we will continue to follow policies that will pay off 
in better economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we will bring down the absolute level of debt itself. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is our debt repayment plan.  First, we will continue as 
before to present two year fiscal plans based on prudent economic 
assumptions.  We will continue to be consistently more cautious 
than our private sector forecasters.  In the first two years of 
this plan as set out in this budget we are committed to back to 
back balanced budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we will continue to build into our financial plans a 
buffer, a $3 billion contingency reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, if as in each of the last three years the contingency 
reserve is not needed, it will go directly to paying down the 
debt. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT82"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT82"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1650

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how since coming into office we have brought the deficit 
down year after year after year, and this is how in the future we 
will bring the debt down year after year after year. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, that process is already under way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two principal ways to calculate the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first, the method we use in Canada, is considered to be one of 
the most rigorous in the world. It includes all the liabilities the 
government incurs over the course of a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second measure, used by other countries like the United States, 
the United Kingdom and Japan, includes only the borrowing that the 
government makes in financial markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to this measure, Canada recorded a financial surplus last 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And according to this international comparison, Canada is in the 
best fiscal health of the G-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of even greater significance, as shown in the monthly numbers being 
released today, is the fact that, so far this year, we have actually 
paid down debt previously borrowed in financial markets by almost $13 
billion. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ours is a country of great opportunity.  What we must do is 
strive to be a country of equal opportunity as well.  All 
Canadians do not begin life at the same starting line.  For some 
the race is virtually won before it is begun.  For many others it 
clearly is not.  Circumstance and privilege can create a playing 
field which is very uneven.  What we must understand is that when 
individual Canadians are deprived of the opportunity of reaching 
their full potential, then the country is deprived of the 
opportunity of reaching its full potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some seem to believe there is nothing government can do. Some 
seem to believe that we should just unleash the market, let loose 
the forces of change and abandon those whom opportunity has 
passed by.  That view is not ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A rising economic tide does not lift all boats.  There are many 
Canadians who for many reasons do not enjoy the opportunities 
that others do but who would grasp them immediately and lift 
themselves up if only given the chance.  That is why in this and 
previous budgets we have enhanced assistance to those with 
disabilities, Canadians who do not seek special rights but simply 
equal citizenship.  That is why we have increased support for 
charitable groups, given the enormous role played by the 
voluntary sector in helping Canadians and enriching our 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equal access to opportunity is a question of fairness, of 
fundamental social justice, but it is also about the fundamental 
economic challenge we face, the challenge of jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 200 years in Canada prosperity and knowledge have gone hand 
in hand.  However, let us understand the true nature of the 
dynamic that is at play.  As a society we are not educated 
because we are prosperous.  We are prosperous because we have 
extended the frontiers of education.  Today more than ever 
getting a good job and achieving a higher standard of living 
require even greater skills and broader knowledge. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of jobs in the new millennium will be anchored in two 
essential components: the infrastructure of innovation, and the 
infrastructure of skills and knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In today's evolving world—to get a job, to keep a job, to move 
on to a better job—there is only one resource that will equip 
Canadians to succeed, and that is to develop the very best skills they 
can.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Learning must be the central part of any national jobs strategy. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a very real way, the ability to learn must be the central 
part of any national job strategy. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts speak for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, those who graduated from university, community college 
and vocational institutes enjoy incomes 45 per cent higher than those 
who did not complete high school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last recession, for those with only high school, 640,000 
jobs were lost. However, for those with degrees or diplomas, 450,000 
jobs were gained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus it is not surprising that the unemployment rate for those with 
less than a high school diploma is 15 per cent, while for those with a 
university degree, it is only 5 per cent. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this is by no means only about university.  It is about 
every community college and every vocational and technical 
institute in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The demand for knowledge and skills spans all occupations at all 
levels and in all sectors, from factory to farm, from software to 
sales and from medicine to mechanics. Nor is this only about 
young people, it is also about the need to upgrade skills and 
develop new ones consistently throughout all of our working 
lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, if knowledge and skills underpin a strong economy, 
so too they underpin a strong society and a secure society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The backbone of a country is the strength of its middle class. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no better way to reduce the gap between the rich and 
the poor, no surer way to widen the mainstream, no more 
meaningful way to reduce the numbers of those left behind and no 
better way to provide a higher quality of life for Canadians than 
to facilitate the path to higher education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite simply, every Canadian who wants to learn should have the 
opportunity to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet today from Corner Brook to Coquitlam there are tens of 
thousands who do not have that opportunity.  It is a fact that 
students from lower income families are under represented in our 
institutions of higher learning and the fault line widens every 
time a young Canadian is denied access to the skills they need, 
not because the courses are too hard but because the costs are 
too high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too many are deterred from pursuing higher education because of 
a fear of large debt.  Too many who have made the decision to go 
forward are struggling with rising costs and too many parents 
worry that they will not be able to save for their children's 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a great irony and a greater tragedy that at the very 
moment when the country cannot afford to do without higher 
leaning it is becoming more difficult than ever to afford. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, before proceeding further, let me be very clear on one point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Education is a matter of provincial jurisdiction. It is the 
provinces that are responsible for the curriculum, for educational 
institutions, for quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking here of the content of what is taught. What we 
are talking about is equal access to opportunity. Indeed, what we are 
dealing with is the responsibility of all governments and all sectors of 
society to ensure that Canada builds on its strengths in an increasingly 
competitive and interdependent world economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each of us must do our part. We will only be truly successful in 
creating opportunity for all if we act in partnership, a partnership of 
parents, of educators, of the private sector, and of provincial and 
federal governments. 
In that partnership, some roles are exclusive. Others are shared.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For decades, both the federal government and the provinces have 
played their part in providing equality of access to those in financial 
need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, as demands evolve, we must strengthen and adapt that 
assistance to better ensure that all Canadians are provided an equal 
opportunity to participate in the knowledge-based economy of the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why? Because the need is so great. Because the cause is so clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote directly from the communiqué issued by the Prime 
Minister and the provincial premiers at their meeting last December. 
“The First Ministers agree on the importance of lessening students' 
financial burden. 
Furthermore, it is agreed that the Minister of Finance and the Minister 
of Human Resources Development will accelerate work in concert with 
provincial and territorial Education Ministers so that the Minister of 
Finance can take account of this work in the next federal 
budget”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are taking action in response to that consensus and that 
request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to set out the Canadian Opportunities Strategy—a 
co-ordinated set of measures building on the thrust of the last 
budget, designed to create opportunity by expanding access to 
lifelong learning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Action is required on seven fronts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, promoting access by helping students in financial need cope 
with rising costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, helping those who have graduated manage growing debt 
burdens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, providing Canadians with access to the financial resources 
required to upgrade their skills throughout their career. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, assisting families to save for their children's education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, supporting graduate and post-graduate students so that they 
can continue to develop their skills and do the research that will pay 
off for the whole country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixth, helping young people make the transition from school to 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, connecting Canadians, young and old, rural and urban, to 
the technology of the information age and all the knowledge it makes 
possible. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian opportunity strategy which we are outlining today 
helps move Canada forward on all seven of these fronts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, last fall in the House the Prime Minister said, and I 
quote, “There can be no greater millennium project for Canada 
and no better role for government than to help young Canadians 
prepare for the knowledge based society of the next century”. 
Then he went on to call for a major investment to provide 
thousands of scholarships to deserving Canadian students.  In 
this budget the Prime Minister's commitment and vision become 
reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are announcing the largest single investment every made 
by a federal government to support access to post-secondary 
education for all Canadians.  The Canadian millennium foundation, 
a private independent institution, is being created.  The 
government will provide the foundation with an initial 10 year 
endowment of $2.5 billion.  As a private foundation it will be 
able to receive donations and bequests from across the country.

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This investment will provide over 100,000 scholarships to low 
and middle income students each and every year over the course of 
the next decade.  The scholarships will average $3,000 each per 
year.  As a result, a student receiving a scholarship over four 
years will see his or her debt load cut by $12,000, half what it 
otherwise would have been. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These scholarships will be awarded to Canadians of all ages, 
part time as well as full time students.  Those attending all 
publicly funded institutions, not simply universities but 
colleges, CEGEPs and vocational and technical institutions, will 
be able to apply.  Canada millennium scholarships will be for the 
students at Durham College in Oshawa and the Northern Alberta 
Institute of Technology in Edmonton just as much as they will be 
for those at Université de Montréal or Dalhousie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians would like to be able to attend college or 
university outside their hometown or home province at an 
institution of their own choosing, but today rising costs make 
that less and less of a possibility.  We believe that more 
Canadians should have the opportunity to attend the institution 
that best meets their needs.  We also believe that Canadians 
should get to know their country better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore. recipients of the Canada millennium scholarships who 
want to travel or study outside of their hometowns or home 
provinces will be provided with the help to do so. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation will be a private, 
independent body. It will be managed by a board of directors, each and 
every one of whom will be a private citizen. They, not the government, 
will decide how best to design the scholarships within the mandate they 
are given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Council of Ministers of Education, representing the provinces, 
as well as representatives of the education community, will be given a 
key role in identifying who the directors should be. We will ensure that 
a student is on the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once established, the Foundation will consult very closely with 
provincial governments and the education community. The goal will be: to 
award scholarships by the Foundation to individuals in a manner that 
avoids duplication, to build on existing provincial needs assessment 
processes, to complement existing provincial programs. The legislation 
creating the Foundation will provide it with the administrative 
flexibility required to meet these objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, the Foundation will have the authority, subject to 
mutually agreed needs, merit and mobility criteria, to contract with 
appropriate provincial authorities for the selection of those recipients 
in a province to whom the Foundation will award Canada Millennium 
Scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Above all, we must significantly increase access to post-secondary 
education for low- and middle-income students. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This investment in the future of our country is the result of 
Canada's successful battle against the deficit.  It is an 
investment that will pay for itself over and over again in the 
years ahead.  The Prime Minister stated it best last fall: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope this can do in the 21st century for our economy and our 
country what the investment after World War II in post-secondary 
education for our returning soldiers did for our economy and our 
country in the last half of the 20th century—This will not be a 
millennium monument made of bricks and mortar, but when future 
Canadians look around they will see its legacy everywhere.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians do not need to be told that student debt has become a 
major problem.  Students know it.  Families know it.  Graduates 
must deal with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990, only eight years ago, the average debt load after a 
four year program was $13,000.  By next year it will almost have 
doubled to $25,000.  At the beginning of this decade fewer than 
8% of borrowers had debts larger than $15,000.  Now almost 40% 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Students are graduating with a mortgage before they can even 
consider buying a house and for many, before they have been able 
to land a job.  There are few students who do not find the burden 
of loan repayment to be a difficult one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Businesses are able to deduct the interest cost of buying 
equipment when investing in their future.  We believe that 
individual Canadians should receive similar treatment when 
investing in their future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, this budget announces that for the first time ever 
all students will be given tax relief on interest payments on 
their student loans.  This will be provided through a tax credit 
which can be carried forward for five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, to simply give you an example, for students just 
graduating with a loan of $25,000 this will mean a reduction of 
$530 in their taxes in the first year alone.  Over a 10 year 
paydown of the average student loan this could mean as much as 
$3,200 in tax relief.  This measure will help one million 
Canadians who are repaying their student loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, there are those who need even greater 
assistance in shouldering a debt burden that is simply too large 
for them to handle alone.  To help these individuals, additional 
changes will be made to provide further interest rate relief on 
their loans and for longer periods of time.  These changes will 
benefit up to 100,000 graduates in financial hardship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, for most, these measures will be sufficient.  However, 
there will still be a very small minority who despite interest 
relief cannot cope with their debts.  For these people, after 
careful examination of all of the circumstances, the principal 
amount of the loan itself will be reduced so that payments are 
more affordable.  This form of help will be considered five years 
after individuals have ended their studies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The measures we are announcing today will help greatly to ensure 
that Canadian students are not mired in a swamp of debt from 
which they can never escape.  However, in order to ensure that 
Canada student loans continue to provide as much assistance as 
they can to those who need it, we will be taking steps to ensure 
that both educational institutions and students use the program 
as it is intended. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The costs of study are a challenge for many Canadians, but 
there are some for whom the problem is particularly acute. We all 
know young people who made the decision early in life to have a 
family and as a result were unable to continue their education. 
Many are women who are today heading single-parent families.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, many want to return to their studies to improve their 
prospects and those of their children. Given the family obligations 
they have, the road ahead can be a very rough one indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, in order to expand opportunities for these 
Canadians, we are announcing today that new grants of up to $3,000 
per year will be made available to over 25,000 students in 
financial need who have children. These grants will help them 
whether they pursue their studies full time or on a part-time 
basis. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians know that their ability to continue earning depends on 
their ability to continue learning.  There are a growing number 
of part time students, the majority of whom are having a very 
difficult time trying to manage the difficult balance between 
work, family and study.  We have already announced that part time 
students will be eligible for Canada millennium scholarships and 
those with children for special grants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are announcing two additional steps to support part 
time studies.  The education credit is one of the major ways 
government provides tax assistance to students.  It helps with 
the living expenses of those in university, community college or 
vocational school.  Up until now this has been available only to 
full time students.  We are announcing today that for the first 
time part time students will have access to the education credit 
as well.  This will assist 250,000 students who could not take 
advantage of this credit before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next, the 1996 budget enabled full time students who are parents 
to claim the child care expense deduction against all types of 
income.  Today we are making part time students as well eligible 
for that deduction.  Fifty thousand students will benefit from 
this action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of these two measures, the tax savings for a typical 
part time student with two young children will more than triple 
from $300 to almost $1,000 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is more to be done.  Many Canadians already in the 
workforce need and want to upgrade their skills through full time 
study, yet many do not have reasonable access to the financial 
resources this requires.  Today we are moving forward to help 
meet this challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Effective January 1, 1999 Canadians will be able to make tax 
free withdrawals from their RRSPs to support full time education 
and training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are few things more critical to ensuring an adequate 
income in retirement than ensuring a good income when working. 
Providing opportunity to improve skills is an important way to 
make sure that happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The office worker who wishes to enhance their computer skills, 
the assembly line worker who wants to retrain as a machinist, 
these Canadians and more will now have access to a resource, 
their RRSP, that until now they were prevented from using. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of what we have announced so far concerns today's 
immediate needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But we must look ahead to the students of tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the answer lies in the over 100,000 Canada Millennium 
Scholarships that will be awarded each year. Part of the answer 
lies in assisting parents to prepare and plan for their children's 
future education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, Canadians are already saving for their children in many 
ways. Some buy bonds. Some set up special bank accounts. Many 
simply set aside a bit of money whenever they can. Grandparents, 
aunts and uncles put money away at birthdays and at Christmas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One way government assists Canadians in saving for their 
children's education is by supporting registered education savings 
plans—RESPs. Money placed in these plans grows tax free until 
the child is ready to go on to college, to a vocational institute 
or to university.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past two years we more than doubled the annual 
contribution limit for RESPs. Today we are taking a significant 
further step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today marks the beginning of a new partnership with parents.  We 
believe that government has a role to play investing alongside 
those who seek to save for their children's education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, effective January 1 of this year the government will 
provide a Canada education savings grant to supplement new 
contributions made to RESPs.  For every dollar contributed by a 
parent or other up to an amount of $2,000 a year the federal 
government will provide a Canada education savings grant equal to 
20% of the total and this money will be paid directly into the 
child's plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If contributors are unable to save the full amount in any 
particular year they will be able to carry the unpaid amounts 
forward, allowing them to catch up in later years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me illustrate the impact of saving with a Canada education 
savings grant beginning when a child is three.  If parents were 
to save, let us say, $25 every two weeks through an automatic 
deduction from their paycheque, even if prudently invested, their 
child beginning at age 18 would receive $4,700 each year for four 
years to finance his or her schooling.  Of that amount, almost 
$800 a year would be the direct result of the Canada education 
savings grant we are announcing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the initiatives we are taking, RESPs will now be 
among the most attractive savings vehicles available for a 
child's education.  We believe that RESPs will soon come to be 
considered as essential for future planning as registered 
retirement savings plans are now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They represent one of the best things parents can do for their 
children, one of the best things grandparents can do for their 
grandchildren.  They speak to the partnership of generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There can be few things more critical to determining our 
economic success in the next century than a vigorous, broad based 
research and development effort. The fact is the more R and D 
that is done in Canada, the more jobs that will be created for 
Canadians.  That is why, for instance, we created the Canada 
Foundation for Innovation last year, to provide the facilities at 
our hospitals, our universities and our colleges that will 
support world class research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year we are providing new support for researchers 
themselves so that the best and the brightest can realize their 
dreams and fulfil their promise right here in Canada.  They will 
do so by opening up new frontiers of knowledge in medicine and in 
the natural and the social sciences. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For two decades, the government's granting councils—the 
Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, the 
Medical Research Council of Canada and the Social Sciences and 
Humanities Research Council of Canada—have provided crucial 
support for these researchers and their projects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, Dr. John Polanyi, Nobel Prize winner and inventor 
of the chemical laser, has been a recipient of such 
support throughout his career. 
So, too, has Dr. Fernand Labrie of Laval University whose research 
work on enzymes and hormones has opened up vast possibilities for 
the treatment of breast and prostate cancers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we brought the deficit down, many difficult choices were 
made. One of these was a reduction in funding for the granting 
councils. That is why I am very happy to announce today that, 
effective April 1, their budgets will be restored to their original 
1994-95 levels. In the years ahead, these resources will grow 
further. Indeed, by the end of the year 2001, they will have 
received more than $400 million in additional resources and their 
budgets will be at their highest level ever.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The youth unemployment problem remains grave in this country. 
As we have just seen, an important part of the answer lies in 
higher education.  However, too many of our young people still 
confront the dilemma they know only too well: no experience, no 
job; no job, no experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To help address this problem, the government launched a youth 
employment strategy in February last year.  As part of that 
strategy, more than 120,000 career summer placements and over 
50,000 internships are being created over a two year period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the private sector is the engine of job creation and 
many employers are rising to the challenge of helping to hire and 
train more youth.  However, much more remains to be done.  Many 
more employers must rise to the challenge if it is to be 
overcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore today we are introducing two measures that we believe 
will support the private sector and others in this endeavour. 
They, along with the measures announced today and others 
previously taken, are part of what we believe must become a 
country-wide effort to deal head on with the problem of youth 
unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we are announcing that over the next two years employment 
insurance premiums paid by employers will be eliminated for new 
jobs they create for young Canadians between the ages of 18 and 
24. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we recognize that the challenge of finding a job is 
toughest for those who have dropped out of school.  For these 
people the need for skills is great, and on the job training is 
often the best way to develop them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today Youth Service Canada is helping over 5,000 unemployed 
young Canadians get work experience in local businesses and 
community based projects.  The results are there.  One year after 
completing their Youth Service Canada work experience, 85% of 
participants had found work or had returned to school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore in this budget we are more than doubling the resources 
devoted to this program in order to assist those, particularly 
between ages 20 and 24, who have not completed high school.  Wage 
subsidies of up to $10,000 will be provided to give them the kind 
of work experience that is key to long term employment. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Computer skills have now joined reading, writing and 
arithmetic as one of the basics of learning. Having access to a 
computer puts the world literally at one's fingertips. There are 
two programs in place to give Canadians access to the technology 
and knowledge that makes it all possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, SchoolNet, introduced by the government four years ago, 
is bringing the Internet into the classroom, making it a vital 
learning tool in every school in Canada. It allows students to 
access huge volumes of material in a matter of seconds—making 
learning more satisfying and teaching more effective.> 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Computers for Schools Initiative, which is part of 
SchoolNet, donates thousands of computers to schools across the 
country, helping our children develop computer literacy at an early 
age, the easiest time to learn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the Community Access Program is bringing Canada on-line. 
Five thousand communities and libraries are being connected. Five 
thousand more sites await. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The goal of both these programs is to make sure that, no matter 
where Canadians live, no matter how small a town, how small a 
school, rich or poor, every student—indeed every citizen—has 
access to the same storehouse of knowledge. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1730"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT89"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To bring that goal ever closer to realization, the government 
is significantly increasing the resources available to both 
SchoolNet and the Community Access Program. There will be 
additional investment as well for CANARIE, Canada's world-leading 
research effort into next-generation communications networks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This unique and extensive private and public sector consortium 
will enable Canada to put in place the world's fastest 
coast-to-coast information network, accessible to schools, 
communities and businesses. At the dawn of the information 
economy, this will provide Canada with an important leg up on the 
rest of the world. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me summarize what the Canadian opportunities strategy means 
for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the student at college or university or vocational 
institute, the Canadian opportunities strategy means a 
comprehensive system of scholarships, study grants, student loans 
and tax credits. For the graduate coping with student loans it 
means a new tax credit to support repayment and new loan relief 
if they are in a situation of financial hardship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the worker seeking to renew his or her skills, whether 
through part time or full time study, whether at university, 
college or vocational institute, it means increased support that 
will now be available for students of all ages, plus the 
opportunity to draw on RRSPs to increase earning capacity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For parents and grandparents it means the Canada education 
savings grant which will make RESPs the best way by far to save 
for a child's future education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For post-graduate students and researchers it means greater 
support of their important work through the granting councils. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For young persons having difficulty joining the workforce it 
means new opportunities to gain practical work experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For children as well as communities across Canada, it means new 
access to computer technology and computer networks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian opportunities strategy is based on a very 
straightforward proposition:  that people, regardless of their 
income level, who are serious about getting an education should 
have that opportunity.  That is their right.  It is our duty and 
it is a responsibility that we are acting upon today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have just been discussing the role of education in assuring 
equality of opportunity.  But let us be very clear.  The capacity 
to learn does not begin in school.  It is dependent on the caring 
and the nurturing provided the smallest infant.  The fact is 
equality of opportunity means a good start at home.  That is why 
over the past year the federal, provincial and territorial 
governments have begun to build a national child benefit system 
which will play a key role in fighting poverty so as to help 
provide that good start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a first step, in our last budget we allocated $850 million to 
increase federal child benefits.  This funding begins to flow in 
July of this year through the new Canada child tax benefit.  It 
will increase support to over one million children and their 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last spring we said that as soon as we could afford to do more, 
we would.  Today we are. As part of the national child benefit 
system, we are allocating a further $850 million to enrich the 
child tax benefit over the next two years:  $425 million as of 
July 1999 and $425 million as of July in the year 2000. 
Details of these improvements will be announced after discussions 
with the provinces. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1735"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT90"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next, we believe that government must recognize and support all 
Canadian families in their desire to provide quality care for 
their children.  We know that the vast majority of working 
Canadians belong to two earner families.  While those parents are 
away at work they want the very best care for their children.  We 
also know that the costs of childcare can be high and that they 
are increasing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, in this budget we are increasing the limit on the 
childcare expense deduction from $5,000 to $7,000 for children 
under age 7, and from $3,000 to $4,000 for children aged 7 to 16. 
For a parent earning $45,000 and paying $14,000 for the care of 
two preschool children, this measure will reduce their costs by 
$1,600 a year.  The increased childcare expense deductions will 
provide needed assistance to 65,000 Canadians with children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the defining features of a secure society is its will and 
capacity to provide a secure retirement income for its senior 
citizens.  One of the most important policy initiatives ever 
undertaken in Canada was the decision over three decades ago to 
establish the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CPP is about our values as a nation.  It is about the 
sharing of risk and the security of benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year we and the provinces as joint stewards came together 
and agreed on a package of reforms to preserve the CPP and 
enabling legislation was passed by this Parliament.  The CPP is 
now secure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can say to every Canadian who is 60 years old, the CPP will 
be there for you.  We can say to every Canadian who is 40 years 
old, the CPP will be there for you.  And we can say with 
confidence to every young Canadian, many of whom have not 
believed that public pensions would survive, the CPP will also be 
there for you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the months ahead we will move on to the next stage of 
preserving our pension system.  Legislation will be introduced to 
put in place the seniors benefit which in the early years of the 
next century will replace the current system of old age security 
and the guaranteed income supplement, the second pillar of our 
retirement income system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The seniors benefit will fully protect the pensions of all 
current seniors and near seniors.  It will ensure that all those 
in need receive as much, if not more, than they would under the 
current system. We have consulted with seniors and other 
interested groups on the detail of this reform.  They have raised 
some very important points concerning the package that was first 
put forward in 1996.  We have listened very carefully.  Their 
points are being given every consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me now turn to the question of taxation.  Let me begin by 
reaffirming our goal.  It is to reduce taxes.  It is to leave 
more money in the pockets of hard working Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A government's tax policy must be an essential element of its 
overall social and economic policy.  Our tax policy is crystal 
clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, our financial resources are limited.  Therefore targeted 
tax reductions aimed at critical social and economic concerns 
must be the first priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, as financial resources permit, general tax relief will 
be provided, the priority being personal income taxes for middle 
and low income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the tax system must be fair.  This means Canadians should 
pay taxes consistent with their capacity to pay.  And we must 
ensure that all taxes owing are indeed paid.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the beginning, we have provided targeted tax relief where the 
need is greatest and the impact the largest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In past budgets, for example, we have increased tax assistance for 
students, for charities, for persons with disabilities, and for the 
children of working parents with low incomes. In this budget, the 
process of targeted assistance is being continued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the measures we have announced as part of the Canadian 
Opportunities Strategy will, in fact, be delivered through the tax 
system, as will the new support for families under the Canada Child Tax 
Benefit and the child care expense deduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, we are announcing the following targeted tax measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the number of self-employed Canadians is growing daily. Many 
operate through unincorporated businesses. However, unlike those 
businesses that are incorporated, they cannot deduct the premiums they 
pay for their supplemental health and dental plans. This is unfair. 
Starting this year, self-employed Canadians will be able to deduct these 
premiums from their business income. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We recognize as well that there is an unprecedented number of 
Canadians, mostly women, who are today providing care for family 
members at home, very often an elderly parent or a disabled 
child.  The support they provide is irreplaceable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recognition of this the government is introducing a new 
federal tax credit of up to $400.  This will increase or extend 
assistance to well over 400,000 caregivers. Together with the 
GST/HST exemption proposed in this budget for respite care, our 
goal is to enhance federal support for Canadians striving to meet 
the growing demands of caring for family members with an 
infirmity or a disability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, as witnessed over the past year in floods and the ice 
storm, it is important to recognize the extraordinary service 
provided by the thousands of Canadians who register as volunteers 
in our communities, mostly rural, as has been pointed out by 
caucus, and who provide essential emergency services such as 
firefighting and first aid.  They give concrete meaning to the 
concept of good citizenship.  To support them, the tax free 
allowance for volunteer firefighters will be doubled from $500 to 
$1,000.  This allowance is extended to all other emergency 
service volunteers effective January 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the books balanced it is now possible to consider broader 
tax measures.  Very clearly, at the outset these measures must be 
modest for the financial dividend that makes them possible is 
modest as well.  We simply cannot put in jeopardy either Canada's 
regained fiscal health or the country's priorities such as health 
care, education and public pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equally clearly, as a matter of fundamental fairness, our first 
focus must be on low and middle income Canadians.  The place to 
start therefore is with those least able to pay taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, personal tax credits serve the purpose of greater tax 
fairness by ensuring that no tax is paid on a basic amount of 
income. Therefore, as of July 1 of this year, we are raising the 
amount of income that can be earned by a low income single 
Canadian by $500 and by $1,000 for a family, before they pay one 
penny of tax. 
As a result, 400,000 people will be removed from the tax rolls 
completely.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, in 1986 the previous government subjected all Canadians 
to a 3% general surtax, a tax on tax, which it said would bring 
the deficit down.  The deficit went up.  The surtax remained on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are announcing the elimination of the deficit.  Today, 
for 13 million middle income Canadians, we are eliminating the 
surtax. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we are announcing the elimination of the deficit. And today, 
for 13 middle-income million Canadians, we are eliminating the surtax. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Effective July 1, taxpayers earning between $50,000 and $65,000 
will see the surtax reduced and 83% of all taxpayers, those 
earning up to $50,000, will see it eliminated in its entirety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taken together, the last two measures will provide tax relief 
for up to 14 million Canadians and 90% of all taxpayers.  In 
total, the general tax relief and the targeted tax measures that 
we are announcing today, primarily to low and middle income 
Canadians, amount to $7 billion over the next three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These tax measures are a first step.  Looking ahead, we will 
build upon them as we can.  We will do so with the nation's 
economic and social needs very much at the forefront of our 
consideration.  We will do so in a measured and responsible way. 
Let there be no doubt, as soon as we can afford it taxes will be 
further reduced. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This then is our budget. It represents the second stage of the 
plan we put in place in 1994. It has three parts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, in previous budgets, we reduced the deficit. With this 
budget, we have balanced the books and have begun the process of debt 
reduction. In future budgets, we will stay the course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we have invested in the future. Over 80 per cent of our 
new spending initiatives reflect the highest priorities of 
Canadians—access to knowledge and skills, support for health and 
education through increased transfers to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, we will accomplish this while at the same time 
maintaining a tight control on our expenditures. 
In fact, in this budget, Canada's program spending as a share of GDP, 
will fall to its lowest level in 50 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we have reduced taxes initially in a targeted way and, as 
soon as the country's resources permit, we will broaden and deepen the 
process. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This plan is not only simply a theme for one budget or one year. 
It has defined our approach from the beginning.  It will define 
our approach in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as I draw to a close, let me conclude not by 
summarizing the measures contained in this budget but by 
describing the challenges those measures are designed to meet. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1750"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT93"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we cannot pretend that our task is over.  It is not.  If 
Canadians have accomplished a great financial turnaround, there 
are greater things still that need to be done.  We dare not coast 
now.  We cannot let go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that in this age of globalization and technological 
change we hear constantly about barriers that are being brought 
down, about new markets that are being opened up.  This is true 
and it is tremendously exciting, but the fact is as well that 
Canadians have come to fear that our capacity to shape our own 
destiny is disappearing and that their country has become like a 
small boat sailing on rough and uncharted seas. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an era of restructuring and downsizing, Canadians have come to 
wonder whatever happened to the once solid link between growth in the 
economy and growth in their incomes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After decades of runaway deficits, Canadians have feared that their 
health care, their pensions, their system of education risked becoming 
mere shadows of their former selves—frail and fading, no longer 
strong and secure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well, there is a new destiny we must design for ourselves. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Globalization and technological change are a reality.  They are 
not a religion.  They are a fact.  They are not a faith.  We 
commit a very serious mistake if we ever come to believe that the 
global economy abroad means that there is no role, no 
responsibility on the part of government to provide opportunity 
and security at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the era of great change our core programs, our core 
institutions, our core values are more important than ever.  They 
hold us together.  They give Canadians the security and the 
confidence they deserve.  They equip the country to succeed, and 
succeed we will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe on this side of the House that the strength of a 
nation's agenda lies in its balance, not in its extremes.  The 
fact is we have not balanced the budget in spite of having taken 
a balanced approach.  We have done so precisely because we have 
taken a balanced approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not about compromise.  This is not about trying to be 
all things to all people.  It is about meeting the diverse needs 
of a modern nation.  It is about managing the present while at 
the same time preparing for the future.  We do not believe that 
our society and our economy should be left to twist in the winds 
of globalization.  We must make change work for us or else we 
will end up working for it.  That frames our challenge. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some countries have great natural resources, others have impressive 
technological capacity, still others have vast human resources. We have 
all three. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why our goal must be to make Canada, not just a participant 
in the modern economy, but a world leader. A country which provides its 
citizens with access to the highest standard of living and the widest 
scope of opportunities possible. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our responsibility as we go forward is very clear.  It is to 
balance the budget but it is also to bring forth budgets that are 
balanced.  It is to work to build not simply an economy of growth 
but also to safeguard a society that is fair.  Our challenge 
today is to put our values to work in new ways for a new century. 
It is to turn opportunity for some into opportunity for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what this budget seeks.  That is what we will strive for 
in each and every year that lies ahead, for that is the 
foundation on which a great nation is built.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in about three minutes I will formerly move adjournment 
of the budget debate until tomorrow, but before doing so I would 
be remiss if I did not say that congratulations are in order 
concerning the fact that for the first time in 28 years the 
federal budget is to be balanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members opposite, most of whom have resisted budget 
balancing throughout their entire careers, appear to feel that 
these congratulations are owed to them.  What an illusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I half expect the finance minister to show up tomorrow with his 
arm in a sling, having patted himself on the back so many times 
that he has dislocated his shoulder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget figures themselves plainly show that the federal 
budget has been balanced primarily on the backs of long suffering 
Canadian taxpayers, taxpayers who are now contributing more than 
$30 billion per year to the federal coffers than when the 
government took office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is the taxpayers of Canada who have contributed the most 
to balancing the budget, then it is those taxpayers who should be 
the first to receive the rewards of a balanced budget and it is 
they who should receive the greatest reward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would have expected a grateful government, a grateful 
minister, to have first devoted any surplus to meeting the 
priorities of those taxpayers, which are debt reduction and tax 
relief.  Sad to say, this budget does not provide that reward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members have not heard this, but they will hear it now. The 
story of the budget in brief is that there is no serious effort 
to tackle the debt.  Spending is up by $11 billion over the next 
four years.  I would ask Liberal members to listen to the last 
point because they were not told this in caucus.  While tax 
relief measures amounting to $7 billion are offered over the next 
three years, total taxes paid by all taxpayers increase by $46 
billion over the same period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the minister put $900 into the left pocket of 
the average family and over the next three years will take $6,000 
out of the right pocket and hope that the taxpayers will not 
notice.  The taxpayers are going to notice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the intention and the duty of the official opposition over 
the next few days to fully disclose and expose the betrayal of 
the taxpayer in this budget and to present alternative measures 
to make real tax relief and real debt reduction the priorities of 
the 36th Parliament.

exposures of the weaknesses of its budget, to give the government 
its fleeting moment in the sun, I move:
