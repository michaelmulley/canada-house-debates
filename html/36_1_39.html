</H4><P align=left>
<P><A NAME="LINK3"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>DRAFTING LEGISLATION—SPEAKER'S RULING 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I would like to deliver a ruling on the 
questions of privilege raised by the hon. member for 
Yorkton—Melville on October 21, 1997 and by the hon. member for 
Sarnia—Lambton on November 18, 1997. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Yorkton—Melville objected to an 
administrative change where House procedural staff were drafting 
legislative amendments for private members, rather than 
legislative counsel.  The hon. member felt that this change would 
reduce the quality of service available to him and as such 
interfered with his ability ot do his job as a member for 
Parliament. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton, on the other hand, objected 
to his private member's bill being drafted by lawyers enrolled in 
the legislative drafting program at the University of Ottawa. The 
hon. member felt that this arrangement breached the 
confidentiality that applies to such matters and was evidence of 
inadequate legislative counsel support for members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the fact that the program is headed by a justice 
department lawyer caused him to wonder about possible government 
interference in private members' bills. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. members for their submissions on this matter and 
the other hon. members who intervened.  The legislative work of 
private members is an important part of what it means to be a 
member of Parliament.  As your Speaker, it concerns me that some 
private members feel they are not adequately supported in their 
legislative function. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated in my ruling on October 23, 1997 on a point of 
privilege raised by the hon. member for Sarnia—Lambton in 
respect of legislative counsel services, questions pertaining to 
resources provided to private members should be brought to the 
attention of the Board of Internal Economy and should not be 
raised on the floor of the House as a point of order nor as a 
point of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The matters raised on that earlier occasion and the matters now 
raised by the hon. member for Yorkton—Melville and the hon. 
member for Sarnia—Lambton involve in my view basic 
administrative issues.  I had however committed to both hon. 
members that I would ensure this matter would get priority at the 
board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the administrative changes to which the hon. 
members referred, I have directed that both initiatives, the 
drafting of amendments by procedural staff and the drafting of 
private members' bills at the University of Ottawa, be put on 
hold pending a decision by the board on the mandate and the 
resourcing of legislative counsel services generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to reassure the hon. members that amendments and private 
members' bills shall only be drafted by legislative counsel 
retained under the authority of the Speaker.  For this the board 
has authorized additional resources for the balance of the 
current fiscal year which should improve timely delivery of 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The larger question of legislative counsel services remains on 
the agenda of the board. 
It is hoped that a more comprehensive solution will be found in 
time for the next fiscal year, as the board is currently working 
on the proposed 1998-99 estimates.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my hope, given the nature of this matter and the number of 
times it has been raised, that the board will resolve this 
matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I want to close this statement by giving the hon. members 
for Sarnia—Lambton and for Yorkton—Melville a further 
commitment, and it is this:  If this matter is not resolved in a 
timely fashion at the board, I will not shy away from my duty and 
responsibility as the Speaker of this House.

pursuant to Standing Order 36(8) I have the honour to table, in

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>ORGANIZED CRIME 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to address an issue of grave concern 
to the Government of Canada and to all Canadians, that being 
organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this the first of what will be annual statements to 
parliament on organized crime I want to give parliamentarians and 
Canadians an understanding of the immense challenge our nation 
faces.  I also want to discuss the concrete measures the 
government and its partners are taking to combat organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime is big business and it is bad business.  It is a 
national problem that threatens public safety and erodes the 
social well-being of all Canadians.  Organized crime is a global 
problem.  The United Nations has recognized it as a priority for 
the next century and has called on all member states to declare 
it public enemy number one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized criminals and gangs prey on society through a variety 
of destructive activities:  drug trafficking, prostitution, 
forgery, weapons trafficking, auto theft, liquor and tobacco 
smuggling, and bank fraud.  The economic cost of organized crime 
in Canada alone is measured in the billions of dollars annually. 
There also can be losses suffered by legitimate businesses, tax 
payments evaded and a high law enforcement expenditure, to name 
only three. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police estimates the total 
amount of money made from illicit drug sales at $10 billion 
annually.  The smuggling of black market jewellery is estimated 
to be a $400 million illicit business in Canada, leading to 
additional tax losses of $30 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Untold illegal revenues are being made through the use of new 
technology colour copiers by counterfeiters.  Credit card fraud 
can run as high as $80 million annually.  One illegal lottery 
scheme alone, operated out of Canada between 1994 and 1995, may 
have cost elderly American victims $100 million or more.  The 
elderly in Canada are also at risk and we are committed to their 
protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economic impact of organized crime is only one measurement 
of harm these activities inflict.  Our communities pay dearly to 
finance organized crime kingpins.  One shipment of heroine landed 
successfully in Canada can lead to numerous deaths and human 
suffering in cities like Vancouver and Toronto.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children are hooked by schoolyard pushers.   Muggings, 
robberies, auto thefts and house break-ins increase as addicts 
scramble to finance their habits.  Higher drug use dramatically 
increases the chances of infection with HIV and other diseases. 
Families can suffer under domestic violence and child abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are also seeing firsthand the problem of organized 
crime violence. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, for example, biker gangs have been tied to dozens of 
bombings and related violence. Biker gangs are very visible sign 
of organized crime, but other groups are buried deep, disguising 
themselves as legitimate enterprises or using today's tehcnology 
to prey on their victims from afar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government will not allow organized criminals to use their 
ill-gotten gains and threats of violence to intimidate our 
communities. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to elaborate on what Canada is doing to deal with this 
huge crime challenge.  My ministry has mounted a combined 
offensive against organized crime working together with the 
departments of justice, revenue, finance, citizenship and 
immigration, foreign affairs and others.  To increase the power 
and effectiveness of that offensive, we have joined forces with 
our provincial, territorial and international counterparts and 
police forces across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has consulted closely with law enforcement, 
business and others affected by organized crime.  We had a number 
of excellent suggestions come out of the national forum on 
organized crime convened last year, practical suggestions that 
would hit hard at organized crime.  Forum participants also 
recommended that the solicitor general make an annual statement 
to the House of Commons to draw attention to this grave problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that forum Canada's police urged governments to give them 
the tools to do the job.  That is what we have done.  We renewed 
the resources for the anti-smuggling initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Early in the first mandate of this government, we took decisive 
action against organized tobacco, alcohol and firearms smuggling. 
We quickly and effectively curbed the smuggling and 
re-established order in the marketplace.  Just as important, we 
restored the sense of safety and security in affected border 
communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We passed the Witness Protection Act to provide police with an 
effective means of protecting people who help police collect 
evidence against organized crime groups.  We passed the 
Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, establishing a legislative 
base for police to conduct undercover reverse sting operations. 
We passed the Criminal Law Improvement Act to provide police with 
the means to conduct storefront operations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We listened to the police and passed tough, comprehensive 
anti-gang legislation.  We acted on law enforcement's call to 
define in our criminal law what constitutes a criminal 
organization.  The law gives new powers to the police, 
prosecutors and the courts to deal with these newly defined 
criminal organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation also lets us seize any property used by criminal 
organizations and the courts can ultimately order the property 
forfeited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anti-gang legislation is being used right now.  Arrests and 
seizures regularly make headlines.  We are monitoring its 
implementation and I will provide a status report in next year's 
statement on organized crime.  We are also attacking organized 
crime through the existing proceeds of crime laws.  The police 
have also told us that the most effective way to dismantle and 
disrupt criminal enterprises over the long term is to target the 
upper levels of criminal organizations and focus on the kingpins. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been able to mount a highly successful attack on the 
illegally obtained assets of criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The joint integrated proceeds of crimes units, where the RCMP 
worked together with provincial and local police as well as 
customs officers and Justice Canada counsel, were so successful 
that we established 10 more units located across Canada.  In 
addition, justice has created a proceeds of crime prosecution 
team in each region to complement these expanded enforcement 
activities.  We are not finished.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A key recommendation out of the organized crime forum was to 
continue to improve the ability of the police to investigate 
money laundering.  Therefore the government will introduce 
legislation in this Parliament to create new financial reporting 
requirements regarding suspicious transactions and the 
cross-border movement of currency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These measures will give the police more information on illegal 
financial activity and put us in step with our international 
counterparts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The heart of our anti-organized crime strategy is bringing all 
the concerned agencies together from all involved jurisdictions 
and maximizing the use of our resources, federal, provincial and 
municipal.  Co-operation will be the hallmark of our effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, law enforcement has urged greater national co-ordination 
of effort and policy so that organized crime faces a seamless 
net.  We took that suggestion very seriously and that is why we 
established a national co-ordinating committee of police and 
other officials, chaired by my department, along with regional 
counterparts in British Columbia, the prairies and territories, 
Ontario, Quebec and the Atlantic region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, the United Nations has expressed alarm at the 
rising threat of organized crime internationally.  We recognize 
that global problems demand global solutions.  We are working 
with the United States and other partners in Europe, the Americas 
and around the world in forums such as the United Nations, 
Interpol and the Organization of American States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In early December in Washington I will attend the first ever 
meeting of G-8 ministers on organized crime to further our work 
internationally.  Co-operation and information sharing only makes 
sense when criminals can use borders to hide from police.  That 
is why we have to work smarter and more effectively with our 
neighbours to the south. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September I hosted the first ever Canada-United States 
cross-border crime forum here in Ottawa attended by United States 
Attorney General Janet Reno. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian and United States officials are working together to 
build on the co-operative relationships between our countries. 
Ms. Reno and I believe this forum will pay great dividends in the 
future.  Law enforcement of all jurisdictions needs to be 
networked with each other so that criminals cannot slip through 
the cracks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members can see from my remarks, the Canadian law enforcement 
community has been the cornerstone of our anti-organized crime 
efforts and it will always be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would particularly like to recognize the efforts and the 
commitment of the police community in helping to keep the public 
informed about the organized crime problem and providing us with 
advice on how to address it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In concluding the first report to Parliament on our efforts to 
combat organized crime in Canada, let me restate this 
government's commitment to provide national leadership in the 
fight against this menace and to keep Parliament informed on the 
progress in the battle.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to respond to the 
minister's statement today on behalf of average Canadians from 
the official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his opening remarks the solicitor general stated that 
organized crime is big business and it is bad business.  I agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gang business is far from simply riding around on loud, 
outrageous motorcycles.  It is about the almighty dollar and 
finding the most direct way of getting lots of it, whether it is 
being done legally or illegally.  In almost every case the 
fastest way is the illegal way, drugs, theft, prostitution and 
business scams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this month, the 10 month undercover police sting at 
Edmonton led to 51 drug trafficking, possession and conspiracy 
charges against 10 gang members.  This is what the police seized: 
$800,000 worth of property including two homes, one worth 
$350,000 and the other $300,000, four motorcycles, a Lamborghini 
sports car, several firearms, not registered I suppose, TVs and a 
great deal of cash, well into the thousands.  This is no small 
town operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is also right when he states that this issue is of 
great concern to all Canadians.  Canadians really fear for their 
safety.  Organized crime affects each and every Canadian.  It is 
not something that is untouched or does not affect the local 
community. 
With the continued operation of the notorious biker gangs, each 
and every one of us sitting in the House is at risk. Our families 
are at risk.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of weeks ago in Quebec a man who was linked to the 
Hell's Angels was gunned down in a restaurant. Then a couple of 
days later a gang sympathizer was discovered dead in the trunk of 
a car. Gang wars in Quebec are out of control.  Edmonton is 
another city that is starting to feel similar pressures. The 
violence is absolutely unacceptable. Since 1989 there have been 
well over 65 gang related homicides in Quebec alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was astounded to learn the number of gang members there are in 
Canada.  According to Staff Sergeant Jean-Pierre Levesque who is 
with the Criminal Intelligence Service of Canada there are about 
1,200 gang members in total in Canada formally recognized. 
However, if we count friends, connections, business associates, 
the number may be as high as 12,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, according to Interpol there are close to 95 
chapters of the Hell's Angels operating in 16 different countries 
around the world. To say they are well connected would definitely 
be an understatement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Almost daily there are news stories directly related to gangs. 
Canadians are concerned. They want solutions and, most important, 
they want solutions that are going to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the solicitor general trumpeted the government's record. 
This government has had over four years to correct the flaws of 
the justice system but all it did was often tinker with it.  I do 
not think the government should be too proud today.  It should 
perhaps apologize to Canadians for not doing enough. It has had 
enough time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The power to implement change was there to use. It had complete 
majority governments, but all it did was sit on its hands and 
hope that everything would get better, until the cries could not 
be stemmed anymore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the solicitor general's statement he said that his government 
listened to the police and passed tough, comprehensive gang 
legislation: “Anti-gang legislation is being used right now. 
Arrests and seizures regularly make headlines. We are monitoring 
its implementation. I will provide a status report in the next 
year's statement on organized crime”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can honestly say that I eagerly await next year's statement. 
I want the minister to stand up and say how gang violence has 
dramatically dropped from one date to the next.  It is the 
government's administration and its responsibility. I want the 
minister to say at that time that his new legislation has not 
been overturned by the Supreme Court of Canada because it 
infringed on the charter of rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On November 2 of this year gang member Ettore Sabastiani was 
apparently the first person to be convicted using the new law. He 
was sentenced to five years in prison. The solicitor general may 
be proud of his headlines, but he cannot be proud of what is in 
the article. Two of the headlines surrounding this story were: 
“Gang member first convicted under new law” in the Ottawa 
<I>Sun</I>; and “Sabastiani sentence believed to be the first 
convicted under the new anti-gang legislation” from the Kingston 
<I>Whig Standard</I>.  But here is where the minister's happiness 
perhaps ends.  I want to read two clips, first from the <I>Sun</I> 
article and the second from the <I>Whig Standard</I>: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But Friday, Sabastiani tried to withdraw his plea to the 
anti-gang charge.  He lawyer, Wayne King, argued that the law 
violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms because it 
is too vague, too broad and contradicts the provisions for 
freedom of association. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Sabastiani had not plead guilty, a constitutional challenge 
would have likely been allowed and may still happen in other 
cases.  The legislation has a good chance of being struck down if 
it is challenged, said King. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Kingston <I>Whig Standard</I> had similar words: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Queen's law professor Don Stewart agrees with King.  He said in 
an interview yesterday that it's a bad piece of legislation 
because it is so loose that it is ripe for misuse and ineffective 
against organized crime.  It was drafted in great haste—to get 
votes in Quebec where there was concern of the Rock Machine and 
the Hell's Angels—it's a very bad piece of legislation. The 
law is likely to be challenged under the charter as too vague, 
too broad. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bringing forward legislation should never be done just for short 
term political purposes.  It should be done for the well-being of 
all Canadians, for the long term vision of a great society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform supported the organized crime bill in the last Parliament 
because there was need for something to take place. The bill was 
a start in providing the necessary tools for law enforcement. But 
the questions we asked then are the same as we are asking today. 
Is the law constitutionally sound?  Ten months ago was the time 
to make the changes.  It may now be too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, like the minister, I want to see an immediate stop to 
organized crime.  I also want to see laws that will withstand the 
supreme court challenges. When is the government going to 
understand that a major overhaul of the justice system is needed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ministerial statements are fine, but ministerial action is 
preferred. 
The longer the government waits to act, the worse our streets 
will become.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general has made his statement.  He is directly 
responsible for the administration of federal prisons.  Yet 
organized crime flourishes in our prisons and he has been unable 
to respond to it.  We hope that on this score he will clean up 
the backlog of union grievances and fully support his staff to 
rid us of organized crime in federal jails. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the second world war we have had many years of Liberal 
governments.  With that backdrop of a history of administration, 
the government must more fully accept its responsibility for 
where we are today in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are broad sociological reasons for the success of 
organized crime.  Some of it has to do with the general legal and 
economic culture which the government is creating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When economic prospects are dim, young people are more easily 
preyed upon to become involved in street level crime supervised 
by the organized crime bosses.  When tax policy kills the spirit, 
the sinister elements can more easily get a foothold.  When 
governments in the past have erected unreasonably high 
differentials between the U.S. and Canada, unnecessary economic 
incentives are created for the perverse to arise.  Capacity 
creates its own demand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically the Liberals have been very soft on crime.  We are 
pleased when we can get the government to move substantively 
rather than just in a cosmetic fashion.  If the government can 
gather courage and do what is right rather than just what is 
politically convenient, we will certainly support those efforts. 
Sadly, how many times in the House has the general debate gone on 
about some crime measure? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On our side after looking at the bill, we are calling for more 
substance, a more comprehensive approach, a more thorough job 
than just tentative measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most recent example was the DNA evidence collection bill. It 
is good as far as it goes, but here again it stops far short of 
what is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the broad societal reasons for the success of 
organized crime.  The government has to accept a share of the 
blame for the context of the culture it has created for organized 
crime to flourish.  If it could learn those lessons, then the 
courses of action would become evident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything that we have brought to this House on the economy was 
helpful in fighting organized crime.  One of the biggest crime 
prevention strategies is low unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud the minister for anything he can do on this file.  He 
is now committed to an annual statement. It is hoped that he will 
be able to measure how the government's rather haphazard 
administration of public affairs is successfully responding to 
this challenge which will be measured from year to year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vision for the national voyage must be based upon honesty, 
competence and real leadership.  May the legislation that flows 
from the government statement be honestly presented.  May the 
government administer with the highest of standards guided by 
real accountability measures.  The annual statement may form a 
bit of an accountability measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May the government gather some courage to legislate against 
crime and to lead, for whatever increases hope will also exalt 
courage.  If the government faints from these principles, the 
nation knows that we on this side of the House are more than 
ready.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, organized 
crime is a major problem in Quebec and Canada, but particularly in the 
Quebec City area, where my riding of Charlesbourg is located. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my hon. colleague from the Reform Party mentioned earlier, there 
was another murder in my riding last week, in a family restaurant. 
As families were enjoying a quiet evening meal at the restaurant, they 
witnessed the cold-blooded murder of a man. This dramatic incident is 
but one example of the kind of violence biker gangs are responsible for 
in Quebec. It has reached such proportions that recently—two weeks 
ago I think—the Lloyds Insurance Company of London announced its 
intention to no longer insure bars in the Quebec City area. This shows 
how bad the situation is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The party that has been asking this government to do something 
about biker gangs since 1995 is our party, the Bloc Quebecois. After the 
Bloc Quebecois put a great deal of pressure on the government in Ottawa 
on behalf of Quebeckers, the government started to act in April 1996, 
but that was not enough, because too many unfortunate incidents have 
occurred in the past year.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I referred to a while ago, there is a very heavy 
concentration of biker gangs in Quebec.  There are, of course, the 
Hell's Angels, but there is also the Rock Machine, which is 
apparently about to join forces with another biker gang, an 
international one this time, called the Bandidos. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very clear that the government does not have the desire 
to put all of the law enforcement resources necessary in place to 
deal with this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his speech, the minister claims that he has restored 
security in the border communities where the goods were crossing. 
As recently as this fall we witnessed the aborted raid at 
Kahnawake, where there were sizeable stocks of arms brought in from 
outside, and it was not the Quebec Minister of Public Security who 
was responsible for aborting the raid, either.  This one very 
recent example can make us doubt the desire of this government to 
fight organized crime effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can also ask oneself the following question: Is the 
antigang legislation the government across the floor wants to see 
passed sufficient?  Is it stringent enough?  According to the Bloc 
Quebecois, even the definition of a criminal organization, referred 
to a moment ago by my hon. colleague from the Reform Party, still 
does not go far enough.  Vagueness remains, and this could lead to 
challenges of the constitutional validity of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The act also authorizes the seizure of goods that have been 
used by criminal organizations.  Although it is a nice initiative, 
a look at the concrete facts points to some shortcomings. 
Consider the cases where the police moves in to make a seizure. 
Two weeks ago there was a raid at the Hell's Angels hideout in 
Saint-Nicolas, near Quebec City. When the police arrived at the 
bunker, they took it over, but there was almost nothing left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there not a way to ensure that the police can act more quickly 
so that these seizure operations can really be effective against 
organized crime? This is a legitimate question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning Bill C-95, the Minister of Justice at the time said that 
the object was to hit the master minds behind these criminal 
organizations. But at that time, the bill was not at all that clear, and 
I remember a discussion between my colleague for Berthier—Montcalm and 
the minister. My colleague had difficulty finding in the bill what was 
meant by a master mind, and these people were not mentioned anywhere in 
the bill. 
So this is another weakness in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister also wants to give the police more flexibility to 
carry out investigations on money laundering. This is an excellent 
initiative, but we have to go further than that. We should also consider 
parole because, beyond these gang problems, there is for instance the 
Lagana case, where the lawyer succeeded in getting him paroled after he 
had served one sixth of the sentence. The minister will have to tighten 
up the law generally and also the Parole Act so as to prevent this type 
of criminal from going on parole so soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, I will be introducing in a few minutes a bill to 
amend the Corrections and Conditional Release Act so as to make it 
clearer. 
Its purpose will be to amend section 103 of that act so that 
appointments to the National Parole Board will stop being subject to the 
political patronage they are exposed to nowadays and will instead be 
made under supervision by the people, and through the people under the 
supervision of the elected members of this House. In this way, impartial 
people will be appointed and they will have the necessary background to 
deal with this type of problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, many other efforts have to be made in the fight 
against organized crime. The government must act and it must act quickly 
to reassure the public, which is frightened. They have reasons to be 
frightened when violence reaches people in a family restaurant in a 
quiet and prosperous suburb. The government must come to realize that 
its laws and its commitment to deal with this issue are not clear.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One reality that the government does not seem to recognize is the 
fact that biker gangs, to take only this example of organized criminal 
groups, are growing, and that every day there are more and more people 
joining these gangs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois doubts that the government is willing to commit 
the necessary resources to the fight against organized crime, and we 
expect initiatives that are much more concrete than those that the 
minister is proposing today. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK12"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
annual statement on organized crime stems from Bill C-95, an act 
to amend the Criminal Code (criminal organizations), passed in 
the last session of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was tabled in response to biker gang violence in Quebec 
and involved a package of measures targeting criminal activity 
and organized crime.  It created a new offence of participation 
in a criminal organization and gave law enforcement agencies new 
powers to combat criminal activity and to confiscate the proceeds 
of organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our caucus supported passage of the bill and measures to combat 
organized crime in gang related activity.  There is nothing new 
in the minister's statement.  In fact, the bulk of the statement 
merely quotes the former solicitor general's speech in the House 
at the time of the introduction of Bill C-95 at second reading 
last April. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statement talks about the government's commitment to provide 
leadership in the fight against organized crime, while in fact in 
at least one important area the actions of this government have 
had the opposite effect.  It would appear that the government's 
privatization of our national ports and the disbandment of the 
Canada ports police has been a serious blow to the fight against 
organized crime in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's actions have resulted in a serious setback in 
the efforts to control and stop organized crime activities.  It 
is a well-known fact in the law enforcement community that 
organized crime and gang activity are thriving in our ports. Is 
it possible that the federal government's disbandment of the 
ports police and the privatization of the ports has been to open 
the doors for an increase in the very destructive activities such 
as drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, auto theft and liquor 
and tobacco smuggling that the minister referred to in his 
statement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada ports police were created in 1968 and represented a 
highly specialized and dedicated police force with skills and 
powers specifically designed to combat organized crime, smuggling 
and gang activities in the ports.  Local police and private 
security companies have neither the resources nor the expertise 
to effectively combat crime in our ports. When I spoke on Bill 
C-9 in relation to the ports police, I expressed my disgust at 
the suggestion that low price security should have their lives 
devalued by placing them in a highly criminal and violent 
atmosphere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister in his statement noted that Canada's police urge 
governments to give them the tools to do the job.  It would 
appear that in the case of the ports police the opposite is 
taking place.  Other jurisdictions in the United States and 
elsewhere which have experimented with similar privatization 
schemes for the ports and ports police have had to re-evaluate 
their actions in the face of increases in criminal activity and 
have reinstated specialized ports police to take back control of 
their ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister speculates about how one shipment of heroin landed 
successfully in Canada can lead to numerous deaths and human 
suffering in cities like Vancouver.  In fact we know that the 
drug trade in Vancouver is flourishing and has widespread impact 
in that city and across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Vancouver has experienced a serious increase in crime, gang 
activities and increased drug trafficking in the ports which many 
believe is a direct result of the privatization of the ports and 
ports police.  Numerous case files and ongoing investigations 
into organized crime and gang activity were halted or compromised 
with the removal of the Canada ports police from the Vancouver 
port. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the opposite coast in Halifax, in a few weeks the ports 
police will be disbanded.  We can be sure that organized crime is 
just waiting to fill the void.  The Hell's Angels biker gang is 
known to be active in the Halifax-Dartmouth area.  It is rumoured 
that the notorious Rock Machine bikers have recently purchased a 
bar in the area.  It is also rumoured that a California bike gang 
is currently looking for property in the area and we can be sure 
they are not coming for the balmy weather. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the privatization of our national ports this government has 
put out the welcome signs for gangs and organized crime.  It is 
putting our communities and citizens at risk. 
The minister talks about creating a seamless net against 
organized crime.  It is clear that this net has some very large 
holes.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has indicated in the House that we should be proud 
of and support the workers in the justice system.  Yet this 
minister and this government are doing the opposite.  I would 
suggest that the minister practice what he preaches, that he work 
to ensure that the concerns of the ports police and the employees 
in the penitentiary systems are addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We encourage and support this government in its fight against 
organized crime.  Yet there appears to be contradictions in its 
actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our hope that when the minister reports to Parliament 
again there will be some concrete news of success in the fight 
against organized crime and that we do not once again hear the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise today as well in response to the Solicitor 
General's first annual statement on organized crime in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this occasion to congratulate all the men 
and women of this country who are on the front lines of law 
enforcement in Canada.   We know them as police officers, peace 
officers, customs agents, crown prosecutors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must address and recognize the need and responsibility that 
we as parliamentarians have to those individuals in charging them 
with this important task of fighting crime in Canada.  They are 
the thin blue line, these men and women who walk the beat and 
patrol the neighbourhoods of Canada, and they are tasked with 
enforcing the laws that we make in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without the active support of these hard working Canadians, many 
of whom put their lives at risk time and time again, any 
government's anti-crime measures will fail and fall flat on their 
face. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The self-congratulatory tone of this report is fine but it is 
early in the game.  I remind the government that as far as this 
initiative goes, the true test will be time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel it is important to put on the record that the Progressive 
Conservative Party of Canada also had a key role in kick-starting 
the government's action against organized crime.  Contrary to the 
implications of the Solicitor General, this government's fight 
against organized crime did not simply begin under the Liberal 
government.  In fact between 1989 and 1993 the former Progressive 
Conservative government passed four major pieces of legislation 
to assist our law enforcement community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1989 the Conservative government passed proceeds of crime 
legislation for the first time in Canadian criminal law history, 
making money laundering a distinct crime.  This was done to help 
police officers trace the flow of money derived from criminal 
activities.  The former Progressive Conservative government then 
passed new proceeds of crime legislation in 1991 which required 
financial institutions to maintain detailed records of 
transactions relating to crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former government also passed legislation in 1993 with the 
passage of the Seizure of Property Management Act.  This act 
created the office of an administrator to seize and retain 
forfeited property.  More important, this legislation provided an 
incentive to organizations participating in criminal 
investigations by developing new provisions for the disposal of 
property obtained by crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final initiative I would mention by the Progressive 
Conservative government was an act to modify the Customs Act and 
the Criminal Code.  It was a far reaching omnibus bill and made 
many positive changes to the Criminal Code, in particular in the 
area of contraband products such as tobacco and alcohol. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to inject partisanship into the debate, but it is 
important that everyone realize that this government is picking 
up where previous governments left off.  I mention these 
legislative initiatives not to dwell on the past but to put in 
perspective what is going on in this process today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am nevertheless willing to extend credit where credit is due. 
The Liberal government and the Solicitor General in particular 
have taken positive steps in this area.  I commend the Solicitor 
General for recognizing that more can be done.  The Solicitor 
today used his statement to renew a commitment first made in 
response to last year's national forum on organized crime.  That 
commitment, although somewhat more vague today, was used to 
create a new financial reporting requirement regarding suspicious 
financial transactions and cross-border movement of currency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be successful, these requirements must include a very clear 
principle.  Canada must adopt the current U.S. policy that 
requires financial institutions to report all transactions which 
exceed $10,000.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the largest undefended border in the world, Canada and the 
United States share one of the largest bilateral legal trading 
relationships in the world.  Unfortunately, because of this 
border, we also share the largest bilateral illegal trading 
practice in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because Canada lacks the same tough reporting requirements of 
the United States, we are allowing our country to serve as a safe 
haven for these large criminal organizations for ill-gotten 
gains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A $10,000 reporting rule is not only my position but that of the 
party and it is the position of the solicitor general himself who 
just less than two months ago made a speech to the U.S.-Canada 
cross-border crime forum.  I would therefore urge the solicitor 
general to live up to his earlier commitments.  Instead of being 
timid and vague on the question of mandatory requirements, the 
solicitor general should be bold and straightforward and set 
clear financial transaction requirements in this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would recommend that the solicitor general review the 
definition of participation in organized crime.  The new criminal 
offence and anti-gang legislation approved by the previous 
Parliament in April of this year leaves that definition very 
vague in my opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to this definition, participation in criminal 
organizations occurs when “a person participates in or 
substantially contributes to the activity of a criminal 
organization and knows that all the members engaged or have 
engaged in an indictable offence within the preceding five years 
and when the person is a party to the commission of an offence 
indictable for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in 
association with criminal organizations”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a mouthful.  The problem with this particular wording, I 
would suggest, is that it lacks specific intent.  There is a huge 
vague definition that leaves open the issue of intent which makes 
it very difficult to prosecute.  I would suggest that this 
particular definition could be reworked and the solicitor general 
has an opportunity to do so in his upcoming round of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general also commented that arrests and seizures 
under the new anti-gang legislation are regularly making 
headlines.  Headlines are nice, but law-abiding Canadians are 
seeking concrete results and, as has been referred to earlier by 
some of my colleagues in the opposition, this is what Canadians 
are looking for the most from government and from Parliament, 
concrete results not empty rhetoric. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was also a very telling comment made by my colleague from 
the New Democratic Party about the government's apparent 
contradiction in fighting crime.  On the one hand, it has taken 
the initiative to introduce anti-gang legislation but, at the 
same time, it has taken away one of the frontline abilities that 
law enforcement officers have in this country and that is by 
disbanding the ports police.  This, by all intents and purposes, 
opens up many of Canada's ports for business in terms of illegal 
drug and gun trade.  The port of Halifax was mentioned by the 
hon. member from the New Democratic Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that people in the province of Nova Scotia are 
extremely concerned, particularly in and around metro Halifax, 
that these new organized crime organizations are going to be 
setting up shop.  With these ports now falling under the 
jurisdiction of the RCMP or metro police in the coming months, it 
is going to be very difficult for them to combat crime in a 
substantive way when we already have a specialized force in the 
ports police who are charged solely with that task. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I would reiterate my earlier remarks.  Laws are not the 
only answer.  In fact, creating laws without accounting for 
adequate resources to properly implement and enforce these laws 
can be very dangerous.  I would cross reference again the fact 
that there has been legislation introduced that is going to 
charge customs officers with more onerous tasks and a more 
proactive attempt to have them fight crime at the border. 
However, we do not yet know if adequate resources and training 
are going to be put in place as well to help them implement and 
enforce these new pieces of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the solicitor general's statement, we heard that the 
government has been creating partnerships between local, 
provincial, national and international law enforcement agencies. 
We have also heard about existing resources to fight crime.  I am 
very much aware of the situation that is going on in New 
Brunswick presently between the Moncton municipal police and the 
RCMP who are imposing their particular services in place of the 
municipal police.  This is a situation that I suggest the 
government has been very lax in addressing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support the government's efforts in bringing about various 
elements of our criminal justice system to fight organized crime. 
I do so wholeheartedly, but the government must not, however, use 
the co-operative partnerships as an excuse to withhold the 
necessary resources. That is not just my opinion.  It is the 
opinion of many local police officers across the country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The police chief in London, Ontario summed this up perfectly 
when he stated last month “Just because we now have a law, that 
does not realize anything unless we have the programs which mean 
resources for police and enhanced training.  Laws for the sake of 
laws mean nothing.  They are just more paper”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, this is the impression that many law enforcement 
officers and I would suggest many Canadians have when we have 
legislation put through Parliament and the resources to see that 
it is enforced are not there to support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I thank the solicitor general for his statement. 
I would reinforce my comments with four main points. One, let us 
not forget the foundation upon which this present government is 
acting by developing policies and legislation with respect to 
organized crime.  Let us work to build upon it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the solicitor general needs to commit to a 
straightforward, mandatory reporting requirement for financial 
transactions which will correspond with our biggest trading 
partner, the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the solicitor general needs to clarify the definition of 
a criminal organization to better establish the principle of 
intent so that prosecutions can be successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, the government should provide necessary programs and 
training through additional funds if necessary to help police and 
all law enforcement officers to properly implement and enforce 
this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hoping that we are not going to hear more 
self-congratulatory statements from the solicitor general.  We 
must work toward concrete examples of crime reduction so that 
Canadians will be satisfied that this Parliament and our 
enforcement officers are doing their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very supportive of the government in its efforts, but let 
us not just give lip service to this serious matter.  Let us see 
that the right thing happens and that we can actually report back 
in a year's time that these initiatives have been successful.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK33">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from November 26 consideration of Bill C-2, an 
act to establish the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and to amend 
the Canada Pension Plan and the Old Age Security Act and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts, as reported (with amendment) 
from the committee; and of Motion No. 8. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, we are 
resuming debate on Motion No. 8, tabled by the Conservative 
member for Madawaska—Restigouche. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What he is saying in this particular motion is that the 
regulations made under paragraph 1(b) must reflect the objectives 
of the board as set out in section 5. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something which appears to be highly technical.  He is 
talking here, of course, about the investment board of the Canada 
pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to have a radically new departure from the Canada 
pension plan when this legislation is passed through the House, 
through the Senate and receives royal assent in a matter of a few 
weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently the Canada pension plan has, roughly, a two year 
contingency fund of about $40 billion.  That $40 billion fund is 
now being loaned to the provinces at federal government long bond 
rates, which are the cheapest rates for long term debt.  That has 
been very positive for a number of provinces in the country, 
including my own province of Saskatchewan which a while ago was 
going through a difficult financial time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has also been very helpful for Manitoba, which at times has 
not had a very positive credit rating.  As well, it has been 
helpful to the provinces of Atlantic Canada, particularly 
Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That has actually been a pretty good part of the Canada pension 
plan.  The provinces have borrowed to build schools, hospitals 
and infrastructure to make a stronger province and a stronger 
country.  That is what the fund is used for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there will be a change.  Instead of having about two 
years of funding set aside, in a few years there will be five or 
six years of funding set aside through the establishment of an 
investment fund.  In a few years that investment fund will grow 
to over $136 billion.  The fund will invest in the market, 
similar to the way in which private pension funds are invested. A 
board will be established.  That board will have regulations, 
objectives and goals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our concern is that we think the goals and objectives of the 
fund will be too narrowly defined.  I do not support this 
amendment today because it reasserts support for that narrow 
definition of the objectives of the fund.  We believe that the 
fund should have more broadly defined objectives, similar to the 
Caisse de dépot et placement in Quebec. Its objectives not only 
speak to the return to the eventual pensioner but also talk about 
some of the social objectives in terms of Quebec society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It looks at things like creating jobs in the province of Quebec, 
investing in Quebec industries, building a stronger economy in 
the province of Quebec, and so on. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's Caisse de dépôt et placement has served Quebeckers well 
over the past 60 years. The province's economy is now stronger, partly 
because of this fund available to Quebeckers.

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The economy gradually became stronger and unemployment diminished, 
thanks to the Caisse de dépôt et placement, whose objectives were 
broader and more encompassing, and whose vision was more positive. In 
fact, the vision was not at all the same in the federal fund for the 
rest of Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a vision here that is more narrow.  It talks only about 
maximizing the returns to the people who are making the 
contribution to the fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to maximize returns but we need some balance as 
well.  I think about jobs in Canada, creating more jobs.  That is 
very important, investing in Canadian industry, in Canadian 
business.  There are a lot of very profitable businesses in this 
country which, if they had access to more funding, major pension 
funds, might do even better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noticed in the House yesterday that we were criticized. Indeed 
the Bloc Quebecois was also criticized for talking about 
doctrinaire investment.  We are not talking about doctrinaire 
investment.  We are talking about an investment fund that has a 
similar objective to the Caisse de dépots et placements in the 
province of Quebec.  That is not what I would call doctrinaire 
investment. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a fund which was supported not only by the Bloc Quebecois. 
Long before the Bloc Quebecois, the Liberal Party was in office in 
Quebec, with Mr. Lesage, who had previously sat here as an MP if I am 
not mistaken. The Liberals were followed by the Union nationale, which 
was a conservative party quite similar to the federal one. The Union 
nationale also supported the Quebec fund and its objectives. Then came 
Mr. Bourassa and the Liberal Party again. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think what is happening in Quebec in terms of the fund's 
objectives is very laudable, very positive and could serve as a 
model in terms of this particular investment fund.  The concern 
we have is that the objectives are too narrowly defined, looking 
solely at the maximization of the return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My prediction is that it is not going to be very long before the 
Minister of Finance will succumb to pressure from the investment 
community to lift the rule that says only 20% of the funds can be 
invested outside this country.  I have asked that question to the 
Minister of Finance. He said for the time being we are not going 
to change the rules. He has always left that door open, that in 
the future those rules may be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe they will because this will be the biggest investment 
fund in the country.  There will be pressure from other funds as 
well to lift the rules so that more money can be invested out of 
the country.  I think that is going the wrong way.  This is the 
Canadians' money.  It is Canadian workers' money.  It is money 
from Canadian business, from small business, from the employers 
and the employees and most of those funds should be invested 
right here in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a great deal of respect to my colleague of the Conservative 
Party from New Brunswick, I cannot support the motion before the 
House today because I think it just reinforces the narrowness of 
the objectives and goals of that board of directors. The board of 
directors, I believe, will be lopsided in terms of who it 
represents.  It will represent mainly the business community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We moved an amendment in committee that would have a balance in 
terms of the board of directors between the two stakeholders, 
between labour and business.  That amendment I moved in committee 
was supported by the Reform Party, the Bloc Quebecois, the 
Conservative Party, the four opposition parties, but the 
government across the way would not accept that very reasonable 
amendment that there should be balance on the board of directors 
between business and labour to stakeholders. If we do not have 
that balance and if we have narrow objectives in terms of what 
the board should do, then I am even more concerned about the use 
of the money of the working people of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is bizarre that we have a Parliament now where the Liberal 
Party represents only 38% of the Canadian people and the 
opposition parties represent 62% of the Canadian people, as of 
the results on June 2.  Yet the government has refused to accept 
even a single opposition amendment at the committee stage and 
appears unwilling to accept even a single opposition amendment 
here at report stage.  Is that parliamentary democracy?

</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not expect all the amendments to be carried or accepted, 
but surely to goodness some of them could be accepted.  They have 
been suggested by business groups before the committee.  They 
have been suggested by social action groups before the committee. 
They have been suggested by trade union groups before the 
committee.  They are reasonable amendments.  Some of the 
amendments would not need the approval of the provinces yet they 
have been turned down.  They have fallen on deaf ears. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one reason we need a serious effort at looking at 
democratic reform so that the people's wishes can be expressed 
and accurately reflected in the House of Commons.  It is ironic 
that 38% of the people can elect a majority government and that 
majority government does not listen to the representatives of 62% 
of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still have some time left.  The parliamentary secretary is 
sitting across the way.  I once in a while see his head nod but 
that is about all I see.  I hope he will be more receptive and 
will consider some of the amendments, in particular amendments 
where we have a three or four party consensus on this side of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment is obviously not one where we have consensus.  I 
think two opposition parties support this amendment and two 
opposition parties oppose it.  Maybe this reflects a difference 
between social democrats and conservative ideology, but on many 
amendments there is four party consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why can the government not listen to the people and reflect the 
wishes of the people by accepting some amendments that are 
reasonable?  I do not know whether the rules permit, but I would 
like to have a response from the parliamentary secretary or from 
the gentleman on my left who has been very active in the 
committee on whether or not they might accept some of the 
amendments.  I will wind up by asking them to be reasonable and 
to accept a few of the opposition amendments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I want to comment briefly on a couple of the points raised by the 
hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance committee considered a number of amendments, but the 
member will well know that amendments dealt with in committee can 
also be dealt with in the House, so many of the amendments of 
substance are coming forward at report stage.  The member will 
also know that amendments are being proposed which the government 
is supporting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make sure members understand a couple of the points 
the member raised.  He indicated that the funding would move to 
fuller funding, from two years of reserve up to five years, to 
accumulate a fund which can be used by the CPP investment board. 
The disagreement in this regard has to do with the application of 
those funds.  I understand the member and the NDP would like to 
have these funds directed at certain programs for economic 
stimulus and the like. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot lose sight of the purpose of the investment board.  We 
are talking about the Canada pension plan.  Its objective is to 
provide a safe and secure indexed pension for Canadians and to 
keep the rate of the CPP as low as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objectives have been ratified as a result of public 
consultation.  They have been agreed upon with the majority of 
the provinces, at least two-thirds of the provinces representing 
two-thirds of the population of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of where moneys could be invested did come up.  There 
was a strong consensus, certainly in the consultation, that the 
funds should not be used for other purposes, for other government 
objectives such as regional economic development or something 
like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the fund is invested according to prudent investment 
practices, it will earn a better return than it is getting now. 
As a result the rates of premium will be kept at a lower rate 
than they otherwise would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was very clear from all experts that came before us that we 
should not compromise the principal objective of the Canada 
pension plan with regard to either other ancillary benefits or 
with regard to other government social or economic objectives. 
We had to make it clear that the CPP was there to ensure 
Canadians had a cost effective, reliable and sustainable Canada 
pension plan.

principles of the 20% rule apply to all pension plans and to 
RRSPs.  They apply also to the Canada pension plan.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The interesting thing about the Canada pension fund today is 
that the two year reserve, which is around the $40 billion mark, 
can be borrowed by provincial governments at the federal 
government long term bond rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the last 30 years, the federal government's long 
term bond rate has been a pretty good deal for a number of 
provinces.  Over the last while many of them have not had the 
same credit rating as the federal government because of economic 
difficulties or their sheer size. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am joined in the House this morning by my friend from New 
Brunswick.  Over the years New Brunswick has a rather high 
unemployment rate as a small province with a small population. 
Its credit rating has probably always been lower than the federal 
government's credit rating.  Therefore it is more expensive for 
the province of New Brunswick to borrow money for its schools, 
hospitals and universities other than from the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One goal of the Canada pension plan was to set aside its reserve 
for about two years and to allow the provinces to borrow moneys 
from it at the federal government rate. That made it cheaper for 
the province of New Brunswick to build schools, hospitals and 
universities.  It could borrow money from the fund at a lower 
interest rate than if the fund had not been there.  The federal 
government bond rate was at a lower rate of interest than New 
Brunswick could borrow money elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing was true in my province of Saskatchewan.  It has 
been very helpful in terms of the infrastructure we have built in 
our province over the years. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was also true for the province of Manitoba, the Atlantic 
provinces, not just New Brunswick, but Newfoundland, Prince Edward 
Island and Nova Scotia too, as well as every other Canadian 
province.  It is a good thing, a positive thing.  I recall very 
well—I heard the debates in the 1960s—that it was in 1966 
that this bill became reality in Canada.  It was under the Liberal 
Prime Minister, Lester B. Pearson. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberal Prime Minister Lester Pearson, in a minority parliament 
in those days, supported particularly by the NDP, people like 
Tommy Douglas and David Lewis, brought the country the pension 
plan.  One of its objectives was to provide the fund at lower 
interest rate to the provinces so they could build their 
infrastructures, become stronger provinces and build stronger 
economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that will disappear.  That is one of the changes in the CPP 
legislation that I am personally very concerned about.  Now every 
province will be on its own.  That may not be a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alberta has a very strong and robust economy and a very good 
credit rating today.  It will be a problem for Newfoundland that 
does not have a good credit rating.  It will be more expensive 
for Newfoundland to go to the market for long term debt to build 
a university or to build the infrastructure than it will be for 
Ralph Klein in the province of Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is worried about national unity, about 
building a strong federation and about doing some things at the 
federal level that help all Canadians regardless of where they 
live, surely to goodness this is one part of the bill that should 
be changed by the federal government across the way.  If we are 
looking at equality for all our citizens and at equality of 
opportunity or condition for all our citizens, surely to goodness 
this is one of the changes the government should look at in terms 
of the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons the governments of B.C. and Saskatchewan did 
not agree to the changes in the CPP was that it set up a 
balkanized Canada in terms of interest rates.  It seems to be 
very bizarre that a so-called Liberal government would do this. 
Now provinces will be at the mercy of bond rating agencies like 
Moody's of New York.  They will determine how much the taxpayers 
in Manitoba, New Brunswick or Newfoundland have to pay when they 
borrow money to build a project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will be at the mercy of Moody's or other bond rating 
agencies such as the Dominion Bond Rating Service.  The bond 
rating agencies will fly into a province with their books and 
their own technocrats and sit down to determine at what rate of 
interest the provinces can borrow money.   That decision is out 
of our hands as parliamentarians. 
It is out of our hands and in the hands of a few foreign bankers 
and bond raters. It does not matter what political party is in 
power, we are at the mercy of these people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know how important it was in Saskatchewan a few years ago when 
the province was in great debt and suffering from a humungous 
deficit.  The bond rating companies had the province on the verge 
of bankruptcy.  We are at the mercy of these New York bankers. 
They set the rates. What has happened in the last few years is 
that the province has recovered.  It has a balanced budget, the 
debt is going down and the credit rating is going up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can a Liberal government put the provinces at the mercy of 
these speculators from New York and elsewhere?  That is exactly 
what is happening in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our amendment today is restoring to the Canada pension plan the 
same provisions that have existed since 1966 that will allow the 
provinces to borrow from the fund at the federal government's 
long term rate. The federal government's long term rate is a rate 
that is attractive because the federal government is large, it is 
credible, it has a good credit rating.  It is the economy of the 
whole country that is supporting this credit rating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is only fair that the federal government accept this 
amendment.  Accept the wisdom of a Lester Pearson, accept the 
wisdom of a Paul Martin, Sr. when they had a vision of trying to 
build a co-operative federalism where Canadians were equal and 
had equality of condition whether they lived in New Brunswick, 
Newfoundland, Quebec or Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is that Liberal vision of old that wanted to offer this 
equal opportunity right across the country?  Why is it the new 
Liberalism in this country has the vision of a Brian Mulroney or 
the Leader of the Opposition where it is dog eat dog?  Why is 
that happening? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do know there are many Liberal backbenchers who are very 
uncomfortable with this new very conservative model of 
Liberalism.  In fact somebody said that we have probably the most 
conservative government now in the history of the country sitting 
across the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Brian Mulroney did not try to do this.  Brian Mulroney did not 
try this when he was Prime Minister of this country.  If he had, 
the Liberal Party would have been up in arms.  The rat pack would 
have been up in arms in this House. It would have denounced that 
government as right wing extremists and sellouts, balkanizing the 
country, a supermarket of Canadians where Canadians are different 
classes in different parts of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the Liberals are in power. Now the sons and daughters 
politically of the Liberals of old, of the Pearsons and the 
Martins and the Pickersgills of old are changing that Liberal 
vision that talked about equality of condition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is a fundamental amendment to a fundamental part of 
the bill.  I wish we had the independence and the freedom in this 
country where parliamentarians on the government side could get 
up and speak their minds and vote freely and independently and 
accept some of the amendments being put forth by members of this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are getting cynical of this whole process.  They get 
cynical when they see this kind of thing happening.  They get 
cynical when they see this kind of radical departure and change 
and not so much as a peep from the Liberal members sitting 
opposite. Not so much as a peep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know how concerned everybody is about national unity and 
keeping this country together and creating equality of condition. 
Equality of opportunity is supposed to be a great principle of 
Liberalism in Canada.  Can the Liberals explain why they are 
going to treat a Newfoundlander different from an Albertan? Why 
they are going to treat an Ontarian different from somebody from 
New Brunswick?  Why they will treat a Manitoban different from 
someone in British Columbia? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are going to have the balkanization of this country in terms 
of lending rates.  That is not fair.  That is not just.  That is 
not equality.  That is not the kind of vision of a country I want 
to build. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the province of Quebec with the Caisse de dépôt et placement 
du Québec there are not different lending rates for different 
regions. There is one lending rate right across the province of 
Quebec for their particular fund and their particular investment 
board and agency. This will not be the case now in the rest of 
the country.  This will not be the case at all.  That concerns me 
as a Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were Brian Tobin, the premier in Newfoundland, I would be 
up in arms denouncing the Minister of Finance and the minister of 
human resources for saddling him with a regime that will make it 
more expensive for him to borrow money for his schools and his 
hospitals than for Ralph Klein in the province of Alberta.

Speaker, I have listened very carefully to the hon. member's 
comments on this bill and the amendment he is bringing forward on 
preferential loan rates to provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Canadians are telling us that they are looking for 
people to manage their money. Over the past 20 years we have been 
lending money to provinces at a preferred lending rate, but where 
are we today?  There is a shortfall of $600 billion in the fund. 
I do not think that Canadians were looking for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to provide Canadians with the best bang for their 
dollar. They are looking for maximum returns, guarantees that the 
CPP will no longer be affected.  They are looking to have a 
Canada pension plan in 20 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also heard the hon. member talk about New Brunswick and how 
this would help to create jobs.  I will say that for 20 years we 
have been lending money to provinces at a preferred rate and the 
unemployment rate is still very high. I do not believe the status 
quo would work. There are other vehicles to create employment in 
New Brunswick.  The way to do that is by electing a Conservative 
government in the next election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking today about saving the CPP. The hon. member 
mentioned keeping the status quo.  Well today there is a $600 
billion shortfall in the CPP fund. Imagine if the NDP were the 
government today and passed this type of bill.  Maybe in 20 years 
the CPP fund would be a trillion dollars in the red. That is 
scary.  I hope that Canadians can see exactly what is going on 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that for my investment, my money, I want the best bang

talking about this radical amendment. This is the same approach 
that Brian Mulroney and the Conservative Party favoured over the 
years. They suggested keeping this particular fund for the 
provinces.  That is what is wrong with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé:</B> Madam Speaker, if I can continue, this is 
1997, not 1966. Canadians are looking for good management and 
that is what we are proposing.  We are proposing to secure the

little of the background in our province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am saddened to see my colleague rise and say that, if the 
New Democrats were in office, the problem would be worse in ten 
years than it is now.  I can tell you that all the poverty we are

</I></B></P><P align=left>They were followed by the Liberals, the opposition back then, 
who said “Elect us and we will do better”.  We have never been in 
such bad shape as we are now.  It is all very fine and well to take 
the tack they are taking, to speak about the economy and how to 
invest money and reap the benefits, but I can guarantee you Canada 
never saw as many hungry children as it did under those two 
governments.  It was because of those governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it really sad that, today, someone from my region, my 
colleague the hon. member, cannot grasp the fact that families are 
living in such poverty and that the Canada pension plan, with all 
the money that goes into it, plays no part in getting the economy 
moving again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that the Conservatives and the Liberals have 
simply taken money and given it to their friends, the major 
corporations, in $100 million and $400 million chunks.  This is why 
our economy is in such a sorry state today.  There is too much 
patronage, that is the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberal and Conservative members make me think of employment 
centres.  There are the employees and the poor people that have to 
go to see them about jobs, and if they are not Liberals or 
Conservatives, they do not get a job.  This is why Canada is so far 
in the hole.  This is why Atlantic Canada is always impoverished. 
Governments have never carried out their responsibilities in the 
Atlantic provinces. 
They talk about national unity, but the day Canada considers all 
the provinces in the country, fewer children in the Atlantic 
provinces will suffer.  I am ashamed of the previous speaker. 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, on reading the NDP amendment, the deep 
feelings behind it are quite understandable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It can be seen that in the past many regions of Canada have 
indeed been the victims of decisions by the central government.  It 
must be kept in mind that the text that existed in 1964 was part of 
a kind of a deal to have the Canadian economy centred in Ontario, 
with transfer payments and employment insurance to give the 
peripheral regions a top-up income to allow them to survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One important mandate was lost sight of at that time, however, 
that a supplementary income was not the only thing needed; regional 
economies also had to be diversified. 
The regions—although I speak for eastern Quebec, I think the same 
applies to the maritimes—have long respected this agreement, 
saying that industrialization and all the manufacturing sector 
would be mostly located in Ontario and the natural resources sector 
would be more in the eastern provinces and Quebec, but there was no 
change in the regional economy so that we would not just cut down 
the trees but also process them in our regions, not only catch the 
fish, but also have the fish plants in our regions.  In short, 
there was no worthwhile diversification of the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be kept in mind that, at the end of the 19th century, 
the maritime provinces were self-sufficient and the state of 
dependency we have today was created and perpetuated by the 
systemic implementation of federal government policies, 
particularly during the Trudeau years. 
So, as I said, we can certainly understand the deep feelings behind this 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, on the eve of the 21st century, the amendment before us is 
not necessarily the solution to revitalize regional economies. Nowadays, 
the provinces can get fairly easy access to credit. They can get money 
from various sources and use the pension fund in compliance with the 
stated purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that the Canada pension plan is the fund that has 
had just about the lowest rate of return over the last 35 years. 
Compared to the Régie des rentes du Québec—and this is partly because 
of the investments made by the Caisse de dépôt et placement—the 
Canadian plan is way behind and does not perform nearly as well as the 
Régie des rentes du Québec and its investment instrument, the Caisse de 
dépôt et placement.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, the bill seeks to correct a situation whereby the pension fund 
may no longer be self-sufficient and may no longer provide the funds 
necessary for future generations. Many of the amendments to the current 
act are based on the Quebec experience. I was told that federal public 
servants travelled to Quebec City to look at how the Caisse de dépôt et 
placement and the Régime de rentes du Québec worked. They looked at why 
the RRQ provided better control than the CPP over areas such as 
disability claims. They concluded that our system worked and that they 
should try to implement a similar plan in Ottawa and get it to work as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the bill before us will lead to such results. 
Let us bear in mind that, given the opportunity to go about doing things 
differently, in an original way, Quebec can make an outstanding 
contribution and demonstrate, with concrete results, that Quebeckers 
have all it takes to take the necessary and appropriate steps to promote 
their development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, regarding the amendment under consideration, which seeks to 
give some sort of preferential rate to provincial governments that need 
money and borrow from the Canada pension plan fund, the solution may be 
to give the regions the opportunity to develop adequate infrastructures 
to ensure the most appropriate free trade possible. Since the free trade 
agreements were signed, some industries have expanded and Quebec 
certainly came out a winner in this respect. 
Safeguards will also be required to ensure that environmental 
regulations and labour laws are respected, but it will nevertheless be 
possible to diversify our economies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a tool available that would be much more efficient than an 
preferential interest rate and that is a federal government procurement 
policy based on the regions. If in evaluating its procurement contracts 
with suppliers, the federal government was accountable to the House of 
Commons and to the people of Quebec and Canada for not concentrating its 
expenditures in Ontario, without necessarily distributing expenditures 
among all regions, that would be the beginning of a solution. 
The federal government's performance will have to be assessed on the 
basis of whether or not transfer payments are maintained, because there 
is no doubt that some action is required in that area, that some 
distribution of wealth is required, but in addition to transfer 
payments, there should be decentralization of procurement to the regions 
so that each region can create an appropriate number of jobs depending 
on its population. There is nothing of the sort in the government's plan 
of action right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be much more in favour of questioning this government on 
all its actions, and it does not seems to me that giving the provinces 
a preferential rate on loans from the Canada pension fund is the best 
solution because, at the same time, the public will demand that the fund 
finally become cost-effective after 30 years of going about it the wrong 
way, after discovering that it was not successfully replenished, it 
would be a grave mistake not to let this fund produce the best results 
possible. 
And I believe that today the provinces have other opportunities to 
borrow. There are various markets opened to them. They are not all the 
same economically, that is true, but if this approach had already 
produced over the past years what we are looking for, we would not have 
to be discussing it today. So it did not help achieve what was being 
aimed at. The result has been that basically the provinces were not 
encouraged to look for investments with capital that may not come from 
the federal government or from the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons, we will vote against the proposed amendment, 
although we are well aware of the fact that many changes should be made 
in the way the federal government helps the regions and the provinces. 
The best way to do that is to restore the transfer payments that were 
withdrawn four years ago, instead of trying to design new programs for 
youth or for any other group, such as the disabled or other groups. It 
is of course very appropriate that assistance be provided to these 
groups.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But we should have more confidence in the ability of the provinces 
and of the professionals in these areas to address these issues. We 
should give back the money that was taken away because of cuts over the 
past four or five years, and I am sure there would be a much greater 
positive effect than by letting the provinces borrow from the Canada 
pension plan at a preferential rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having assessed this whole situation, we feel that this amendment 
should not be allowed. It is contrary to the general scheme of the act, 
which is not the same as the one passed during the sixties. We have 
learned that there is less money coming in than expected to finance the 
plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such an approach could have the following undesired effect: if we 
allow the provinces to borrow at a preferential rate, who will be paying 
the cost of such a preferential rate? Will it be future generations, the 
young people who will have to finance the program, by increasing their 
contributions over the next 10, 15 or 20 years? It is absolutely 
essential that the act, and the scheme of the act ensure a better 
intergenerational balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we should avoid adding amendments that would not help 
achieve that objective.

like to comment on the comments of the hon. member from the NDP 
that we are seeing more and more poorer Canadians and poorer 
children. I think a distinction has to be made here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are talking about is preventing poorer and poorer senior 
citizens in this country. That is the concern that we have. 
Lending money to provinces at preferential or lower interest 
rates is not what we are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to ensure that there is a solid fund that will provide 
for Canadians who are planning for their retirement.  We see the 
reason why there is a $600 billion shortfall in the CPP system. 
It is partly because these funds were loaned to the provinces at 
far too low interest rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to see a solid fund that is going to provide a regular 
income for retired citizens in a way that basically gives the 
people what they deserve and not having younger people paying 
exorbitant amounts for this.

one.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I would like to speak in favour of the opportunity for provinces 
to have access.  I think previous members speaking in opposition 
to this do not realize that economic indicators are major cycles. 
Some day their riding or their province may realize a downturn, 
something that Hong Kong, Taiwan or Korea as state nations in the 
Pacific Rim are realizing.  Their national interests have closed 
the door on them to be able to build much needed infrastructures 
like schools, hospitals, water and sewer facilities for the 
health and well-being of their communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these major needs are prevalent in my region.  I look at a 
region in northern Saskatchewan.  We do not have big banks.  We 
cannot walk down the street, then play golf with the local banker 
and hopefully get a few million dollars to build our next major 
infrastructure to create an economic cycle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still have the remnants of the Hudson's Bay Company.  They 
took the profits and left nothing.  There is no Hudson's Bay 
hospital, school or highway.  These guys took the profits and 
ran. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here a government finally has a fund that is available from our 
pensions and then members want to close the door to allowing us 
to access our own investment for our children, our communities 
and for the betterment of our entire country. 
They are willing to close this door without knowing what our 
economic future is going to be like.

are at the poverty level, the unemployed and the people who do 
not have huge bank accounts.  We do not even have major banks in 
some of these regions.  Having a bank teller is basically a way 
of accessing one's bank account.  However, if one has nothing to 
put in it then one is in trouble. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Territorial governments have been borrowing from the provinces. 
They do not seem to have access to this investment fund unless 
the provinces do it on their behalf.  The government is closing 
the door on the whole territorial region that is at the 
developmental stage.  Some of these regions that the hon. members 
who are speaking represent have had their opportunity for 
development and now they are closing it on the underprivileged or 
underdeveloped areas of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I carefully ask for the government to take its time on this 
whole issue of investment of pension funds and access by 
provincial governments at a federal rate as opposed to a 
marketable rate.  If a province's rating by Moody's has been 
classified high the interest rate will be high.  We may run into 
trouble in the future and maybe our grandchildren will run into 
trouble in the future and the door has been closed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask for support for this amendment to keep the opportunities 
for these provinces to have access if they need it.  It does not 
necessarily mean they are always going to line up and take it

people of Canada. 
The amendment our caucus is supporting is a clause that has 
been part of the Canada pension plan since its inception in 1966.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When I listen to the comments of the member from the far right 
on this being a devastating affect, putting the Canada pension 
plan way under, that people of Canada want to see their money 
invested strictly for profit, I suggest that the provinces being 
able to access the Canada pension fund for investment to ensure 
they can continue is an investment and is profitable. It might 
not be a buck we can hand back and forth, run to the store with 
or down the street, whatever our little hearts desire, but it is 
profitable.  It is an investment in the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised at the comments coming from that member. His 
party left in Saskatchewan one of the most devastating results of 
a government that so blatantly abused its power.  I am surprised 
that the present government did not have to borrow from this fund 
to secure the locks on the jails of Saskatchewan because of that 
situation.  It was able to borrow from this fund and is very 
credible in its approach to getting out of the mess that 
government put us in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As someone who grew up in Saskatchewan I would go back from 
Manitoba year after year while that government was in place and 
watch my home province go down and down and down.  It literally 
tore me apart.  I have such pride in seeing the results of the 
present government and knowing that this amendment, this 
proposal, was the result of being able to see that province come 
back life. For someone to suggest that it is not important, that 
it is not a profitable investment, is absolutely disgraceful. 
<P><A NAME="LINK47"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my intervention will not be long but I have been 
carefully listening to the interventions from our NDP colleagues 
with respect to this proposed amendment.  Unless I heard it 
incorrectly, from the very mouth of the last speaker comes the 
reason why the amendment should not be supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She is talking about giving, as I understood, the opportunity 
for the provinces to dip into this fund and use the money for 
what they think is right, if I understand the amendment 
correctly. Yet in the very next sentence she points out the 
irresponsible behaviour of a certain province during the regime 
of a certain government.  There is nothing in the future to 
prevent other irresponsible governments in other provinces from 
doing things that might be irresponsible with the CPP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems that what Canadians want is to make sure that the 
Canada pension plan is there when they retire and to make sure 
that when they retire they will receive an appropriate pension, 
being one of the three pillars we are trying to get Canadians to 
appreciate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to do that we want to make sure that the fund is 
invested in the most prudent and most efficient way to ensure 
profitability, not for the sake of profitability but for the sake 
of ensuring that those people who are retired can count on the 
Canada pension plan.  One of the ways we want to do that is to 
make sure that the investments are invested in a prudent, 
financially secure manner.  If we are going to leave it 
willy-nilly to governments that may or may not be good or bad 
from time to time, it seems to me that in itself is 
irresponsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is the intent of the NDP amendment I certainly cannot 
support it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, one thing all of us in the House need to be absolutely 
clear on is that this is not politicians' money.  I hope my 
colleagues in the NDP realize that.  This money belongs to the 
people of Canada.  They work hard for it and they want to retire 
on it with some security. They do not want it to be played with 
for political purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the Canada pension plan in such a mess?  Why do we owe 
$600 billion when there is not a nickel anywhere to pay it?  It 
is because of philosophies like this, that somehow we can use 
this money, we can play with it, we can benefit from it and there 
will be no price to pay down the road. There is a price to be 
paid.  It will be paid by our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unbelievably, we have a party which is arguing passionately in 
favour of continuing to repeat the mistakes of the past.  I hope 
there is not one more member of the House who would support such 
nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada pension plan represents a second national debt.  We 
have to do everything we can to pay off that debt.  It is a 
disgrace.  It represents a real threat to the security of our 
future and to the well-being of our children. Yet we have a 
group of people saying let us continue to use this money to 
bail ourselves out when we get in a jam.  Let us continue to use 
this money with a lower rate of return.  The people who 
entrusted us with this money could get a better rate of return 
under prudent management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of philosophy has failed us miserably in the past. One 
of my gravest concerns about this whole scheme is that we are 
going to create a huge investment fund, with billions and 
billions of dollars in it, and we are going to have politicians 
like these saying we need to do this, that this is a different 
kind of investment, that maybe we will not get as much money out 
of it but, boy, it is really important that we make these kinds 
of investments.  It is an investment for the future. Maybe we 
will not get a good return on it, but it is an important 
investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not our money to play with.  This is money which has 
been entrusted to us by hardworking Canadians who hope to retire 
on it.  We had better give them the very best management we can 
possibly give them and forget about all the other nice things we 
could do with this money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish we had unlimited money.  I can think of at least a 
hundred things that I would do tomorrow if I had an unlimited pot 
of cash, things that would help a lot of people.  But this money 
does not belong to the politicians and it should not be treated 
that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very concerned about the political risk that is being posed 
to our hard earned retirement investment before it even gets 
going.  I wonder as a middle-aged Canadian whether this kind of 
thinking will be the death of my retirement hopes and those of my 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone has to pay.  If money is loaned at low rates, someone 
has to make up the difference.  There is no way around it.  It 
will have to be made up by paying the extra money which should 
have been earned or it will be made up by receiving lower 
benefits because the maximum return was not earned.  Yes, all 
these nice things are being done but that does not give us a 
secure retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not support amendments to a bill which would in any way, 
shape or form suggest that this money belongs to the politicians. 
The money belongs to the people.  It is their retirement fund. 
They had better get the best, most secure retirement they can 
possibly get or there will be big trouble in the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, just to pick up on the comments 
of my colleague who was just up speaking and addressing this 
House, the motion is clearly inconsistent with the public's wish 
to stop the practice of lending CPP funds to the provinces at 
below their own market rates of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to the report on the Canada pension plan consultation 
that was put out in June 1996.  It says that there was widespread 
support across the country for achieving a higher rate of return 
by investing CPP funds in market securities. Participants said a 
higher rate of return on investment is a prerequisite for the 
changes to the benefits and contributions. Without it the 
rationale for fuller funding disappears.  There was agreement 
that the inevitable increases in contribution rates must be kept 
in check through diversified investments that will earn a higher 
rate of return. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is reflective of what Canadians have said throughout 
consultations.  The NDP this morning consistently gets up and 
talks about how any of the changes that are put forward with 
respect to Bill C-2 are not progressive enough or are not 
reflecting what Canadians are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I offer to this House the opportunity to put aside the rhetoric 
the member for Qu'Appelle has put forward this morning, and some 
of the other members of the NDP, and look at the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talk about the reasons why British Columbia and 
Saskatchewan did not sign on to this agreement.  Let us be quite 
clear that during the consultations both those provinces never 
said that provincial access to funds was an issue.  They had 
other issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>British Columbia put forward toward the latter part of the 
consultations and the negotiations between the province and the 
federal government the proposal to expand coverage up the income 
scale to $50,000 or $55,000 from where it is with the present 
plan.  That is fair enough, but it also needs to be stated that 
particular issue is on track two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The discussion with respect to that proposal from British 
Columbia will be reviewed on track two when the provinces and the 
federal government come together once again to review the Canada 
pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were no issues related to the investment board or the 
investment board principles.  In fact, both those provinces 
signed on to the information paper that included the investment 
board principles.  The investment board principles stated quite 
clearly that it will perform its function in the best interest of 
the plan members.  The best interest of the plan members is an 
attempt to receive the best rate of return, and the best rate of 
return is not achieved if we have this motion go forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces agreed that the CPP fund should be invested in the 
best interest of the plan member, just like other pension funds. 
I think it is important to emphasize like other pension funds. 
Another member of the NDP was up earlier this morning talking 
about the limited access to the funds.  The regulations included 
in Bill C-2 quite clearly state that the bill guarantees 
provincial access to funds at market rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a transition period.  It was part of the negotiation. 
The provinces wanted to ensure the amendments to the Canada 
pension plan provided the opportunity for the provinces to 
continue to receive access to those funds, and Bill C-2 does that 
while at the same time providing the highest possible rate of 
return to the plan members by ensuring the provinces are able to 
have access to those provincial moneys at market rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to state that this morning we heard the NDP get up 
and say that the amendments are not progressive enough with 
respect to Bill C-2.  Yet here we have a motion that continues to 
put forward the status quo.  Let's not change it.  What they are 
doing is mixing all kinds of different motivations for these 
changes.  They talk about regional development.  They talk about 
labour participating and different types of initiatives.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regional economic development is an issue that is being dealt 
with outside the Canada pension plan.  Canadians have said 
unequivocally that they want the pension plan to survive.  As my 
colleague from the Reform Party stated quite clearly, it is 
Canadians' money.  They are asking for the highest rate of return 
with prudent management and investment of the money.  That is 
what we are doing.  This motion would not speak to the concerns 
of Canadians or support what they want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be quite clear that nothing would put benefits at risk in 
the long run more than the failure to deal with the fiscal 
realities of the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The higher rate of return the actuary has indicated the plan 
will receive speaks to the contribution level.  If we take away 
provisions from the bill that do not allow the board to achieve 
the highest possible rate of return in a prudent fashion, which 
reflects what Canadians have said then, as my hon. colleague from 
the Reform Party said, the money has to come from somewhere, 
either from higher contributions or reduced benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the one hand the NDP continually says that the benefits are 
being slashed in the program.  At the same time it is saying that 
we should not allow Canadians to receive the highest rate of 
return on their money.  The NDP cannot have it both ways.  Bill 
C-2 strikes a very good balance in achieving the sustainability 
of the plan financially while still providing crucially important 
benefits to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I close by saying that we should oppose this amendment for the 
reasons stated by me and by members of the Reform Party, the 
Conservative Party and the Bloc who all stated quite eloquently 
reasons why we should not support the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions in Bill C-2 reflect what Canadians have been 
saying throughout the consultations.  It allows for a higher rate 
of return than is presently there.  It also continues to allow 
provincial access to funds, which is part of the 
federal-provincial agreement. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to add a couple of points.  The parliamentary 
secretary has made very clear why the motion should be defeated. 
Page 58 of the report on the Canada pension plan consultations 
says that all but one presenter were opposed to giving the 
provinces continued access to CPP funds at below market rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of those exhaustive consultations and with the 
requisite support of the provinces the issue is quite clear not 
only for the provinces and the federal government but for 
Canadians at large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to make one brief comment about the issue of the 
unfunded liability raised in the speech of the Conservative 
member.  He referred to it as a shortfall of some $600 billion. 
Technically it is referred to as an unfunded liability, but in 
the context of corporate pension plans an unfunded liability 
determined by an actuarial report must be dealt with and 
provisions must be made to fund the unfunded liability for one 
very simple reason.  Pensioners have to be protected.  Should the 
business fail there would be no recourse to deal with an unfunded 
liability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a difference, however, with regard to the benefits 
accrued under the Canada pension plan by today's workers which 
have not been fully funded.  Finance officials have advised that 
should the benefits accrued by all current workers which 
continued to build up over the years require funding, we would 
need some 30 years of funded benefits put aside in the investment 
fund. 
Needless to say, that is a very substantial amount of money. 
Since that money is not funded it is in the hands of businesses. 
It is in the hands of Canadians, the premium payers of the CPP.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out for the benefit of members the reason crude 
benefits to current workers who are earning credits for their 
pension plan are funded on a pay as you go basis.  When the plan 
came into effect the then retirees had come through two world 
wars and a depression, the depression of the thirties and 
forties.  We all know they did not have the opportunity or a full 
working career to be able to provide adequately for their 
retirement needs.  As a result the plan was structured on what is 
called a pay as you go basis.  Today's workers pay for the 
benefits of the then retirees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an aging society.  The ratio of workers to retirees is 
going down.  This is one of the principal reasons amendments to 
the Canada pension plan are necessary.  We have to move to an 
investment opportunity which will achieve higher rates of return 
than previously was the case so that the fund earning those rates 
will subsidize the premiums Canadians would otherwise pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes good sense.  It certainly was the view of Canadians and 
experts that appeared before the finance committee that attention 
should not be seconded away from the principal purposes of the 
Canada pension plan, which is to provide a secure guaranteed 
indexed pension to all Canadians today and for future 
generations.  That should not be jeopardized or undermined by 
either ancillary benefits or other activities such as regional 
economic development, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, the member from Qu'Appelle continues to suggest that 
the amendments being proposed by the NDP are reasonable and that 
the government has not accepted any of these amendments.  It is a 
prime example of the motivation of the amendments proposed by the 
NDP being totally inconsistent with the objectives of Bill C-2 
and the creation of the Canada pension plan investment board. 
That is precisely the reason this amendment should be defeated.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac—Mégantic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the purpose of the amendment now being considered, Amendment No. 9 
moved by my distinguidished colleague, the hon. member for 
Qu'Appelle, is to amend Bill C-2 in order to allow certain 
provinces to be able to borrow from this huge fund at a very low 
rate of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be remembered that governing means forecasting, 
anticipating.  It means being able to see 10, 20 or even 100 years 
down the road.  If I may, I would like to go back to the early 
1960s, when the late Jean Lesage was elected to office in Quebec 
with his slogan about things having to change.  And he was 
successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1962, I am sure you will recall the Liberal Party in Quebec 
talking about being masters in our own province, the primary goal 
being to create the Quebec pension plan fund and to nationalize 
Quebec's electricity companies.  This phenomenal team included René 
Lévesque, who did wonderful things in Quebec for Quebeckers, and 
Eric Kierens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec pension plan investments are earning a distinctly 
higher return.  If the QPP loaned money to government corporations 
at 3, 4 or 5%, it would be in the hole today.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If corrective action is not taken quickly, the CPP will be 
running a large deficit.  With $5.85 on every $100 insurable today, 
and hundreds of thousands of baby boomers all set to turn 65 at the 
same time, or just about, the fund will be in the red.  The 
Minister of Finance would then be facing serious problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CPP must therefore be properly managed so as to deliver 
the highest return possible.  To this end, it is anticipated that 
a minimum of 80% of the fund will be invested in Canada.  This 
could go as high as 99%, of course, but never below 80%. 
And the 20%, also as a maximum, could be invested in certain foreign 
countries, where it is the safest to do so. We should not be investing 
in countries offering 100% or 120% interest, but without any guarantee. 
In other words, we should not be investing in a company like BREX, which 
was very profitable, as you noticed also, but many Canadians lost their 
shirts after having invested in BREX. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So these assets have to be invested, not with a charitable but 
rather with an intelligent approach, to achieve maximum return, in the 
same way that such assets are administered in Quebec by the Régie des 
rentes du Québec. In Quebec, we have our Caisse de dépôt, and in Canada 
we will have a fund called the Canada investment board, which is the 
equivalent of the Caisse de dépôt et placement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like here to pay tribute to Jean Lesage and 
his tremendous team; in 1964, they created the Régie des rentes du 
Québec, which is working very well and providing fruitful investments 
for Quebeckers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil—Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise in this House a second time to speak to Bill C-2 
concerning reform of the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I spoke the first time, I mentioned that this reform of 
Canadian pensions was of special concern to me, because I am the Bloc 
Quebecois critic on policies affecting the elderly. Furthermore, I have 
risen many times in this House to defend the rights of the elderly, one 
of the most vulnerable groups in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois agrees with the general objective of the reform, 
which is to preserve the viability of a public pension system. However, 
this reform concerns Canadians more than Quebeckers, since less than 
0.5% of the people living in Quebec receive Canada pension plan 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to reiterate what my colleague for Mercier said: the 
Government of Canada or the governments of the other provinces should 
have done the same thing as Quebec in 1964-1965 when it created its 
Caisse de dépôt et placement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to forecasts, retirement benefits from the Régie des 
rentes du Québec, and also the benefits from federal income security 
programs, will reach $49 billion in 2001, and as much as $170 billion in 
current dollars in 2030. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the birth rate has gone down considerably over the past 
several years, we have to ask ourselves: What will be the consequences 
of the greater than expected rise in the contribution rate that will 
result from the increase in capitalization? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1230"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas there were 7 people of working age for every pensioner 
in 1951, the ratio dropped to 5.3:1 in 1991, and by 2031 will be 
2.4:1.  Unlike the Quebec pension plan, then, the federal programs 
have no reserve they can capitalize on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We therefore believe that this will have the effect of 
reducing the intergenerational inequality by making the baby-boomer 
generation pay, and most of these have about twenty years left to 
work. Needless to say, the Bloc Quebecois has never called for the 
end of the Canada pension plan and I would refer you to the 
speeches of myself and my colleagues in this connection, all of 
which focussed on the same thing: leaving seniors' rights 
untouched. 
The younger generations must also be able to benefit from a public 
pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Machiavelli's <I>Prince</I>, he says “The people could bear any 
burden, provided it was imposed gradually”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to focus once again on the changes proposed for 
federal disability benefits.  The federal government is 
experiencing great difficulty in implementing the disability 
benefit.  Last year, the auditor blamed the federal government for 
the unjustified escalating costs of disability benefits, for the 
most part the result of its rules being too lax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time the federal benefit is more generous that 
the Quebec pension plan's disability benefits, mainly because 
federal administrative policy allows more people to be eligible. 
A departmental directive allows a person to be declared disabled 
after the age of 55 if unable to perform his or her own job.  The 
federal government intends to abolish this directive, thus 
tightening up administration of the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has never had a directive of this type.  In fact, a 
person is eligible for disability benefits if he or she has 
contributed for two of the past three years,  five of the last ten, 
or half of the same contributory period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government wants to limit eligibility to those who 
have contributed for four of the last six years, which ought to cut 
back considerably on eligibility to the plan.  Today, at the report 
stage, we need to look at a number of amendments moved by several 
of the parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will deal particularly with Motion No. 9, moved by the New 
Democratic Party, which provides that a provincial government should be 
entitled to borrow funds at the lowest rate of interest available to the 
federal government. Unfortunately, the Bloc Quebecois cannot support 
this amendment, because it goes against the primary responsibility of 
the investment board, which is to achieve a maximum rate of return to 
ensure the plan's viability. A wide consultation process will take 
place, possibly in early 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B> This is very unfortunate, because it is my 
party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Dumas:</B> I see that the hon. member just realized we were 
talking about his party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B> You are a social democrat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Dumas:</B> The Canada pension plan must be adjusted to have 
a semblance of fairness that will be accepted by all generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, the earlier proposal made by the Reform Party to create 
a super RRSP is also unacceptable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under a system of super RRSPs, the government would have to 
guarantee a basic income for retirees, either through a minimum annuity 
or a separate assistance plan. In both cases, major costs would be 
associated with such a type of guaranteed minimum income. Again, the 
Bloc Quebecois never advocated the end of the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my first speech on Bill C-2, I mentioned that the United Nations 
had declared 1999 the international year of the elderly, to pay tribute 
to our seniors. The theme promotes a society for all ages by developing 
greater public awareness regarding the essential role played by seniors 
in every field of activity. 
The international year of the elderly should promote the principles 
aimed at improving our seniors' quality of life by emphasizing autonomy, 
participation and care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes without saying that the Canada pension plan is obsolete and 
no longer meets the public's requirements. I hope that, as the UN 
international year, 1999 will be special, because the Bloc Quebecois 
supports the objectives of the reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we urge the government to be very vigilant and to adopt 
the appropriate amendments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it always intrigues me when Bloc members wax eloquent 
about the Canada pension plan when in fact they do not 
participate in it. I want to respond very briefly to the comments 
of the Bloc member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said that there are problems with the fund.  He 
described the demographics and so on.  The point that needs to be 
made is that if the fund had been managed properly, demographics 
would not matter.  I wonder if that has ever occurred to those 
members. Because the fund was mismanaged the money will not be 
available for those who are looking forward to it as some 
security for their retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The suggestions made by the Bloc and by the NDP will not fix it. 
There will be more government mismanagement.  They already have 
their greedy eyes on that money.  They are telling us how we 
should manage it, how we should lend it out at low interest rates 
and so on.  That is what got us into this mess in the first 
place.  More of that will not solve the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that the proceeds should go to those who 
invested the money.  They should have a say in how it is done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If people looked clearly at what we are proposing, at the whole 
plan and not just nit-pick at little parts of it, they would begin 
to realize that is the most realistic solution to our problem 
with the Canada pension plan.  It will take many years to roll it 
over to the point where people have control over the funds, but 
that is what we need to do.  That is the bottom line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as it is managed by the same people in government who 
have been managing it up until now, and as long as those people 
are giving directives and appointing people to boards to manage 
the fund, we are still going to have the same problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc says there is not the appearance of justice which there 
should be.  We do not want an appearance of justice; we want the 
fund managed properly so that those who expect a retirement 
income will get it according to the funds they invested. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was reading some of the articles which comment on the payroll 
tax hike we will have.  One of the commentators said to kiss 
176,000 jobs goodbye.  My Conservative colleagues have made the 
point over and over again that this increase in tax will kill 
jobs.  The evidence is right here.  We have been saying the same 
thing.  That has to be a consideration.

compassion.  Those people over here on the left side who are 
advocating this have to realize that that is going to be a 
tremendous job destroyer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seniors who retired in 1976 got over $12 for every dollar 
invested.  Young people today who are going to retire in 2041 are 
going to get 59¢ for every dollar they have in the fund.  It is 
not their fault.  It is not the fault of seniors who are getting 
a very high return now for what they have actually put in.  Nor 
is it the fault of the young people who are going to retire 40 
years from now that they did not get a good return.  It is the 
fault of the government that has mismanaged it.  For the Bloc to 
say we need more of that, to only tinker with it a little bit, is 
not the solution.  We have got to have a solution that will serve 
us for all time.  What has been proposed here is not that 
solution.

not matter.

subsection (2) for the year 1997, 1998, 1999, or 2000 shall not 
come into effect unless the cumulative increase in anticipated 
revenues under the Canada Pension Plan resulting from the changes 
in the contribution rate after December 31, 1996 are offset by at 
least a cumulative decrease in anticipated combined employer and 
employee contributions under the Employment Insurance Act for the 
years 1998, 1999, and 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(4) The contribution rate for self-employed persons shall 
not exceed 10.25 per cent even if the Chief Actuary of the Office

report under section 115, is of the opinion that a higher 
contribution rate is warranted.” 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Madam Speaker, this amendment concerns the rate of 
contribution to the Canada pension plan and accordingly to the 
employment insurance program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that excessive payroll taxes kill job creation. 
Small and medium size businesses are hit hard by increases in 
payroll taxes.  We must encourage them to expand and not force them 
to limit their projects because they simply lack the means to hire 
the staff it takes to do the job. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first part of our amendment would tie CPP premium increases 
to EI premium cuts.  It would require that at least for the first 
three years, increases in cumulative CPP revenues from the 
combined CPP employee and employer CPP premium increases be at 
least offset by cumulative EI revenue decreases from combined 
employee and employer EI premium decreases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the government's internal reports show that the EI 
premiums could be cut to less than $2 and still cover the cost of 
the program.  This amendment would ensure that at a minimum, 
higher CPP premiums are at least offset with EI premium cuts over 
the next three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are deeply concerned about EI and CPP payroll taxes.  We have 
been talking about this since the very beginning and we are not 
the only ones.  Business leaders and organizations from across 
this great country have been telling the government the same 
thing.  If we want to create jobs, start by cutting payroll 
taxes.  Put people back to work.  Give them the opportunity to 
make our economy grow. 
The government chooses not to do that.  Last Friday it announced 
new EI premiums for the year 1998.  While it had the opportunity 
to give Canadians a much needed tax break, the government decided 
to spin a mere 20¢ reduction in EI premiums as good news.

$11 billion tax hike.

Canadian economy.  Actually it may be good news for the Canadian

be forced to lay off because the cost of having skilled workers 
will simply be too high.

to turn on his lights and bring the cuts necessary so that

should be offset with decreases in the other.  The current EI 
premiums are now set more than 50% higher than EI benefits 
justify.  This year alone the EI surplus is expected to be $7 
billion.  Hello profit, profit on the backs of Canadian workers, 
profit that equals deficit as far as employment growth goes.

this opportunity to see the light. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The levels of contributions to the Canada pension plan are of 
grave concern to Canadian workers.  This is why I think we must 
amend Bill C-2 by adding another paragraph. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would, however, like to draw your attention to a small 
omission in the French version as it compares to the English one. 
The second line of subclause (4) should read “même si” rather than 
just “si”.  This omission is important, because, as you will agree, 
it radically changes the meaning of the sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus amended, the French text of the subclause reads as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Le taux de cotisation des travailleurs autonomes ne peut 
dépasser 10,25 p. 100 même si l'actuaire en chef du Bureau du

taux de cotisation plus élevé est justifié.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As it stands, the bill, which affects almost all Canadians, 
permits an increase in contributions without new legislation.  If 
we let that go through, we will be giving the government a blank 
cheque essentially.  This is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I propose is that we preclude any increase above 10.25% 
without a decision by this House on the matter.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This would mean the consent of the provinces was essential for 
any premium increase.  The CPP cannot be changed except with the 
agreement of at least seven provinces representing 50% of the 
population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why this amendment?  The answer is very simple.  By their very 
nature, actuarial estimates are subject to error.  Even if CPP 
premiums were to exceed 10.25%, there would be such a discrepancy 
between the basic actuarial estimates and those submitted to 
Parliament that there would automatically have to be a review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government is serious when it says that amendments to 
Bill C-2 will keep premiums from climbing past 9.9%, it should not 
be afraid to ask Parliament to review amendments if the rate were 
to reach 10.25%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should also be emphasized that the fact of making it more 
difficult to increase premiums beyond 10.25% is not just the result 
of some bloodless number crunching.  On the contrary.  CPP premium 
rates have a direct impact on the lives of millions of Canadians, 
whether they are employers or employees.  So imagine what is like 
for Canadians who fall into both categories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Self-employed workers are hard hit by higher premium rates. 
They must shoulder the heavy burden of a combined premium. 
When there is talk of a 10.25% premium rate, the self-employed 
worker does not need a calculator:  he knows he has to turn over 
$10.25 of every $100 earned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people will perhaps say that the self-employed represent 
only a small proportion of the labour force and that, on the whole, 
this is not an issue of concern to Canadians generally.  Wrong. It 
is indeed of concern to Canadians generally, increasingly so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is precisely about the 2.5 million self-employed Canadians 
that members should be thinking as they consider Bill C-2 and the 
proposed amendment.  We have an obligation not to allow premium 
increases until the House has examined the consequences to Canadian 
workers, particular those who are self-employed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, while looking to reduce payroll taxes as much as 
possible, the Progressive Conservative Party does not expect, with this 
amendment, that the system could be improved in an effort to bring the 
employment insurance plan back down to human proportions by meeting a 
number of requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we read closely, this amendment means that, in the year 2000, 
the premium rate will be reduced by 80 cents per $100 of earnings. 
Should we go for it and adopt this amendment, we would effectively close 
the debate on possible improvements to the system in the interests of 
those who, as unemployed workers, benefit from it, and the Bloc 
Quebecois will not stand for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position put forward by the Bloc Quebecois during the campaign, 
which we feel is, all in all, the most balanced, is that the employment 
insurance premium rates could be reduced by a reasonable yet substantial 
amount.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We note with interest that the government accepted the suggestion 
we made at the first meeting of the committee, which all party leaders 
attended, that the reduction should be at least equal to the amount by 
which contributions to the Canada pension plan increase in order to 
partly offset this increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something else that you should also reduce because you can 
afford to. There is a surplus in the EI fund, which is literally 
overflowing, a surplus that makes no sense and is only used to solve 
deficit management problems at the expense of workers and employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We therefore feel that premiums should be cut significantly. 
The Bloc thinks that premiums should be cut not only by the current 
20 cents but perhaps by something like 40 cents so some money will 
go back into the economy and into employees' and employers' 
pockets.  However, we should keep the option of improving the 
conditions of the plan open.  The amendment before us would not do 
that.  Worse, it would make it impossible to do so, because if 
contributions are reduced to a point where there is no more 
manoeuvring room, we will be asking workers to agree to live with 
the existing plan for the next few years when they lose their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the latest federal election, if one message was sent to the 
government and to the opposition parties, it was that the people 
living in regions with high unemployment do not want the plan that 
turns workers into cheap labour.  The former Minister of Human 
Resources Development said they profited by the system. 
This minister got the message from the NDP member here.  The people 
gave the clear message that they did not want what the Liberals had 
done to the employment insurance plan based on the model the 
Conservatives had set up.  They want something that will distribute 
wealth.  The government talks about fighting poverty and giving 
more money to poor children, but most poor children have poor 
parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the best ways for the federal government to reduce 
poverty is to put money back into society. 
The unemployment insurance plan was not set up just to impress the 
unemployed.  It was set up to avoid a repetition of the depression 
of the 1930s by distributing wealth among the people.  The people 
creating the wealth—woodworkers, peat producers, fishers—all 
keep the economy moving.  They often work in sectors offering only 
seasonal work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our society and our country must recognize the need to assure 
workers in these sectors of a decent living if we want to sustain 
these economic sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposal on the table, which in part deals with the 
necessity of decreasing contributions, goes much too far in 
ensuring that there is money left in the system to improve the 
conditions of the unemployed.  The Liberal Government must not, 
under any circumstances, be handed the perfect excuse to say that 
Parliament has passed an 80 cent decrease, so nothing more can be 
done for the people concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically, this proposal sort of closes the circle. The 
Conservatives undertook unemployment insurance reform some seven or 
eight years ago.  The Liberals came into power announcing they 
would change all that, but they went even further than the 
Conservatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was very surprising, and I recall it because I was in 
Montreal at the time, three or four years ago, to see 30,000 people 
demonstrating on a day when it was 30 degrees below zero. 
The demonstration was attended by federal Liberal MPs then in 
office who marched with us to show that the Conservative reform 
made no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The day after the Liberals came to power, they continued along 
that path with a vengeance.  And now they are being told by the 
voters that there is no way they can talk out of both sides of 
their mouths like this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A clear message must be given to the Liberal government: 
unemployment insurance must be changed so that the fund can be 
properly monitored, allowing premiums to be at a level that would 
yield a reasonable surplus so as to improve the conditions of the 
unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservatives' proposal is along the same lines as the 
Mulroney government's reform, that is to level the situation of 
workers as much as possible so that they will be increasingly 
available to work as cheaply as possible.  Doing so is following 
along the same lines as in the United States where unemployment 
insurance is at 50%.

<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
first, I will be voting against the amendments and I will give my 
reasons why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe, as I said a while ago, that this started with the 
Conservatives and has continued under the Liberals.  They still 
have not learned their lesson.  That is not what Canadians and 
the working people are asking for. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They want to mix employment insurance premiums with Canada 
pension plan contributions so they can tell people how much money 
they can save on their paycheques.  I have never seen workers in 
Canada out in the streets demanding decreased contributions.  I 
have, however, seen employers demanding this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not forget what I sincerely believe is happening in 
our economy, the reasons our small businesses are experiencing 
difficulties.  In the June 2 election, no small business in our 
part of the country claimed that it was because they were paying 
too much in employment insurance premiums.  What they did tell me 
was that there will be nobody left who can afford to buy anything 
from them, the way the employment insurance system is going. 
This is why small businesses are closing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to back up and look at what really hurt Canadians and 
small businesses.  If there is no one buying what a small business 
is selling, the negative effect on the system is far greater than 
the contributions.  People working can pay their contributions. 
When they are not working, they cannot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our system in Canada is running amok, and we have not yet 
finished paying.  We have not finished paying for what we is going 
on.  I listen to what the people at home are saying.  I can tell 
you that it was not only people working who voted for me.  Small 
businesses worked for me and believe in what I say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The change to the unemployment insurance system began with the 
Conservative government and was continued by the Liberals.  My 
predecessor said, when he was in opposition, “You are going to 
create a mess in New Brunswick.  I encourage all New Brunswickers 
to fight any changes to the unemployment insurance system with 
vigour, because they will spell disaster for New Brunswick”.  That 
is what my predecessor Doug Young said at home.  Do you know what 
our people said?  “Mr. Young, we will show you the door, because 
you have done our region damage”.  I say to my colleague that he 
should think about what he says and that it is not the rates that 
did the most harm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a problem with the way these things are considered.  In 
other words, we will have to improve our employment insurance 
system. The focus must really be on job creation and when it is 
on real job creation, the system will automatically cost less, 
because there will be fewer people on employment insurance, 
contributions will decrease and it will all happen.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is what we must look at. The Canada pension plan is 
expensive at present, but we could perhaps consider alternatives for the 
Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have nothing against the fact that a person who is sick or 
injured will receive a disability pension, provided this person does not 
work for a company and the disease or injury is not work related. But I 
do have a problem with a person who works for a company and pays for 
compensation, as we call it where I come from, who, one year after 
having been injured, is asked to apply for the Canada pension plan. 
Because in that case the CPP has to pay first, when another plan should 
perhaps be paying for that, especially when the person in question has 
an employer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, benefits are paid out of the Canada pension plan for any 
accident that happened on the employer's premises. The compensation plan 
only covers the difference between the two plans. Perhaps we could take 
a look at this, at having employers make their businesses safer places 
where fewer accidents happen. It might save money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many Canadians are receiving CPP disability benefits today when 
the company that employed them should perhaps be held financially 
responsible, if the accident happened at the workplace. But that is not 
how it goes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that we should look at the whole picture and see how 
CPP money could be saved by making those responsible pay. Next, we 
should look at employment insurance and see how small business people 
can have enough money left to run their businesses. 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, there are 
those who think there will no longer be a government pension in a 
few years.  The birth rate is dropping and life expectancy is 
increasing.  As a result, the number of people receiving pension 
benefits is going up and the number of people paying into the plan 
is going down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our pension system is losing ground and in need of changes. 
We want to put it on a rock solid footing.  We are working hard to 
ensure that all Canadians will receive a pension when they reach 
retirement age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to understand the impact of our amendment, let us take 
a look at the pension system in general.  There are three 
components.  First, there is the basic income received by every 
resident of Canada:  old age security and the guaranteed income 
supplement. Second, there is income based on work earnings: 
Canada pension plan, or CPP, and Quebec pension plan, or QPP. 
Third, there is income paid by an employer or drawn from RRSPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is proposing a program to improve the 
system.  It represents, however, a large threat to the three 
components of the existing system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is creating the seniors benefit by 
combining old age security and other seniors benefits.  Low income 
seniors will thus be getting a bit more than before:  a meagre 
annual allowance of $120 will go to the least well off;  and too 
many retired Canadians will be living under the poverty line.  In 
addition, middle income seniors could lose up to $7,000 annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals will increase contributions to the CPP by $11 
billion, one of the largest tax hikes in Canadian history.  No tax 
relief is planned by way of compensation.  In short, workers will 
have to pay more, and young Canadians will have to foot the bill 
for mismanagement of the plan for years to come.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They discourage people from putting their money in RRSPs or in 
private pension plans. The Liberal government reduced the tax deduction 
available when investing in a RRSP, and it continues to impose 
restrictions on authorized pension plan investments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think we have a better idea to improve our pension system. 
For the time being, we must limit ourselves to amending the 
government's legislation. But, before amending seniors benefits, 
we would like all Canadians to have a reasonable period of time 
to examine the effects of the proposals and to express their 
views. We want to make sure that the pension system reflects the 
values dear to Canadians, rewards them for their hard work and 
encourages them to save for their retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to improve the administration of the Canada pension plan. 
In order to do so, we want to provide a sound financial basis for the 
plan, to make up for the increase in contributions by lowering taxes, 
and to encourage people to put more money into their RRSPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada pension plan is an essential element of our social 
safety net. We want to maintain it. The Canada pension plan needs 
another $600 million to fulfil its obligations to tomorrow's retirees. 
The CPP must be saved. It must be properly managed by a board whose 
members would come from the business and financial community and have no 
ties to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must increase contributions to the Canada pension plan, so as to 
ensure its financial viability, but we must also be cautious not to 
penalize young workers. The increase should be compensated by tax 
reductions in other areas, such as employment insurance contributions. 
The employment insurance fund has a $13 billion surplus. Combined with 
the $11 billion increase in CPP contributions proposed by the Liberals, 
this surplus represents a huge tax grab by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments should encourage people to save for retirement. They 
should not penalize those who do it. I support policies that help 
Canadians get the best possible return on their investments in 
RRSPs and that include as few government restrictions as 
possible. This means a guarantee that the funds protected in 
RRSPs will not be taxed, as long as they remain in these RRSPs. 
It also means allowing a higher percentage of foreign investments 
in RRSPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no choice but to conclude that our pension system is in a 
sorry state and that something must be done. Any system, either new or 
improved, should be based on the following principles: long term 
viability; sound management free of any political interference; fair 
contributions regardless of income; and built-in incentives designed to 
encourage people to look beyond the Canada pension plan and to put more 
money aside for their retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments seek to improve the bill so that it can meet these 
objectives. I urge members to support our amendments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the Bloc 
will obviously be voting against this amendment because, as my colleague 
has stated, we want to go much further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised that such an amendment is being proposed today. I 
find this surprising, coming from the Conservatives. Why do we have to 
discuss this today, instead of discussing full employment? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment insurance, of course, should be protected; I agree. 
Contributions should be reduced, of course; I agree.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that in my area, in the riding of Matapédia—Matane, 
there are so many unemployed workers? It is because there are no jobs. 
Why is it that there are no jobs? It is because the Liberals, beginning 
with Mr. Trudeau, created such a debt for Canada—the Conservatives 
continued afterwards, but they slowed down a bit—that we have to 
earmark billions and billions of dollars every year to pay for that 
debt. Because of this, it is obvious that everyone is backed up against 
the wall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we are being told that pensions have to be protected. But 
when workers have almost nothing left on their pay, how do you expect 
them to go out and buy things? 
Even small businesses, which have to pay such high contributions, often 
have to lay off several employees, and these receive employment 
insurance that I would call poverty insurance, while the owners of these 
businesses have to work 18 or 19 hours a day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the real problem. There has been poor management for 30 
years, and now, they are waking up all of sudden and saying  that this 
is most unfortunate, that this is painful and that we have to protect 
the elderly and also the people who, because of circumstances, have to 
rely on employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, here are the Conservatives wailing and arguing 
that contributions have to be reduced. But it is the Conservatives and 
the Liberals who put us in this mess, into this gaping hole. Today, they 
are waking up and saying “We have to wake up”. But the Conservatives are 
saying that we have to wake up because they are part of the opposition. 
When they are in office, they say the same thing, it is more of the 
same, as you know full well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why? I have said this before and I will say it again, today. It is 
because their campaign coffers are full and, when they are in office, 
they do not even have to ask for money; it just pours into their 
coffers. When the Conservatives are in office, their coffers are full 
too and, as a result, their hands are tied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell you, we have always said we were willing to help 
workers. We are willing to take to the streets with them. I went to 
Rivière-du-Loup, Amqui and Matane, where I took to the streets with 
workers in the riding of Matapédia—Matane. Now we have two new RCM, 
Denis-Riverin and Avignon, and they are not the richest in Canada. I 
will be with these people because they want to work. These people have 
intestinal fortitude. Quite often, they are responsible for large 
families and have nothing. 
When they start working, the premiums are so high they are already 
strapped for cash. They cannot put a few dollars in the bank for the few 
months that are difficult for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You know, when a father works only to get his stamps and that, 
quite often, they are small stamps, it means abject poverty for his 
children. It is not because people do not want to work, you know that 
very well. People want to work, but there are no jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we ask the government to help small and medium businesses, 
there are so many factors that come into play in handing out some money 
that some always end up being struck off the list, and told “No, this 
does not match the criteria”, “No, sir”, “No, madam”, and that is the 
way it goes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, for this amendment to be ordered, if I can put it that way, 
by the Conservatives, it is somewhat hypocritical, I would say. 
They are trying to make amends. When they were in office, they 
should have taken some action to create jobs.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, there are actually two amendments in this group.  I 
would like to speak mostly to Motion No. 10 which was introduced 
by me.  It would strike clause 58 of the act.  I am sure that 
does not enlighten many people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially what clause 58 does is make the contribution rate 
increases retroactive.  A small portion of the contribution 
increase to CPP will actually kick in for our 1997 obligation. Of 
course here we are at nearly the very end of the year talking 
about legislation which will make Canadians' tax bills for this 
year higher than they had anticipated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our view that is very unfair.  It is taxation by stealth.  It 
is something that will be a real hardship for Canadians to have 
to go back and pay something that they had never anticipated 
having to pay.  Not only will it put their budgeting out of whack 
but it also will be paper work grief they do not need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to refer to one example of how clause 58 will 
impact on at least one sector of the economy.  That is with 
respect to the people who provide temporary services.  These 
temporary services are used by businesses and by government 
during peak work periods for special jobs or projects, when 
permanent employees are ill or on vacation. Some of the temporary 
services provided are office administration and support, data and 
word processing, industrial, marketing, technical, financial, 
professional and health care services.  So there is a wide range 
of Canadians employed in this area of temporary employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, it is a major entry level for recent immigrants to 
Canada and also for workers returning to the workforce after an 
absence.  A lot of students are involved in these kinds of 
temporary employment opportunities and so are recent graduates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also retirees and older workers who are moving into retirement 
are attracted to temporary employment opportunities.  So it is 
fair to say that companies that offer jobs and opportunities for 
temporary employment are major Canadian employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is going to happen with this retroactive increase that the 
government is trying to put into place is this.  The 1997 
contribution rate was 5.85%.  If this bill passes the 
contribution rate for 1997, that is from January 1, 1997, a year 
ago almost, will go up to 6%, a retroactive increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will argue that is just a few dollars and it 
really is not going to make a whole lot of difference.  But if we 
take an increase like that and make it retroactive and put it 
back on employers, because they have to pay half of this, that 
can significantly affect their bottom line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The case of the temporary help industry is just one example. 
There are other businesses affected very adversely but I will 
give this example. The payroll that is paid to employees by 
temporary service employers accounts for about 75% to 85% of the 
firm's revenue, and that is a lot greater than some other 
industries.  For example, the financial services sector pays only 
9% of its expenses to payroll paid to employees.  For some 
businesses this is a significant portion of their cashflow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increases or decreases are usually announced in advance of the 
date at which the rate takes effect.  That gives businesses 
adequate time to adjust.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this 1997 CPP rate is an increase, as I said, after the 
existing rate was confirmed a year ago.  What we have is a 
contribution rate that is going to cost one sector of the economy 
millions of dollars, and this will take a big bite out of its 
expected profit and cashflow.  These businesses refer to the rate 
as punitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they did was enter into contracts for 1997 based on their 
expenses being at a rate of 5.8%, their CPP contribution 
rate. Now they are going to have to pay 6% and they 
will not be able to pass the added cost of the rate increase on 
to their customers.  The profits these companies are making are 
going to be put at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are companies, as I said, that hire some of those 
vulnerable workers in our society.  Yet what the government is 
doing in this retroactive tax grab is causing a real hardship to 
at least this sector of the economy, and it is only one example. 
There are others but time does not permit me to go into all of 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another consideration that I will bring before the 
House.  This retroactive rate increase is going to be a real 
administrative cost.  What will happen is that, interestingly 
enough, for governments that use temporary services, companies by 
law are able to change their bill if there is a retroactive 
change to the payroll burden.  What will happen is that service 
firms will have to go through their payroll records for every 
employee, for each assignment that employee had, and prepare 
invoices to add on this retroactive 1997 CPP rate increase.  That 
invoice will then go to government clients.  Then the government 
will have to go back and double check to make sure that these 
temporary people were hired on, to make sure that the amounts are 
calculated correctly and to make up cheques to send back to pay 
this retroactive rate increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an administrative nightmare, and it is simply because 
government did not have the foresight or the administrative 
expertise to bring in these changes in a way that was fair and 
reasonable and could be handled with the least disruption 
possible to the people it affects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amounts, we think, should simply be collected another way, 
if they have to be collected.  They should not be collected in a 
way that is so costly, so disruptive and so unfair to the people 
they affect.  Just because government cannot get it right does 
not mean that other people should scramble around and have to 
pick up the ball. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we proposed that clause 58 which brings in this 
retroactive tax increase be struck and that government go back 
and find other ways to make up this amount if it feels it has to 
do it.  It is not fair to people who have to pay the freight to 
do it this way.  It is poor form. We really urge the government 
not to do this to people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the examples I have been able to give will be persuasive 
that this is not a compassionate thing to do.  It is not a fair 
thing to do.  It is a real hardship.  We hope that this amendment 
will pass.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically what we are talking about is retroactive taxation 
which I think most of us on all sides of this House would find 
most unsavoury.  What it does is eat away at government's capital 
in the sense of confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think most Canadians can accept that.  It means that at 
the end of the taxation year we are going to have to ante up more 
money for the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many of us going into 1997 thought that was going to happen? 
I would submit not very many Canadians would expect the 
government to bring in a bill that is going to add to 
contributions already paid.  There is something wrong with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason the government has the problem with regard to the 
Canada pension plan is that it simply failed to deal with that 
reality over the last number of years.  Having failed to deal 
with that reality, it has to make up ground.  Let us take a look 
at some past administrations. The person who comes to mind is a 
prime minister who was here long before our time, Mackenzie King. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what this government reminds me of, that type of 
leadership.  I think if I could summarize how Mackenzie King 
operated, he operated on the basis that if someone waits long 
enough the problem will go away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the present Prime Minister operates under that same 
formula.  If you wait long enough, the problem will go away, so 
let's not touch it, let's not deal with it, because if you deal 
with it, it means that you would have to exercise that rare 
commodity that we call leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they took office in 1993, that was a problem facing them as 
a government.  If they took a look at the numbers today, what 
they would have to do to fix the problem is multiply it tenfold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had they dealt with the problem in 1993, the exaggerated rates 
of payment or the premiums that all Canadians are going to pay 
would have been much less.  They were operating on the premise 
that no, we do not have to deal with it today, the problem will 
disappear. It has not disappeared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think any financial analyst and anyone with any kind of 
thinking mind at all would have told the government then that the 
problem would not disappear, and they did.  Canadians were 
warning the government what would happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of them were in this House.  It could be the member 
standing and speaking because we all knew what was going to 
happen.  The sad part about this horrendous increase in these 
premiums is that it is the young Canadians who are going to be 
paying the price for the present government's mistakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the tragedy in the whole equation.  None of us mind 
paying our own way and that is the way it is supposed to be. 
However, the present CPP pensioners deserve what they have.  None 
of us argue with that but the unfunded liability in the CPP 
amounts to $600 billion.  That is spelled with a <I>b</I>, $600 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Basically what we have now is a pay-as-you-go scheme that is 
quickly going broke.  The demographics and the age differences 
and percentages in terms of the individuals who are retired now 
and the number of individuals working, that equation just will 
not support the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In future years that equation is going to be weighted too much 
on the retirement side.  Again, the government knew that this was 
coming.  It is like a freight train.  It could be seen coming 
down the rails.  The light is there.  It is on the track.  It is 
coming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A collision can either be avoided by drawing back or by doing a 
number of things, but the government chose not to do it.  Now we 
are looking at the most regressive of all legislation I think to 
enter this House in a number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about a huge tax increase.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can talk about it as being a premium, but anything that comes 
out of our pay cheques at the end of the week is a tax no matter 
how we want to word it.  What this is is a hidden tax.  It is a 
silent killer of jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are suggesting as a party, and a responsible position, 
is that the government over the last number of years has built up 
this huge surplus in the unemployment insurance fund.  Right now 
it has a surplus of about $12 billion, and that is spelled with a 
<I>b</I> as well.  What is the government doing with that?  The 
finance minister is using it to fudge the deficit numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are suggesting is to simply reduce the unemployment 
insurance premiums that are paid by all Canadians.  In all 
fairness to the government, it reduced it by a mere 20¢ last 
week.  However, it could be reduced by at least 70¢ or 90¢ if it 
wanted to but it chooses not to do it because it wants to use 
those numbers and that fund for its own political purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister is certainly not going to let the minister 
responsible for the unemployment insurance act or CPP use any of 
those funds other than for debt reduction or deficit reduction 
which is where the unfairness lies.  If the government took those 
moneys today and said “Let's reduce the amount that we are 
paying into the EI fund, it would neutralize those increases in 
the Canada pension plan”.  At the end of the day the workers in 
your constituency and the workers in my constituency are going to 
look at their pay cheque and it is going to be the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, what we need is a reduction in some of those 
other taxes to offset the increases in the Canada pension plan. 
We cannot be totally naive.  The government has put off the 
problem for five years and the problem has now compounded to the 
point where it has to go in there with a big hit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going back to where I opened my remarks in this debate.  It 
is like the old Mackenzie King philosophy:  Wait and the problem 
will take care of itself.  It has not taken care of itself.  The 
government has provided no leadership at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to the motion we are speaking on, I support that 
amendment in the legislation which would eliminate the 
retroactivity that is going to hurt every working Canadian in 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to get off the topic a little bit.  Yesterday in 
question period I and some of the other members had the same 
question for the health minister.  I am going to point this out 
because it is the lack of leadership in solving a problem that we 
are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I mentioned to the health minister the need to address 
the 12,000 hepatitis C sufferers in Canada as a result of the 
incompetence of the federal government to recognize a problem a 
number of years ago.  The result is that we have 12,000 Canadians 
infected and compensation has to be paid.

realize what I am going to say because I would expect that the

understands the rules that are in effect at report stage.  I 
would only ask the member, through you, Madam Speaker, to respect 
the rules of the House and continue his debate with respect to 
the motions that we are debating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I knew this was coming 
because the one thing the Liberal Party does not want to do is 
deal with the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I want to make is simply that the Liberals dilly-dally 
on every single issue and problem in Canadian society.  They are 
in office to deal with these problems today.  It is like the 
hepatitis C sufferers.  We need compensation for them but again 
they postponed that decision for five years and postponed CPP 
decisions for five years.  These problems just compound and 
multiply.  By the time they get ready to deal with it, it is 
blown completely out of proportion.  That is what they have done 
with these CPP premiums that you and I and all Canadians are 
going to pay.  It has been completely blown out of proportion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I object strenuously to the type of bill that they want to 
introduce here to deal with the problem today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
want to say a few words on the two motions before the House in 
the name of the Reform member from the Calgary area.  I concur 
with much of what she said in her remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member wants to eliminate clause 58 of the bill which calls 
for the CPP premiums to be made retroactive to January 1, 1997. 
The CPP premiums now are at 5.85% and once the bill goes through 
they will be increased to 6%.  The employer will pay 3% and the 
worker will also pay 3%.  However, we are still on the old regime 
of 5.85%.   When this goes through the House and the Senate has 
given royal assent, part of the law will make this retroactive to 
January 1, 1997.  So it is a retroactive premium or assessment. 
Some would say it is a retroactive tax on both the employee and 
the employer.  Doing this retroactively is something that I am 
very uncomfortable about.  It is like closing the barn door after 
the horse has already gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that assessing someone retroactively has been 
done very often by Parliaments.  There seems to be something a 
bit unjust about it.  People plan their lives, draft their 
personal budgets, businesses draft budgets and make plans 
according to a set of rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general I guess people have been notified that this is going 
to happen.  I am sure we could go out on Wellington Street in 
Ottawa or on Albert Street in Regina or the big main street of 
Thompson, Manitoba, and ask the first ten people who go by 
whether or not they were notified that there is going to be a 
retroactive increase in the CPP.  I think of those people, all 
would say no, they were not aware of it, despite the fact that 
they have a very good MP from Thompson who notifies them of 
absolutely everything.  I think that is unjust.  I am happy that 
the amendment is before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might say that the increase from 5.85 to 6% is not that much. 
In many cases it is not because it is split between the employer 
and the employee.  However, for some families and people living 
on the edge with very low wages, even an increase of a few 
dollars a year will be meaningful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other problem will be on the employer's side.  A group of 
people came before the committee to make their case about the 
difficulty of collecting money retroactively from temporary help 
agencies.  They are very, very labour intensive.  Most of their 
costs are going to salaries, to labour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talked about the expense and the difficulties it would 
create for them as employers, the red tape, the bureaucracy and 
the bother and how tedious and cumbersome it would be.  In some 
ways maybe the cost of doing it would be even more than the money 
they would collect from the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My understanding is that the federal government would have 
dropped the retroactivity part of this, but at a loss of about 
$400 million.  That may sound like a fair amount of money, but 
the cost of collecting the money is going to be several million 
dollars as well.  It might be wise for the government to consider 
not making this retroactive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are concerned about money in the CPP fund, the most 
important thing we should do is make sure that we have a strong 
economy, jobs in the country and income growth, because when 
people are working they are going to be paying into the CPP. That 
is the way to raise the money, enlarge the fund and make the 
Canada pension plan sustainable.  I do not think we can do it by 
making it retroactive, which people are not anticipating.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fine to say that people were notified, but I am sure there 
is scarcely a soul out there, including a lot of businesses, who 
realize this has to be done on a retroactive basis.  That is 
going to cause needless hardship for Canadians across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an example of an amendment which should be looked at 
seriously by the government.  If it were to move in the direction 
of eliminating the retroactivity, it would make good sense.  It 
would be good politics and would restore faith in the democratic 
system.  It would indicate that parliamentarians do indeed listen 
to the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second amendment before us today was moved by the 
Conservative Party and would attach EI premiums to Canada pension 
plan premiums.  As much as the intent is positive, I would not 
support this amendment as part of the statute changing the Canada 
pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I believe the increase in CPP premiums of 73% 
over the next six years is too steep.  It will be a hardship on 
Canadians.  It is not progressive; it is regressive. The very 
fact that the government is eliminating the indexation of the 
basic yearly exemption which is now some $3,500 makes it even 
more regressive and more difficult for low income people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are hardships.  The premiums are going up.  To attach CPP 
premiums to EI premiums is not the way to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead the government should have listened to what it heard in 
British Columbia and Saskatchewan.  It should have listened to 
what it heard from the trade union movement, the progressive 
people across the country, and made the contributions more 
progressive.  It should have continued the indexation of the 
yearly basic exemption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1966 when the CPP originated, the yearly basic exemption was 
around $400.  It was then indexed to the inflation rate.  It has 
moved from $400 to about $3,500.  This means that low income 
people have progressively been receiving a higher exemption. That 
has been a positive step in keeping this plan a bit more 
progressive.  Now indexation will stop.  It will remain at $3,500 
for the next 5, 10, 20, 30 years and every time the inflation 
rate rises the plan will be a bit more regressive.  It will be a 
bit more difficult for low income people in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is wrong.  It is unfair.  If I remember correctly, I 
believe that the Minister of Finance as much as acknowledged that 
in committee three or four weeks ago when he said that this 
should be on the agenda when the CPP is reviewed in the year 
2000.  I hope he does that.  I hope there will be a change to 
once again index the basic exemption to make the premiums more 
progressive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other side we have the employment insurance premiums. 
There was a bit of a reduction announced last Friday by the 
federal government.  It was a small reduction.  It was a step in 
the right direction, but the reduction should have been higher. 
There is now a big surplus in the EI fund and there should be a 
reduction in the premiums to help working people in the country. 
It would also help the business community in Canada, particularly 
small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think we should be tying one to the other in this 
legislation.  The government should keep both items as separate 
files.  On the one hand the government should reduce EI premiums. 
That would put more money into the pockets of ordinary people. It 
would allow the small business community to create jobs.  On the 
other hand the government should ensure that we have a more 
progressive Canada pension plan premium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we listened to public opinion, listened to what the people 
are saying, they would agree that these funds should be handled 
separately and that they be handled for good social reasons and 
for reasons of progressiveness in our income tax system and 
progressiveness in our social policy within Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have 
this opportunity to speak to this issue, especially to add to these 
statements we have just heard on Motions Nos. 10 and 12. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These two motions have one thing in common. The present pension 
plan is inadequate, it has insufficient funds for the long term. If this 
decision is delayed, it is the future generations that will bear the 
impacts. This is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment proposed by the Conservative Party attempts to link 
the reduction in contributions to employment insurance. From the point 
of view of business, this makes sense to a certain extent, because it 
would offset any increase in their payroll taxes. 
However, going as far as the Conservatives would like us to go can 
perhaps jeopardize the employment insurance program and have an effect 
on this program and also on the positive aspects of these initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We already know that the reduction in employment insurance benefits 
has had an effect. Repeat claimants are affected by seasonal 
unemployment and have to bear a 1% reduction of their benefits. It is 
not their fault if there is seasonal unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be careful with this because it can affect the program. 
I used to sit on the human resources development committee, and we in 
the Bloc were opposed to changes in the employment insurance system. 
Today, we are still constantly reminding the government that it made an 
error, that it went too far in its cuts to employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to come back to the Canada pension plan. The situation 
is a bit similar, the fund has to be sufficient to provide for the 
future. A Quebec success story is often mentioned, the Caisse de dépôt 
et placement. It has been in existence for at least 25 years, and it has 
had positive results for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will allow among other things to manage this money by 
creating a fund, and this would be more efficient. It would allow an 
increase in assets and ensure the future of the Canada pension plan for 
ordinary citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People can talk about payroll taxes, but often these taxes exist 
for the benefit of the whole population, especially the underprivileged. 
As you know, it is not everyone that can have access to a pension fund 
through the workplace. Not everyone works for the government, for a 
municipality or for large companies that have pension funds. There are 
people who cannot benefit from these. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also people who, because of their family obligations, 
like single mothers, do not have the opportunity to contribute to RRSPs 
and to plan for their future, when their children will be grown up and 
will have finished their studies, etc. Very often these are people who 
have few assets, and this plan allows many people who are less fortunate 
to know that they will at least have a basic minimum for their 
retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be careful when we touch this. The people concerned form 
a very large part of the population. Very often, they are the less 
fortunate, the underprivileged in the system. I think that the 
government acted too slowly in proposing better contributions in this 
area.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Any amendment that proposes to slow down or reduce rates and to 
improve the management of this fund to better plan for the future in the 
interest of future generations is worth considering because such action 
is urgently needed. However we, in the Bloc Quebecois, oppose Motions 
Nos. 10 and 12, especially since Motion No. 12 has a connection with the 
employment  insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, we believe that the employment insurance plan is a plan 
that was considerably thinned down by the Conservatives. We remember the 
impact of the cuts made by Minister Valcourt, who lost his seat in New 
Brunswick. The Conservative government was severely criticized for its 
lack of compassion for the unemployed. 
In spite of their promises, the Liberals did the same thing during their 
last mandate. They too got their just reward; in the maritime provinces 
in particular, where seasonal unemployment is widespread, election 
results spoke volumes. Voters made it clear first to the Conservative 
Party, then to the Liberal Party, that they should be careful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, in the Bloc Quebecois, will not be counted among those who wish 
to slow down efforts to improve the pension situation of ordinary 
people.

seems to be a jobless recovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too many Canadians are being left behind. The unemployment rate 
continues to hover around 10%.  There are areas in regions of the 
country where high chronic unemployment has become the norm for 
second generation Canadians. This is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian families are working harder than ever, many needing two 
or three incomes just to make ends meet.  Working Canadians are 
falling further and further behind.  Canadians have not 
experienced a real tax pay raise since the 1980s. A person's 
disposable income has actually fallen by almost 6 per cent since 
1990.  Canadians are paying more and more in taxes but getting 
less and less in return.  For the first time ever a generation of 
Canadians are at risk of leaving their children a lower standard 
of living than that of their parents.

<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, in a statement that 
was both arrogant and without precedent, claimed that the question 
during the last referendum was a fraud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the Prime Minister who, on the eve of the 
referendum, stated at Verdun that Quebeckers were going to make the most 
important decision of their lives, if he was inviting them to 
participate in a fraud. 
<P><A NAME="LINK116"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
clear that when we heard Mr. Parizeau's statement after the referendum, 
there was a very great difference between what was on paper and what the 
government intended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspected there was a trap in this, and I asked Quebeckers to be 
careful. 
<P><A NAME="LINK117"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, when 
the Prime Minister voted in his riding of Saint-Maurice on October 30, 
1995, did he have the impression of participating in a fraud, in a 
fraudulent exercise, when he went to vote? 
<P><A NAME="LINK118"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to point out that there was no mention of separation in the 
question. When I read the question, there was no mention of creating a 
new country. When I read the question, there was no mention of becoming 
a member of the United Nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were saying that an association would be worked out with the 
rest of Canada, that Quebeckers would keep the Canadian passport, 
Canadian money and Canadian citizenship, and also economic union and 
political union. I have always said that I hope one day they will be 
honest enough to ask an honest question “Do you want to separate from 
Canada, yes or no?” 
<P><A NAME="LINK119"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to quote part of the speech by the Prime Minister in Verdun, 
in case he has forgotten it. He said “Listen very well to what the 
separatist leaders are saying. They are being very clear”.—That is what 
he said: “They are being very clear. The country they are proposing is 
not a improved Canada, it is a separated Quebec”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask him again how he can speak today of fraud, when he was saying 
on the eve of the referendum, with a look of desperation, of 
understanding, of openness towards Quebeckers, that the separatists were 
being very clear. How can he say today that it was a fraud? 
<P><A NAME="LINK120"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
was telling Quebeckers that when looking at what was written at the time 
of voting and when hearing what the separatists were saying in some 
areas of the province, what they meant was not very clear to the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were saying “Nothing will happen, you will receive your old 
age benefits from Canada, and all the benefits of Canadian citizenship, 
while at the same time voting yes to this ambiguous question”. I am 
asking for only one thing, and that is a little bit of honesty, to ask 
Quebeckers “Do you want to separate, yes or no?” There is nothing 
complicated in that, it is not much more than a sentence and the people 
would understand clearly. They would vote very clearly, once again, for 
Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK121"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if we 
want to speak about honesty, the last person we would want to deal with 
is the present Prime Minister of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the evening of October 30, 1995, following the results, when the 
Prime Minister had promised to everyone in Canada that there was no 
danger from sovereignty, that Quebeckers did not want it, these are the 
things he said.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the prime minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning Campaign 2000 released its report card on child 
poverty, confirming that child poverty has increased by 58% since 
1989.  It demonstrates the appalling record of the government on 
child poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government talk is cheap considering that the funding for 
programs our children need has not been there. The new child tax 
benefit does not even replace what the government has already 
cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the prime minister commit now to restoring these cuts? 
<P><A NAME="LINK124"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, indeed the prime minister 
took the leadership in June 1996.  The premiers of the provinces 
have asked us to work very hard on child poverty. I have seen the 
report of Campaign 2000 and it supports the initiatives we have 
been taking on the national child tax benefit.  It has seen what 
we have been able to do along with all the governments of this 
country to help children with CAPC, which my colleague, the 
Minister of Health, has been increasing thanks to last year's 
budget.  We are working toward that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK125"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
that is not acceptable. The federal government is behaving like 
the schoolyard bully who takes the weak's lunch money and then 
feels he deserves a reward for buying a small milk. By refusing 
to index the child tax benefit, the government is allowing it to 
slowly fade away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the government as a first step commit to fully indexing the 
child tax benefit? 
<P><A NAME="LINK126"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government will commit 
very clearly that we will have $850 million more dollars as of 
July 1, 1998. The Government of Canada will commit very clearly 
today that there will be at least another $850 million in this 
Parliament directed toward children. That is a lot more money 
than they are talking about on the other side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should realize that a lot of work was done in the last

while the prime minister was away at the APEC conference, 
peppering his meals with other APEC leaders and peppering 
Canadians with amusing jokes, the Governor of the Bank of Canada 
this week peppered Canadians with a 25 basis point increase in 
interest rates. As a result of this, the value of the Canadian 
dollar went down the following day and continues to go down 
again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the prime minister explain to Canadians why the financial 
markets are reacting negatively?  Could the prime minister tell

downward trend in the dollar? 
<P><A NAME="LINK129"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the record of the government in managing the economy is 
much better than when the Tories were in power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the circumstances there is a fluctuation in a lot of the 
currencies around the world.  But at this moment because of the 
good management of the government we have low interest rates, 
much lower than American interest rates. We have more room than 
when we took over government from the Tory administration when 
interest rates were at least three points above American rates. 
<P><A NAME="LINK130"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
doubt that Canadians are applauding as the Liberal benches are 
applauding with 9.1% unemployment, more Canadians having a lower 
standard of living than when he was elected and there are more 
poor children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the prime minister tell us what are the policies of the 
government when it maintains artificially high payroll taxes, 
when there is an increase in CPP premiums which will kill jobs 
and increasing interest rates which will also kill jobs?  What 
are the policies of the government that has made Canadians poorer 
today than when he was elected in 1993, that has created more 
child poverty today—

report is not news to me, nor to my department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at some of the chronology.  In 1994 the auditor 
general looked at social assistance and gave us some 
recommendations for change.  The department responded immediately 
and commissioned a report.  When we received that report in 1996 
we shared it with the Assembly of First Nations. Together in

</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that she has been unaware of the 
crisis within her own department because her own officials have 
stonewalled her.  On the other hand, she is not able to obtain 
information from the grassroots Indian people about the horrific 
conditions under which they live because she will not meet with 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inasmuch as her own officials will not tell her the facts about

They focus on the need to modernize our programs. They focus on 
the understanding that indeed aboriginal peoples are going to be

</I></B></P><P align=left>In the province of New Brunswick the provincial government is

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that the tribunal found originally that at the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development,

these former workers, when no other action had yet been taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw the hon. member's attention to a letter, dated the 27 and 
signed by the union president, which I am prepared to table in the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to ask the government House leader the regular 
Thursday question.  I would like to know the business for the 
remainder of this week and the business for next week. 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wish to make the following 
business statement.  We will continue this afternoon with report 
stage of Bill C-2 respecting the Canada pension plan.  Tomorrow 
we will— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am sorry the hon. member 
is heckling his own House leader.  Perhaps we could get his 
attention.  I know this is a wild rose day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tomorrow we will consider report stage and third reading of Bill 
C-10, the tax treaty legislation.  This will be followed by 
report stage of Bill C-5, the co-operatives bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Monday and Tuesday we hope to conclude the remaining stages 
of Bill C-2.  On Monday we will have either report stage or third 
reading of Bill C-2, with the conclusion on Tuesday as the case 
may be depending on the stage reached this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Wednesday we hope to complete Bill C-5 followed by report 
stage of Bill C-9, the ports bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are ongoing discussions among House leaders every now and 
then to further develop the agenda, particularly as we near the 
Christmas recess.  I thank my colleagues, the other House 
leaders, for their usual co-operation.

agree with me that the language used in the House should be 
conducive to maintaining an atmosphere of calm and respect for all 
members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During oral question period, when the Leader of the Bloc 
Quebecois was putting a question to the Prime Minister, the member 
for Bourassa used offensive and disgusting language that is not 
even worthy of being repeated in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask you to request that he apologize and withdraw his 
remarks. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the National Assembly demand that the Federal Government 
not amend Federal Statute C-91, which refers to the pharmaceutical

last Thursday during debate in the House I made a comment to

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK219">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-2, an act to establish 
the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and to amend the Canada 
Pension Plan and the Old Age Security Act and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts, as reported (with 
amendment) from the committee; and of Motions Nos. 10 and 12. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  When the House interrupted the debate 
to proceed with question period the hon. member for 
Compton—Stanstead had the floor.  He has eight minutes remaining 
in his remarks. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
just before we started question period I was talking about the 
totally unacceptable tax burden on small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small business people are the real job creators in Canada.  The 
tax burden for small business in Canada is higher than in most 
competing jurisdictions.  Small business owners have to pay both 
employer and employee premiums.  This makes it very difficult for 
Canadian businesses to survive in today's global economy, which 
means fewer jobs and fewer job opportunities for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Study after study around the world have shown that high taxes 
kill jobs.  Jurisdictions with low relative tax rates have high 
economic growth and strong job creation.  Where the taxes are 
high, growth is low and there are fewer jobs.  That is a Polaroid 
picture of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within Canada our high payroll and corporate taxes form a 
barrier to jobs and growth by taxing businesses for every new job 
it creates.  It is a job creation tax.  That is unheard of.  The 
real solution is to create the conditions under which job 
creation by the private sector is sustainable over the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why it makes sense to cap increases to the Canada 
pension plan at 10.25%.  If the government is serious when it 
states that changes made to Bill C-2 will prevent premiums from 
rising above 9.9%, there should be absolutely no problem with 
requiring parliament to review the changes if premiums ever 
approach 10.25%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CPP is a fundamental part of the Canadian social safety net, 
an obligation that the government must honour.  Capping the CPP 
at 10.25% and reducing EI premiums are ways of returning the CPP 
to financial viability and protecting the investment Canadians 
have already made in the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party believes that the only way to deal with this 
challenge is to abandon our obligation to retiring Canadians and 
eliminate the CPP.  This approach is without merit.  The current 
government solution asks people to put even more of their 
paycheques into its hands every year.  This approach is without 
merit.  Canadians do not need a multibillion dollar tax hike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most experts agree that the best solution is to make the CPP 
fully self-financing.  In other words, enough new money should be 
directed into the plan today to ensure that it can pay the 
benefits due to those who retire down the road. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1510"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is possible to put more money into the fund and offset the 
cost by reducing EI premiums.  This plan has merit and it makes 
sense.  It would mean more money going into the plan without 
asking Canadians to pick up the tab and without creating more 
threats to job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small business is the engine of growth in the country.  We 
should encourage this engine to grow and run smoothly instead of 
forcing it to run out of gas and stall.  The House can and must 
make a difference. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the first motion has to do with what some have called a 
retroactive change.  It is important for members to know the 
dimensions of the change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently an employee pays 2.925% on their insurable earnings. 
The proposal in Bill C-2 would increase that to a full 3%.  In 
terms of dollars an employee earning $20,000 a year would be 
required to pay another $12.71.  It is important to keep the 
dimensions of the change in focus.  For example, if an employee 
were making $35,000, the ceiling for insurable earnings, the 
increase would be marginally over $17.  To keep it in perspective 
it is important to know the numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Calgary—Nose Hill raised the issue with 
regard to this change and the difficulty it may cause.  All 
members should know the increase that took effect in 1997 was 
part of the consultation process.  It was a change that was 
discussed. It was also approved by the federal government and 
two-thirds of the provinces representing two-thirds of the 
population.  This change was seen as an important starting point 
with regard to providing fuller funding for the CPP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of Motion No. 10 was to delete that requirement.  It 
is important for Canadians to understand that if the change is 
not made in 1997 the amount to be paid to get up to the full 
funding rate would have to increase.  It is a matter of a nominal 
change in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason, although there may be a case where temporary 
workers require adjustments, those businesses had consultations 
with the finance department as early as last spring and were 
advised of the change.  This is not a surprise to business at 
all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second motion in this group has to do with preventing the 
new CPP contribution rates from coming into effect unless the 
increases are offset by EI premium reductions.  In this area a 
lot of comments have been made by members which require 
clarification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the EI surplus, it tends to connote that $12 
billion will be sitting in some account somewhere, a surplus that 
is available to be spent for EI benefits or programs.  That is 
not the case. 
There is a notional account, an EI account, which keeps track of 
the premiums received and the benefits paid out but as a 
requirement or a recommendation that was accepted by the 
government from the auditor general the EI premiums are included 
in operating revenues, in the general revenue account. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1515"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would only have to ask what to do if there were a deficit in 
this notional account.  How would that be handled?  I think that 
is a very important question to understand.  If in an economic 
downturn the benefits paid out exceeded the premium base of the 
reserve there would have to be some cross-subsidization or some 
underpinning by other government revenues to be able to continue 
to fund and pay out benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that the EI fund actually was in a substantial 
deficit position in the last downturn of the economy in about the 
same magnitude as the surplus is now.  The amount of the surplus 
that is being referred to is not really out of line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the Minister of Human Resources Development's announcing 
a $1.4 billion cut in EI premiums, from $2.90 down to $2.70 per 
$100, is an indication that when it is sustainable and when it 
can be delivered and can be counted on by business there will be 
reductions in the EI rate as long as it is clear that those 
reductions in the EI premium can be sustained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of the discussion on this motion also has to do with some 
of the funding requirements of the CPP by taking some this 
notional surplus. As I explained, since there is no $12 billion 
surplus that will be sitting in some account somewhere to use for 
whatever purposes we want, actually what we are talking about is 
the size of the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to take funds out of the notional EI account we in 
fact are taking moneys out of the revenues of the government and 
therefore increasing the deficit.  I suggest that also is 
inconsistent with an important position of Canadians that we have 
to get our fiscal house in order. We have to deal with the 
deficit.  Also, what the finance committee has heard time and 
time again across the country through its exhaustive prebudget 
consultations is that Canada must continue to deal with the 
national debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debt, the deficit, it does not matter what we call it, the 
fact is we have a mortgage which we must continue to pay down on 
an orderly basis to have our house in order.  It is the reason 
why we have low interest rates.  It is the reason why we have one 
of the strongest records of economic performance and the 
strongest projected economic growth in the G-7.  It is because we 
have been getting our fiscal house in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should be very careful about suggesting that somehow 
there is $12 billion floating around that we could somehow use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another very subtle point but I think salient in this regard is 
that one of the principles that came out from the consultations, 
agreed on by consensus of the witnesses and by the federal 
government, the provinces and the territories, is that today's 
seniors will be insulated from the changes to be made to the 
Canada pension plan in order to make it sustainable for 
generations to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to somehow take moneys out of the general revenue of 
the government and increase the deficit what we are basically 
doing is asking today's seniors to pay something with regard to 
the CPP changes.  We are asking today's seniors, who already have 
their pensions fixed, who already have their retirement income in 
place and who have absolutely no major source of other 
opportunity, to change their current retirement situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members must remember that seniors do pay taxes.  Because they 
retire does not mean they have opted out somehow.  They continue 
to pay taxes on their pension income and on other investment 
income and other transfers from various sources.  They are 
taxpayers. To the extent that we take money out of general 
revenues and increase the deficit or reduce spending on some 
other areas or have to increase taxes, which I doubt will happen, 
it would therefore be asking seniors to bear some of the burden 
of the changes in the CPP.

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important to also emphasize this aspect of 
insulating today's beneficiaries under the CPP from having to pay 
for some of the portion of funding future benefits of today's 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has to do with the fact that they came through two wars and 
the depression of the 1930s and 1940s.  Their working careers 
were smaller than we have enjoyed today.  Their opportunities to 
build up a nest egg for their retirement were restricted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the real world there is a process of arbitrage and fairness 
and equity.  The CPP was built on that process of fairness and 
equity and today's seniors will be protected by these changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, they must be assured that they will not be 
negatively impacted by the changes being proposed under Bill C-2. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to spend a few 
moments speaking on Motions Nos. 10 and 12. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion 10, proposed by the member for Calgary—Nose Hill, 
intends to delete the requirement for workers and their employers 
to make extra contributions for 1997, which are the maximum of 
$24 each for employers and employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The contribution rate for employers and employees in 1997 is 
2.925% and employers have been submitting their employer-employee 
contributions based on that rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 59 of Bill C-2 amends the existing schedule of the 
contribution rates to require employers and employees to pay 
the 3% in 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I state that the motion deletes the mechanism for 
collecting the extra contributions resulting from the amended 
contribution rate for 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion would require that the extra contributions be 
collected starting at the beginning of 1997.  Since it is 
impossible to undo the past, the motion is in fact eternally 
flawed.  I am sure that is not the intent of the member who 
has put forward this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me spend a few moments talking about what the departments 
have done to deal with the anticipated increase in the CPP 
premium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Departmental officials did meet with several staffing groups 
concerned about the 1997 rate collections.  Revenue Canada did 
reflect the new higher rate in the 1997 withholding tables, which 
it puts out each December. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Putting new tables in mid-year is quite expensive for the 
government and administratively cumbersome for employers.  The 
government did try to make employers aware of the possibility 
that the 1997 rate could be changed during 1997 so that employers 
had as much notice as possible to deal with this situation and 
they could take appropriate action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I stated, Revenue Canada alerted employers in December 1996 
and contained this information in the 1997 withholding tables. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance indicated in his February 14 statement 
that the extra money for 1997 would be collected at tax filing 
time.  Revenue Canada again informed employers in May of the 
procedures for collecting the 1997 premiums.  Again, finance 
officials talked to a number of employers and their associations 
over the spring and summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been ample attempts by the departments and the 
governments to inform employers that in fact this anticipated 
increase is coming and tried to work with them to deal with the 
administrative concerns they may have had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to talk for a second on the mechanism to collect. 
Employers file, every February, a T-4 reconciliation statement 
that is used as a final year end reconciliation for EI, for 
Canada pension plan premiums as well as other taxes that are 
collected and withheld from employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This T-4 reconciliation form is the form that would be 
used to collect the 1997 premiums.  There is no additional 
administrative burden put in place as a result of having to 
collect these 1997 premiums in 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes that were made do eliminate that administrative 
burden and if we had made those changes mid-stream we would have 
caused much greater hardship on the business community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Motion No. 12, it attempts to prevent 
the new CPP contribution rates from coming into effect for 1997 
through 2000 unless the increases are offset by decreases in 
employment insurance contributions from employers and employees. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1525"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT65"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT65"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1525

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that there is no link between CPP and EI. They are 
separate programs that serve purposes and rates are established 
independently.  EI premiums nevertheless have been reduced since 
1994 and they will fall again from $2.90 to $2.70 which is a $1.4 
billion expenditure on behalf of the government.  This completely 
offsets the 1998 CPP rates for workers and more than offsets the 
increase in CPP rates for employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has committed over and over again that it will 
continue to lower EI premium rates as soon as it can.  However, 
the overwhelming message from Canadians throughout the entire 
consultation period was that the government needs to take action 
now to fix the CPP so that the contribution rate does not rise 
above 9.9%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part of the motion deals with the steady state 
contribution rate.  The motion intends to prevent the steady 
state contribution rate from exceeding 10.25% regardless of the 
chief actuary's calculations.  Establishing a cap of 10.25% is 
clearly inconsistent with the CPP financing principles set out in 
the act.  The principles require a constant contribution rate 
that can be sustained.  The 9.9% steady state contribution rate 
is based on prudent assumptions and we are therefore confident 
that the rates will not exceed this level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was also some discussion earlier from the Conservative 
Party about the so-called tax grab.  Let me be very clear that it 
is not a tax grab.  This is a contribution of savings toward 
pension.  When these contributions are made and collected by the 
government, they go into a separate fund.  They do not go into 
consolidated revenues; taxes go into consolidated revenues.  They 
will go into a separate fund and will be invested like other 
pension plans.  That is what Canadians have asked us to do and 
that is what Bill C-2 will do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the existing legislation, CPP contribution rates are 
already set to climb above the 9.9% rate.  In fact, the rates are 
scheduled to reach 10.1% in 2016, so we are reducing the amount 
that the existing contribution rates would end up being if we did 
not bring forward Bill C-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chief actuary has shown that if we do not move fast, the 
Canada pension plan will be bankrupt by 2015 and the rates will 
have to soar to 14.2% in 2030, which is a 140% increase.  No one 
on this side of the House is saying that the CPP premiums are not 
going up.  Clearly they are going up but they are going up so 
that we can sustain the plan.  They are not going up as high as 
they would have if we had done nothing.  For the first time in a 
long time the administration of this government has taken action 
to save the CPP plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same cannot be said about the prior administration which sat 
there and watched the CPP go into disarray.  It sat back and said 
it would do nothing, that it should be left to become 
someone else's problem.  We do not want that to happen.  We are 
reflecting what Canadians have said.  We had the consultation 
period.  Bill C-2 reflects what Canadians have told us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The responsible thing to do to avoid bankruptcy and truly 
intolerable rates is to put forward Bill C-2 to ensure the Canada 
pension plan stays solvent and provides the security Canadians 
are asking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member from the Conservative Party continued to talk 
about the increases in the CPP premium.  He referred to an $11 
billion tax grab.  Let us be very clear.  He fails to mention 
that because of the changes that have been made in this bill, 
premiums would ultimately be $11.5 billion if we compared it to 
the existing schedule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about doing something for future generations, when 
we talk about ensuring the pension plan is solid, when we talk 
about doing it in a very balanced manner, and when we look at the 
premium increase versus the changes on the benefits side, we will 
find on review of Bill C-2 that we have met those criteria.  We 
have ensured that the concerns of Canadians have been reflected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces have played a very large part as joint stewards of 
this plan in the federal-provincial negotiations.  We have an 
agreement that is clearly a balanced approach that will ensure 
the Canada pension plan will be there for Canadians well into the 
future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise this afternoon in opposition to this particular 
amendment which is being put forward.  I want to rise in 
opposition as the small business critic for the New Democratic 
Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at this proposal and I see that the amendments they are 
putting forward in many ways do not bode well for small business. 
Small businesses have a lot of challenges right now.  They are 
faced with the pending increase in interest rates.  Small 
business people have always had challenges with respect to 
capital acquisition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also looking at the huge increase in profits by the banks 
year over year. The only conclusion one can draw from that is 
that not only are they receiving a huge amount of increased 
profits and revenues from consumers in this country, but also 
from the small and medium size businesses which employ the vast 
majority of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Business is also faced with the challenges of the GST collection 
on behalf of the federal government.  This is a burden the 
government has put on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally of course the issue that we will be dealing with this 
afternoon is the payroll taxes as they are called. They are 
basically programs which assist small business owners to provide 
some level of support in terms of a pension plan, or unemployment 
insurance plan, or disability plan for their employees.  By the 
way, a vast number of businesses and owners of small businesses 
employ those who own the businesses so this is something that is 
very important to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the amendment outlines in terms of this particular bill is 
it proposes that any increase in the contribution rate with 
respect to the CPP for the years 1997 through 2000 shall not come 
into effect unless the cumulative increase in anticipated 
revenues under the Canada pension plan resulting from the changes 
in the contribution rate after December 1996 are offset by at 
least a cumulative decrease in anticipated combined employer and 
employee contributions under the Employment Insurance Act for 
those same years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some information which I would like to share. The Canada 
pension plan has been a very helpful program for small business. 
If small and medium size businesses did not have such a plan, 
they would be forced in many ways to commit greater resources, 
which are limited to them, to establishing their own type of 
pension plan.  As we know, establishing a pension plan for a 
small number of employees on their own would be very costly and 
prohibitive.  There would be less pension coverage for employees 
who work in the small and medium size businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to share with members in the House today some information 
which was provided and accumulated by Statistics Canada on 
self-employment.  Self-employment grew rapidly both in absolute 
and relative terms between 1989 and 1996.  During this period 
self-employed workers accounted for more than 75% of total job 
growth.  Seventy-five per cent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the period 1989 to 1996 the number of business owners 
increased by 25%, by a margin of 457,500 compared to an increase 
of 1% or 132,700 in the number of employees.  In essence small 
business has employed more people over the years.  Most of those 
who became self-employed during this period worked alone and did 
not hire other workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned about the rapid increase in CPP premiums.  As 
the small business critic and spokesperson for the New Democratic 
Party caucus, we believe that contributions should be increased 
at a slower rate over a longer period of time to allow 
self-employed people to adjust their businesses and to allow 
small and medium size businesses to adjust their forecast and 
financial analysis to meet these increased payroll taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the majority of business people want to continue in 
the program.  That is the information I have received.  But the 
information I have also received is that they want more time to 
ensure that they are able to adjust their revenues.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, small business cannot announce a 25 or 50 basis 
point increase in the charge for their services like the banks 
can.  If they do, they just do not seem to stay in business very 
long. Whereby the banks are large businesses and are basically 
oligopolies and can do whatever they want with respect to 
charging these very same small and medium size businesses 
increased rates at the drop of a hat.  They do this on a 
fluctuating basis without a lot of rationale, far too often 
costing small business and self-employed people a great deal of 
anxiety, anguish and concern, not to mention the fact that it 
jeopardizes their business and their way of doing business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saskatchewan registered the highest proportion of self-employed 
workers in 1996.  Saskatchewan is the province I represent. If we 
exclude agriculture from these numbers, actually British Columbia 
had the highest incidence of self-employment in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely important to us in Saskatchewan as in other 
parts of the country, but more in particular because of the 
agricultural economy.  Many farmers have incorporated and they 
are paying their own contributions. They are self-employed. In 
many cases family members work in the incorporated partnerships, 
farm operations or agricultural operations and they pay their 
Canada pension plan premiums as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who are self-employed pay not just the employee share, 
but the employer share.  It is a very big concern for 
Saskatchewan business people in terms of a quick increase in 
premiums in a short period.  This underscores our position in the 
NDP that we should take lower increases over a longer period of 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the most recent data available, average earnings 
among self-employed individuals in 1995 were 91% of average wages 
and salaries.  The distribution of earnings among the 
self-employed is more polarized than the earnings of paid 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 approximately 23% or 392,800 self-employed workers 
earned less than $10,000. Almost one-quarter of self-employed 
workers earn less than $10,000 a year. That means they are very 
restricted in terms of discretionary revenues and discretionary 
income to meet these higher increases in Canada pension plan 
premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About 45% of self-employed workers in Canada earned less than 
$20,000 a year. At the other end of the distribution, only 4% of 
self-employed workers earned in excess of $100,000.  In 1995 the 
average earnings of self-employed women were slightly higher than 
one-half of their male counterparts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Underlying the distribution and earnings of self-employed 
workers is the amount of time self-employed individuals work. 
Compared to paid workers, self-employed workers are more likely 
to work either short or long hour work weeks.  But part of the 
earnings gap between male and female self-employed workers is 
undoubtedly attributed to the fact that male self-employed 
workers worked a longer work week. In 1996 male self-employed 
workers worked an average of 13.3 hours more per week than their 
female counterparts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This particular proposal in my view is also detrimental to 
women, whether they are in small business or not.  The increases 
and changes in CPP will affect women most in a very negative way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the growth in self-employment between 1989 and 1996 was 
voluntary.  It is estimated by Statistics Canada that only 12% 
were pushed into self-employment because there was no other work 
available.  This particular statistic means that we have a trend 
in our country whereby more and more people are being frustrated 
in terms of finding employment and therefore are going into small 
business.  We also have a trend where more people are interested 
in working for themselves because they have not had a proper deal 
with respect to their employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a number of things I want to raise but the final thing I 
will talk about is this.  I want to agree with the Liberal member 
for Mississauga South when he said that these increases are of 
concern to him.  They are of concern to us in the NDP.  We agree 
with him on this point, that we should not put the EI surplus 
into the Canada pension plan benefits.  That jeopardizes the 
employment insurance program which was set up to insure workers 
who are unemployed.  We feel that is not only a 
cross-subsidization but really a wrong way to deal with it.

period of time to meet the needs of a very important program.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK228">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-2, an anct to 
establish the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and to amend 
the Canada Pension Plan and the Old Age Security Act and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts, as reported (with 
amendment) from the committee; and of Motions Nos. 10 and 12. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have this opportunity to make a few remarks on this bill, an 
act to establish the Canada pension plan investment board and to amend 
the Canada pension plan and the Old Age Security Act and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2, which the finance minister introduced on September 25, is 
a reform of the Canada pension plan, among other things. 
This reform has three main components. The first one deals with the 
level of capitalization of the plan which will increase from two to five 
years of benefits, as suggested by the minister. The second one provides 
for the optimization of the plan's performance through the establishment 
of an investment board. And the third one is a series of changes to 
certain benefits, such as the disability benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Implementation of these measures depends on Bill C-2 going through 
the parliamentary process. In order to assess this reform, I would like 
to give the House if I may a brief background of the CPP. The plan goes 
back to 1966, when nine provinces opted in, while Quebec created its own 
plan, the Quebec pension plan, which is also being revised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada pension plan pays benefits totalling about $17 billion 
a year. This includes survivor and disability benefits. Right now, the 
plan has enough money in reserve to pay two years worth of benefits, 
which amounts to some $39 billion. Of course, this reform will have a 
significant impact on Canada pension plan premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now talk about the various amendments, starting with Motion 
No. 12 put forward by the Conservatives, which says that, for the years 
1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000, any increases in the contribution rate 
provided for in the bill shall not come into effect unless they are 
offset by an equivalent decrease in employment insurance contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion also says that the contribution rate for self-employed 
persons shall not exceed 10.25% except if the chief actuary is of the 
opinion that a higher contribution rate is warranted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the idea of a decrease in employment insurance 
contributions to offset the increase in CPP premiums. However, the 
cumulative decrease proposed by the Conservatives is equivalent to a 80 
cent decrease in the EI contribution rate. Such a decrease is not 
compatible with the Bloc's position, which calls for an enhancement of 
the program in addition to a significant decrease in the contribution 
rate, because we think that the reform went to far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now my mouth is watering in anticipation of what I am about to say 
on the other amendment, this one being proposed by the Reform Party. 
We thought we had seen everything, but this tops it all. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment proposed by the Reform Party calls for repeal of 
the section of the legislation allowing retroactivity of the 
increase in contributions for 1997.  At this time, the agreed CPP 
contribution level is 5.85% and the act will allow this to be 
retroactively raised to 6% for 1997.  The Reform Party members are 
against this retroactivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel that, in politics, at some point one has to see beyond 
the end of one's nose.  I was pleased to be able to speak at the 
first reading of this bill.  Opposition parties are always 
described as being there to get in the face of the government.  I 
do not believe this is the case. 
The Bloc Quebecois is in favour of such a bill, except that I note 
that its vision is rather a long term one.  If I want to receive 
benefits some day, at some point, we have to start realizing that 
there must be more money in the fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, I am in agreement with this reform.  It imposes a 
surcharge on taxpayers, in that people will have to contribute 
more.  It is like another tax.  I know that the people will not be 
delighted at that, but we have to look several years down the road. 
We have to be able to look at our children and tell ourselves that 
it would be worthwhile for them to have the same advantages we have 
had all our lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Reform is telling us is that this is a tax increase. 
This makes no sense; they are playing politics with blinders on. 
I find this very frustrating.  We in this House see our share of 
short-sighted policies. 
I need only think of the position taken by the Minister of the 
Environment, who, very quietly, will take a position much like that 
of the United States.  It is true they say greenhouse gases are 
serious business, but what about future generations?  I am not just 
thinking about myself.  Policies being formulated now will have an 
effect in 20 or 30 years when I will be 40 or 50.  I think they 
should give thought to future generations when they establish 
policies.  Policies on sustainable development as they are called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were the son of a Reformer or rather a Reform member, I 
would be wondering how I could look my children in the eye and say 
“Sorry, my education did not cost me a lot.  When I finished 
university, I got a job and it did not take long.  When I retired, 
I had a pension plan and one heck of a retirement. 
Unfortunately, you my son, will have to pay for your university 
education”.  What is more, this morning in committee, a Reform 
member said he was opposed to loans and bursaries.  I am not going 
to get into this, but as I said, the Reform approach is sort of 
“You are going to pay dearly for your university education.  When 
you get out, you will not have a job, and that is no problem.  When 
you retire there will be no pension, because the coffers will be 
empty”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand.  I am not into partisan politics.  I do 
not want to divide the Bloc Quebecois, the Reform Party and the 
Liberal Party.  I am talking much more of a generational thing.  I 
feel sorry for the poor people my age who vote for the Reform Party 
in Alberta and British Columbia.  Perhaps it is time they looked at 
their policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, this shift to the right is of great concern to me because 
such policies widen the gap between rich and poor. It is like saying to 
young people: “Our generation was rich, but we don't care if you have to 
live on a shoestring”. This makes me very uncomfortable. When I talk 
about the gap between rich and poor, I am talking not only about long 
term policies, but also about things that are happening right now. My 
colleague from the NDP mentioned the banks. One of my Bloc colleagues 
will soon propose a reform package to encourage banks to become more 
socially involved in our communities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is time for policies that are more concerned with 
social issues. This shift to the right will lead us nowhere. It only 
redistributes the money so the rich get richer while the poor get 
poorer. The poor must resort to violence to be heard, leading to total 
anarchy. I do not want that kind of society. I want a fair system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Your generation enjoyed a rather fair and equitable system. My 
generation and that of my children deserve a system that is just as 
fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I intend to keep Reform members on their toes. As long as they keep 
moving such phoney amendments—I have no qualms about calling them 
phoney—I will rise in this House to take them to task.

<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Iftody (Provencher, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
my pleasure today to speak briefly on the motions before the 
House and the debate about the Canada pension plan in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having sat on the finance committee and having heard from 
Canadians both on the larger question of the general finances of 
the country leading up to our budget and on the CPP, it has 
provided me with an opportunity, I believe, to speak to a number 
of points and to add some clarifications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for the New Democratic Party, the critic for small 
business, referred to a number of points with respect to the 
Canada pension plan contributions and the effect on small 
business.  Indeed, it is true that it will have an effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is important to point out a number of features within 
the tax arrangements between the provinces and the federal 
government on the CPP question.  That is to say, that with some 
of the tax measures that are currently available, there is 
possibly a $900 increase in the Canada pension plan between the 
employer and the employee.  After tax it is more like around 
$700.  I believe those features have to be brought out with 
respect to small business and for the assistance of small 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking about small business, the member for the Conservative 
Party, who spoke eloquently earlier here in the Chamber, talked 
about the plans of the Conservative Party with respect to 
unemployment contributions and tying that into the CPP.  It is 
important to remind the House—and I am sure it is not lost on 
all the members here and those who were here between 1988 and 
1993—that the current leader of the Progressive Conservative 
Party voted many times and repeatedly to raise contributions to a 
level of $3.30 per $100 of earnings against the small business 
people and employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have done in the four short years on that particular 
question with respect to employment contributions is lower it, 
indeed with the most recent changes a few days ago, to $2.70. 
Taken all together over the past four years, this puts $4.2 
billion back into the hands of small business people in Canada 
and their employees.  This is an important contribution.  As was 
pointed out by the parliamentary secretary earlier in the debate, 
we will continue to work toward that goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really a false assumption to say that we have this large 
and looming surplus in the employment fund when, as members know, 
previously, around 1989-90, we had a deficit.  Was it proper 
then?  I would like to ask the opposition if it was immoral, as 
some had suggested at the committee table, to take money now from 
the surplus?  Was it immoral at that time, for example, to ask 
Canadians to pay that deficit fund under the EI fund which 
accounted for billions of dollars? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is prudent practice in terms of consolidating the revenues of 
the Government of Canada and to balance those out.  Certainly in 
times of surplus, last week we made a $1.4 billion contribution 
back to the employees. 
If it runs into a deficit financing position again, obviously we 
would be prepared to back that up and to support that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Referring to the CPP specifically, one of the things the Reform 
Party has not done to address this important debate is the 
primary antecedent or variable that shapes this whole discussion 
on the Canada pension plan.  Thomas d'Aquino, President of the 
Business Council on National Issues, for example, when he came to 
the table of the House of Commons, specifically asked the 
opposition parties what they were prepared to do with the $600 
billion debt that was on the table momentarily and what we are 
going to do with this liability over the next 25 to 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been no constructive proposals brought forward in 
this regard.  Most certainly the plan of the Reform Party for 
this super RRSP may benefit a few but it certainly is not going 
to help the majority of Canadians who make contributions at an 
average of $3,000 a year.  It certainly said nothing, absolutely 
nothing, about the $600 billion liability which we are trying to 
address in this formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very interesting that even in the province of Manitoba, 
recent reports from Stats Canada, and reported in the local 
newspaper in Manitoba <I>The Winnipeg Free Press</I>, that the 
average contribution in Manitoba for RRSPs was less than $3,000. 
Surely these contributions are not safe enough to provide that 
template, that safety net for all Canadians into their future. It 
is just not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words what I am saying is that the ceiling we have 
employed at this point in the RRSP contributions of $13,500 is 
exercised and enjoyed by only a few.  The plan for the RRSP will 
not do that. This says nothing about the absence of a disability 
plan or some compensation for widows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada pension plan and the long term proposals we have put 
forth to the House and through the committee are responsible 
plans.  It should be acknowledged that yes, the plan has fallen 
short of its goals and its objectives.  No one could have 
foreseen, certainly the crafters and drafters of these documents 
could not have foreseen, a reasonable person could not have 
foreseen in 1965, 1967 and 1968 that successive generations of 
adults would not be having larger families than we currently 
have, two or three children per family.  This is the central 
feature.  Demographics cannot be lost in this debate in terms of 
their effect on ability to pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what we are trying to do by responding to the auditor 
general, to outside consultants' reports and by looking at the 
overall view and the long term health and prosperity of the 
country.  What we are doing now will provide that template to 
make sure those people who are 60 years old now, those who are 
turning 50 this year and in 10 years will be thinking more 
acutely about their retirement, whatever their arrangements are 
and whatever packages are as a combination of their work 
benefits, family inheritances, RRSPs, are secured into the future 
for their retirement.  Further, the younger generation, those for 
example between the ages of 30 to 40, can have the degree of 
certainty to know that they will need to have a secure pension 
plan into the future as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to conclude my comments by saying that over the next 
number of months and in the upcoming budget we are responding to 
the needs of small business in Canada.  The recent reductions in 
the employment insurance, the changes in the CPP to provide a 
stronger stability and predictability in financial planning for 
small business, the reduction in interest rates as well are 
helping small business and keeping the economy moving and 
growing.  This is particularly so in Manitoba where we are 
enjoying record growth in our exports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the amendment is wrong.  I believe the motion by the 
Conservative party to bring these two important programs together 
is a misleading one.  It will not be helpful to small business 
and ultimately will not be helpful to Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
dealing here with nine different motions, most of them in my name 
and one from the Conservative Party.  I only have 10 minutes, so 
I just briefly want to touch on the motions in my name on behalf 
of our party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 11 relates to the new investment fund that is being 
established by the legislation.  The amendment is to put other 
objectives into the fund in terms of where it is to be invested. 
Right now the only objective is to maximize the return for the 
contributor. That is a very laudable objective.  In addition, we 
believe there should be some other objectives, such as investing 
in the Canadian economy, in industries and sectors that would 
create more jobs for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The model would be la Caisse de dépôt et placement. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objectives of the Caisse de dépôt in Quebec were quite adequate 
for a long time; they supported job creation and economic growth.  The 
Quebec economy grew stronger and stronger thanks to the Caisse de dépôt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must have similar principles and goals for the Canada pension 
plan. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 11 would create some of the goals and objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 13, is extremely important to members of the NDP. 
This is the one that would reindex the year's basic exemption. In 
the Canada pension plan there is a basic exemption of $3,500 
which has been indexed over the years.  That indexation is now 
going to be eliminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Canada pension plan was formed back in 1966 the basic 
exemption was approximately $400.  People making less than $400 
would not contribute to the Canada pension plan.  The government 
of the day and the Parliament of the day in their wisdom decided 
to index that $400.  Now it has gone up from $400, to $500 to 
$1,000, to $2,500 and now up to $3,500.  Low income people are 
not making contributions to the CPP on anything they earn up to 
$3,500. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, the government, despite the advice of a lot of people in 
the country, has decided to deindex that basic exemption so low 
income people will be paying more and more into the Canada 
pension plan.  That is why we have put forward these amendments 
and that is why the changes are regressive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Across the way there are Liberals who are ashamed of this 
change.  I am sure that if you could speak out, Mr. Speaker, you 
would be ashamed that low income people in Kingston are paying 
more and more into the Canada pension plan.  Now, that is not the 
tradition of Lester Pearson and Paul Martin, Sr. and the 
progressive Liberals of the 1960s that brought in a Canada 
pension plan that was progressive.  That is gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why these amendments are not supported by the 
governments of British Columbia and Saskatchewan which have the 
good fortune to have NDP governments which are very enlightened 
and very progressive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 15 is of great interest to my colleague from 
Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre.  He spoke very eloquently on the 
previous motion which is very similar to this one.  This deals 
with the problem of the self-employed who are going to be hit 
very hard by the changes to the CPP.  The premiums are going up 
from 5.85% over six years to 9.9%.  The self-employed person will 
have to pay both the employer and the employee contribution of 
9.9%.  That is going to be very difficult for self-employed 
people who are on the lower income scale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a wealthy accountant from the Toronto or Mississauga area 
who is making $200,000 or $300,00 a year as a self-employed 
person, it does not really matter. 
However, it is very difficult for the small businesswoman who is 
struggling along at $20,000, $30,000 or $40,000 a year, to pay 
10% of her income into the CPP.

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My motion will make this contribution progressive as well.  The 
lower income people who are self-employed will pay proportionally 
less and a wealthy lawyer or accountant from Mississauga will pay 
proportionally more.  Who could oppose that outside of the 
wealthy who come from Mississauga?  And he is a Liberal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure in the days of the old progressive Liberals like Paul 
Martin, Sr. or Pickersgill or Pearson, they would never have 
dreamed of doing this to the self-employed people.  I am sure 
they would not.  That is another motion I present to the House 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Winnipeg North Centre is extremely interested 
in Motion No. 16 which would restore the benefits to where they 
were since there will now be a reduction in benefits.  This 
reduction will affect women the most, especially low income 
women.  That is very regressive.  And—

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-2, an act to establish 
the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and to amend the Canada 
Pension Plan and the Old Age Security Act and to make 
consequential amendments to other acts, as reported (with 
amendment) from the committee; and of Motions Nos. 10 and 12. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, before 
royal assent I was discussing Motion No. 16.  I suggested that it 
is a very important motion because it restores the benefits to 
their current levels.  Many people will experience a cutback to 
their benefits under the legislation.  It will make accessibility 
to benefits more difficult.  It is a step in the wrong direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 17 has been moved by the NDP under my name.  It would 
restore the old formula for the calculation of disability 
benefits under the CPP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the Liberals across the way in their new 
conservative style have decided to make it more difficult for 
disabled people to collect benefits under the Canada pension 
plan.  They are hanging their heads in shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Disabled people are finding it more difficult to get benefits. 
This is happening at a time when we are experiencing economic 
recovery in the country.  The so-called Liberal government is 
taking it out on the disabled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be willing to sit down if the Liberals would get up to 
explain why there is an attack on the disabled. I am puzzled as 
to why the party of Paul Martin Senior and the party of Lester 
Pearson would do that kind of thing.  It is amazing.  They are 
going after those who are most vulnerable in society.   They are 
making accessibility to disability benefits more difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I plead with the government to accept this reasonable amendment 
to return to the formula that currently exists in the Canada 
pension plan for the disabled to receive benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 18 is also very interesting.  It is a departure from 
the current Canada pension plan.  Currently there is a maximum of 
$35,800.  Above that maximum people do not make any further 
contributions on their earnings.  What actually happens is that 
the person who is making $35,800 pays as much into CPP as a 
senator, a member of Parliament, the Minister of Finance or 
Conrad Black, who is a friend of the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask again if that is fair.  I ask the hon. member for Abitibi 
if that is fair.  That member is a free spirit.   He should be 
rising in the House and saying that it is not fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My motion would make it more progressive.  It would ensure that 
people who make more money would make contributions on the money 
they make above $35,800 a year.  Some might say this is a radical 
idea that could not be sustained.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The upper limit for contributions to the United States pension 
plan is $85,900 Canadian a year.  That is over two and a half 
times higher than what it is in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us make it more progressive when it comes to people who are 
making $50,000, $60,000, $100,000 or $150,000.  As members of 
Parliament we should be paying a bit more of our income into the 
Canada pension plan to make it more progressive.  It would be 
more progressive than the contribution rate for low income 
people.  It would be lower.  It would not be 9.9% but much lower 
than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning to Motion No. 19, there is a cutback in benefits to 
women.  They want to restore the formula so that low income 
people receive the same kinds of benefits they are getting today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not asking for too much.  The economy is starting to turn 
around.  Why penalize women?  Why penalize the disabled?  Why cut 
back on survivors benefits?  The death benefit is being cut back 
from about $3,500 to $2,500.  Again many widows are receiving 
that benefit.  Once again it is an attack on women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My Motion No. 22 is self-explanatory.  In a nutshell those are 
the motions I moved.  There is also one Reform motion in this 
grouping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This group of amendments would restore progressivity to the 
Canada pension plan.  I would like to see one or two progressive 
Liberals, one or two so-called left wing Liberals or pink 
Liberals, getting up in the House of Commons to offer a bit of 
support to a couple of these amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Abitibi may do that.  He used to be a 
Conservative MP.  Now he is a Liberal MP.  Why does he not 
continue that move toward the left by getting up and supporting 
some of these progressive amendments.  It would be good for his 
constituents and good for Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean Dubé (Madawaska—Restigouche, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to correct the hon. member.  This grouping contains 
a Conservative motion as well as his amendments. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have the pleasure to propose an amendment to Bill C-2, based on 
the principle of equity for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it stands, Bill C-2 freezes the basic annual exemption at the 
$3,500 level.  I wonder on which planet the authors of this bill live, 
but they seem not to know the word “inflation” over there.  It reminds 
me of the George Orwell novel <I>1984</I>.  Whenever the characters in that 
book wanted to get rid of a reality, they would ban the use of the word 
depicting that reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we all know that this is not how things work in the real 
world. 
Everybody knows that it is not because Bill C-2 ignores inflation and 
its impact on low income workers that inflation will disappear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 in its present form does not provide for a review of the 
basic exemption.  How much do you think the $3,500 of today will be 
worth in 2017?  In 2037? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In clear terms, workers who think they can manage with this 
exemption will gradually get smothered by inflation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government pretends that freezing the year's basic exemption 
at $3,500 accounts for as much as 1.4% of the premium decrease, 
but in fact such a case cannot be considered as a real premium 
decrease of 1.4% since they will end up paying a higher premium 
on higher income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this what we call creative taxation? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should not have the power to change a fundamental 
and essential program such as the Canada pension plan without explaining 
to Canadians all the consequences of the changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that is exactly what it is doing because it does not 
explain the impact of this deindexation of the basic exemption and it 
does not specify which Canadians will be affected. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1625"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The freeze of the basic exemption in contributory earnings will 
have more impact on low wage earners, particularly women, students and 
residents of disadvantaged areas.  I should say will have, again, more 
impact on these people.  And I thought that the message sent to the 
government on June 2 by several regions had been received loud and 
clear! 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party strongly believes in equity.  If 
the growth of the plan is stronger than forecasted by the last actuarial 
report, we could have some room allowing us to restore indexation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that there should be a mechanism to allow for a review 
of the year's basic exemption.  Bill C-2 already provides for a review 
of the plan every three years.  What we propose is that the year's basic 
exemption be reviewed also in 2006. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we manage a return on investment comparable to the return of 
private plans over the next ten years, it would not be necessary to 
freeze the basic exemption forever.  This is the only way to have some 
equity in this bill.  We should not forget that the people most affected 
by the freeze on the year's basic exemption are the young, women and the 
self-employed, 45 per cent of whom earn less than $20,000 per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, young people are severely affected by the reform of the 
pension plan. 
In simple terms, they will pay much more than those before them and get 
back only a fraction of what those before them received and will be 
receiving. So much for intergenerational equity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for women, it is a secret for no one that their socio-economic 
profile is generally such that they will not be able to benefit from the 
plan as much as men. Does Bill C-2 contain anything that may help 
counteract this? No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this government chose to include for these women is a year's 
basic exemption, which will gradually be eaten up by inflation. The same 
goes for self-employed workers who, in addition, have to bear the burden 
of paying both the employee's and the employer's share of premiums. The 
same goes for people from depressed areas struggling with horrible and 
outrageous levels of unemployment. The same goes for all low income 
earners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing, absolutely nothing, in Bill C-2 for these people. 
There is nothing in here to ensure that Canadians are treated equitably, 
nor, for that matter, in the employment insurance program, the other 
major social security program, which once was the pride of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of compensating working taxpayers by reducing employment 
insurance premiums by a fair amount, which would help consolidate 
existing jobs and create many new ones, the government stubbornly 
insists on offering symbolic reductions and mini-reforms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, observers agree that this is a step in the right 
direction. The problem is that, when I leave my riding, in New 
Brunswick, and head west toward Vancouver on the Trans-Canada highway, 
I am also going in the right direction, but I am very far from my 
destination. At the rate premiums are going down, I will not even make 
it to Regina by New Year's day.

</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, we, in the Progressive Conservative Party, believe in 
equity for all Canadians. Since this quest for equity is also one of our 
fellow Canadians' most serious concerns, it is essential that a 
mechanism be provided for in Bill C-2, that will allow the amount of the 
year's basic exemption to be reviewed on a yearly basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And because equity is a value shared by the members of this House, 
I encourage them all to vote in favour of this motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to stand and participate in this debate on changes to the 
Canada pension plan.  I congratulate my colleague from 
Madawaska—Restigouche and the other members of our Conservative 
Party who have mounted solid arguments and amendments to try to 
fix this ill conceived plan that the government has brought 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, and this is probably the only time this will ever happen, 
I want to commend the Minister of Finance for the amendments he 
brought forth yesterday.  I did not get a chance to speak on them 
then but I was happy to see that the minister listened to our 
concerns about his bill and being silent on the auditor general's 
ability to request documentation on the CPP investment board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we pointed out to the House, the auditor general himself 
indicated that there were no guarantees in this bill that would 
ensure he could request the documentation that he needed to 
oversee the board's operation.  With the amendments he submitted, 
the minister clarified that situation and we were very pleased 
that he finally saw the light even if it was for only a brief 
moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to speak today so I could talk about Motion No. 15. 
This motion was introduced by one of our colleagues from the NDP. 
It proposes that self-employed persons pay a CPP premium 
rate according to their incomes.  We believe this is a very good 
idea and a very good recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to remember that self-employed persons are required to 
pay the employee's portion and the employer's portion of the 
premium.  When rates go up even a little, self-employed persons 
have to bear the brunt of the entire increase.  In other words, when 
rates go up 
to 9.9% the self-employed have to pay $9.90 to the government for 
every $100 they make.  That can be very hard, especially when we 
know that in 1997 more than 2.5 million Canadians were 
self-employed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consider for a moment that according to Stats Canada, 45% of the 
self-employed earn less than $20,000 a year.  At $20,000 a year 
you do not have a lot of disposable income left after you give so 
much of your pay cheque to the government.  We must help those 
millions of Canadians who are trying desperately to earn their 
livings and to have their dignity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can help low income Canadians by lowering payroll taxes. That 
is the argument we bring forward today when we say that the hike 
in CPP premiums should be offset by reductions in EI premiums.  I 
was very pleased to see that the minister came forth after I rose 
to speak in the House and lowered it by 20 cents. However, 
according to the actuarial report he should have lowered it by 
90 cents because he will still have $40 billion in an account by the 
year 2004. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can also help self-employed workers by making them pay CPP 
premiums according to a sliding scale based on their 
yearly revenue.  If you make only $20,000 a year, you could pay a 
lower rate than someone who makes $60,000 a year.  It is a small 
measure but it can make a big difference in the lives and the 
pocketbooks of many Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time in our history a whole generation of 
Canadians is unsure that it will be able to enjoy the same 
quality of life its parents did.

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians worry that some of our most fundamental 
institutions and values such as health care and Canada pension 
plan might not be there for them and their families when they 
need it.  Canadians have every right to expect the federal 
government to set the right priorities and policies and to chart 
the right course to achieve what they need for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need an innovative, realistic plan that sets new priorities 
for government as part of a long term vision for our future.  One 
of these priorities is security for retirement for all Canadians 
and more especially the restoration of the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 30 years the average age of Canadians will be higher than the 
present average age of the population of Florida, with no 
corresponding adjustment in temperature.  A lower birth rate and 
increased life expectancy, along with a sharp rise in disability 
claims, also put new stress on the CPP.  The CPP has also been 
jeopardized by inadequate contribution levels and inefficient 
plan management as a consequence of faulty legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CPP funds, for instance, have been loaned to the provinces at 
the rate Ottawa pays on its 20 year bonds.  This is less than 
what the provinces pay other bond holders and it is also less 
than what private sector plans earn.  No wonder Canadians think 
the government cannot add. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The liberal plan to fix the CPP is basically a $11 billion tax 
hike on working Canadians out there and employers over the next 
six years.  This is coupled with already high EI levels which the 
Minister of Finance, as I have stated, has refused to lower, the 
90 cents he should have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What this government is doing with these changes to the CPP is a 
traumatic tax grab that will have a devastating effect on job 
creation.  If we were in power, we would increase CPP 
contribution rates to levels adequate to ensure the long term 
viability of the plan.  However, these increased contributions 
would be offset by a substantial reduction of personal income tax 
rates and EI premiums.  This means putting more money into the 
plan without asking Canadians to pick up the tab and without 
creating threats to job creation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would also make provisions to finance the extra cost per year 
of seniors benefits resulting from demographic changes. We would 
also ensure that the mandate of the Canada pension trust and its 
trustees would be to advise the government on required 
contribution levels and to select the best private managers 
acceptable to the industry to invest the fund's growing surplus 
to secure long term returns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is most important that we guarantee all our young people 
today, not just the ones who are sitting in the House, but those 
across the country, that there will be a retirement plan for 
them, a Canada pension plan for them.  It is up to each and every 
one of us to make sure this happens.  Now it is our generation's 
turn to become nation builders.  Part of that responsibility is 
to ensure that Canadians of all ages and all circumstances can 
count on a secure retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that unless Bill C-2 is amended to meet the 
changes that our party is advocating and that the NDP is 
advocating as well, the Liberals will be passing the biggest tax 
increase this country has had in a long time and it will impact 
and hurt every Canadian very hard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members of this House to consider this very 
seriously. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was pleased to 
give up my turn to the member for Saint John earlier, the reason 
being that there is a shipyard in her riding, as there is in my 
riding of Lévis.  This may strike you as odd, but all parties 
sometimes have something in common. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I listen to her, the old saying about not having your 
cake and eating it too came to mind.  Basically, she is deploring 
the fact that the population is aging and that the CPP can be 
expected to cost the government more.  If one were consistent, one 
would then admit that more money needs to be put into the fund, but 
that is not what she is saying. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT79"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT79"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1640

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the contrary, she is saying that it is an unwarranted and 
unacceptable tax hike.  We in the Bloc Quebecois feel the same way. 
The population is aging and there will be an increase in the needs 
of seniors, of those retiring in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But there is worse.  We must not forget those to follow, 
subsequent generations.  Earlier, the member for Lac-Saint-Jean 
spoke of his concerns and fears as a young person for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There must be no mistake about this.  The Liberal and 
Conservative governments should have taken action much sooner.  If 
we look at the demographic patterns, at the statistics, it is 
obvious that there will a problem to resolve. 
It could have been foreseen and resolved much earlier, but this was 
not done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We therefore find ourselves in a situation where there is a 
mad rush to build up the fund, to make it more efficient, more 
productive, as Quebec did several years ago by setting up its 
Caisse de dépôt et placement.  The Caisse is the pride of 
Quebeckers.  Being a staunch sovereignist, I am delighted to see 
that the federal government wants to copy Quebec.  This augurs well 
because it is also an admission that the Quebec government's 
solutions are sometimes good ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But back to the amendments.  Following this line of thought, 
Motion No. 13 is admittedly a bit special.  The New Democratic 
Party and the Reform Party agree on something.  This worries me. 
What is the explanation when we see people from parties with completely 
different ideologies agree? Why is it that they agree on that when they 
are at opposite ends of the political spectrum? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are also against it. They want to have their cake and eat it 
too. That is not possible. There comes a time when we have to make a 
choice, and this choice is now before us. The Bloc Quebecois' position 
is that the fund for the pension plan absolutely has to be increased. 
That is why we cannot support amendments designed to limit the assets 
going into the fund. For us, it stands to reason that it should operate 
this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other amendments have more or less the same objective, and the 
motives in the case of Motion No. 14 are the same. I do not have much 
too say on Motion No. 15. We have to admit at times that we do not 
understand very well. I hope the NDP members will be providing more 
information because, as it now stands, this amendment serious questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for Motion No. 16, it calls for the deletion of the section 
dealing with the new rules for calculating the benefits. These rules 
state that the pensionable earnings average will be determined by taking 
the last five years, instead of the last three years as is presently 
done. We are against this amendment for the reasons outlined before. 
This would have the effect of not ensuring the long term viability of 
the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for Motion No. 17, I do not have any comments. On Motion No. 18, 
if I understood correctly, the member for Qu'Appelle wishes to increase 
the contributions, so that the maximum earnings would go from $35,000 to 
$70,000. If that is what is meant, we can announce right now that we 
will be against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for Motion No. 19, it calls for the deletion of the clause that 
provides for stricter requirements on the payment of benefits in the 
case of combined retirement and disability benefits. 
There is something I do not understand in all this. When a person is 
disabled, it is necessarily because he or she is sick or has a 
disability. I think everyone would agree that a person with a disability 
has a higher cost of living. Equipment and facilities that generally 
cost more are required.

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same thing in the case of people who have an incurable 
disease. They need medication, many types of services, and people to 
help them. So I think we have to accept the principle that people with 
a disability, when they are retired, need extra support to continue to 
live under conditions that are as normal as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So these are the main arguments. Other colleagues from my party may 
also have observations on this, but that is the position of the Bloc 
Quebecois on Group No. 6. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am happy to speak to this again.  There are some new 
amendments before the House and I want to say a few words on 
behalf of the New Democratic Party caucus with respect to these 
amendments to Bill C-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by thanking the member for Saint John and 
her caucus in the Conservative Party for supporting some our 
amendments.  I have worked off and on with the member for Saint 
John over the years and I find her to be a very co-operative 
person on many issues.  She does not totally agree with our 
philosophy, but she sure agrees with a lot of it.  I just want to 
acknowledge that today and thank her for her support on these 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I deal specifically with Motions Nos. 11 and 13, 15 
through 19 and No. 22, I want to say a word about No. 21 on which 
I understand the government has undertaken to follow the advice 
of the NDP.  The NDP suggested that the auditor general be the 
auditor of record for the Canada pension plan benefits.  I 
understand by reading the orders of the day that the government 
has put forward an amendment suggesting that the auditor general 
be the auditor of record for the Canada pension plan.  That is 
something all parties would agree to support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Motion No. 11, the NDP has a bit of a problem 
with accumulating a large surplus without reinvesting in our 
communities, our local businesses and our provinces with respect 
to infrastructure and creating jobs.  Our motion provides some 
recognition of the fact that the Government of Canada and the 
people who support the funding of the government, the taxpayers, 
unanimously agree that government is a going concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we mean is that when we are in business there are certain 
long term obligations, whether it is capital costs or capital 
accumulation.  There are long term costs when it comes 
specifically to pension benefits for some business people.  This 
motion we are putting forward acknowledges that the government 
has a going concern status, which means that it is going to be 
around for a long time and has a source of revenue that 
fluctuates on a regular basis, but is consistent.  If it is a 
stable concern it can fund a pay as you go pension plan more 
easily than a corporation or a business that is having financial 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The notion of an unfunded liability is not really pertinent to 
the Canada pension plan as we know it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Motion No. 13, we are very concerned about what 
the government is doing with respect to deindexing the yearly 
earnings.  When the minimum is deindexed, there is a burden on 
those at the lower income scale.  Our basic amendment freezes the 
year's basic exemption, the YBE, at $3,500 beginning in 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are proposing to let it float, let it be indexed for 
inflation.  My colleague from Qu'Appelle indicated earlier that 
in 1966 when the plan was initially created as the result of a 
lot of hard work from the CCF and the New Democratic members 
across the country, the minimum yearly basic exemption was about 
$400. At that time the maximum was about $4,000 on earnings.  It 
was a ratio of about 10 to 1. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT81"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT81"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1650

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we see the basic yearly earning being $3,500 on the basis of 
contributions made on a top salary of $34,000, so about a 10:1 
ration has been sustained.  We feel that if this is not sustained 
on a long term basis, it will hurt those people who need the 
support most.  We are very concerned about this.  We are asking 
in this amendment to make sure that the yearly basic exemption is 
indexed with inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Motion No. 15, I know the Bloc had some concerns about this. 
We believe very strongly that employees are getting away from 
paying the Canada pension plan share because many employees are 
hired on a part time basis.  They are paid up to about $3,500 but 
they do not qualify to pay pension contributions and then they 
are not called back.  These are mostly part time workers, women 
and others, who would suffer.  We are asking that this minimum 
$3,500 be adjusted particularly in the face of work in this 
country which is ever-changing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Motion No. 16, my colleague from Qu'Appelle 
basically indicated very clearly what we after here.  We want 
better benefits for our seniors.  Our change proposes that the 
benefit formula in the calculation is altered.  The net effect is 
to provide increased benefits as opposed to reducing benefits, 
which the government wants to do.  It seems to me that as we get 
older and inflation kicks in and the cost of living increases, we 
want to provide our seniors, our pioneers, with some sense of 
security so they will not have to rely on welfare and other 
things to get by on in their retirement years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Motion No. 17, we propose to delete clause 69 
because 69 is really attacking those who can least defend 
themselves.  It reduces benefits for the disabled.  It really 
attacks those who need more support as they get older.  For 
example, we have a worker who works for 40 years, turns 55 or 56, 
gets injured, does not have a disability plan and cannot work. He 
or she does not contribute in those last eight or 10 years, which 
are crucial for CPP benefits to maintain a higher pension when he 
or she gets older.  Therefore they diminish their pension for the 
years they need it the most.  These are people who are injured. 
They are not people who are abusing the system or taking 
advantage of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Motion No. 18, we want to uncap the ceiling.  We 
are proposing that the $35,800 be increased.  For example, the 
National Council of Welfare is quite disappointed that the size 
of earnings are not considered an increase.  Under current 
arrangements, CPP contributions apply to a relatively narrow band 
of earnings.  Of the larger earnings base, contribution rates do 
not have to rise so quickly.  The trade off would soften the 
impact on workers with lower than average wages.  Those who are 
earning more money can afford to pay a little bit more and 
subsidize the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 the rules of contributory earnings begins at the year's 
basic exemption of $3,500 and goes up to the year's maximum 
pensionable earnings of $35,004, a rough approximation of the 
average industrial wage.  In the United States the upper limit is 
not $35,004.  The upper limit for social security in the United 
States is about $62,700 U.S. which is about $88,000 to $90,000 
Canadian.  We are pegging ours at a measly $35,000.  We believe 
it would be in the interests of Canadians to explore the impact 
of expanding the upper limit of contributory earnings to the 
Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 19 amends Bill C-2 by deleting clause 76 which in 
essence, if clause 76 remains, is another attack on women. It is 
unnecessary and it fails to provide a good overview with respect 
to how the CPP works and how it impacts on future benefits for 
Canadians. 
Why the changes?  Reduction in combined benefits, reducing the 
ceiling for disability and survivor benefits.  We do not want to 
reduce them.  We want to increase them.  We are suggesting our 
new combined benefit calculations should be increased for 
survivor, retirement and disability benefits.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will end my comments by summarizing that we believe these 
changes are beneficial to those people who need it most, those 
people who are disabled, those people who have a lower income. We 
believe if we adopt these changes we will have a more viable 
Canada Pension Plan for not just the next four or five years but 
for as long as our country exists.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, right now we are having a rather lengthy discussion 
about Group No. 6 amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effect of these amendments is pretty much as follows:  to 
increase the level of benefits given in a fair number of areas, 
better benefits for the disabled, better benefits for survivors, 
mostly women, better benefits period.  This is something that we 
would all like to see happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would all want to see everyone in our country, probably 
everyone in the world, be very comfortable in their retirement 
and indeed throughout their whole lives.  It would be wonderful 
if we could generously protect everyone and even make sure they 
have the luxuries of life.  The thought, the intention behind 
these amendments is something we would all agree with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, as we all learn from the time we are young, our 
wants come at a cost.  When we purchase something, we must have 
money to do that.  The reasonable question for Canadians is what 
level of benefits can we afford.  Are we willing to pay for them? 
This notion that somehow “the government” is going to pay for 
it is simply a myth.  The government is us.  It is taxi drivers, 
hairdressers, people who are working hard every single day, 
paying their money into these programs and funding the benefits 
that come out of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have amendments saying “We want more”.  The question 
is how much can we afford?  We have to remember, and I am sure 
the members who proposed these motions have not forgotten, that 
already this program is $600 billion in the hole.  Six hundred 
billion dollars is a fair chunk of change.  There is about two 
years worth of payments only lying around to the pay the benefits 
that have already been promised.  Yet we now have a demand for 
more benefits where we have almost no money to pay the ones we 
have got already and some members are saying “More, more, 
more”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no money available to pay for the ones we have.  I guess 
the question has to be asked:  where is the money going to come 
from? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two amendments that are possibly talking about where 
the money is coming from.  They are kind of an interesting mix. 
One amendment is to uncap the ceiling on earnings on which people 
must pay benefits.  That would make higher income earners pay 
more into the program than lower income earners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other amendment would say that premiums must be based on 
income and in a sense that is the same thing.  If a person earns 
less, they pay less premium and if they earn more, they pay more 
premium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all respect to the members, we have to decide, and I think 
this might be a good time, whether this is really a pension plan 
or whether it is a social program, whether it is an income 
redistribution program. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is just an income redistribution program, let us not 
mislead the Canadian public by saying that it is a pension plan. 
Contributions are paid into a pension.  They are invested and 
everyone benefits from that.  That is a pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have never heard of a pension plan where some people pay some 
money in and some people pay more money in and, then, at the end 
of the day some people get more out and some people get less. 
That is not a pension plan.  That is an income redistribution 
program.  It is a social program.  It is entirely different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to say that this is a social program let us be honest 
about.  I actually agree it has been run like a social program in 
the past.  Benefits have been paid to people who have not put in 
sufficient investment to get them out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Investment will be put into the plan by people who will not get 
the value of their investment out.  Then let us not call it a 
pension plan.  It is a fiction if we operate it this way and 
pretend it is a pension plan.  It is not a pension plan.  There 
is no pension plan in the world that operates in this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is a social program where we take from the rich and give 
to the poor let us at least be honest about it.  That is exactly 
what the majority of the amendments are proposing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I for one think that if we are to run a pension plan let us run 
a pension plan.  If we are to help the poor and disadvantaged 
with retirement security, there are other instruments in society 
to do that.  We should get on with that.  Let us not subvert or 
convert a pension program for the purposes that are being talked 
about here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I notice the objectives of managing the fund keep coming up. NDP 
members say that we have to use it for other objectives to build 
infrastructure and help the economy.  If this is actually a 
pension program it belongs to the people who made investments. 
Their sole purpose is to get a pension out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I dare say members of the New Democratic Party would not go to 
CUPW or any other union and say “By the way, the pension moneys 
you pay into your union pension fund should be available to the 
provinces to use for infrastructure and for economic 
development”.  They would get pretty short shrift if they went 
to union members and said the pension funds should be used for 
broader objectives. Yet they are saying to Canadians that their 
pension investment should be used for other good works and to 
help economic development in the provinces when necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That totally flies in the face of logic, good management and the 
expectations of Canadians.  I do not see any logic, good sense or 
proper management in the proposals.  The one proposal I support 
is to make sure that the year's basic exemption continues to be 
tied to inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As other members have pointed out the year's basic exemption, 
the minimum amount of money that does not require a premium to be 
paid, started out at $400.  We can imagine if it was frozen at 
$400 and the government went to workers and said “Aren't you 
lucky you do not have to pay premiums on your first $400 of 
earnings?” The workers would say “Whoop-de-doo, big deal”. 
Because of inflation the basic exemption has had to rise to 
$3,500.  After a few years, if we do not tie this to inflation, 
$3,500 will be worth to workers exactly what $400 is today, 
nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very sneaky way of taking even more premium from low 
income people who can least afford it.  I think it is dishonest. 
I think it is unwarranted.  It certainly flies in the face of the 
stated intention of having a year's basic exemption in the first 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would certainly urge the government to get rid of taxation by 
stealth.  If it is to take money from people, it should at least 
be done in an honest and forthright way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to increase benefits for everybody.  I certainly 
would like to retire on a much bigger pension than I expect I 
will, having given up my MP pension. 
I did not think it was fair in light of what other Canadians can 
expect.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would 
like to discuss Motion No. 11 put forward by the NDP.  Basically 
if we voted for this amendment we would be negating our Motion 
No. 12.  The NDP amendment would eliminate clause 59 of the bill, 
which sets out the premiums to be paid now and in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree that certain measures must be taken to ensure the 
stability of the CPP now and in the future.  That includes 
raising CPP premiums.  We also believe that hiking CPP rates 
would put payroll taxes at a level which would stifle job 
creation.  It would place a tax burden on Canadians that would be 
hard to take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we can agree with raising CPP premiums they must be offset 
by a reduction in EI premiums.  As it stands the EI fund has a 
huge surplus.  During the election campaign we argued that EI 
premiums should be reduced 70¢ per hundred dollars.  If members 
do not want to take our word for it, they can take the word of 
several business organizations that have echoed our position and 
said that premiums could be reduced 60¢ to 70¢. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some business groups have recognized that reducing payroll taxes 
will not necessarily create jobs but that increasing payroll 
taxes will stifle job creation.  The government recently ignored 
all these arguments in favour of reducing EI premiums 
substantially.  It reduced them by a mere 20¢, not nearly enough 
to offset the $11 billion tax hike with CPP premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP motion would eliminate higher CPP premiums altogether. 
That is irresponsible, to say the least.  We cannot turn a blind 
eye to the crisis facing the CPP.  Millions and millions of 
Canadians are counting on us to save the CPP for now and the 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certain decisions have to be made.  The government wants young 
Canadians to foot the bill almost entirely.  The NDP does not 
want anybody to foot the bill.  We want to spread the bill as 
equally and as fairly as we can.  I believe our amendments will 
do that.

pleased to address Bill C-2 and to tell you why my party supports this 
legislation, thus acting in a responsible way, as it always does. 
Indeed, when a bill is good, we are prepared to support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would like to briefly discuss Motions Nos. 11, 13, 14, 15,

Again, I am disappointed by the Reformers, the Conservatives and the New 
Democrats as regards this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the Bloc Quebecois opposed to Motion No. 11? The purpose of 
this amendment is to delete the clause allowing for an increase in the 
contribution rate. We are opposed to this amendment partly because we 
will partially restore intergenerational fairness through a faster rate 
increase.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Present workers and babyboomers will pay more than expected, and 
this increase will ensure the viability of the plan in the coming years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The increase in the contribution rate, as amended, is the result of 
an agreement between the majority of the provinces and is identical to 
the one proposed in the debate on the Quebec pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 13 put forward by the NDP provides for the deletion of 
the basic exemption limitation provision. Contributors to both plans 
benefit from an exemption on the first portion. The basic exemption will 
be fixed and premiums on total pensionable earnings will continue to 
increase based on salaries. 
That means that the more you earn, the more you pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc will vote against this motion. This cap on the exemption 
will have the effect of reducing the gap between the amounts used for 
calculating premiums and benefits paid. This cap represents in fact an 
increase in premiums for everybody, but this increase will be 
proportionally higher for low income people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The viability of the program for future generations and the need to 
maintain contribution rates at an acceptable level require that some 
concessions be made with regard to benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 14 put forward by the Conservatives calls for the same 
thing and we will vote against it essentially for the same reasons as 
those for which we will vote against Motions Nos. 13 and 15 put forward 
by the NDP. It makes no sense at all. I think even they do not 
understand. How can we understand this total mess? 
It makes no sense from beginning to end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 16, put forward by the NDP, also calls for the deletion 
of a provision that sets new rules for calculating benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not read through the motion. For the same reasons as Motion 
No. 13, we will vote against this motion because we must make 
concessions to ensure the long term viability of the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 17 is the same as Motion No. 14. As I was saying, we did 
not understand what it was about and we will vote against it for the 
same reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding Motion No. 18, if the amount is to go from $35,000 to 
$70,000, we are against the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for Motion No. 19 proposed by the NDP, we will vote against it 
motion for the same reasons as Motion No. 13. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, we will be voting against Motion No. 22 put forward by the 
NPD, because the lack of concern about the negotiations and the urgent 
need for action about the pension plan are costing us enough money 
without having to repeat the same errors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, I said that I wanted to tell the House why I, as the hon. 
member for Manicouagan, and my political party will be voting for Bill 
C-2. I was elected four times to the Sept-Îles city council and during 
the last term I was responsible for the senior citizens and the 
pensioners. There were two associations with a total number of 3,000 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of these senior citizens came to me and said “We worked 
awfully hard, we gave everything we had to take care of our children and 
to get a good pension plan”. They explained their concerns and sent me 
and my party a message. They wanted us to protect their rights and to 
think about young people too.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I want 
to speak to Motions Nos. 13 and 14. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 13 has been proposed by the NDP and talks about 
eliminating the freeze on the yearly basic exemption.  I cannot 
support that and I will go on to tell the House why a little 
later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am on my feet, I also want to speak on our Motion No. 14 
which would freeze the yearly basic exemption for 10 years only. 
I would like to frame this as best I can so that the House will 
know what we are proposing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The elimination of freezing altogether as proposed by the NDP 
would impose an additional 1.4% in premiums. Obviously when we 
are changing the principal amount of money that we are dealing 
with and the numbers of people who are paying, it has a huge 
impact on the fund.  We cannot operate in a vacuum when we are 
talking about the realities of finances. It would be fine if we 
could, but unfortunately we cannot. We need to make sure that the 
fund is stabilized.  The stabilization of that fund is paramount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, earlier today you were very gracious in allowing 
me a few more seconds than what I should have had in the debate 
when I was talking about this bill.  I talked about the 
government postponing the inevitable.  That is what has happened 
in regard to the Canada pension plan.  The government knew full 
well a number of years ago and certainly when it took power in 
1993 that something had to be done.  It could only postpone the 
inevitable for so long.  At some point reality comes home and we 
have to deal with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it was a normal business transaction in an insurance company 
in the private sector, it would have had to declare bankruptcy. 
It would be insolvent.  However in government, and this is the 
only place it can happen, the government has the power to take 
measures to resurrect itself almost from the dead.  Basically the 
fund at this point is dead.  The Reform member mentioned that 
there is about two years of premiums in the fund.  In other words 
in two years the fund will be broke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are really talking about is pay in and pay out.  It is 
on a day to day basis that the fund is sustaining itself now. 
The reality of having to deal with it is there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Picking up from where I left off earlier in the day, the chance 
to have dealt with this reality presented itself in 1993 but 
postponing it is only postponing the inevitable.  Now with 
compound interest and the demographics changing and moving around 
as they are and more people retiring and the pressures that are 
being placed on that fund, it has forced the government to 
increase the rates.  I would call it an astronomical increase in 
rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Getting back to the reality of it, we have to deal with the 
cards that we have. None of us in this House or in the country 
want to see the fund go broke.  There is an unfunded liability of 
$600 billion staring the government in the eye.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion that is proposed by the NDP just will not work.  The 
one proposed by the Liberals talks about an indefinite freeze on 
the basic exemption, and we are talking about a 10 year freeze on 
the exemption. The differences in these three divergent points of 
view reminds me of what Aristotle said 2000 years ago when he 
said that virtue was in the middle. It is in the middle, between 
the two extremes.  That is what our amendment does.  It is 
grappling with reality but it is not going to one extreme or the 
other.  We are looking at a 10 year exemption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What could happen in the meantime if the plan's earnings are 
invested wisely, and much more wisely than they have been in the 
past and are left untampered with, in a 10 year time period we 
could be looking at a completely different picture.  The reality 
at that time would be that maybe our plan of a 10 year exemption 
would work, but in the meantime we have to deal with the cards 
that are on the table.  I do not think any of us wants to duck 
that bullet because if we do, there is going to be a lot of hurt 
out there in Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think every member of Parliament is dealing with Canada 
pension plan problems galore back home.  A number of disabled 
people are applying for Canada pension, and rightfully so, and 
are being turned down. They are just not getting it. One of the 
PC party members from Nova Scotia spoke yesterday of some of 
these situations back in his riding.  That was during the 
statement period yesterday, right around 2.15, shortly before 
question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have the same type of cases back home.  People who have had 
hip replacements and cannot work.  People who have a chronic 
disease or a crippling disability and cannot work, some of them 
much younger than I am.  People apply only to find out that their 
applications are turned down, whereas just a few short years ago 
those same people would have been successful in their application 
for Canada pension plan benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have now is the government accepting the reality that 
the fund is almost broken, but in the meantime there are a lot of 
innocent people who are casualties because of the inability to 
deal with this fund in the last number of years.  In other words 
the fund is money in and money out.  The government is taking a 
very hard look at who qualifies for these benefits.  I think that 
is wrong.  It is absolutely wrong because we are brought up to 
believe that if we pay into the fund, it is going to be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we find out that mismanagement over a number of years has 
left a lot of Canadians out in the cold.  The worst thing that we 
could do at this point is to allow that mismanagement to continue 
and to not deal with the reality of having to readjust the 
premiums paid by you and me to sustain that fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Laying blame is not going to solve the problem.  It would be 
easy for me to stand up here and condemn the government for 
having to do what it is doing, which is fine.  And I do not agree 
with the huge increase in premiums either.  Nobody could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our position has always been and it continues to be to this day, 
that if we are going to tackle the question of the CPP, let us 
also look at the employment insurance fund. Canadians are paying 
too much into that fund.  It is just the opposite of the CPP.  We 
are paying too much into that fund.  Today as we sit, there is 
about a $12 billion surplus in that fund.

<A HREF="#LINKT87"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are saying very simply is that the surplus in that fund 
should be applied to reduce the premiums in the Canada pension 
plan or at least to reduce the EI premiums that all Canadians pay 
so that at the end of the day it is a wash and will not be an 
extra tax burden on Canadians and on businesses.  An increase in 
the CPP premium is really a hidden tax and we cannot stand any 
more of those hidden taxes on our businesses and professionals.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I want to talk about the huge problems Bill C-2 will create. This 
legislation reforms the Canada pension plan, without taking into 
consideration the needs and the interests of all Canadians. The Liberals 
would rather protect the wallets of the Toronto brokers and go after the 
most disadvantaged segments of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposals put forward have a disproportionate impact on women, 
the disabled and the low income Canadians. What is the government trying 
to do? Is it trying to compete against the United States to see who can 
best abuse the disadvantaged citizens in their respective countries? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 will make it even tougher to get disability benefits. It 
is bad enough that these Canadians have to overcome their physical 
disabilities, but now the government wants to reduce the number of 
individuals who receive these benefits. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is bad enough that the government is attacking people with 
disabilities by reducing the number of people who will receive 
benefits.  Now it has created a category of storm troopers who 
will harass the disabled to make sure they are worthy of their 
benefits. Does this government have no shame? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clauses 69, 87 and 107 of the bill must be deleted so that 
people living with a disability can do so with dignity and without 
being harassed by investigators.  Resources would be much better 
spent by increasing benefits and the number of beneficiaries. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Women will also be negatively affected by Bill C-2.  It is 
understood that because women leave the workforce to take care of 
loved ones, live longer and have fewer wages than men, women 
receive smaller pensions.  On average, women draw CPP pensions 
worth only 39% of an already low maximum benefit and only 57% of 
average benefits drawn by men. The government had an opportunity 
with this legislation to rectify these imbalances, but what did 
it do? It made the situation of women even more difficult. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most terrible things about this bill is that the 
amount of the basic annual exemption is no longer indexed.  That 
means the poorest in our society will pay more, but the richest 
will pay less as inflation rises.  Women in particular are 
penalized, because they are over-represented in the low income 
worker category.  We must ensure that subclause 61(2) is deleted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Women are also penalized under clause 76, which introduces a 
new calculation for disability, survivor and retirement pensions 
combined.  Women often live longer than their spouses, and this 
clause will go after the already modest income they apply for. 
Clause 76 must be deleted to ensure that the women and men affected 
are not further penalized. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to also add it is not a surprise that women are attacked 
since they are attacked in every way, if we look at the EI where 
women have been affected and also the way that the government is 
abusing its power by not paying the pay equity it owes to women. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-2 contains a number of problems, because according to 
the government's philosophy the economy is more important than 
people.  The Canada pension plan looks after workers.  Employers 
and employees contribute to it to ensure that Canadian workers 
enjoy a comfortable retirement.  So would it not make sense for the 
government to listen to workers in this country and come up with a 
system that means more money for them?  This would be the logical 
thing to do, but Liberal logic is not always comprehensible.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals will argue that they consulted provincial governments, 
but I never saw Franck McKenna protect the interests of New Brunswick 
workers. Also, union representatives came before the committee reviewing 
this bill to voice their opposition to the bill. Did anyone listen to 
them? Of course not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government made it very clear that it wants to protect the 
interests of the rich rather than those of Canadian workers. If the 
Liberals were really concerned about the situation of workers, they 
would reduce unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite simply, the larger the number of workers contributing to the 
Canada pension plan, the better it is for the system. If the Liberals 
really take the interests of all Canadians to heart, they will deliver 
on their promises and create the jobs so desperately needed by the 
unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals could ensure that the money paid into the Canada 
pension plan is reinvested in Canada. The Caisse de dépôt et placement 
du Québec is a good example, as funds are reinvested to help the Quebec 
economy prosper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does this government not want to give us any assurances that 
the Canada pension plan will be used for the benefit of companies here 
in Canada? Is it afraid of seeing the unemployment rate fall under 9%? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear, however, that job creation is not on the Liberal 
agenda. 
They would rather take the Canada pension plan and hand it over to Bay 
Street brokers to make even more money off it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP asks that a panel of experts oversee the activities of the 
board of directors. If this government is well-intentioned, it should 
not be afraid to have a panel of experts ensuring that friends of the 
Liberal Party act properly. If it is necessary to monitor people with 
disabilities who make, at best, slightly more than $800, it is only 
logical to want to monitor those who will be making millions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went through a number of problems Bill C-2 will cause. Simply 
put, this Canada pension plan reform will see retired Canadians become 
poorer and poorer. Over the past ten years, Canada has taken major steps 
to reduce poverty among seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will take us back to a time when seniors were even more 
vulnerable than they are today. We must see to it that this does not 
happen and that all Canadian workers can rely on a pension that will 
allow them to live with dignity.

has the courage of his convictions and he does not mince words, 
whether they are good ones or bad, he dares to express himself.  We 
could do well with more politicians like Mr. Parizeau today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Returning to the amendments proposed on Bill C-2 which we are

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the discussion on this 
group of amendments to Bill C-2 sponsored by the hon. member for 
Qu'Appelle who has done my party and the Chamber a great service 
by doing such a thorough job of researching and presenting 
alternatives to the provisions before us as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Stanley Knowles were here today he would be very proud of the 
work being done by the hon. member for Qu'Appelle and others. 
When Stanley Knowles passed away we said the best way we could 
honour his legacy would be to stand up for the programs he 
pioneered and to fight against any erosion, cutbacks or plans to 
terminate those very important programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he were here today he would have stood in the House and said 
to members of the Liberal government that they were doing a great 
disservice to Canadians and to our history and traditions of 
working together to ensure that everyone is guaranteed some 
measure of equality upon retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He would have said the proposals before us today in the form of 
Bill C-2 are a fundamental departure from everything we hold near 
and dear as Canadians, from the values of caring and sharing 
which have built the country.  He would have said to the Reform 
member for Calgary—Nose Hill that she was wrong to spread the 
myths and misinformation that have characterized this discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He would have reminded all of us that we were talking about a 
system which was not in crisis.  It is a plan that needs 
adjustment and changes but one that should not be changed so 
fundamentally as to cause its inevitable destruction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He would have said that we need balance.  We need to look at the 
sustainability of the Canada pension plan for the future.  That 
would mean some adjustment in the rates.  That would mean some 
changes in the benefit structure.  That would mean some increases 
in premiums.  However these points must be balanced with our 
sense of valuing human dignity in society today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He would have said to the Reform member she was wrong to suggest 
that the Canada pension plan was or should be a personal savings 
plan.  He would have said it was a social insurance program in 
the best sense of the words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He would have said that when Canadians supported the Canada 
pension plan originally they agreed to get together to pool the 
risk of providing for the loss of income we all face when we 
retire or become disabled.  In so doing all of us as Canadians 
work to create citizenship rights or entitlements that reflect a 
collective responsibility for and to future seniors. 
He would have told Reform members and the Liberal government not 
to tamper with a program, which means so much to Canadians, to 
the point where they will cause its demise.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He would have said this was not supposed to be a program or a 
policy based totally on fiscal management but was about human 
worth.  He would have said that this was not about the Reform 
view of society that this is a dog eat dog or survival of the fittest 
world.  The plan was originally intended to do the opposite and 
any amendments to the Canada pension plan should uphold those 
principles and those values.  He would have given our caucus all 
the support he could have mustered, for the amendments we are 
proposing today are right and just and deserve the support of 
every member of the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that context I want to focus specifically on a half dozen 
amendments before us in this grouping, the amendments that 
deindex the year's basic exemption of $3,500.  All of us by now 
should be aware that would download the burden of premium hikes 
to low income earners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about our amendment which seeks to change Bill 
C-2 in terms of its unfair burden on those who seek 
self-employment.  I want to support our amendment which addresses 
the government's attempt to alter the benefit formula 
calculation, leaving a net effect of reducing benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to support our amendment which addresses the government's 
proposal to change minimum contribution requirements for a 
disability benefit, the net effect being a reduction in 
disability benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to support our amendment which addresses the government's 
proposal to set maximum pensionable earnings at $35,800 so that 
those who make over the maximum pensionable earnings pay a lesser 
share than those who make under the MPE. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to support our amendment that addresses the government's 
attempt to reduce benefits in general for people with 
disabilities and for survivors.  In every one of those amendments 
we are attempting to stand for those people who are most likely 
to be forced into poverty.  Our amendments would raise people 
above poverty or remove them from poverty so that they can live 
their retirement years with dignity, respect and some sense of 
security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not ironic that today we are discussing provisions in a 
bill which disproportionately affect the lowest income people in 
society, that disproportionately affect women and that place the 
greatest burden in a negative way on people with disabilities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not interesting that we are debating those issues on a day 
when Campaign 2000 came out with its report card on child poverty 
in Canada?  The report card shows that Canada is second from the 
bottom in terms of the wage gap between the rich and the poor, 
second from the bottom out of nine selected OECD countries at the 
same time as being second from the top in terms of having the 
greatest comparative national wealth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are talking about the gap between rich children and poor 
children we are talking about the gap between rich families and 
poor families.  Children are poor because their parents are poor. 
The last thing in the world we should be doing today is anything 
that will widen the gap even further and will relegate poor 
children to absolute destitute poverty when they reach the age of 
65. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not enough that we have one of the worst records of any developed 
country when it comes to treatment of women?

<A HREF="#LINKT91"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it not appalling that we are talking about amendments that 
will put women further into poverty when we know we are already 
dealing with a situation in Canada where many women live below 
the poverty line and where the majority of older women live in 
poverty? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to a report by our own legislative library on women and 
poverty:  “Much contemporary research also indicates that most 
women in Canada can expect to live their later years in poverty. 
Statistics show that 45% of unattached women between the ages of 
70 and 74 live in poverty. The figure rises to 57% for women in 
the age group of 75 to 79 and skyrockets to 75% for women 80 
years of age and over”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report goes on to state that part of the explanation for 
such high poverty rates for the elderly lies in the inadequacy of 
the existing income security programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Council on Welfare has determined that in 1992 
maximum benefits from the old age security pension and the 
guaranteed income supplement for a couple living in a large city 
were more than $2,000 below the poverty line.  For unattached 
pensioners living in a large city the gap was $3,460.  And we 
today want to make that situation even worse?  We want to put 
more women into poverty?  We want to ensure that just because you 
are a woman, when you become old you are designated to live in 
abject poverty? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we not thinking about ways to have a balanced approach 
to income retirement security in this country?  Why are we not 
looking at ways to ensure people can live with dignity and some 
sense of security after they have spent their working lives 
trying to contribute to this country?  They have raised children, 
they have tried to hold down their jobs, they have juggled family 
and work responsibilities, they have participated in the 
community, they have gone to school advisory meetings to try to 
help on every front and we say that their entitlement after doing 
all of that is to live in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our amendments are an attempt to address that fact, and it is a 
fact.  It is a fact with this legislation.  If Bill C-2 goes 
forward as this government is so determined to have happen, 
without real debate, without accepting any suggestions, without 
listening to any of these amendments, we will see that day, and 
that can only be described as the most irresponsible action any 
government could ever take, to deliberately go forward with a 
policy that will hurt women, people with disabilities and low 
income people in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is after the government promised that any social policy 
initiatives would have a gender analysis.  Where is the gender 
analysis?  All we heard from the Minister of Finance was that an 
analysis was done which showed that women will benefit most from 
these changes because they live longer.  My goodness, what an 
insult to suggest that because women live longer we should be 
satisfied with the fact that we are getting anything at all even 
if it is greatly reduced, even if we are talking about peanuts 
every month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely in a civilized society we should ensure that everyone is 
entitled to decent security in their old age, in retirement and 
when faced with disability.  That is our goal today, to try to 
make sure the government listens and accepts these amendments so 
we can move forward to ensure we have a great nation of equality, 
dignity and security. 
<P><A NAME="LINK256"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will spend some time discussing points that were raised.  Motion 
No. 11 put forward by the NDP would eliminate the rate schedule 
as proposed, which basically means to revert to the existing 
schedule.  The chief actuary has indicated that if we make no 
changes now the fund will run out by the year 2015.  This is what 
the NDP would call “one of our reasonable amendments”, which is 
to do nothing. 
We have to do something.  We have to make sure that the Canada 
pension plan is still there. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1750"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT92"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP would prefer to apply the funds as well for regional and 
economic development rather than for investment to provide for 
the best possible return for Canadians so that we can keep the 
rates as low as possible and at a steady rate so that it is 
efficient in meeting the objectives of the bill and of the Canada 
pension plan as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second item on Motion 13 is with regard to the year's basic 
exemption and the fact that the $3,500 is not indexed.  It is 
important to put in context the amount that we are talking about. 
Inflation in Canada right now is about 1.7%  If the $3,500 
exemption on the CPP was indexed, it would result in a reduction 
of the Canada pension plan premiums otherwise payable by $1.89 
for the entire year.  The deindexation item with regard to an 
employee, the maximum for someone making $35,000, is only $1.89. 
The member who just spoke talked about throwing people into 
poverty.  I am afraid this is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last area I want to comment on—I know other members want to 
speak and the parliamentary secretary would like to comment on 
these—is with regard to the issue of self-employed persons.  As 
we know, self-employed persons pay both the employee and employer 
share.  Currently they pay the full 5.85% whereas an employee 
would only pay half of that if they worked for a company. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of reasons for that.  Members should know 
that under the Income Tax Act self-employed persons have a number 
of other opportunities within the tax system to reduce their 
taxable income.  It could be with regard to use of automobile, 
travel, entertainment expenses, tools, clothing and a number of 
things which are not available to employees.  In terms of the 
assessment of whether or not it is fair that a self-employed 
person should pay both sides of it, you have to look at the full 
tax consequences of being a self-employed person. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a chartered accountant, I can tell you that in certain fields 
there are a number of direct expenses related to that 
self-employed income that are deductible.  The same levels or 
kinds of deductions would not be available to an employee.  There 
is a balance of a process of arbitrage which makes these issues 
not as black and white as the member may indicate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would indicate that although there are a number of issues here 
they are self evident— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I hate to interrupt the hon. member 
but the hon. for Charlotte has a point of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I find this unbelievable. 
We are here debating one of the most important bills to come 
before this House, certainly in this session, and there is not a 
minister in the House.  It has always been the practice, Mr. 
Speaker— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member knows that it is 
improper to refer to the absence of members in the House.  I am 
sure he would want to comply with the rules in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to conclude my 
comments by clearly stating that, in my opinion, the comments 
with regard to the last speaker about the benefits available to 
seniors and those in poverty are going down are absolutely wrong, 
false and totally out of character with the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seniors should be assured that the benefits under the Canada 
pension plan continue at the same levels and are indexed.  They 
are guaranteed, they are secure and they will be there in 
addition to survivor benefits and the disability benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has misunderstood Bill C-2 and the provisions under 
the report stage grouping which we are dealing with.  I want to 
make sure that it is understood clearly by all members that 
benefits are not being reduced.  We should not fearmonger and 
scare seniors today that somehow things are going to happen here 
which will reduce their benefits.  It is not so.  Seniors should 
be assured. 
I want to assure them that the benefits under the Canada pension 
plan and the amendments of Bill C-2 will ensure that those 
benefits are there, they are secure, they are guaranteed and they 
will be indexed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For Canadians of all generations, the intergenerational equity 
is in place with these changes and all today's beneficiaries 
should be assured that nothing will change the benefits that they 
currently enjoy from the Canada pension plan. 
<P><A NAME="LINK257"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to make a few comments on 
each of the motions that form part of this group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Motion No. 11, I think it is important to point 
out that essentially this motion puts the financial 
sustainability of the CPP at risk, the very thing that the bill 
addresses.  The motion in fact would mean that instead of rising 
to 9.9% by 2003 and then levelling off, contribution rates would 
in fact rise to 10.1% and then to 14.2%, a 140% increase over 
current contribution levels.  That is in fact the motion put 
forward by the NDP.  This motion would impose an unfair burden on 
our children and grandchildren and never in fact make the CPP 
sustainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the question, does the NDP want to kill the CPP by 
neglect?  Let us do nothing.  We have heard a lot of rhetoric 
from the NDP today which is in full flight.  We did not hear 
anything of substance unfortunately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Motions Nos. 13 and 14, the federal-provincial 
governments have put the plan on a sustainable track through 
their negotiations after consulting with Canadians.  Freezing the 
YBE was part of the changes required to balance the cost of the 
program.  Despite the freeze, the low income workers will still 
pay contributions on a smaller portion of their earnings than 
higher income earners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the amendment put forward by the NDP and the 
Conservatives would remove an essential element of the 
federal-provincial package and would require a significantly 
higher long term contribution rate than the 9.9% provided for in 
this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also may be of interest to hon. members of the House to know 
that further examination of the basic exemption will occur in the 
next phase of the Canada pension plan reform studies.  More 
specifically, the federal and provincial governments have agreed 
to study Quebec's proposal for graduated removal of the exemption 
as income rises.  In fact there is a commitment on the part of 
the federal government and the provincial governments to the 
changes to the YBE in the next review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 16, essentially the measure that is the five year 
average of earnings, is similar in concept to how most private 
pension plans adjust for wage growth over a pensioner's working 
life.  The reduction again helps the costs over time and 
strengthens the sustainability of the CPP.  Again, I think it is 
very important to ensure that Canadians know that current 
pensioners and persons age 65 or older in 1997 will not be 
affected by any of the changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changes to the benefits that had to be made were in fact 
balanced.  This particular change is the only measure in Bill C-2 
which affects retirement pensions and it is therefore not only 
essential to the overall goal of sustainability but also to 
achieving an overall balance in the impact to the benefit 
changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effect of the motion as worded is somewhat flawed and in 
fact would make the legislation unworkable.  It would not be 
acceptable to take away this critical element to ensuring the 
long term security of the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 17 essentially talks about the labour force 
attachment rule.  The current provisions require very little 
participation in the workforce, in fact as little as a few months 
over the course of two years.  I think this is important because 
members of the NDP have been getting up all day and making 
comments that in fact what the government is intending to do does 
not reflect what Canadians have been saying.  During the 
consultations many Canadians have said that the current 
requirements of labour force attachment were not strong enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, with the changes put forward in Bill C-2, workers do have 
to demonstrate a slightly stronger attachment to the workforce to 
be eligible for the disability benefits.  The measure will not 
affect current recipients of the CPP disability benefits.  Under 
the proposed changes, workers must have made contributions in 
four of the last six years compared to the current requirement to 
work in two of the past three or in five of the past ten. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, it is also very important to make note of this.  The new 
coverage rules are still more generous than the original rules of 
the plan. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT95"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT95"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1800

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to 1987, workers had to contribute in five of the past ten 
years and also in at least one-third of the years from their 18th 
birthday in order to be eligible for disability benefits. We have 
seen the progressivity of the plan.  The new coverage rules are 
still more generous than the original rules of the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP has continued to focus on the disability aspect of the 
plan.  Persons with disabilities are not being singled out. The 
CPP changes are only one aspect of the government's broad agenda 
focusing on persons with disabilities.  It is also important to 
note that the federal and provincial governments are moving 
forward on a number of other strategies that will enable persons 
with disabilities to participate more fully in the economy and 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the CPP disability, the chief actuary analysis 
also points out that 75% of the proposed changes to keep the 
contributions to 9.9% are on the financing side and only 25% are 
on the benefits side.  It reflects the message from Canadians 
during consultations to go easy on the benefits side when fixing 
the CPP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Motion No. 18 put forward by the NDP, as worded 
the provision would be temporary in nature and would only be 
helping contributors who receive a benefit beginning in the 
period from 1999 to 2003.  This would be entirely unfair to other 
contributors, especially the future generations who will be 
paying for these pensions through their contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear contradictions in the House where the NDP continues to 
put forward the intergenerational argument and how it is unfair 
to future generations.  Here we have an amendment put forward by 
the NDP which would in fact do the exact opposite and put a 
greater burden on future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it was made a permanent feature of the program, the doubling 
of benefits as the NDP is asking for would also require an 
approximate doubling of contributions.  This would be 
unacceptable to the governments that are the stewards of the 
program, both federal and provincial governments, and also to 
Canadians who have asked us to ensure that the plan remains 
financially sustainable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point has been made over and over again by various members 
of the opposition parties other than the NDP that if we want more 
benefits, premiums have to go up.  The NDP have not formed any 
sort of argument that would deal with the premium side of the 
program.  Canadians have said to deal with the plan, ensure that 
it is sustainable, ensure that we go easy on the benefits side 
and ensure that it is balanced off with the premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Motion No. 19, I must stress that the proposed 
changes will not affect those who currently receive combined 
disability-survivor or retirement-survivor benefits.  The CPP has 
always had limits to restrict the stacking of benefits. The 
proposed changes bring the limits on combined benefits more in 
line with their original intent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to understand that the combined benefit 
provisions will have no effect on survivor recipients who are not 
also receiving another CPP benefit, that being a retirement or a 
disability pension in their own right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also may be of interest for hon. members of this House to 
know that there will be further examination of the role of the 
CPP survivor benefits in the next round of the federal-provincial 
review of the plan.  The object is to ensure as far as possible 
that all CPP premiums remain relevant to the needs of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one final motion to comment on in the time remaining. 
Motion No. 22 put forward by the NDP asks that we delete the 
requirement for increased contribution rates to cover the costs 
of new or increased benefits.  It is an important statement of 
principle and something that Canadians have continued.  It has 
certainly been very effectively communicated during the 
consultation process that the federal and provincial governments 
agree that any future benefit enrichments must be paid for, that 
we should never again put the security of the Canada pension plan 
at risk by enriching benefits without being willing to pay for 
them.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On the intergenerational issue, we must ensure the 
sustainability of the plan. We must do so not only for the 
seniors who are receiving the benefit now, the near seniors, the 
middle age Canadians, but for young Canadians. The changes we 
have made to the CPP will ensure that young people are not 
saddled with an unbearable burden. 
<P><A NAME="LINK258"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>   Mr. Speaker, I 
noticed that many of the amendments before the House simply want 
to delete items from the bill. They do not try to improve and 
they do not try to compromise.  They think that whenever they do 
not like something, it should be scrapped.  They do not think 
about the ultimate consequences and ultimate responsibility.  We 
have to be careful that we do not throw the baby out with the 
bath water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Progressive Conservative Party believe that the CPP 
must be saved. Canadians deserve it and future generations of 
Canadian deserve it as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our plan for the Canada pension plan which our amendments speak 
to has to be discussed today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that payroll taxes kill jobs. The communique “The 
Economist”, speaks to the fact that if we lower payroll taxes it 
will ultimately create jobs, but also that if we raise payroll 
taxes it will kill jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada pension plan provides a survivor's benefit. The 
government wants to raise the premiums by 73% and we know that 
will kill jobs.  We believe that premiums have to be increased in 
order to save the Canada pension plan and make it viable. 
Canadians want the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Federation of Independent Business is possibly one 
of the most democratic business organizations in the country.  It 
polled 88,000 of its members.  They said unequivocally and 
categorically that the Canada pension plan is part of the small 
business owner's plan for retirement. It is something that has to 
be saved. However, they know that payroll taxes will continue to 
kill jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a $14 billion surplus in the EI fund.  For the 
government not to connect that with the increase in CPP premiums 
will actually kill jobs.  We propose that if we have to raise 
premiums, we must at a minimum lower EI premiums.  When the chief 
actuary visited the issue with respect to the EI fund, it was 
said that the EI fund would be sustainable at $2 and would still 
be able to withstand a severe recession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has lowered EI premiums by a mere 20¢, from $2.90 
down to $2.70.  During question period today I was afraid that 
the Prime Minister would say that he was going to raise them back 
up to $2.80 because he was a little confused about the reduction. 
Reducing the premiums to $2.70 is only a drop in the bucket.  We 
need to get the premiums down to somewhere near $2. This would be 
good for small business.  It would be good for Canadians. It 
would save the Canada pension plan and would ensure that we saved 
jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the amendments before us do not recognize the need for 
change.  They do not recognize that we just cannot play around 
with people's pensions. We cannot eliminate what we do not like 
without any regard for the consequences.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Actually, this lack of responsibility reminds us of another 
party's plan for the Canada pension plan.  I think you know who 
they are, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party tried to save face by presenting a few 
amendments to the bill.  In fact, we agree with both measures 
that it proposes.  But let us remind everybody that this is not a 
change of heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party wants to eliminate the Canada pension plan and 
jeopardize one of the fundamental pillars of our retirement 
savings program. I agree with a lot of initiatives that the 
Reform Party presents from time to time, but there are some 
initiatives which are just plain wrong and some people might even 
say just plain kooky. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform's plan to eliminate the Canada pension plan would ensure 
that 325,000 disabled Canadians whose only source of income is 
the Canada pension plan would not have access to income from the 
CPP.  The party to my left wants to scrap the Canada pension plan 
and leave 325,000 disabled Canadians without a source of income. 
I say shame on them. If that party were the government, the 
Canada pension plan would be over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I campaigned for 36 days during the election this past May.  Mr. 
Speaker, you did as well.  You were there talking about the 
different issues in the election.  We talked about the need to 
cut taxes, pay down the debt, get our fiscal house in order and 
restore fiscal conservatism to this House and to this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the 36 days of the campaign, CPP came up on occasion. 
Every single day of that campaign I asked the Reform candidate 
who ran against me what Reform was going to do about the $500 
billion unfunded liability.  Unfunded liability.  What are Reform 
going to do with the $500 billion unfunded liability? Mr. 
Speaker, when I was on the campaign trail, and maybe when you 
were there as well, Reformers did not have an answer.  They did 
not have an answer for what they would do with the $500 billion 
unfunded liability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  What are you going to do with it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  We are going to save the Canada pension 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  That does not solve your problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  We are going to raise premiums as well, 
compensated with a reduction in EI premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the Reform plan with respect to the $500 
billion unfunded liability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the recent hearings on this the leaders of the parties 
sat down and spoke.  I am sure people might have seen some of 
this on television when the finance minister actually presented 
his plan to save the Canada pension plan and then the Leader of 
the Official Opposition presented his plan to save the Canada 
pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance committee in turn asked the Leader of the Official 
Opposition about the $500 billion unfunded liability.  What did 
he tell that committee?  I shake my head about the answer. He 
actually told the committee that it was a complex issue and it 
would take too long to explain Reform's plan for the $500 billion 
unfunded liability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You would think that after 36 days on the campaign trail and the 
whole summer and part of the first session of the House that 
Reformers would at least have some form of an answer about what 
they would do with the $500 billion unfunded liability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have read Reform's platform, and guess what?  It is not in the 
platform either. This fresh start is in fact a false start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to talk about this very issue in terms of how this 
party— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Not for very long.  You have 50 
seconds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in order to sum up, I will 
just make a couple of small points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That party does not understand the necessities or the wants of 
small business.  The Canada pension plan is what small business 
wants and Reform does not support that. 
They want to have a flat tax which would mean that ultimately 
small businesses, because they are private enterprises, would be 
rolled into taxable income.

need to provide small business with tax relief by cutting EI 
payroll taxes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-214, an act to allow taxpayers to inform government of 
their views on levels and priorities for the expenditure of tax 
revenues and to provide for parliamentary review of the results, 
be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, the bill I have introduced will be 
welcomed by all parliamentarians interested in improving their 
tools of representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A democracy functions best when people are well informed and 
through their representatives conduct the affairs of the country 
according to their will.  Information must be open and available. 
Procedures must follow acceptable patterns.  Decisions must be 
open and available for close scrutiny and all the information 
must be easily accessible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill provides for one of the most important pieces of 
information that could be made available to government leaders to 
be in their hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People should have a mechanism by which they can tell government 
how they want their money spent, the levels at which they want 
their taxes and what their spending priorities are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can see the excitement building in this place as I describe 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A government which is truly democratic would want to carry out 
the will of its people.  It would not just ask for support and 
direction every four years, it would want to receive that support 
and that input on a regular basis. Look at the excitement. That 
is what my bill is designed to do in a very important area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people's tax form act, which I have introduced in the House 
of Commons, has wide public support.  It has been around for a 
couple of years.  People up and down this country have been able 
to look at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I only wish that we had three hours to debate this.  I am sure 
many people would like to have input.  However, we only have one 
hour.  I only wish that the rules of the House required that all 
private members' bills were to be votable and I will work toward 
that end.  That is a change which needs to be made.  Otherwise we 
are just wasting our time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would Canadians think if they only had one store that they 
could shop at, which they were forced to shop at?  What would 
Canadians think if money were taken out of their pay cheque for 
the store manager to fill the store with all the things which he 
thought were important, not what Canadians thought they needed? 
What would Canadians think if they went to the store to shop and 
not only could not get what they wanted, but would be forced to 
buy and to take the things they did not need, did not want or 
could not even use? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does that sound far fetched?  Not really.  Any Canadian who pays 
taxes already shops at this store. 
It is called the Government of Canada.  At the end of every 
month we have to give our money and take whatever it decides to 
give us without having any input into it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government forces Canadians to pay high taxes and give 
taxpayers what the government wants, not necessarily what 
taxpayers want or need.  Pandering politicians and meddling 
bureaucrats often will say trust us, we know what is best for 
you, just keep handing over the money and be quiet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxpayers do not get any choice about the programs and services 
the government delivers to the taxpayers, to the people of 
Canada.  If they do not like it, they are told to vote for 
someone else in the next election, as if that is the only way to 
go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for us to change the way we do business, to 
democratize the system.  It is time to give taxpayers more say 
and some choice about how their money is spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I think the people's tax form is a tax form 
taxpayers would really like to fill out.  Why?  For starters 
because it is voluntary and because this is no ordinary tax form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxpayers would like filling out this form because it would let 
taxpayers tell the government where they thing the government 
should spend the thousands of dollars each and every taxpayer 
sends in every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people's tax form would let them identify the government 
programs and services taxpayers do not want to support with their 
tax dollars.  Does that not make sense, Mr. Speaker?  I see your 
excitement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Canadian taxpayers would say this is the kind of 
schedule that should be included in every Revenue Canada tax kit. 
Canadian taxpayers want to send a message to Ottawa.  They do 
not just want to send them the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Passing my bill into law would give Canadian taxpayers an 
opportunity to send Revenue Canada the people's tax form every 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the essence of my people's tax form act.  It proposes 
that government would design a form which would be included in 
every tax kit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Completion of the people's tax form would be voluntary.  All the 
forms returned to Revenue Canada would be analysed and summarized 
and a copy of the analysis would be sent to every MP and senator. 
The analysis would be tabled in both the House of Commons and 
the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The analysis would be automatically referred to the standing 
committee for review and reported back to the House.  The duties 
of the standing committee are included in the bill, including a 
provision allowing the tax form to be amended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I first heard about the idea for this people's tax form in an 
article in the <I>Fraser Forum</I> November 1995.  It was written 
by Professor Filip Palda of the school of public administration, 
University of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He wrote, and I think it is very important that I include this 
quotation, that every year millions of Canadians go through the 
agony of filling out their tax returns, their T-1s.  Filling out 
these T-1s is painful, T-4s, whatever. It is painful because 
people have no sense that they control where their money is 
going. He suggested we add a sheet to this form that gives people 
that control.  This sheet, which he called the people's tax form, 
would list the categories of government spending and invite 
taxpayers to decide what fraction of their tax bill should go to 
each category. Churches and charities call this earmarking.  The 
people's tax form would allow citizens to earmark where they want 
their tax dollars to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Library of Parliament examined Professor Palda's concept for 
me and proposed alternatives for implementing the idea.  I 
bounced the idea off a number of other MPs and Professor Palda 
was kind enough to give me his comments and advice as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the spring of 1996 I tested the people's tax form in my own 
constituency and finally sent instructions to lawyers in the 
House of Commons to draft a private member's bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On December 10, 1996, I introduced the people's tax form act. It 
says it is an act to allow taxpayers to inform government of 
their views on levels and priorities for the expenditure of tax 
revenues and to provide for parliamentary review of the results. 
That is the essence of this tax form act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than 500 of my constituents were kind enough to fill out 
and return the early version of the people's tax form act, 
proving that given the opportunity, taxpayers do want to have a 
direct say in how the federal government spends their money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These results were very interesting but they need that mechanism 
and they do not have it at the present time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on where they want their tax dollars directed, the top 
five government programs most strongly supported by my constituents 
were old age security, health care, justice and the RCMP, Canada 
pension plan, debt reduction, but also there are areas that they 
did not want their money to go to.  The most strongly opposed 
areas were official bilingualism.  Does that surprise you, Mr. 
Speaker?  How about funding for special interest groups?  Over 
90% objected.  Gun registration just did not fly.  Foreign aid 
was not a priority.  Multiculturalism was opposed by over 80%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe I should not have mentioned those results.  There are 
interest groups in this country that are going to lobby the 
government to veto this bill, to not have any part of it.  Is 
that not unfortunate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My test of the people's tax form found support in an article in 
<I>Western Report</I>, dated May 6, 1996.  It read head of the 
Canadian Taxpayer's Federation, now the hon. member for Calgary 
Southeast, said the people's tax form is a great idea, and he 
would like to see it adopted as an advisory measure.  He went on 
to say, and I quote: “If the government would compile the 
results and then be measured against it, it would wrest control 
of the budget away from interest groups”.  I am honoured to have 
had this MP second this bill when I introduced it on September 
29. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague's reaction was very similar to Professor Palda's. 
Again I quote: “When I suggest the people's tax form to my 
academic colleagues I get a shocked reaction: `But that's putting 
power directly into the hands of the people who know nothing 
about government. Why would you want to do that?”'. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come back to my introduction.  We live in a democracy. 
Surprise, surprise.  Do those people not have the right to give 
us that kind of information?  I really agree with Professor Palda 
when he says giving Canadians the power to directly influence 
government spending would create a panic in the ministries 
responsible for that spending and among the groups that benefit 
from that spending.  Special interest groups could no longer 
ignore public opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last four years the Liberal government has cut billions 
of dollars in transfers to the provinces for health and education 
and programs that my constituents strongly support and yet this 
same government spends billions on grants and handouts that my 
constituents strongly oppose.  I suspect it is not just in my 
part of Saskatchewan.  I suspect that opposition is across 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that once the Liberal government extracts money 
from the taxpayers by force, then it can spend tax dollars any 
way it wants. Tax dollars are not the Liberals' money to do 
whatever they wish.  All of a sudden the excitement is dying 
down, Mr. Speaker.  What is going on? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the truth, though.  Listen.  Constituents are telling 
their members of Parliament what their priorities are and either 
the government is not listening or it does not care, or the 
message is not clear enough for it.  How about making it a 
little clearer and support this tax form act and get that 
information into our hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Special interest groups, big corporations and paid lobbyist have 
been able to hijack the agenda and persuade politicians to give 
them tax dollars and implement programs that most people do not 
feel are high priorities.  It is obvious the people want 
politicians to cut grants and handouts to special interest groups 
and big business and thereby help preserve funding for pensions, 
health care and law and order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somehow the Liberal government does not seem to be getting the 
message.  Everybody seems to be disappearing out of here now. 
They just do not want to hear this.  The people's tax form act 
will make sure the message gets through loud and clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our tax system focuses only on collecting money from people and 
without allowing them a real say in how it is spent.  The current 
system rewards groups that make the most noise and individuals 
and organizations that make the biggest donations to the 
political party in power, not the people who are paying the 
bills.  We ought to listen to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should taxpayers be forced to support political programs and 
activities that the vast majority do not believe in?  The 
people's tax form act will give Canadians a chance to make their 
priorities the government's priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I draw near to the end, I want to give some other positive 
spin-off benefits that we would have.  It would foster debate 
across Canada. 
It would increase interest in the affairs of government.  It 
would combat apathy.  It would decrease public cynicism.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, if they see government wanting their opinion and 
listening to it, the attitude of many people that government does 
not care about what they think would begin to change.  If they 
see government actively seeking information and following the 
direction, it would restore faith in their institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, it may even help unity problems.  That is not a stretch 
because people in all parts of this country feel alienated.  They 
would again feel like they belonged.  It would be a small step in 
the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, Canadians would find citizenship much more meaningful. 
They would be willing to accept more responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened to some of the objections from people in 
Parliament.  One of the first is that common people are not 
capable of knowing how to best spend the money.  That is not so. 
I detect that here in Ottawa the elite have the attitude that 
they know what is best for the country.  The people out there 
know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an objection that this initiative may cost too much 
money.  It would actually save money.  Will Rogers said it well: 
“Lord, the money we spend on government” and it's not one bit 
better than what we got for one-third the money 20 years ago. 
That is the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I seek unanimous consent not to make this a votable item but to 
refer it to the committee for further study.  There is very wide 
support for this initiative among the members of this House and 
among Canadians in general, and it is a non-partisan issue.  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like you to ask for unanimous consent because 
this is supported on all sides of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  It is my understanding that the hon. 
member is asking for unanimous consent to refer the subject 
matter of the bill to the Standing Committee on Finance for 
further study.  Is there unanimous consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  There is not consent.  Resuming 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  There was dissent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  There was dissent.  There was not 
unanimous consent.  Resuming debate, the hon. Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Finance. 
<P><A NAME="LINK263"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government welcomes any 
efforts to open up the lines of communication with ordinary 
Canadians on tax and expenditure policy.  Since we took office in 
1993 we have greatly expanded the opportunities for individual 
taxpayers to make their voices heard in the policy process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of the new open budget process, the Minister of Finance 
appears before the House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance 
each fall to discuss the options and priorities for the upcoming 
budget.  The finance committee then begins a prolonged period of 
direct public consultations on budget priorities across Canada. 
This year for the first time the chair of the finance committee, 
the member for Vaughan—King—Aurora, asked each and every member 
of this House to consult Canadians in their own constituencies. 
That is direct democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is apprised of the results of these consultations 
through a report of the committee which is tabled in the House 
and delivered to the Minister of Finance before the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance and other ministers also receive many 
other proposals and recommendations on tax and expenditure policy 
from the public each and every day.  These take the form of 
letters, faxes, Internet, E-mail letters and other means.  We 
take each and every response into consideration in the 
formulation of policy.  In short, we already have a dynamic and 
practical system of public consultation and communications in 
place to help guide us in our tax and expenditure policy 
decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While further consultations are always desirable, I am not sure 
this bill would significantly add to the information the 
government already collects in the area.  As mentioned by the 
mover of this bill, the financial implications of this bill need 
to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe it is a prudent expenditure of public funds 
since it would largely duplicate the results of the public 
consultation systems that are already in place.  While I 
appreciate and share in the objectives of this bill, I do not 
think it will improve upon the existing system of public 
consultations on tax and expenditure policy in a very practical 
and efficient manner.  As such I really cannot support this 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also stated that his bill will allow for extensive 
debate to take place throughout this country. 
I have to state quite clearly that at least the members on this 
side of the House, and I am sure some members on that side of the 
House, do involve themselves in extensive debate with their 
constituents on an ongoing basis.

regular basis through my householder for feedback on various 
items that the government is considering pursuing and certainly 
on this very important issue of fiscal dividend as we move into 
an era of balanced budget and a fiscal dividend.  The government 
wants to hear from ordinary Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it somewhat unfortunate that members continue to point to 
the fact that those people who come before the finance committee 
are all representatives of interest groups and they do not 
reflect the concerns of individual Canadians.

very passionate presentation put forward by an individual from 
Vancouver East.  This individual was not there speaking on behalf 
of any so-called interest group, as the Reform Party is so fond 
of referring to.  He was there to deliver a message on behalf of 
those constituents and individuals who live in Vancouver East. 
The finance committee took that information into consideration. 
It was a very passionate presentation indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the member is proposing in this bill is to duplicate a 
system that is already in place, a system which is quite dynamic 
and practical and does allow for public consultation and 
communications.  This government, more than any other government 
in the past, has been more open, more transparent in its 
pre-budget consultations, allowing many Canadians the opportunity 
to come before the committee or provide some written submissions. 
Members of Parliament have gone out and consulted with their 
constituents through town hall meetings and round tables so that 
we can go directly to Canadians right across this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not require another bill that speaks to the duplication of 
what is already taking place.  I find it ironic.  The Reform 
Party has always been out there talking about government needs to 
eliminate duplication.  We now have a bill here that promotes the 
duplications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party continues to talk about the prudent expenditure 
of money.  Passing this bill would allow for some phenomenal 
bureaucracy to take place.  We would have to go out and hire more 
public servants at a time when we have been talking about 
reducing the public service in order to deal with the financial 
implications we were left with because of the past 
administration, the Tory government, that did such a terrible job 
over the last period it was in office in dealing with the 
finances of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, while I certainly appreciate and certainly would say 
quite clearly that not only on this side of the House but on both 
sides of the House further consultations are always desirable, I 
am not sure this bill would provide anything significant and 
would add to the information the government is already 
collecting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Useful information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  The member makes a statement that it is 
useful information.  I will tell him, and I take exception to the 
statement, the useful information that is coming to this House 
right now is coming in the form of public consultations directly 
with Canadians through round tables, through town halls that 
members of Parliament conduct in their constituencies.  We do not 
require this duplication of effort.  We do not require the 
additional bureaucracy.  Quite frankly, I am astonished that the 
Reform Party is putting this forward.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
address Bill C-214, introduced by the Reform member for Yorkton—Melville. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was drafted following the hon. member's experiment with 
taxpayers from his riding in western Canada. Again, we can see that the 
Reform Party has a hard time understanding how our democratic 
institutions work. That right-wing party comes up with a regional idea 
it sees as innovative and, above all, realistic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at the title of Bill C-214: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An act to allow taxpayers to inform government of their views 
on levels and priorities for the expenditure of tax revenues— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The title is a long sentence which could summarize our whole 
democratic system. The way some Reformers behave in this House, one gets 
the impression they want to reform everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“An act to allow taxpayers to inform government of their 
views”. 
The fact is that every three or four years, depending on the Prime 
Minister's mood, Canadians are asked to support or reject the 
government's achievements, through a general election. 
They are also asked to choose among the programs of the various 
political parties that clearly indicate how they intend to use 
taxpayers' money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intentions of Bloc Quebecois members are clear. We want to give 
back to Quebec the taxes paid by Quebeckers. We are convinced that the 
federal system no longer meets Quebec's real needs. In the last 
election, Quebeckers understood Reform's message and decided not to 
elect any member of that party, a party which is openly opposed to 
bilingualism and which flatly rejects every one of Quebec's demands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Reform members, that consultation was not adequate. When 
taxpayers prepare their income tax return, they want them now to fill 
out a form describing how they want their money to be spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine that tomorrow morning Revenue Canada has to review 18 
million ideas on how Ottawa should spend the money. Who will determine 
the priorities? Would Revenue Canada's unionized workers be willing to 
screen these millions of ideas? No, with the cuts and the constant 
remodelling that most departments have experienced, the work of these 
government employees is now based on very precise duties and they have 
neither the time nor the training required to perform the new duties 
that the Reform Party would require of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party could force them to do this work by implementing 
a series of orders or special laws. 
This is probably what would happen when you consider how that party 
treats the postal workers. They really have difficulty understanding how 
collective agreements are negotiated. The Reform philosophy, which leans 
strongly to the extreme right, is once again leading them to opt for the 
hard line by calling for a special law and by completely disregarding 
the claims of Canada Post employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine if after difficult negotiations with Canada, the Reform 
Party had to hire personnel to try and compile these millions of ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see the leader of the official opposition, who is 
constantly calling for cuts, cuts and more cuts, rise in this House and 
attempt to justify these additional expenses, and especially to explain 
why the decision making process has bogged down. 
Of course no one is surprised by the way the Reform leader changes his 
mind, especially when we see that his official arrival at majestic 
Stornoway cost taxpayers over a quarter of a million dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Yorkton—Melville thinks that he has made a great 
discovery with this method of consulting taxpayers in his riding. This 
type of consultation is part of a member's job to maintain a close 
relationship with the grassroots, and we do not need to fill out a 
Revenue Canada form to do this work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, Reform members have to recognize that there are other 
means of finding out what the public thinks about the policy decisions 
we want to implement. They only have to consult their supporters in the 
community and, from time to time, to study the polls or read the 
opinions of political and economic commentators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At any rate, in Quebec, the public knows what the real face of the 
Reform Party is. 
They remember how the Reform Party insulted Quebec's political leaders 
during the last electoral campaign, the anti-Quebec advertising. We all 
know that this party from the right has absolutely no idea of what the 
issues are in Quebec.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the Reform member who sponsored this 
bill that there is a whole other series of activities here in the 
Parliament of Canada by which politicians, groups and individuals 
can make known their points of view: oral question period, 
parliamentary committees, statements by members, speeches, press 
releases and even press conferences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really have trouble understanding how the logistics of this 
bill could be defended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I nonetheless took the time to examine the result of this 
local operation in the riding of Yorkton—Melville.  Here are the 
priorities expressed by the 500 taxpayers who went along with their 
MP's request. 
But before I give you the results, I will briefly review the 
purpose of this bill, an act to allow taxpayers to inform 
government of their views on levels and priorities for the 
expenditure of tax revenues.  The French leaves something to be 
desired, but what it boils down to is “Where would you like to see 
the money you give Revenue Canada spent?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The answers were as follows: 93% are against their money being 
used for bilingualism; 81.2% are against multiculturalism; and 
78.4% are against native peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the upshot of the 500 forms completed perhaps by the 
500 members in good standing of the Reform Party.  The constituents 
indicate their preference for justice and the RCMP, and jails, with 
welfare 21st on the list.  In other words, they would rather send 
the least well off in society to jail than provide them with social 
and community support. 
Here again, we recognize the philosophy of the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My conclusion will look at the results of this operation, a 
phoney consultation, a tool for disinformation in the hands of a 
right wing party from western Canada trying to get the public to 
swallow Reform Party ideas that will not work in the 1990s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The political party to which I belong, however, would be 
tempted to try this approach, given the negative sentiments 
expressed about Quebec and about social democracy.  This kind of 
consultation would certainly help the sovereignist cause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we will be voting against this bill, which has no 
serious foundation and which is pure Reform party politics.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am also pleased to join with my colleagues in the 
Chamber to debate Bill C-214, the People's Tax Form Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first glance the bill seems to be quite interesting.  It even 
sounds great.  I do not think a soul in the Chamber does not 
support the basic premise that taxpayers, the citizens of the 
country, have the right to have their views considered on how 
government spends tax dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However one has to ask if this is the way to address the 
concerns.  Is this getting to the heart of the matter when it 
comes to people's sense of being disenfranchised?  Are there not 
other steps that must be taken first before we look at 
establishing another form that requires a great deal of knowledge 
to complete? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will in some cases be seen as an unnecessary piece of mail. 
The major concern of taxpayers is to feel confident the 
government is prepared to achieve tax fairness and to address the 
concerns working men and women deal with on a daily basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, a few years ago one of my constituents had a full 
time job at a brewery in Winnipeg.  The brewery closed down and 
my constituent lost the full time job he had held for many years. 
He found a part time job.  Then he found another part time job to 
supplement his income.  He is doing night courses to retrain for 
some other field, for some other hope in the distant future.  He 
has a couple of kids.  His partner works.  They are all juggling 
work and family responsibilities to try to make ends meet.  They 
are barely surviving.  They got a call from Revenue Canada saying 
that they owe taxes on the RRSP they had to cash in. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1850"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT104"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This person was dealing with an institution which did not make 
the tax deductions at source.  This person who is barely making 
ends meet was suddenly faced with an adamant voice on the other 
end of the phone from Revenue Canada saying “Too bad, you have 
to give us something.  We need something.  You have to pay some 
of the taxes”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He asked me “How is it that I am getting harassed on a day to 
day basis over this kind of situation when so many wealthy people 
in society and so many big corporations are able to avoid paying 
taxes, to take advantage of loopholes, to take advantage of 
deferred taxes, to invest in all kinds of areas and not to pay 
immediate taxes?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise this situation because it demonstrates where people are 
at today and what is important.  They are saying that the first 
pressing issue for them is to have some fairness in the system. 
Sure, they would like to have a say, but the government should 
first address the fundamental issue of how they survive on a day 
to day basis, given the present tax structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are saying that there is a heck of a lot of other ways to 
make government more accountable than having another form come in 
the mail which takes time, knowledge and resources to complete. 
They are saying that the government could be more accountable if 
it was willing to do so right now without the additional forms or 
paperwork. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current pre-budget consultations are relevant to this 
debate.  We had round table discussions.  The Minister of Finance 
went across the country and held discussions.  Some people had a 
chance to participate.  A small number in each town were allowed 
to participate but certainly not a vast number of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was even more galling to the folk who saw that as somewhat 
of an opportunity to participate in the decision making process 
was that they learned, all the while the pre-budget consultations 
were going on, the Minister of Finance was meeting with his 
cabinet colleagues and making decisions about how the budget 
would be allocated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to start somewhere in terms of restoring people's 
confidence in government, letting people know they have some say 
in how tax dollars are spent, and giving them the sense that some 
day there might be a bit of tax fairness in our system, we need 
to start with our own house.  We must get our own house in order. 
We must ensure that the government practises honest and real 
accountability and does not create some pretence that it is 
consulting with the people when all the while it has a set 
agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a few other suggestions.  Why not ensure much more open 
and transparent debate in the House and across the country?  What 
does it do to people's confidence in democracy and in parliament 
when the government readily introduces closure and cuts off 
debate?  It denies us the opportunity to contribute the feelings 
and beliefs of our constituents on an important issue such as 
changes to the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about restoring confidence in the system, in the 
government and in people's ability to influence decisions.  What 
about putting an end to the appointments of MPs who have either 
decided not to run or who were defeated at the polls?  These are 
patronage appointments for defeated MPs turfed out by the 
electorate because they did not win the confidence of the people 
in their constituencies.  They suddenly find themselves in a 
lucrative position with as much power, if not more power, as a 
member of the Chamber.

<A HREF="#LINKT105"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many people have made other suggestions.  We need to look at a 
more simplified tax form so people can see what is happening in 
terms of their own situation and get a better handle on where 
their money is actually going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I made the suggestion again today of the need for a tax 
ombudsperson, someone people can turn to for raising their 
concerns when they feel their minister of finance or their 
elected representative is not responsive. We could give more 
powers to the auditor general to make his recommendations a much 
more meaningful part of our decision making process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list goes on.  It comes down to trying to restore people's 
faith and confidence in government, in parliament and in 
politicians.  While the idea of the bill seems great at first 
glance, it is not the solution at this time.  It is not an 
appropriate mechanism for dealing with those kinds of concerns. 
People want to see us act to put in place measures that will 
guarantee them a voice in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to do that by improving our methods of accountability. 
We have to try to encourage the government to hold honest and 
open discussion on such things as pre-budget consultations and on 
major legislation such as the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be able to show people that we are always accountable 
and do whatever we can to hold round tables in our own 
constituencies, to get the information out about developments in 
parliament and to give people a chance to give feedback to us. We 
need the opportunity to convey those sentiments in the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I appreciate the efforts of the Reform member in 
introducing the bill, my feeling and the feeling of members of my 
caucus is that this is not the appropriate mechanism at this 
time.  There are many more ways to address the concerns of 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me conclude by saying that if there is anything we have 
learned as members of Parliament at a time when people are so 
cynical and sceptical about politicians, it is that we must go 
the extra mile to restore that confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of talking all the time about deregulating, privatizing, 
offloading and cutting back in terms of government 
responsibilities, we should be truly talking about 
democratization.  This is the greatest service we could provide 
to Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK266"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
applaud the hon. member of the New Democratic Party for giving 
some consideration to the bill before us and for being open to 
more accountability in the House.  It is certainly one of the 
things we agree is very desperately needed today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also appreciate the opportunity to represent my constituents 
and my party.  I am proud to stand in the House to speak in 
favour of Bill C-214, the people's tax form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As its title explains, the people's tax form would allow 
taxpayers to give a sense to the government of their views on 
levels and priorities for the expenditure of tax revenues and to 
provide parliamentary reviews of the results.  This is truly 
direct input, a people type of bill, a bill where real Canadians 
would have some input into the way their tax dollars are being 
spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for us to remember that Canadians are actually 
paying the ultimate bill.  The bill we are discussing and 
debating is a bill of fiscal responsibility.  It would encourage 
the government to better priorize and account for where it spends 
the taxes it collects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would not frighten any responsible democratic 
government but it does seem to frighten the Liberals.  They see 
it as a potential hindrance to their agenda if people do not 
agree with their priorities. 
It frightens them because it would let taxpayers put priorities 
on how governments spend taxpayers' money.  It frightens them 
because the Liberals are, I am afraid, increasingly out of touch 
with real Canadians and with what they want their taxes going 
toward. The Liberal priorities and values are not lining up with 
those of ordinary Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of funding Liberal projects, this bill would give 
taxpayers more say and some choice in how their money is spent. 
That is something the people want but the Liberals do not.  This 
bill concerned the Liberals so much that they refused to allow a 
vote on it in this House.  Further, they will not even let it be 
discussed.  A few moments ago they refused to give unanimous 
consent of the House to refer this bill to committee for further 
study. What they are saying is no accountability and democratic 
input. It is not allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that the finance minister and the Standing Committee 
on Finance travel around the country at this time of year under 
the guise of prebudget consultation while refusing to consult 
ordinary Canadians at a time when they are filling out their 
taxes?  Apparently the minister is more interested in controlled 
input from a select few and racking up his air miles than getting 
broad based input from ordinary Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paying lip service to consultation by going through the motions 
at staged committee meetings does not allow the priorities of the 
whole Canadian public to be heard.  Canadians are increasingly 
and understandably jaded about the wisdom of their elected 
representatives spending their dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thirty years of government overspending has saddled us with $600 
billion of debt, the highest taxes in the G-7 countries, with 
interest payments that are eating the heart out of our social 
programs.  Given this track record, the status quo on tax and 
spend governments from on high is not acceptable.  In fact it is 
destructive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want to have input into the governance of their 
country.  It is that desire that has put Reformers in this House. 
This is the message that Reform has consistently promoted since 
its inception over 10 years ago.  This is the message we will 
continue to promote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill furthers this vision.  I commend my hon. colleague 
from Yorkton—Melville for his initiative and effort in putting 
it forward.  I was very interested to hear the results that he 
received back from his constituents when he asked them to fill 
out the people's tax form.  It is clear that his constituents 
want to retain public security for those who need it most.  Old 
age security, health care, justice and even the RCMP are their 
priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers are true Canadians who care, despite how others in 
this House want to misrepresent them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague's constituents also made it abundantly clear that 
they do not want their tax dollars going to pet Liberal projects 
like multiculturalism and special interest group funding.  They 
want government to encourage but not subsidize business 
initiatives.  They know that Canadian industry is strong enough 
to stand on its own and that tax breaks to consumers will do more 
to strengthen business than making them dependent on subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Canada want Ottawa to stop telling them what is 
best for them.  They are tired of a Liberal position that it is 
not the people's job to think but to obey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill provides an effective vehicle for government to better 
serve the people.  I ask my hon. colleagues in this House to 
support the people who have put them here and to support this 
initiative.  It is with this in mind that I would like to seek 
the unanimous consent of the House to make this bill a votable 
item. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent for the 
motion proposed by the hon. member? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.

shares the southern borders of our province, the hon. member for 
Cypress Hills—Grasslands. 
The day after the June 2 election one of the press people came to 
me and said  “What do you suspect will happen in the House when 
you get there, given the fact that there are four opposition 
parties and the Liberal Party, the governing party opposite”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I said to that young reporter  “I expect that it is going to be 
240 versus 60”.  That is the way it has been.  When we bring 
common sense legislation in, we see 240 lining up to vote against 
the 60 people that come here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from the highest taxed province, Saskatchewan. 
Saskatchewan is the highest taxed province in Canada right now. 
When I hear people talking about this being very expensive to 
have one electronic sheet placed in everybody's income tax forms, 
to be filed through electronic machines in each province on the 
computer, any government should welcome this. They would have 
more public opinion than a thousand town hall meetings and they 
would have it every year in April.  By April they would know what 
the people across Canada are thinking.  They would know that the 
thoughts of British Columbians differ from those of the 
maritimes.  At least they would have before them a truly 
volunteered opinion coming before them at very little cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one in this House can say that this is an expensive measure 
as far as democracy is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If any government were to take a look at a sheet coming in like 
this, they could look down at the constituency of my colleague 
and see that 88.8% of the people are opposed to government 
expenditures in the matter of gun registration.  The amount of 
money that they would save in gun registration over the next five 
years would pay the bill of the tainted blood inquiry and Canada 
could walk away free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We spend more money because some brainwave comes into existence 
with no feeling toward the public whatsoever.  Any government 
that really wanted to be truly representative would say “We can 
do this in a minute.  We can have this ready in April. We can 
have a form filled out and it would come through.  It would not 
have to be touched.  It would be automatically recorded and there 
the government would have the party's opinion”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder what the people of the provinces of Ontario and Quebec 
would think if the people in the four western provinces were 
paying $2.90 for a package of cigarettes and here they were

would be something to pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the last five years or six years the people in western 
Canada who smoke pay at least $3 more for a package of 
cigarettes.  We have never had any big complaint about that, but 
with this government it seems to matter where the complaints come 
from.  That is what makes the difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would be one of the cheapest public relations jobs this or 
any government could possibly do.  We could possibly lead the 
world in the way of getting an electronic opinion from the people 
that we serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should support the bill.  We should discuss it further.  I 
will turn the rest of my time over to my hon. colleague from 
Cypress Hills—Grasslands.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think the problem that we are encountering here with 
endeavouring to get serious consideration for this bill was 
actually spelled out by the hon. member for Yorkton—Melville in 
his address when he stated that if this bill were to become law, 
there would be less public apathy in government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last thing that the Liberal government wants is less public 
apathy.  The more apathy the better.  The government says “Keep 
them out of it.  Keep them asleep.  Do not consult them.  Tell 
them, `Pay your taxes folks and then shut up and leave us 
alone'.”

</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I am rising is really more than to speak to the 
estimable merits of the bill.  I want to comment on the 
presentation by the hon. member for Lotbinière.  He appeared to 
think that this was not a bad idea, but he was distressed because 
he felt that if this did become law, the people of 
Yorkton—Melville might oppose the expenditure of federal funds 
to promote official bilingualism. I would submit that if this 
became law, it would also be the law in the province of Quebec. 
The people of Quebec likewise would vote massively to avoid 
spending federal funds to promote federal bilingualism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member also commented on the fact that we did not elect 
any Reformers in Quebec.  I would like to point out that the Bloc 
did not elect very many members in western Canada. So what pray 
tell is the point of his argument? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, he mentioned the fact that Reform said in the last 
election that perhaps provinces other than Quebec should begin to 
have some small voice at the top level of government.  But do the 
separatists not say the same thing?  They not only want to reduce 
the overwhelming influence and power of Quebec in Ottawa, they 
want to eliminate it altogether. They want to leave Quebec as 
this pitiful and powerless little fish in a vast anglophone sea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one of the most interesting bills I have seen presented 
in Parliament in Private Members' Business to date. It is a great 
shame and a pity that it is not being sent to committee.  It is a 
bill that would not require any great expenditure of public 
funds.  It is pin money to this government. It is a bill that 
would give the people of Canada a sense of ownership, a sense of 
being a part of the process of governing this great country, a 
sense that they are losing by leaps and bounds. There is a vast 
distaste, a vast distrust out there of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us as politicians hear this all the time:  “It does not 
matter anymore.  It does not matter who we elect, who we send to 
Ottawa, it is all nonsense. Go on down there and play your games. 
We will work and pay our taxes but we know in our hearts that it 
is just a charade”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was just getting warmed up, but I see you are giving me the 
finger, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I would not think of giving the 
finger to the hon. member, but I was warning him that he had a 
minute left in his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the time provided for the consideration of Private 
Members' Business has now expired and the order is dropped from 
the Order Paper. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 7.15 p.m. the House stands adjourned until tomorrow 
at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 7.14 p.m.)
