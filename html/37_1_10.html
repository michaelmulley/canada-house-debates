<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 7 consideration of the motion 
for an address to Her Excellency the Governor General in reply 
to her speech at the opening of the session. 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Ottawa—Vanier, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise to make a few comments on the throne speech, the 
general orientation of the government and my own initiatives, 
those which I had the opportunity to present to the voters of 
Ottawa—Vanier in the last general election and which comprise the 
mandate I received from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I think it is appropriate to do as all my colleagues have 
done and thank the people of Ottawa—Vanier for the trust they 
have placed in me for the third time.  This was the third 
election in the riding within six years.  Two general elections 
and one byelection within six years is a pretty heavy task.  In 
this connection, I believe I have a duty as well to thank all 
the people who provided me with active support in those three 
campaigns, the volunteers who play an essential part in the 
democratic process of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year we are making a special effort to spotlight 
volunteerism, and it is very important to keep in mind that 
democracy depends in large part on volunteers.  Without the 
volunteers in all ridings of this country, in all parties, this 
country would not have the successful democracy that it enjoys. 
I wish to particularly thank those who helped me in this 
campaign. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, I take this opportunity to congratulate my adversaries 
in the last campaign.  They were honourable people.  All the 
candidates from all parties, including myself, whether they were 
major parties or those that were perhaps less well known, were 
honourable people with exemplary conduct.  I was quite proud to 
be part of the process in Ottawa—Vanier. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past two weeks, I have had some difficult moments, 
personally.  There were deaths everyone has heard about, because 
the events were very public and, in some cases, very 
controversial.  In each instance, people I know were involved. 
This morning, I want to take this opportunity to recognize the 
contribution these people have made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first instance was a tragedy.  It was the case of Catherine 
MacLean, who died suddenly as the result of a road accident, 
when she was struck by a car driven by a Russian diplomat.  We 
must continue to press on this side of the House, as must all 
parties, for the recodification, if I can put it that way, of 
the Vienna convention on diplomatic immunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said it before, and I repeat it again.  I doubt very much 
that the concept of diplomatic immunity was created to enable 
people to circumvent the law of host countries, as appears to be 
the case here.  We heard there were other deplorable incidents, 
as the matter came up in the House this week.  I therefore 
strongly urge the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Government 
of Canada to seize the opportunities presented to them to update 
the Vienna convention, which is some 40 years old, to ensure the 
full effect of the law is felt, especially in the case of tragic 
events such as we have seen.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to extend my best wishes for a full recovery 
to Catherine Doré, who remains in hospital. She was with Ms. 
MacLean on that fateful Saturday afternoon walk. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, there was the funeral earlier this week of Carol Anne 
Letheren, president of the Canadian Olympic committee.  I had 
occasion to work with her in the preparation of the file for the 
modernization of the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame.  She was of 
great help to me on that project.  She was a great lady.  Again 
this was a life cut short, and it is a great tragedy.  I express 
my deep regret to the members of her family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A colleague of ours will be buried tomorrow in St. Boniface. 
David Iftody died in an unusual way, and again this was a life 
cut short.  David was, dare I say it, a card game buddy.  We had 
good times.  He was also a parliamentary secretary when I was. We 
helped each other out.  We supported each other.  We had good 
arguments.  It is an incredible tragedy that a man of that age in 
such fine form and good spirits, with much more to contribute, 
would disappear from us.  I hope to be able to attend that 
funeral tomorrow to pay my respects to the members of his family. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last person I want to mention is Mr. Charpentier. As we are 
speaking, his funeral is being held here in Ottawa. Mr. 
Charpentier died this week at the age of 103. His was a full, 
extraordinary life in the service of his country, his community 
and his fellow citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the honour of supporting the efforts of Pierre Bergeron, 
the editor of the daily <I>Le Droit</I>, when the Assemblée 
parlementaire de la francophonie awarded the Ordre de la Pléiade 
to Mr. Charpentier, when he turned 100. The ceremony took place 
in the newsroom of <I>Le Droit</I>, for which Mr. Charpentier had 
worked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am anxious to read the book that a friend, François-Xavier 
Simard, is writing on Mr. Charpentier's life. It should be 
released in the coming year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am taking this opportunity to refer to the lives of these four 
people, whom I got to know, if only a little bit, but who 
nevertheless had an influence on my work here as a 
parliamentarian. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a renewed mandate based on a commitment called the red 
book, which was made available widely in print form and even more 
widely in electronic form during the last general election.  I of 
course campaigned on it, as did all my colleagues on this side of 
the House, and all those candidates who did not succeed did 
present that option to the Canadian electorate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That option has been retained as the one favoured for the future 
orientation of our country.  This is the sixth day of debate on 
the Speech from the Throne, which was in great part a reflection 
of that campaign pledge.  We have heard numerous comments.  I 
will not go into detail on the major items of priority.  As we 
all know, they deal with health, the necessity of innovation, 
lowering taxes and debt, education and early childhood 
development.  There are many other items such as our environment 
and our parks.  These have all been talked about.  They are 
widely known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will highlight a few that have perhaps not been dealt with in 
the same detail.  I will also highlight five actions that I 
presented to the electorate of Ottawa—Vanier which I think mesh 
quite well with what is in the Speech from the Throne and are of 
importance not only to the people in Ottawa—Vanier but to those 
within this region and in eastern Ontario and western Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first of these is the need for a ring road and bridges 
crossing our river into western Quebec.  This is important for a 
number of reasons. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1015"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT3"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT3"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1015

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Building a ring road around the national capital region is very 
important to ensure balanced economic development. We all know 
that the western part of our region is growing rapidly. Before 
long, the road network for Ottawa and the region will no longer 
be adequate because of that growth and will no longer meet the 
needs of the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is only one main east-west highway, known as the Queensway. 
There is a need for a ring road, which would branch off from the 
Queensway west of Ottawa, continue south of Ottawa's 
international airport and reconnect with the provincial road 
system to the east of the city. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later on, two bridges would be built and this ring road could be 
completed in western Quebec.  This would truly ensure balanced 
growth in our region, much of it probably centred within the 
bounds of this ring road.  We could thus protect our 
agricultural heritage, something we must not neglect.  In 
addition, we must make sure that the three airports in our 
region, the ones in Ottawa, Gatineau and Carp, are connected to this 
ring road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of this would help to get the huge trucks out of the 
downtown core in the nation's capital. 
I think that any self-respecting city in North America, Europe or 
wherever has this concept of a ring road to allow heavy truck 
traffic to bypass the downtown area, which is not the case now 
in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not forget the safety aspect.  In recent years, a few 
trucks have spilled their cargoes on the highway that runs 
through the downtown core of the nation's capital.  Fortunately, 
these cargoes were not hazardous and contained no toxic 
substances.  One would really have to be irresponsible to think 
that there will be no accidents or ecological or other disasters 
that might pose a threat to the public in this region in the 
future.  It is important that these hazardous goods be 
transported outside the downtown area, ideally on a ring road. 
That was my first point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second is the Rockcliffe military base.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Rockcliffe airbase is a 330 acre parcel of land which is in 
the heart of the riding.  It is a glorious location.  There is an 
opportunity here for public good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years ago the Department of National Defence declared it 
surplus to its needs.  There has been an ongoing process of 
preparing it to be sold.  I have indicated repeatedly, with the 
support of my community, that I am opposed to the disposal of 
that land for building a residential subdivision.  We have an 
opportunity, because of the proximity of the Aviation Museum and 
the National Research Council which is contiguous to this piece 
of land, to create something of much more importance to the 
economic development of the east end of the city.  That is one 
thing I wish to focus a lot of effort on during this mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A third project which has been under some preparation by a 
number of groups, such as the Rideau Valley Conservation 
Authority and the Kingston economic development officers, is the 
cleanup of the Rideau River from one end to the other.  It is a 
rather massive project and is one which will require co-operation 
among the Government of Canada, the government of Ontario and 
many of the municipalities along the Rideau system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know the importance of clean water and having a water 
system that is alive.  We know the importance of having 
ecological biodiversity, a safe water supply and an area that can 
also be used for recreational purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scope of the project is now pretty well established.  Over 
the next number of years, I hope that we would see co-operation 
in a project, which could well take a decade but is of some 
importance and significance to eastern Ontario and the entire St. 
Lawrence and Ottawa River system.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, we have linguistic duality.  Respect for that duality 
must begin here in the capital of Canada.  I believe it is 
absolutely essential for this capital city to reflect the duality of 
Canada, and for it to officially recognize both English and French. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The municipal council will have the responsibility of 
determining how this will be done, but I trust that when 
application is made to the government of Ontario, when it is 
informed of the wishes of the people of this city, this being a 
local decision, it will agree to recognize the benefits of the use 
of both languages in this capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This recognition and respect of linguistic duality does not stop 
there.  It must be present throughout the federal 
administration.  I am most relieved to see that the government's 
intention was set out very explicitly in the Speech from the 
Throne.  I hope to be able to contribute, through work in the 
House and in its committees, to the implementation of that 
desire to ensure that there will be a place for French 
everywhere in Canada and a place as well for English-speaking 
citizens everywhere in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an absolutely vital initiative, for it relates to the 
very essence of our country. 
It is fundamental and essential to the future of this country. 
Once again, let me say how relieved I am to see that the 
government intends to address this. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other item I had mentioned flows totally into the 
government's initiatives in terms of research and development and 
innovation.  I believe we must strive to foster a better 
scientific culture in the country.  It is without doubt that we 
have various areas of science that will be impacting on society 
in a major way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are already seeing on a daily basis developments in the field 
of genetics.  With all its potential and with all of its dark 
side, government must have the ability to establish a framework 
within which we can all feel comfortable, yet pursue knowledge 
and the positive use of that knowledge.  That is just one field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same in the field of nanotechnology.  Last year alone 
the American government put $500 million into the institute for 
nanotechnology.  We have yet to really move on those lines.  It 
is an incredibly important technology in all fields, not just 
medicine, and I sense that sometimes we lag in that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing can be said for artificial intelligence.  I am 
not trying to be funny or anything, but there are accelerating 
developments in that field.  It will have a significant impact on 
all of our lives in the way we conduct ourselves, in the way we 
interact, in the way we do business and perhaps in the way 
democracy works.  Yet sometimes I sense that the population of 
Canada is not engaged in those fields and is not aware of the 
importance of what is coming at us.  It behooves us all to try to 
foster a greater scientific culture and perhaps use some of the 
mechanisms of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had hoped at some point that we might see a full-fledged 
standing committee on science and technology.  I would be 
encouraged if we started with a subcommittee of industry. 
However, in summary, the whole notion of the scientific culture 
and the importance of science and technology to our society 
cannot be underestimated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are some of the elements I had hoped to work on.  I put 
them forward to my electorate and I feel comfortable that I have 
a mandate to work on those. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to point out that a provincial colleague, Brian Coburn, 
the member for the riding next door to me, was elevated to the 
cabinet of Ontario as minister of agriculture.  I am very happy 
to see that because on some of these projects we will be working 
together on in great co-operation, the ring road in particular. I 
want to take this opportunity to congratulate my friend Brian for 
his appointment yesterday to the Ontario cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all of the commitments in the red book being put forward in 
the Speech from the Throne, with these additional ones and with 
the need to address the housing situation in our community, we 
have a lot of work to do in the next years. 
I pledge to my constituents, as I did on the Saturday morning of 
January 27, 2001 when I was sworn in front of 400 of them, 
that I will do the best I can to serve them faithfully.  I thank 
them very much for this opportunity.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That at the conclusion of today's debate on the Address in Reply

</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is it the pleasure of the House to 
adopt the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Canadian

member on his re-election and on his remarks this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One phrase that he used, with which I would certainly be in 
agreement, is the need for creating a greater scientific culture, 
starting right in the House.  We do not make the effort that we 
should to bring science to bear on many of the issues we are 
confronted with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the member, in light of the interest in creating a 
scientific culture, would he support the government creating a 
specific ministry of science and technology, rather than having 
that buried in the industry department?  Would he support the 
creation of a separate standing committee to deal with science 
and technology issues?  Would he support the idea of a chief 
scientist who was accountable to parliament, somewhat in the same 
way as the auditor general? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my colleagues on this 
side of the House know that I support the notion of a standing 
committee on science and technology.  There is no doubt about 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had debates with some of our colleagues.  I believe that 
the notion of the creation of new committees might have been 
broached during discussions between the House leaders.  I am 
not absolutely certain, however, because I am not privy to those 
discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that somehow someone in the House would see fit to 
create a standing committee on science and technology.  From that 
could flow debates on whether or not a science officer or a chief 
scientist would be required and how to structure it, if that was 
the consensus emerging from the committee.  Also flowing from 
that could be how we conduct research, how we attribute budgets, 
how we do not seem to have enough cohesion in the approach 
between departments and how the rate of innovation is important 
to our economic well-being and, therefore, our own personal 
well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would absolutely support that.  I talked to my colleagues 
about it in the recent weeks.  I would hope that some day sooner 
than later we would see a permanent standing committee for 
science and technology in the House of Commons, as we see it in 
many jurisdictions around the world. 
<P><A NAME="LINK8"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I too listened with interest to the member's speech.  I 
noticed that about 85% of his speech had to do with municipal 
government.  Then, he talked peripherally about the values in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned one thing that really intrigued me.  When he talked 
about drinking water, he threw in the word ecodiversity.  I was 
rather confused.  My idea of drinking water is that there is not 
too much ecodiversity in it.  I would rather it be pure water. He 
may want to check the record of what he said and maybe rethink 
his position on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one question for the member.  We feel in the House that 
members of parliament are too marginalized.  Does he have any 
comment on the government's very tepid statement in the throne 
speech on improving the way in which members of parliament can do 
their work?  I would like his comment on that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger:</B>  Mr. Speaker, biodiversity is an 
essential component to the health of a river system.  If we want 
to have good, clean drinking water we must have rivers that are 
alive and that have a great deal of biodiversity in them.  That 
is the case in the Rideau River.  It is actually getting better. 
More species seem to be recovering and re-establishing themselves 
in the river, which leads to clean water, believe it or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not a biologist.  Therefore I will not get caught up in all 
the details.  I cannot get caught up in them because I do not 
know them.  There is no doubt that a dead water system will not 
produce clean, drinkable water.  We need a river system that is 
alive and has biodiversity so that it can regenerate itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not commented, either in the House or publicly, on the 
debates regarding parliamentary reform and so forth.  Sometimes 
some of the criticism is a reflection of a mindset.  I have asked 
to be here, as all my colleagues have.  I fought to be here.  No 
system is perfect.  All systems can stand some improvements.  I 
have chosen not to be miserable.  I have chosen to work within 
the system to try to improve it but to use the mechanisms at 
hand.  The one I have chosen to use the most is the committee 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Colleagues who have sat with me on certain committees know that 
I have had no difficulty supporting amendments or motions from 
opposition members, based on their merits, not on party 
affiliation.  We have changed government legislation at committee 
at least on two occasions significantly and the changes have been 
approved in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There can be improvements as my colleague suggests, but I 
disagree with the statement that the system does not work.  My 
experience has been the opposite.  If we choose to use the 
devices, the services, and the resources available to members of 
parliament, we can effect change.  I did not address that issue 
because it is not uppermost in my mind.  I would rather get 
things done as opposed to whining. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on the address in reply to the government's 
Speech from the Throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First off, I would like to thank the voters in 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot for the trust they have placed in me once 
again, by electing me for a third mandate.  I will try to 
represent them with all the vigour and dignity the job requires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have nine comments to make on the throne speech.  That means I 
have less than a minute per comment.  I will try to do so 
quickly, but these are things I consider vital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech has once again set out the general policies 
the government intends to follow in its dealings with Quebec and 
with the citizens of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First off, there still was no recognition of the federal 
government's flagrant tax imbalance with Quebec and the other 
provinces in Canada.  The money is in Ottawa.  The surpluses 
expected this year will exceed $20 billion, and the needs in 
health care, education and other areas are to be found in Quebec 
and the other provinces.  There is no concern about striking a 
tax balance in Canada.  That is most disappointing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have preferred to have the Minister of Finance 
recognize the mistakes of the past and, acknowledge that when he 
lowered income taxes he targeted first and foremost the very 
high end incomes, so much so that in the latest two budgets, 
people earning over $250,000 in Canada, probably not most 
taxpayers, received a $9,000 tax cut this year, whereas families 
earning about $40,000 received a $300 tax cut. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1035"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT7"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT7"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1035
<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is outrageous, particularly since the anticipated surpluses 
for the coming years could have been used to provide immediate 
relief to families with an income of $40,000 or less, 
particularly single parent families with two dependent children. 
With that money, these families might not have had to pay any 
federal tax and the government would have created a balance in 
society, instead of granting tax reductions that primarily 
benefit the millionaires in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were also very disappointed not to find anything for the 
unemployed who, over the years, have been hit very hard by the 
government. Considering that only 43% of the unemployed are covered by the 
new employment insurance program, one would have expected the 
government to make adjustments and use the annual surpluses of 
$6 billion to $7 billion to come up with a much improved program 
for the jobless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not talking about cosmetic changes such as those proposed 
in the bill, which only use $500 million per year, out of the 
surpluses of $7 billion, and which give to the federal 
government the power required to control the fund's surpluses, 
to legitimize the robbery of the money in these surpluses that 
has been taking place over the past four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we would have liked the government to recognize the 
consensus in Quebec on parental leave and to transfer the 
necessary funding to the government of Quebec, so that it can 
implement its parental leave policy, which is much more generous 
and universal than the federal government's policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, we see in the throne speech the government's perpetual 
desire for confrontation with Quebec.  For example, there is the 
new citizens' council on the quality of health care provided by 
the Government of Quebec.  It is unacceptable that the federal 
government tell the Quebec government what to do in the health 
field when this is an exclusive provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is always this policy of confrontation which drives the 
federal government in its relations with the government of 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, we would have liked to see mention in the throne speech 
of the fact that Quebec has been enforcing the Young Offenders 
Act the way it was intended.  Quebec is a success story with 
respect to the reintegration of young offenders into society. 
The success rate it achieves with its approach is the envy of 
many.  It would have been nice to see this acknowledged in the 
throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister really has the courage she claims to have to 
impose a new young offenders policy, she should have imposed the 
policy being used in Quebec throughout Canada, instead of the 
brutal policy of sending 14 year olds to prison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, if it were your son or daughter who made a mistake 
and was liable to be charged under the new legislation 
introduced by the minister, with the support of the Canadian 
Alliance, I think that you would stop and think twice before 
giving this bill your support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have liked to have seen that consensus respected, and 
this contemptuous treatment of Quebec and young Quebecers 
avoided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixth, once again we find unacceptable intrusions into the 
sector of education and early childhood education, to fuel this 
confrontation with Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seventh, we would have expected the government, with more than 
20 criminal investigations on its back relating to presumed 
fraud, particularly within Human Resources Development Canada, 
to have addressed an important issue in its throne speech: 
government ethics.  Let it agree to carry out its red book 
promise to have an ethics counsellor, one who is appointed by 
parliament, answerable to parliament and guided by rules 
defined by parliament. 
Instead, we still have an ethics counsellor who reports to the 
PMO, who says what the Prime Minister wants to hear, because the 
Prime Minister is the one paying him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to government scandal, to undue pressure from 
ministers or the Prime Minister on crown corporations, when the 
ethics counsellor tells us there is no problem, he cannot be 
believed.  Why can we not believe him?  Because he is on the 
Prime Minister's payroll.  One does not bite the hand that feeds 
one.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will this matter of transparency be one of the fundamental 
questions for this elitist government once and for all or will 
it be sidestepped again?  Like the House leader of the 
government said yesterday in the House, will we again be told 
“We are a government with an incredible record of honesty and 
integrity”.  There has to be some reason for twenty criminal 
investigations, because such investigations are not carried out 
for no reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would also have liked to see an announcement of measures to 
properly deal with cyclical fuel crises.  We would have liked to 
see the government show a bit more compassion for people like 
the independent truckers who have to deal at various times 
throughout the year with the major oil companies and the way 
they set prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not beat about the bush. The government should stop 
telling us there is no proof of collusion between major oil 
companies. One simply has to walk around and look at the prices 
posted by major oil companies at service stations to realize 
there is collusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Competition Act is full of loopholes. It must be 
strengthened. It must have teeth so that major oil companies can 
be confronted about their actions in the areas of gas and 
heating oil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time the government gave some teeth to that act, teeth as 
sharp as those of the sharks called oil companies. In other 
words, it is time the government assume its responsibilities in 
that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cheque of $125 did not solve anything. It merely eased the 
plight of the poor. 
At least they got that, because when it comes to income tax and 
social transfers, this government has made huge cuts in recent 
years. At least they got that cheque. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, mistakes were made and we cannot accept that some 
inmates received $125 for heating costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did not solve anything with that. Oil prices are 
still rising quickly and so are heating oil bills. We would 
have liked to see the government take that into consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that Canada is being built without 
Quebec. It is absolutely shameful to see that while the summit 
of the Americas is going to be held in our national capital of 
Quebec City, our province is not given a place of choice. 
Quebecers have pride and at some point they will express it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Forty five per cent of those who took part in the latest poll 
support sovereignty without a referendum campaign. This is a 
significant increase in the support for sovereignty. It means 
that at the next referendum, Quebecers will decide to leave a 
country that has no room for them, a Canada that is being built 
without Quebec and without Quebecers. I can assure the House you that 
Quebecers will make that decision. 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B> First of all, Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to congratulate you on your appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to respond to my hon. colleague, whose 
remarks were interesting in some ways and less so in others. It 
was interesting when he dealt with the economy, but less so when 
he started to talk again about Quebec's sovereignty and 
independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, the last referendum was not the first one in 
Quebec. It was the second or the third. The question has been 
widely debated, and each time Quebecers came out in favour of 
the Canadian federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot understand. When are we going to stop talking about 
this issue and deal with the important issues for Quebecers, the 
economic issues? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my hon. colleague to tell me whether or not the 
economic situation of Quebecers is much better now than it was 
ten years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has already given to the provinces, 
Quebec included, a great deal of responsibility in several 
areas. What does my colleague want from the federal government 
for his province to get Quebec off its back once and for all? 
You know as well as I do, Mr. Speaker, that Quebecers are quite 
happy with our way of governing. They are very satisfied with 
the Canadian situation. They are also quite proud of the 
Canadian nation and of their French Canadian heritage. Could my 
colleague answer all these questions?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, in case I forgot to mention it, I 
will be sharing my time with the member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When are we going to stop talking about 
sovereignty?  Never.  So long as it is not a fact, we will keep 
talking about it. 
He had better hold on to his hat, as my colleague from Roberval 
would say, because in the coming months we are going to be 
talking sovereignty more than ever.  He has not understood that 
Quebecers constitute a people and that the throne speech 
contains no reference to the existence of a people and a nation 
in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebecers are a people. 
Although people readily speak of a Canadian people, we are not 
among them.  Let him make no mistake.  The sovereignty option 
had climbed in this morning's poll, without anyone talking about 
it.  Does the member know what the percentage was prior to the latest 
referendum, in 1995, six months before the referendum?  There 
was no talk of sovereignty.  It was 37% or 38% tops.  After the 
referendum campaign, it rose to about 50%.  We lost by 50,000 
votes in the latest referendum.  We are at 45% now, and there is 
no talk of it.  Give that a little thought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebecers are proud.  They are not crazy.  They can see how 
Canada is being built.  They can see that Quebec is being left 
on the fringe in this building activity.  They can also see how 
incredibly arrogant the government is, that it marches right 
into Quebec's jurisdictions and that it is destabilizing 
Quebec's public finances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People should not imagine, and I think it is important to point 
this out, that it is easy to manage Quebec's finances when the 
federal government first slashes transfer payments and then 
leaves us in a state of perpetual uncertainty.  We do not know 
what it is going to do in the coming years.  Now we are 
looking at a throne speech and upcoming bills that show not a 
shred of respect for provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it possible for two independent bodies to run the same 
sector effectively?  Do we want to sit still while the 
federal government takes Quebecers for a ride in sectors such as 
education?  Are we going to allow three-quarters of the Canadian 
population, which lives outside Quebec and is primarily 
English-speaking, to decide the kind of exams French-speaking 
students from Quebec should have to write to get into elementary 
school? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a problem somewhere.  Over the years we defined the 
separation of powers and the jurisdictions to be respected. 
However 
the federal government is not keeping to its part of the 
bargain.  It is more arrogant than ever.  The member is 
asking me what it will take to shut Quebec up?  We are not going 
to beg the federal government for anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The day that Quebecers decide to become a sovereign nation, we 
will stop handing over the $33 billion in taxes we now pay to the 
federal government.  We will manage this money ourselves and 
will not get down on our knees to ask the federal government for 
anything.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I take 
this opportunity to congratulate you on your new 
responsibilities. I want to thank voters in Hochelaga—Maisonneuve 
for putting their trust in me for the third consecutive time. I 
will do my best to live up to the responsibility they gave me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, I would like to congratulate all the new members of the 
House, who will undoubtedly work very hard to serve their fellow 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will expand on what our colleague the member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot has said. The Speech from the Throne is 
disappointing, especially for what it does not say. It is 
interesting to note that as the government is embarking on its 
third mandate, two main characteristics come to mind to describe 
it. First, there is this very contemporary will that would certainly 
be a source of embarrassment for the likes of Lester B. Pearson, 
André Laurendeau and other nationalists who believed Quebec was 
a province unlike the others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rather incredible. The new Liberal members, those from 
Quebec who sit on the government benches, are going to be faced 
with a real challenge. I do not doubt they wish to serve Quebec 
just as I do. However, they will have to say once and for all 
whether they are comfortable with the idea that Quebec is a 
province just like the others and that when we talk about 
Quebec, it is the same as if we were talking about Prince Edward 
Island or Newfoundland. Are they comfortable with this logic 
imposed through the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, 
which considers that all provinces are equal in fact and in law?

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We call this the ideology of egalitarianism. However, what is 
interesting is that this cannot be possible. We cannot say on 
the one hand that we wish to have a strong French speaking 
Quebec in North America and, on the other hand that Quebec is a 
province like the others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot on the one hand say that there is a Quebec model 
with the Mouvement Desjardins, with a social safety net that 
cannot be found outside Quebec and on the other hand maintain 
that Quebec is a province like the others. 
We cannot on the one hand vote on a bill in 1997 that 
allegedly gives Quebec a veto and that recognizes Quebec as a 
distinct society and on the other hand deprive Quebec of its 
full powers in immigration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am one of those who believe that in the coming years the 
sovereignist movement, a democratic movement that has deep roots 
in the Quebec society, will go on. I remind the House that each 
time the citizens of Hochelaga—Maisonneuve have had the 
opportunity to do so, they have voted for sovereignty. It is the 
people of Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, whom I am pleased to represent 
here, who for the first time elected a sovereignist member to 
the national assembly, Robert Burns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the coming years, Quebecers will have to face a truth test. 
This identity confusion being maintained by the federal 
government cannot go on indefinitely. As I said, Canada is a 
great country for Canadians. I am convinced we have friends 
everywhere in Canada and that for those living in English Canada 
that country deserves to be defended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However this cannot be the case for a Quebecer. We cannot accept 
that a province like Quebec, which has its own legal system, a 
language different from that of the majority, its own history and a 
desire to live together all these things being the attributes of 
a nation under international law, to be reduced to the status of an 
ordinary province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could have recognized the specificity of Quebec 
in the Speech from the Throne. 
I see new government members who have been democratically 
elected. It is quite acceptable in democracy for people to 
choose between the two main constitutional options: the 
federalist option and the sovereignist option. The issue must 
always be settled by the voters, democratically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, why does this government keep saying that Quebec is a 
distinct society while this statement is never backed up by 
concrete initiatives? For instance, in the case of parental 
leave, why is it that the government continues to ignore one of 
the strongest consensuses in Quebec society? Women's 
federations, management, unions and consumer associations all 
agree that there should be only one parental leave system and 
that it would be easier for the national assembly to improve 
this system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an aside, let me remind hon. members of a letter that the 
Canadian Conference of Bishops sent to those beginning their 
third term, as well those beginning their first one. The letter 
pointed out that during the last campaign the Liberal 
government indicated that 1.33 million Canadian children, one in 
five, were living in poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no wizardry involved here. If there are children living 
in poverty, it is because there are families living in poverty. 
Of course, one way to fight poverty is to increase the parents' 
disposable income to ensure that those who are not in the 
workforce can access it and that single parents who want to 
benefit from a parental leave plan can do so, and be assured 
that they have the best plan possible.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we can count on the new Quebec MPs on the government side 
to support one of the most solid consensuses in Quebec society, 
a consensus on the necessity for the federal government to enter 
into negotiations to ensure that Quebec national assembly be in 
charge of parental leave.

issues, and that the issue of poverty will always be on my 
agenda.

economic growth. 
As parliamentarians, we must realize that economic growth and 
job creation no longer go hand in hand. Things are not as they 
were in the 1950s. Economic growth does not mean that every 
person capable of working can get a job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why over the next few months we, as parliamentarians, 
will have to be extremely ingenious and courageous in terms of 
the social policies we want to put forward and the means we want 
to use to fight poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a few days, I will introduce an anti-poverty bill aimed at 
giving to the Canadian Human Rights Commission a new mandate in 
this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I want to mention that, in a few weeks, we will be 
celebrating the tenth anniversary of the report tabled in the 
national assembly by the Bélanger-Campeau commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will recall that this commission has a special status 
since, even when the federal Department of Intergovernmental 
Affairs alludes to it, it recognizes its status as a constituent 
assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the first time in Quebec history, the national assembly 
recognized, through the Bélanger-Campeau commission, its 
inalienable right to make a partnership offer to English Canada 
and to achieve sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of the House of Commons, it will be incumbent upon 
us on this tenth anniversary to recognize the non-negotiable 
right of the national assembly to make a partnership offer to 
the rest of Canada and to lead us toward sovereignty, if that is 
the wish of a majority of Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, in the Bloc Quebecois, will work toward that in full

motivated us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday the ethics counsellor met with the Prime 
Minister to discuss changing the federal conflict of interest 
code to prevent the Prime Minister from lobbying heads of crown 
corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under these new suggested rules, the intense pressure that the 
Prime Minister put on the president of the Business Development 
Bank in 1997, a person by the way whose job depended on the whim 
of the Prime Minister, would now clearly be unethical.  However, 
if it is unethical now, why was it not unethical then? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this change of heart not really a tacit admission that what 
the Prime Minister did was wrong? 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have to reject the premise of the hon. member's 
question.  As I understand it, the ethics commissioner, Mr. 
Wilson, made some proposals, only, to the Prime Minister for his 
consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has joined with business people from all over 
Canada on the team Canada mission to China.  He has not had a 
chance to consider these proposals.  I am sure he will do so and 
reach conclusions on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I understand it, the hon. member is completely wrong when he 
says that Mr. Wilson has stated a final conclusion as to what 
changes should be made in the rules.  The Prime Minister will be 
considering Mr. Wilson's ideas in this regard. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, he has not come to a conclusion because the Prime 
Minister has not told him what to say yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last election the ethics counsellor claimed that the 
Prime Minister was not in conflict when he forced the Business 
Development Bank to lend $600,000 to the Auberge Grand-Mère.  The 
ethics counsellor took as an authority the B.C. conflict 
commissioner's report, yet he deliberately left out the portion 
of that report that prohibited ministers from lobbying agencies 
of the crown.  Now he has suddenly had a revelation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was the ethics counsellor not simply a convenient political tool 
used by the Prime Minister during the last federal election 
campaign? 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have to reject the unwarranted slur of the Alliance 
Party on the ethics counsellor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The appointment of Mr. Wilson was the subject of consultation 
with the previous Reform Party and the second opposition party. I 
understand the opposition members spoke publicly in praise of Mr. 
Wilson, so there is no basis for that unwarranted slur on him now 
just because he has not turned into a tame tabby cat for the 
opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premise of the question is wrong.  The ethics counsellor did 
not find that the Prime Minister did anything wrong.  It was just 
the opposite.  He said the Prime Minister was doing what other 
people do as MPs in carrying out their jobs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, even the so-called ethics counsellor, who is by the way 
another person who owes his job to the Prime Minister—he is 
there at the whim of the Prime Minister—is now suggesting 
changes to the conflict of interest rules that would officially 
make the Prime Minister's actions improper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On next Tuesday every member in the House will have an 
opportunity to fix this mess by voting in favour of an 
independent ethics commissioner who reports to parliament, not to 
the Prime Minister.  This will be a fulfilment of the red book 
promise.  It is exactly verbatim the promise made by the Liberal 
Party during the election campaign.  It is lifted verbatim.  It 
is exactly what the Liberals promised.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing has changed in that regard.  The nature of the

these words of praise and endorsement were stated for the ethics

pressured the president of the Business Development Bank, a man 
directly dependent upon him for his job, to give a loan to a 
hotel next to a golf course in which the Prime Minister held an 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is clearly inappropriate.  The Prime Minister insists he 
did nothing wrong, even though the ethics counsellor now says the 
rules must be changed.  Why did the Prime Minister still not 
recognize that what he was doing was in fact wrong? 
<P><A NAME="LINK57"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member's facts are wrong.  The Prime Minister 
did not pressure the president of the Business Development Bank. 
I understand he made representations equivalent to what members 
of all parties do in carrying out their work as MPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it is correct to say that the ethics counsellor 
now says that what the Prime Minister did at the time was wrong. 
He has made proposals for consideration of changes in the rules 
eventually.  The ethics counsellor categorically ruled.  The 
opposition has said he was a man of integrity when he was 
appointed, and he is still a man of integrity.  This man of 
integrity ruled that the Prime Minister did nothing wrong.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid (Lanark—Carleton, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>First the ethics counsellor is forced to exonerate the Prime

Minister is ready is the ethics counsellor now allowed to discuss 
changing the rules.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The spokesman for the then Reform Party said “The person in the 
position right now is an honourable person.  He is a man of 
integrity.  He is a man that can be trusted”.  That was a fact 
in 1995 and it is a fact today.  On that fact the hon. member on

equalization program was one of the very few that was not cut. In

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the government just spent $1.3 billion to cushion the 
high cost of heating fuel for low income Canadians.  The problem 
is that a large portion of that money has gone to people who do 
not pay heating bills because they are renters and tenants and it 
is the landlord who pays the heating bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of Finance.  Will he stand up 
and apologize to Canadians for blowing $1.3 billion of taxpayer

was it just another election ploy to buy votes? 
<P><A NAME="LINK92"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

question is for the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In responding earlier to my colleague, he talked about the 
changes to equalization.  However, it is really the clawback 
arrangement that concerns us.  When Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and 
other provinces develop their resources, most of the royalties 
from those resources go to the federal government and we are left 
with very little.  If we could keep our royalties until we 
reached the Canadian average, we would be a contributor.

the royalties that accrue to the Government of Canada are 
transmitted to the offshore provinces.  Obviously that has to be 
taken into account in the equalization formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To help offset that there is an equalization offset.  The

$50 million.  The equalization offset in the case of Nova Scotia

dollar of revenue from the offshore to Nova Scotia, 19 cents 
stays in the province of Nova Scotia and 81 cents goes to the 
Government of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member ought to know that equalization is based 
on the respective fiscal capacities of individual provinces. 
There are seven such recipient provinces.  If we are going to 
treat them fairly, each among themselves, then we must do so on 
the basis of their respective fiscal capacities.  That is what 
equalization does.  That is why as the country evolves, 
equalization evolves.  It is constantly under review.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Yves Roy (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, a few weeks 
before the election was called, the government decided to send 
out $125 rebate cheques, supposedly to offset the increase in the 
price of heating oil for needy Canadians.  It is obvious that 
this hastily thought up scheme to get more votes has done 
nothing to improve matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the Minister of Finance is this:  Does the 
minister realize that, far from being a lasting solution, his 
vote getting scheme had no other purpose than to portray him as 
sympathetic to voters, especially those in the greatest need? 
<P><A NAME="LINK125"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
purpose of the program was to help the needy with a cheque of 
$125 per individual and $250 per family, for a total of 
$1.3 billion.  It has been quite a success, with 11 million 
Canadians receiving cheques.  This is a great help right now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jean-Yves Roy (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, nothing

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if I 
understand the member's question correctly, he is saying that we 
should not have taken quick action. I do not agree.  There were 
increases in the cost of heating oil and it was important for 
the government to come to the immediate assistance of these 
families.  That is what it did.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada,

that when offenders or prisoners have had handcuffs on they have

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish 
to raise a matter of privilege, relating to an incident that has 
just occurred during Oral Question Period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that this was something serious.  As an 
opposition MP, with a duty to monitor the actions of this 
government, I questioned it on a number of investigations in 
which it is involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his response, the leader of the government raised doubts, in 
my opinion, as to my integrity and professionalism, and 
threatened me with legal proceedings as an individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask for some direction from the Chair.  As an opposition 
MP, am I forced to keep in mind that, when we rise to demand an 
accounting from the government and if the matter happens to be 
a sensitive one involving investigations, we will be gagged, 
denied our right to speak and met with a barefaced threat of 
legal proceedings?  The government House leader invited me to 
repeat my words outside the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion it is the role of the opposition to raise 
questions. 
Perhaps those questions may not please the government, but since 
we are a responsible opposition, because in our souls and our 
consciences we consider it our duty to ensure that the 
government is answerable for its actions when there is an 
investigation, I consider this totally inappropriate and 
unacceptable and I feel that my privileges as a parliamentarian 
have been breached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my colleagues, I wish to inform you that we are 
going to ask questions concerning the investigations involving 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My expectation is that, out of a sense of responsibility and 
respect of the duties of parliamentarians, the government House 
leader will rise in his place and apologize to me, for I have 
been injured in my responsibilities, in my duties and in the 
way I represent the people of Hochelaga—Maisonneuve in this 
House.

I also want to address the question of privilege raised by the 
hon. member and express my support for what he just said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a parliamentarian, I too was surprised and even shocked by 
the comments of the government House leader. Hon. members know 
that what the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve was referring to 
has often been covered. On a number of occasions, the media have 
covered some 20 investigations that are being conducted in 
Quebec on a number of grants, particularly some granted by Human 
Resources Development Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fail to see how, today, a member who raises this issue in the 
House can be the object of a barely veiled threat on the part of 
the government House leader, who dared him to repeat the same 
comments outside the House, thus implying that the federal 
government would go so far as to sue the member for something 
said here and repeated outside the House. This is an issue that 
is widely known, an issue that has been reported by the media 
and that has been the subject of statements outside this House. 
I also find it quite unacceptable to see the government starting 
to resort to the very dangerous habit of daring opposition 
members to repeat outside the House what they say here, so that 
the government can sue them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I respectfully submit to the Chair that our privileges as 
parliamentarians have been, if not violated, at least seriously 
threatened by what the government House leader just did. 
<P><A NAME="LINK157"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard—La Prairie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
obvious that all members have the same privileges and are 
entitled to express their views as they see fit in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government House leader did was to point out that a 
premise in the question was fundamentally inaccurate, and this 
is something the Canadian public needs to know, that is that the 
government is not under investigation.  The fact that certain 
grants are under investigation does not mean the government 
is under investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the government House leader did was say that if the members 
opposite have any proof that the government is under 
investigation, which is not now the case, they should step 
outside the House and say so publicly to all Canadians.  This is 
an entirely legitimate attitude. 
The Government of Canada is not under investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is not true.  I would like 
some direction from the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair examines all these issues very 
seriously.  I would not want to see this turn into a debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of privilege raised by the hon. member for 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve will be examined seriously, as it deserves 
to be.  First, I must allow the hon. government House leader to 
reply, I hope at the earliest opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will then be able to proceed with this question of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. I am greatly 
comforted to know that you will give this matter all the 
attention it requires. You have my full confidence and that of 
my colleagues as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would like you to also consider the fact that when 
the deputy government whip rose, he asked us to make a 
distinction.  When he rose in his place and said that the 
government was not under investigation, he was calling 
ministerial responsibility into question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope you will take into account in your reflections that 
we cannot make a distinction—

Minister make a full statement to the House if necessary.

from the current status of 12 to 10.

transfer provisions that can bring a youth into adult court and 
would apply to a child being brought into youth court.  This is

at the younger age of 10.

pleased to rise in the House today to present three petitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first petition has a number of signatories from across

from the Vancouver area who are very concerned about any 
proposals to create a third category status for herbs and

third petition that I am very pleased to present today has been 
signed by petitioners who are very concerned about Canada's trade

issues that are being debated within a trade liberalization 
agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners call on parliament to ensure that health care, 
education and culture are completely carved out of WTO 
agreements.  They say that we must build an alternative model of

the House of Commons, and it is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind him also that it took 20 years of repeated 
requests by successive governments of Quebec to reach that 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope all members will recognize that the national 
assembly, which has an integrated policy for those who are not 
on the labour market, was finally able to take over manpower 
training. Lucien Bouchard's government has an excellent track 
record in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the hon. member will not jump too quickly to a conclusion 
and start to believe that, since the government of Quebec and 
the House of Commons were able to reach an agreement, that Canadian 
federalism is a flexible and collaborative system, because we, 
on this side of the House, do not agree with that.

<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I will read to the member from 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve a few paragraphs from the recent Léger 
poll in Quebec and then ask him a question. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT29"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT29"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1225

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The latest poll by Léger Marketing says that three-quarters of 
Quebec residents see themselves as Canadians and not just 
Quebecers.  According to the poll, more than half the respondents 
oppose Mr. Landry's plan to have the Quebec government actually 
promote sovereignty.  Further, only about 15% say they want to 
see the total independence of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Léger added that the poll certainly shows that Quebecers do 
not want a referendum and do not want the government spending 
their money to promote sovereignty.  It found that 55.3% of 
decided voters would vote against sovereignty, even if it were 
accompanied with an offer of a partnership with the rest of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, the pollster said, there is considerable 
demand for change in Quebec's role in Canada, with only 20% 
saying they would be satisfied with the status quo.  Quebecers, 
said the pollster, “are rejecting the two most radical options, 
sovereignty and the status quo”.  The bottom line, said Mr. 
Léger, is that Quebecers “want to remain a part of Canada, even 
though 45% say they would vote for sovereignty.  The problem is 
that they are not satisfied with either the status quo or with 
the proposal for sovereignty”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When are the Bloc members, who profess to be democrats, going to 
start representing the will of a majority of Quebecers and start 
looking for a third way, between sovereignty and the status quo 
federalism of the current Prime Minister? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish a speedy recovery to my 
colleague, the hon. member for Calgary Southwest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, the popularity of the sovereignist option goes up and 
down. In 1993 and 1994, it went up as high as 67%. That is 
democracy, and we accept that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am the member for a riding that has been supporting Quebec 
sovereignty since 1970. We have always advanced our option 
through democratic means, and we will continue to do so. 
The difference between the hon. member for Calgary Southwest and 
me is that I think the renewal of federalism is an 
impossible task. The hon. member wants to be responsive to 
Quebec, and that is positive. I know he is a sincere man. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope we can count on him to recognize that Quebecers have the 
right to choose their own future. Sovereignty is one of the 
choices that can be made, and we will continue to promote this 
option in the most democratic ways.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):</B>  Madam Chair, 
I want to advise you of two things.  First, I will be sharing my 
time with the member for Gatineau.  Second, and just as 
important, I take this opportunity to congratulate you, Madam 
Speaker, on your new responsibilities.  I am confident, from the 
way you have worked in the past with colleagues from all parts of 
this Chamber, that you will treat us very fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am actually very glad that as we close the debate I have the 
opportunity to respond after listening to what has gone on since 
the throne speech.  Before I do that, I want to take this 
opportunity, my first opportunity after the election, to express 
my gratitude and my appreciation to my constituents of 
Scarborough Centre, who for the third time decided, in their 
wisdom, to show their confidence in me through their vote and 
permit me to be here to carry their voice to Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time I would like to thank my campaign team and the 
many volunteers.  I want to point out with respect to volunteers 
that we are celebrating the International Year of Volunteers this 
year.  I was blessed to have volunteers from all parts of our 
society.  It was a thrill for me to see both the young and the 
old participate, especially the young, who came to offer their 
knowledge and whatever time they had.  I say a great big thank 
you to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also say a great big thank you to my family:  my wife Mary, my 
three children, Irene, who is now married to my new son-in-law 
Tony, and my sons Paul and Daniel, who participated as well.  The 
family closeness we have gives me the opportunity to be here and 
speak on behalf of my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened to the debate over the past little while and to 
question period and I am not going to go into a lot of the 
details of what the throne speech had to say, because we have 
heard it over and over again.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk a bit about what was discussed during the debate. 
All hon. members did not strictly focus on what was said in the 
debate, for example the points the throne speech brought forward 
in terms of what we are to do during this session and some of the 
programs we are to support: the youth programs, the health 
programs, research and innovation, et cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the election call we went to the people of Canada and 
made a statement.  We said that should we be re-elected these 
were the things we would like to do and these were the programs 
we would want to implement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view we put our necks on the line.  Canadians had clear 
choices to make.  They knew what the Liberal team, headed by the 
Prime Minister, was planning to do over the next mandate.  If 
they were not pleased with those proposals, they could have voted 
us out.  However they chose not to do so.  If anything, the 
results speak for themselves.  They chose to return the 
government and the Prime Minister with an even bigger majority 
than we had in 1997, almost equal to the majority we had in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that tell us?  It tells us that during our statements 
on programs and in debates with candidates in the election in my 
view there no ambiguity in what we had to say.  We were telling 
Canadians, because it was of great concern at that time, what 
would happen to the system we all cherish, the system that 
separates us from most other countries: our national health care 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We said that the government would stand firm to make sure that 
all Canadians, no matter where they find themselves, no matter in 
what part of the country, would be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also prior to the election we made a commitment.  We had an 
agreement with the provinces.  All the provinces came on board 
and agreed to the transfers that will now be implemented.  I was 
very pleased to have had the opportunity to talk about that 
commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very pleased in the last election, and I want to do it 
again, to turn the clock back.  In order to appreciate where we 
are today, we have to think and realize where we came from. It 
was very appropriate then, and I believe it is now, to reflect 
back for a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, when we assumed government, unfortunately we inherited 
a mess.  The country was in a mess, sadly to say, but I am 
pleased to say that we have turned it around.  We had a deficit 
of over $42 billion that was out of control.  We had a debt that 
was rising continuously and we had no control over it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had an unemployment rate of 11.4% or 11.5%.  The youth were 
discouraged, not knowing what tomorrow had in store for them. 
Seniors did not know whether or not their pensions were secure. 
The list went on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reference has often been made to red book one, “Creating 
Opportunities”.  In 1993 we went to the people with that book. 
We put down in writing, and it was unprecedented at the time, 
what we intended to do should we be elected, so that people could 
come back to us in a year or three or five years to keep us to 
our promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One commitment which has been raised over the last week or so 
during the debate was the so-called GST.  I take this opportunity 
to read from the red book, because the media clips that were 
picked up printed only half of a paragraph or a comment. 
Opposition members, as is their privilege to do so, will only say 
what they want to say but not complete the sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read exactly what was said on page 22: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Liberal government will replace the GST with a system that 
generates equivalent revenues, is fair to consumers and to small 
business, minimizes disruption to small business, and promotes 
federal-provincial fiscal co-operation and harmonization.

chose to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members from the then Reform Party, today's Alliance Party, made 
some provocative statements with respect to members' compensation 
and pensions.  They said never.  Last night I was watching my 
good friend Mike Duffy interview the Reform Party member for 
Medicine Hat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order to point out that the Reform Party is not a party in the 
House.  It is the Canadian Alliance.  He should withdraw that 
reference and refer to us as the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis:</B>  Madam Speaker, I withdraw what I said. 
The then Reform Party is today called the Alliance.  I will state 
what I was asked during the election.  The member has taken me 
off track what I wanted to say.  Maybe I can put it on record 
right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those members go out during the election and make statements 
that they are a new party.  If they are prepared to say that they 
were then the Reform Party and have simply changed names, I could 
understand.  I have every right to refer to what it was called 
then and to what it is called today.  I am sure the hon. member 
will agree with me on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, I was referring to an interview that took place of 
the member for Medicine Hat last night by my good friend Mike 
Duffy.  I appreciate Mike Duffy is an astute reporter and asks 
the right questions.  The member for Medicine Hat had difficulty. 
He said that he talked to his executive committee before the 
election.  I challenge him to read in <I>Quorum</I> today where it 
states that the executive did not know:

Wednesday he was unhappy with the decisions of Solberg and Grey. 
“They've done what I call a popular politician's manoeuvre”.

out west that has to do with separatism.  Animosity and concern 
exist.  There is talk coming out of B.C. from the new Alberta 
separatist party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the issue that upsets me as a Canadian.  Instead of 
reaching out, there is a task force that will look into it.  I am 
concerned that the task force might provoke emotions.   We are 
trying to bring the country together, but in the end we will have 
done nothing but maybe split it further apart.  One comment made 
by the 10 West Group was:  Why are Canadians not like Americans? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not hear the state of California, Texas or New York saying 
they will separate, every time they get upset and do not agree 
with Washington.  Maybe that is the difference.  Maybe we should 
just take the word out of the Canadian vocabulary.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, before I deal 
with the throne speech, I would like to thank most sincerely my 
constituents in Gatineau for putting their trust in me once 
again. 
I am deeply grateful for the trust they have given me in 
the last election. They know I am always there to serve them, no 
matter what their problems are. They will always be welcome, and 
I hope to be able to always meet their aspirations and help them 
with their representations.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to congratulate the member for Kingston and the 
Islands on his being elected as Speaker of the House. It is 
quite an accomplishment on his part, and I have no doubt that 
his role in the House will be a competent one, thanks to his 
extensive knowledge of the procedure and the fairness of his 
rulings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to congratulate the member for Ahuntsic on her 
being appointed Acting Speaker of the House. I know the member 
for Ahuntsic greatly enjoys being part of the action in the 
House, and I am very happy for her that she has the opportunity 
to serve in such a sought after position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last election campaign, a number of issues were 
raised regarding the national capital region, particularly on 
the Quebec side of the Outaouais region, which I have the 
pleasure and the honour to represent as the member for Gatineau. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national capital region, on the Quebec side, is the most 
bilingual region in Canada, and we are very proud of that. Over 
the years, we have played a major role in the Public Service of 
Canada because of our ability to speak both official languages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the new economy, we realize how important it is for both 
sides of the river to co-operate. I call it “dialogue across the 
river”. For several years now, we have been witnessing the 
astounding boom of the high tech sector all across the world, 
especially in Canada, in the U.S and in Europe. We have been 
fortunate to benefit from the development of the high tech 
sector in the national capital region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have great strengths on the Quebec side. 
I met with a group of high tech industry representatives and I 
told them I was looking for co-operation from both sides of the 
river to ensure continued progress and development in that 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is extremely important for our young people who graduate 
from colleges and universities, so that they can find work in 
this new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the months and years to come, the region's economy will 
depend on the development and expansion of high tech, which is 
not only very important but is also creating an unprecedented 
prosperity level. That is why co-operation between governments on 
both sides of the river is so important. We have to ensure 
continued expansion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to what was discussed in the last election, that 
is the significance of infrastructures in this region in terms 
of roads or bridges across the Ottawa river. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is clearly a need for strong co-operation between both 
provinces and the National Capital Commission, which plays a 
very important role in the development of our region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Gréber Report provided for the building of a new bridge over 
the Ottawa River. The building of such a structure at a certain 
place has been planned for 25 years. However recently some members 
of the new Ottawa city council appear to be hesitating. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1245"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking closely at the issue. After having planned for 25 
years the building of a bridge a given corridor, we must admit 
that progress and politics are two different things. We want 
progress to continue, but we cannot have progress without 
planning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last 25 years, something has been planned, which should 
be respected. If there are policy considerations, I believe it 
is incumbent upon us to conclude that they ought to be put aside 
and to think about what is best for the whole national capital 
region of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that if Canadians have put their 
confidence in the Liberal Party, it was probably for a number of 
reasons. One thing that characterizes the Liberal Party of 
Canada is the fact that we are always conscious of the fact that 
there are people in difficulty in our society, and these are the 
weakest members of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have always tried to find solutions, such as social policies, 
to help them. That is what we did last fall with the rebates 
designed to counterbalance the higher than expected increase in 
the price of heating oil. This was but one of the measures we 
took. All this is to say that we have always been conscious of 
the most disadvantaged in our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the campaign, we also noticed that the health issue was 
extremely important in the minds of people. 
This is why the government decided to invest massively, more 
than $20 billion, in our health care system, to make sure that 
all Canadians, regardless of social standard, have access to the 
medical care they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also extremely important to ensure that research 
continues. We know that research is forms the basis for progress 
in years to come. The importance of research in all areas, to 
allow us to position ourselves in the new world economy, can 
therefore not be overemphasized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reminds me of when the former French President François 
Mitterand was re-elected. At the beginning of his second mandate, 
someone asked him this question: 
“Mr. President, what do you think the most important issue of 
your second mandate will be?” Without hesitation, former 
President Mitterand replied “I wish for all French citizens to 
be able to have access to education and to be the best educated 
people in the world, or among the best”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that the Liberal government has as I do, the same 
aspirations for all Canadians, namely invest more in our 
education system to allow each and every Canadian to have the 
best advancement opportunities. This can be accomplished through 
education. There is no other way to succeed in this world. There 
is no other way to be part of the new economy. There can be no 
progress without the highest possible level of education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that my time is up. 
I thank the House for allowing me to say a few words. During the 
weeks and months to come, I will talk again about those 
important issues, not only on behalf of my riding but also on 
behalf of our Canadian fellow citizens.

</H3><P align=left>
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ORAL QUESTION PERIOD 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Earlier today, I believe that two members of the Bloc Quebecois 
raised a point of order, perhaps even a question of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time, the Chair said it would not intervene until such 
time as I also had an opportunity to add a few words prior to 
the Chair's reaching its decision.  I see that the Bloc whip is 
with us, and I believe he is one of the members who spoke a 
little while ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I want to take a moment to inform the Chair that I find 
it totally unacceptable that someone in the House can say that 
the government is under investigation when no minister of this 
government as far as I know, is under any investigation.  I do not 
even know of any public servant involved in the matters in 
question who might be under investigation, far less that the 
government is under more than one investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, if I understand correctly, the members across the way 
have said that it was unacceptable for me to issue a challenge to 
them to repeat this comment outside the House.  Of course, 
anyone familiar with Beauchesne's knows that this is a position 
that has been advanced on a number of past occasions in 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the members across the way have the right to make accusations 
that prove false, here in the House, then I certainly have as 
much right to challenge them to repeat those accusations outside 
the House where they could be subject to the rigours of the 
existing justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I wish to add that certain candidates of that same 
party on the other side of the floor made similar accusations 
during the election campaign.  A former member of parliament 
from that party was served with a lawyer's letter during the 
campaign.  From then on, he stopped repeating the accusation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am very grateful the House leader set out his point 
of view for us.  If you will permit me, I would like, in a few 
minutes and without wasting the House's time, to respond or at 
least correct certain impressions the government House leader 
may have left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it should be pointed out that my colleague from 
Hochelaga—Maisonneuve was referring to the twenty or so 
investigations of grants by Human Resources Development Canada. 
They are a matter of fact.  This is not rambling.  These are not 
gratuitous allegations.  They are not wild imaginings of any 
sort.  They are a matter of fact and have been reported in the 
media.  This is all the member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve was 
referring to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, the government House leader can indeed get on his 
high horse and tell us we can say it outside.  What that 
means and this is the basis for the question of privilege of the 
member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, is that to say it outside 
implies as he mentioned earlier: repeat it outside and the 
government could initiate proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It means that a member could go outside— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B> Would the hon. member please 
conclude his remarks, as this is not a debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Madam Speaker, I am arguing on the merits 
and not debating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, this means, to all intents and purposes, that the 
government is threatening MPs with proceedings, if necessary, if 
it does not like what is said here in the House and could be 
repeated outside.  That is in direct contravention of the rights 
and privileges of parliamentarians in this House, especially 
those of the opposition.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B> As this question of 
privilege was raised while the Deputy Speaker was in the Chair, 
and as he has already indicated to the House his intention to 
return with a ruling once he has heard the government House 
leader, we will continue with the debate on the motion before 
the House at the moment.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion for an address to 
Her Excellency the Governor General in reply to her speech at 
the opening of the session. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened to the speech by the Liberal member, who 
raised two main issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He referred to the throne speech, but he also talked about 
health and education. His speech was pretty low keyed. Anyone 
listening to him who does not know much about politics could 
have thought “This is a reasonable man. He is talking about 
health and education in the House of Commons”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the member represents a Quebec riding. As a 
Quebecer, and also as an experienced and very knowledgeable 
member of parliament, he should understand that he is addressing 
two sensitive issues. I would like to ask him a very simple 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is he aware that health and education are two areas under 
exclusive provincial jurisdiction and that Quebecers are more 
than a tad touchy when it comes to these issues? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he says that education is a must to be successful in life, 
should he not find the fortitude, and I would appreciate an answer 
to this question, to say “The federal government must quickly 
restore its transfer payments to the provinces to the 1995 level 
and provide additional funds and then make up for inflation”. He 
could mention that. 
What the member seems to be saying is that his government will 
be interfering directly in areas under provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, I cannot really blame him because, unfortunately, the 
throne speech seems to indicate that there are no provincial 
governments in this country and that Quebec does not exist. I 
would like his comments on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Assad:</B> Madam Speaker, of course, I am aware that health 
and education come under provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what I said: during the election, the health issue was 
constantly raised. Indeed, the provinces were certainly very 
happy to get the funds invested in this area by the federal 
government. The investment was a very major one for the health 
system, in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that the federal government made a huge investment 
in education. Universities need this money for research. 
I even quoted the former French president to say that, even if 
the area comes under provincial jurisdiction, it is extremely 
important not only for Quebec, but also for all provinces and 
all Canadians. We all live together in the same country and our 
purpose is to move ahead together, not separately. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I did 
not appreciate the answer from my Liberal colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal members always refer to the last campaign. I think 
they have not understood, or did not want to understand, what 
was said during the last campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were saying that the government should restore transfer 
payments to the provinces for health, education and social 
services to the 1995 level. Right now, in 2001, that has not 
been done. The crumbs given by the government is money that 
belongs to the provinces in the first place and all the 
provincial ministers are asking for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think they should stop repeating what they said during the 
campaign, as it has no connection with what was done in Canada 
since 1995. I would like to hear the Liberal member talk about 
the true facts, to hear him tell the truth.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Assad:</B> Madam Speaker, rest assured that the Bloc 
Quebecois are not the only ones telling the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say to my hon. colleague that the people of 
Quebec understood clearly what we said during the last election 
campaign, as evidenced by the fact that we gained ten seats. 
They understood clearly; the Bloc members are the ones who do not 
understand.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with my 
colleague from St. Albert.  It is an honour and a privilege for 
me to rise today to give my third maiden speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take the opportunity at the outset to thank my constituents, 
the people of Prince George—Peace River, for again entrusting me 
with the task of representing their interests here in the House 
of Commons and elsewhere.  I made a pledge when I first ran in 
1988 to represent my constituents to Ottawa and never to 
represent Ottawa to my constituents.  Today I recommit to abide 
by that promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish I had enough time to thank the dozens of people who 
worked on my campaign adequately, not just in the last campaign 
but over four successive ones.  If I were to start naming the 
individuals who were so instrumental in my being here today, it 
would take the entire 10 minutes or more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech was a shining example of a government devoid 
of ideas, reticent of the realities its citizens face, and 
committed to doing the bare minimum in order to remain in power. 
That simply is not good enough.  Canadians deserve more from 
their government and we in the Canadian Alliance are demanding it 
on their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the beginning of the 37th parliament I am pleased to have 
been reappointed the chief opposition transportation critic. As a 
critic my job is not only to critique the actions and policies of 
the government but to provide an alternate vision for 
transportation to meet the economic and safety needs of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not fluent in vague, so it has been very difficult for me 
to decipher what, if anything, of substance was contained in the 
throne speech.  Since the government has left the entire speech 
open to interpretation, I will discuss the Canadian Alliance 
vision and its plan to meet Canada's actual transportation needs. 
I will not discuss rail or grain transportation, as my colleagues 
from Prince Albert and Selkirk—Interlake have either already 
done so or will do so in the near future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that the new economy is an engine of growth 
for Canada.  That does not mean, however, that Canada's 
traditional resource based industry should be abandoned in the 
process.  The throne speech was all about the information highway 
and nothing about the Trans-Canada Highway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best way to promote innovation, growth and development in 
all parts of our economy is to establish an efficient 
transportation infrastructure system that will meet the needs of 
large industry, small business, e-business, agriculture and 
natural resource extraction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Internet and e-commerce require the ability to get products 
to the consumer faster.  People go online and point and click in 
order to get immediate gratification, but we must be able to 
physically deliver products and services faster to meet the 
demands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a commercial on television which sums up the 
government's approach to the new economy.  The commercial shows a 
roomful of techies talking about their new business and all the 
innovative Internet functions it can perform, until one of them 
asks “What about delivery?”  The fact that they needed to get 
their product to the consumer had escaped them.  So too has it 
escaped the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To date the government has all but ignored our deteriorating 
infrastructure.  Canada's highways, ports and airports are 
falling apart while we pay multiple levels of taxes and user fees 
which stuff the general revenue's piggy bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxes are an investment in society.  Canadians deserve a return 
on their investment.  They deserve safe roads and affordable air 
travel, and they should not have to pay more for it. 
I recommend that the government spend money, not new money, but 
reinvest the money collected from the transportation sector back 
into that sector.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very thought of so-called dedicated revenues sends shivers 
down spines in the finance minister's office because it limits 
political choices the government can make about spending.  The 
improvement of our infrastructure is vital to our future 
prosperity, and as such funding should be dedicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States, our greatest trading partner and competitor, 
is way ahead of us in this area.  In 1998 the U.S. passed the 
transportation and equity act for the 21st century.  That bill 
invests $217.9 billion over six years into infrastructure, a 
large portion of which is for roads connecting its borders to 
Canada and Mexico.  That bill legislatively guarantees that a 
minimum of 90.5% of federal fuel tax receipts from each state 
will be returned to that state.  That is foresight.  That is what 
we need from our government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government brings in about $5 billion a year from 
fuel taxes and last year reinvested less than $200 million in 
roads.  That is only 4%.  The Americans spend 90%.  We spend less 
than 5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>NAFTA has augmented the amount of goods that cross our borders 
daily.  It is essential that the trade corridors through which 
the economic lifeblood of our country flows be as efficient as 
possible.  We must reinvest in trade corridor initiatives that 
will improve just in time manufacturing and the other demands of 
the new economy.  Why was there no mention of this in the throne 
speech? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently President Clinton signed the rails to resources act 
aimed at creating a rail link between Alaska and the lower 48 
states through Prince George.  A second phase would involve a 90 
kilometre tunnel under the Bering Strait.  Phase one of this 
initiative is a tremendous opportunity for Canada, and in 
particular for northern British Columbia.  The city of Prince 
George in my riding would benefit from the increased hub traffic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have spoken to Mayor Colin Kinsley and the Prince George city 
council about this prospect and they are excited about the 
potential for growth.  Of course, the port of Prince Rupert would 
also benefit from the increased volume as it is presently 
underutilized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The U.S. has set aside $5 million for feasibility studies.  All 
that is required is Canada's agreement to study the project.  I 
believe it would be a huge mistake and an enormous lost 
opportunity to refuse to consider the proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is there a vision needed for the future but a plan for 
fixing the mistakes of the past.  When Transport Canada was still 
in the business of running airports, it lost upward of $300 
million a year.  As a result of divestiture rents collected from 
the 26 major airports it currently collects $220 million a year, 
and this will grow to half a billion dollars a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This profit is gathered through fuel taxes, ticket taxes, 
airport leases and the GST, resulting in consumers and smaller 
airports bearing higher costs.  As operating costs and hubs 
increase, so too does the cost of tickets to and from smaller 
destinations.  This has reduced the number of people able to fly 
and reduced the amount of tourist dollars spent in local 
economies.  However, the airport user fees are only one of the 
problems facing Canada's airline industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Airline restructuring is creating chaos for the travelling 
public and is hurting the tourism industry.  Government is 
supposed to protect consumer interests.  It has had many options 
to avoid the present monopoly, including increasing foreign 
ownership limits for our airlines to better access capital. 
Instead it chose the wait and see approach, and what have we 
seen?  We have seen a decline in competition, a reduction in 
service, lost jobs and an increase in fares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What of the emerging airlines?  The government must do all it 
can to ensure that the emerging airlines are unencumbered in 
their ability to expand while protected from predatory practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was encouraging to see the announced merger of Canada 3000 
and Royal Air.  This is a baby step closer to creating 
competition in Canada.  The emerging airlines are succeeding in 
spite of the government's policies rather than as a result of 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One such policy, the CARS 308 issue, is indicative of the 
differences in approach between the government and the Canadian 
Alliance, and indeed of the problems inherent in the government's 
approach to business.

its regional airports.  Local airport authorities feel the

most costly elements of the airport's onsite and fire rescue 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the vast majority of agreements were signed, ironically 
the government decided it was necessary once more to have onsite 
fire and rescue, at the airports' expense of course.  The fact 
that the regulations do not augment the safety of travellers and 
will break the financial backs of some airports seems to be of 
little or no consequence to the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously I could go on at great length pointing out the failure 
of the throne speech as it relates to transportation. 
Unfortunately, as many critics in the Canadian Alliance have 
found, there is insufficient time to do a proper job.  In the 
days and weeks and months to come I am sure we will be looking at 
these areas in greater detail.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, actually I found myself agreeing with 
much of what the member opposite was saying because I too believe 
that the federal government should be engaged in developing 
Canada's infrastructure.  I do agree with him that we should be 
looking at improving the highway systems in the land, because of 
course it benefits all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will he not agree with me also that the development of roads and 
that kind of infrastructure is 100% a provincial responsibility, 
and that when the Canadian Alliance and the Bloc Quebecois say 
that the federal government should not intrude into areas of 
provincial responsibility, is there not a contradiction when he 
says, and I agree, that certainly the federal government should 
intrude in areas of provincial responsibility when it is the 
matter of transportation and infrastructure? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Madam Speaker, there is no contradiction 
whatsoever.  I have had private conversations with the hon. 
member, and he often cites as success, or what he deems as 
success, the past infrastructure programs that have been set up 
by the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have often questioned some of the projects the government has 
targeted, whether it was building bocce courts or canoe museums 
rather than investing that money in road infrastructure or water 
and sewer projects.  Some of it was targeted for that and rightly 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member was listening to the thrust of my presentation, he 
would know I was saying that in the United States the vast 
majority of money from fuel revenues goes back to the states. 
Those states then decide how to spend the money on road 
infrastructure. I do not see a contradiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party and I advocate the dedication of that revenue back to 
the provinces.  Yes, it is primarily their responsibility, but I 
see no need for the federal government not to be involved at 
least in some form of negotiation with the provinces so that we 
have a truly national road system that is supported by taxation 
from both levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than shrugging their shoulders and saying that they will 
continue to collect all the money from the fuel tax revenue which 
flows into the general revenues piggy bank and is used however 
they see fit, and rather than the finance minister constantly 
coming up with new programs in which he doles out money for photo 
ops for ministers, it should flow back to the provinces to be 
used for real infrastructure to meet the needs of all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened carefully to what the hon. member for Prince 
George—Peace River had to say. I have two brief questions 
to ask him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since before the election, the federal government, through the 
finance minister, has not stopped taking great pride in the $125 
they gave to the neediest people. It is now telling us that its 
generosity cost $1.3 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have known for some time that about half of that money went 
to people that do not pay for heating oil, to inmates and even 
to deceased people. Does the member not find that this 
government is a grand master in the art of painting a pretty 
picture?

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what I mean. As the member was saying earlier, we know 
that the government is collecting $10.6 billion in excise tax on 
gasoline. The cost of the measure it has announced is $1.3 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member not think that, with its surplus, the government 
is just pretending to be generous, seeing that it has not 
lowered the price of heating oil? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my area, I still receive phone calls from elderly people 
saying “The price of heating oil has not gone down yet. Last 
year, it cost me $600. This year, it will cost me $1,200”. This 
means that the government is painting a bright picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has it done for independent truckers with regard to the 
price of diesel fuel? Over the last year, there has been a 40% 
increase in the price of diesel fuel. I would like my colleague 
from the Canadian Alliance to tell me what the government should 
have done and what it should do, rather than painting a bright 
picture. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Madam Speaker, I know my time is limited. 
I will try and address the questions that my hon. colleague from 
the Bloc raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, what she points out is very true.  There is some very 
poor planning in programs that the Liberal government has brought 
forward.  What we have advocated on this issue all along, and it 
was in a lot of the questions in today's question period, is that 
the government should be reducing the levels of taxation, thereby 
providing relief to all the people faced with these high heating 
bills and high energy costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things the government could do immediately would be 
to eliminate the GST on home heating fuel.  This would be generic 
to everyone and affect everyone's bottom line.  I agree with my 
hon. colleague from the Bloc, there is a very poor program. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate.  Let me also 
thank the constituents of St. Albert for returning me as their 
member of parliament.  They decided not to choose John Williams 
from the NDP, who was also a candidate in my riding, as the 
candidate, but they got the other John Williams. It led to an 
interesting little election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to compliment and thank the people who worked so hard on 
my election.  I think of Janet Bailey, my campaign chairman, 
Charlie Schroeder, who was my assistant campaign chairman, and 
Marlene and Tom Patterson who ran my sub-office in the city of 
Spruce Grove. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, I want to focus on waste, mismanagement, incompetence and 
everything else that we find in government.  Just before the 
election the auditor general tabled a report.  He tabled another 
report this week.  I will quote from the auditor general's report 
because these points should be on the record.  Regarding the 
stewardship of public funds he said that they deserve increased 
attention.  I have, as the President of the Treasury Board knows, 
been trying to elevate the awareness of these things to 
challenging the spending of this government in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to pages 7 and 8 of the forward of the report of the 
auditor general.  In that he said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But shortcomings of the sort revealed at HRDC—vague and 
inconsistently applied eligibility criteria, breaches of 
authority, absence of appropriate control and accountability 
framework—are by no means exclusive to one program or one 
department.  We observed shortcomings of a similar nature (though 
of a lesser magnitude) in our 1996 audit of the Canada 
Infrastructure Works program, our 1997 audit of The Atlantic 
Groundfish Strategy and our 1998 audit of grant and contributions 
programs at Industry Canada and the Department of Heritage. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talking about Canadians, he went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, I share their frustration.  It is discouraging to 
witness new incidents of waste and mismanagement crop up 
hydra-like after older ones have been discovered and dispatched. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my 10 years as Auditor General, I have seen significant 
improvements...often under the pressure of fiscal constraints. 
But progress has been too slow—

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been far too slow and seems to go on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, the auditor general is retiring on March 31.  He 
has been tabling reports for 10 years with little or no sign that 
the government wants to take these things seriously.  For 
example, we had the billion dollar boondoggle at HRDC.  At 
Heritage Canada, 19% of the files have not been subject to due 
diligence.  A further 30% of files were rated as borderline 
acceptable.  That is in paragraph 33.283 in chapter 33 of his 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It just seems that the government does not care until such time 
as somebody points these things out and really slaps the 
government on the side of the head to get it to do something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Page 3411 of his report deals with HRDC and the employment 
insurance fraud which has been going on for many years.  For many 
years HRDC and CCRA officials have been aware of suspected 
fraudulent practices related to the false record of employment 
forms and no action has been taken.  How can this be? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Think of social insurance numbers which were introduced back in 
the early sixties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I was away from the Chamber momentarily but I thought 
that when I left we were debating the Speech from the Throne. The 
debate I am hearing is on the auditor general's report.  Is this 
relevant to the debate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Madam Speaker, money is always 
relevant and the waste and mismanagement of it is always 
relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the waste and mismanagement of money that the 
government outlined in the throne speech, and how it is going to 
spend it.  The problem is that it spends it with abandon, 
carelessly, without proper control and proper diligence.  That is 
why I am talking about waste and mismanagement in the context of 
the throne speech.  It is relevant and always will be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was talking about social insurance numbers which were 
introduced in the early sixties back in the days before we had 
sophisticated computers.  We now have sophisticated programs to 
send cheques out to everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, back in those days an income tax number, social 
insurance number, was basically a file at Revenue Canada.  If 
anyone had a file with Revenue Canada it basically meant he or 
she had to pay money.  Now if we have file with Revenue Canada, 
it usually means a cheque in the mail.  We talked about it this 
week.  The Minister of Finance has sent out $125 to all people 
who do not qualify for the heating oil rebate, including my 
own son.  Guess who pays the utility bill in my home?  It is not 
him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Concerning the social insurance numbers, one person got 76 
social insurance numbers and was getting 76 child tax benefit 
cheques in the mail every month.  The government never reviewed 
the management of social insurance numbers for 30 years, until 
the auditor general pointed it out.  Then it decided that maybe 
it should do something about it.  He does say in the report that 
the government is doing something, but only after 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have treasury board which is not exempt.  Let me quote what 
he says about the treasury board.  He said: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—Treasury Board Secretariat guidelines do stress the importance 
of balanced reporting and the need to report lessons 
learned...little reference in the reports to the fairness and 
reliability of the performance information they contain.  Very 
few reports mention the possibility that there may be 
shortcomings or problems in the data. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think he is referring to what we call the performance reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Treasury board writes all these rules but it does not police 
them.  It sends them out to the deputy ministers and departments 
who just say “Well, that's okay”.  They do what they want 
because treasury board does not hold them accountable.  Until 
such time as treasury board starts policing its own rules for 
departments, we will to continue to find taxpayers' money being 
wasted every time we turn around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Money was wasted deliberately by the Minister of Finance.  He 
sent out $1.3 billion of cheques out in the mail which were 
approved, by the way, under special warrant because parliament 
was not sitting. 
I hope the President of the Treasury Board is going to be making 
a report to us soon because without parliament's approval the 
government should not be spending any money unless it is urgent. 
I am not exactly sure that my son really needed that $125 right 
away.  Some may, but there are hundreds of thousands of people 
who live in apartments.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday an MP told me that one of his constituents who chops 
his own wood got a cheque for about $600.  That was for he and 
his family members. It did not cost him a nickel for his heating, 
but he got a cheque in the mail.  We find these programs, at an 
election time, very susceptible. This should have been a better 
defined program.  It should have been targeted to the people who 
really need it.  We acknowledge that there are people who need 
it.  There are people who have difficulty paying these utility 
bills as the rates go right through the roof because the 
provincial and federal governments have not properly managed the 
production of energy for the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the consumer has to pay for government's mistakes.  The 
government sends out cheques but to the wrong people, and others 
still have a hard time.  We would hope that the government would 
listen to Canadians and ensure that their money is well spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day I pointed out the HRDC billion dollar boondoggle. 
Now we have the Minister of Health and his problems with the 
Fontaine native health treatment centre in Manitoba.  After years 
of knowing that there were problems, he has finally decided to 
have a forensic audit after $30 million went down the drain. 
There were cruises in the Caribbean and deputy ministers going to 
Hawaii courtesy of the taxpayer.  Only after it became a public 
issue did the government say that it got caught and that it 
better do something about it.  That is no way to run a household. 
It certainly is no way to run a business and by far no way to 
run a country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that since we are into a new parliament and we now 
have a throne speech that the government will take its 
responsibilities seriously and ensure that if it is going to 
spend taxpayers' money, that it spends it wisely and well. 
Yesterday, the Minister of Justice yesterday said that public 
business is a public trust.  I would hope the government will 
live up to that, starting today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I wonder if the people in St. 
Albert actually made a mistake and sent the wrong person to 
Ottawa.  Perhaps they were as confused as the member for St. 
Albert is today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members opposite talked about the heating oil rebate program. 
We could have had people filling in forms.  The members opposite 
love filling in forms.  The people would have then had their 
cheques by next winter.  That would have been a reasonable option 
according to the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance Party put a motion in the House just before the 
election calling for a reduction in the excise tax on gasoline. 
A comparable amount to the $1.3 billion would have been maybe a 
cent a litre.  Of course that money would have gone to the oil 
companies.  I assume then that when the member says there are 
people in need, he actually meant the oil companies because a 
litre of gas goes up and down a cent in one afternoon.  We knew 
that a cent a litre would go straight to the oil companies and 
not to Canadians.  That was the proposition the Alliance 
Party brought to the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the members opposite also talked about the fact that half 
of the people who are getting the cheques do not need them. 
Eleven million Canadians are getting them, so a half of 11 
million would be 5.5 million Canadians, low income Canadians who 
do not need heat or who do not have to pay for heat.  In some other 
provinces they might have very generous landlords who do not pass 
on their costs 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member for St. Albert confirm to the House if he 
really feels the rebate should have gone to the oil companies in 
line with the Alliance's proposition before the election was 
called?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Madam Speaker, this is the typical 
logic that we get from Liberals.  They call themselves the 
government.  We all know that half the price of gasoline is tax. 
If they were to reduce the excise tax by one cent, five cents or 
ten cents, surely as a government they could police it too and 
ensure that the consumer received it and not the oil companies. 
It is that simple.  They are the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the hon. member to say that the oil companies would grab the 
extra cents demonstrates the incompetence of the government in 
the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to clarify something 
with the member for St. Albert.  The fundamental problem with the 
energy rebate was that it was a thrown together, knee-jerk 
reaction because of an imminent federal election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they fail to plan, to set targets or to work with accurate 
information and simply throw money out in a shotgun approach to 
buy votes, they are bound to find out in many cases that the 
people who were not supposed to receive the money or did not 
qualify to receive it are getting it.  That is the fundamental 
flaw of the plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the member for St. Albert will agree that a 
conservative thinking government can be shown to be clearly more 
caring than a Liberal government.  A conservative thinking 
government gives out government money for specific projects to 
help people.  It targets the funds specifically to people who 
need it, instead of the shotgun approach the Liberal government 
uses where it throws the money out there and hopes the people who 
need it get it.  In the meantime a lot of people who simply want 
it get it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think I have made my point about what type of government would 
be a more caring government for Canadians.  Perhaps the member 
for St. Albert could confirm that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Madam Speaker, we all know that the 
government cares about the government and does not care much 
about anybody else.  That is a fundamental fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Prince George—Bulkley Valley is right.  The 
government's big announcement the week before the election was 
that it would send cheques out to Canadians to help them with 
their home heating bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Good stuff, but they did not tell people, as they were going to 
the polls to vote for a government that was to send them a 
cheque, that some of them would not get one.  The Liberals sent 
cheques out to a few people, the wrong people and say they 
fulfilled their election promise.  If Canadians had known the 
real facts based on that announcement, that they would not get a 
cheque, I doubt very much they would have returned the 
government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am going to dedicate my remarks 
primarily to the issue of private members' business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also delighted to follow the member for St. Albert so that 
I can also put on the record some of my observations about that 
fuel rebate before I go into the main text of my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would point out to the member for St. Albert that I have an 
older single woman in her eighties living in the village who lost 
her husband many years ago.  She lives in my village.  She lives 
in an Insulbrick house.  Her total income is about $12,000 a 
year.  It is only old age security. If the government had not 
acted as fast as possible on that fuel rebate, she would have 
felt the cold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, low income Canadians who do not pay for their own home 
heating fuel, who are tenants of landlords, also benefit from 
this because, as the Liberal member mentioned, what happens with 
landlords is when the fuel price goes up they pass on the cost to 
their tenants. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1335"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When those tenants are low income tenants, they are going to 
feel that pinch.  My view is that the government did exactly the 
right thing.  It did away with all the potential red tape that 
would have come from the conservative proposals we heard 
opposite.  What it did was it got it out as fast as possible. 
Obviously it was imperfect but at least 80% or 90% of Canadians 
who needed that rebate, whether they needed it directly or 
indirectly, did benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us just get it straight.  If the government did act in a 
compassionate fashion, and if it had taken the course that was 
proposed by the Canadian Alliance, then the people like the one 
that I just mentioned, people who want to live alone but live 
independently and have small means, they would have suffered. I 
can tell you, Madam Speaker, the snow is deep in Ontario as 
well as out west and as well as on the east coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really want to dedicate my remarks to the issue of private 
members' business.  This is relevant to the Speech from the 
Throne because at various times during the speeches the issue of 
opportunities for MPs has come up and whether or not backbench 
MPs in particular and opposition MPs can have a meaningful 
legislative impact on the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think what has been missing from the debate is the opposition 
has tended to suggest that there have been no attempts at reform, 
no attempts at expanding the opportunities of backbench MPs. 
Well in fact, precisely the opposite has occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like, for the benefit of Canadians, to just give a 
little history of private members' business since 1993 when the 
Liberals came to power after the Conservatives.  If the House 
will recall, we came back with quite a large majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Theoretically, when a government has a large majority, it can do 
whatever it pleases in the sense that it really can afford to 
ignore the backbench, but in fact, this government did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the very outset, this government, at least as far as its own 
members were concerned, decreed that all private members' 
business would be subject to free votes on this side.  As a 
government, we cannot dictate to what opposition leaders say to 
their own MPs, but on this side from 1993 onward it was free 
votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the government invited, not initially willingly, but 
after a little while the government invited private members' 
business from this side, as a matter of fact, from anyone, of 
more substance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to 1993, ordinarily a private member's bill would deal 
with an extremely non-controversial, even trivial topic, 
something that the government did not have to worry about, such 
as a name change or things that cost the government no money, 
that would have no potential negative political impact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that changed after 1993 was that the 
government showed a willingness to accept private members' bills 
that dealt with more substance.  Indeed, we started out in that 
line and there were some notable successes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House on all sides that— 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order. I have been listening very carefully to the Liberal 
member from the beginning, and what he is saying has absolutely 
nothing to do with the Speech from the Throne. I fail to see the 
connection— 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  I wish to remind hon. 
members that there is a lot of leeway in terms of the type of 
debate that takes place during the response and the motion to the 
throne speech on both sides of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Madam Speaker, actually I am sure the 
member knew that quite well, but there is some hesitancy on the 
other side of the House to want to acknowledge that in fact we 
have advanced the opportunities of backbench MPs and we have 
advanced private members' business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There seems to be a theme of the criticism coming from the 
opposition that it wants to demean the opportunities of being a 
member of parliament.  It wants to demean the fact of members of 
parliament having all kinds of opportunities.  The very 
opportunity to speak in this place is an enormous opportunity 
that other Canadians do not have.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming back to my theme, and it is relevant to the Speech from 
the Throne because the throne speech is all about where 
parliament is going in the near term, where I will lead in my 
speech is to the fact that indeed there is going to be a new 
incentive and new efforts to expand private members' business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me return to the history because it is very important to 
understand that expanding private members' business and having 
free votes is not as easy as it seems.  In theory it seems great; 
in fact it is very difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the members on the opposite side will know only too well in 
the matter of free votes, it took them years before their leaders 
would allow them to have free votes on private members' business. 
We could see that on this side because they always voted in 
unison on private members' business, always in unison, and surely 
there would be some dissent on that side, one or two, but no, it 
was always the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this side of course there were MPs who would support 
opposition private members' bills, and opposition private 
members' bills actually did pass.  I remember there was one from 
the Bloc Quebecois dealing with the medical use of marijuana. 
That was an opposition private member's bill and it passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It received support from the backbench MPs here.  It had nothing 
to do with the cabinet.  It had everything to do with the 
backbench MPs on this side recognizing that an opposition MP had 
an excellent bill and that it should be supported, and it was 
supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this side of the House I remember a Liberal member introduced 
a private member's bill that determined that those who would 
deliberately circumvent the Access to Information Act should be 
subject to a fine and even jail term.  That succeeded.  It was 
riding of Brampton West—Mississauga and that was a major step 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That did not occur prior to 1990.  It just did not simply 
happen.  The opposition, particularly the Canadian Alliance alias 
the Reform or however we say it, has never been willing to 
recognize that because it is not in its interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private members' business and free votes brings with it 
significant problems.  Also, introducing private members' bills 
that have real substance brings in significant problems.  The 
reality is that individual members do not have the resources of 
government or even the resources of an opposition party to do the 
kind of due diligence on a weighty subject pertaining to private 
members' business that perhaps has to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens and what we have found on all sides of the House is 
that the member may advance a very important private member's 
initiative and the government and the bureaucracy may genuinely 
find problems that have not been considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wind up with a situation where the government knows that the 
bill has a very negative impact that the member is not 
considering.  So the government is opposed on the advice of the 
bureaucracy in the Department of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet the backbench MPs on this side not considering it in the 
kind of depth that the government is considering the issue and 
the opposition MPs wanting to encourage a private member's 
initiative on this side or that side, what happens in the end is 
that the private member's bill, and several have actually done 
this, can get through the whole process because it is free votes 
on this side and get through third reading and actually go on to 
the Senate and be fundamentally flawed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a problem that those of us on this side who were very 
interested in private members' business did not anticipate.  The 
Senate on a couple of occasions blocked private members' bills 
that had passed this House.  This is a very significant step 
because the Senate is not entitled to block a government bill. It 
can return a government bill to the House for amendment but it 
cannot actually stop it.  The Senate has actually blocked private 
members' bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say that what we are looking at here is a very important 
opportunity for the Senate because I think it is very important 
to give private members lots of opportunity to bring in bills of 
significance and substance; but there has to be a check 
somewhere.  Somebody has to do the kind of due diligence that the 
member himself cannot do and that other members are unlikely to 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another reality about private members' business.  When a 
private member submits a bill, and it is in second reading debate 
and then it comes to second reading vote, often members want to 
support that bill on all sides of the House simply because they 
want to support a private member. 
They want to support initiatives that come from backbench MPs, be 
they on this side or that side.  What happens is then private 
members' legislation can escape through the House of Commons and 
it may not be as well thought out as it should be.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So what I hope in the future is that we will see significant 
activity on the part of the Senate in examining private members' 
legislation that reaches the Senate so that the bills, if they do 
get royal assent, are really bills that will help Canadians and 
are of value to the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the free votes I was mentioning that is a problem too, 
because the fact of the matter is that many members do not study 
the private members' legislation in the same way as they might 
government legislation, and in fact the reality, when it comes to 
party discipline or free votes, is that many MPs on both sides of 
the House do not usually look in detail at any legislation, be it 
government legislation or private members' legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, when it comes to a free vote situation then it 
becomes incumbent upon the MPs to examine the bills in great 
detail and often they do not.  That is the reality, and they 
probably never shall.  Somewhere along the line, if private 
members' legislation is going to be a useful addition to 
parliamentary life, we have to make sure that legislation is 
examined in depth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a problem on this side when it came to free votes. 
Because the members are not always reading the private members' 
legislation or considering the full impact, what was happening 
was that the backbench MPs on this side, when a private member's 
bill—even though it is a free vote—was being voted on after 
second reading, would watch the members stand along the front 
benches.  And because they had not read the legislation and 
because people want to generally be on side with their 
leadership, they would take their cue from the front benches. 
What you would see was everyone standing at the two benches here, 
and then everyone on the back benches.  To address this problem 
the subcommittee on private members' business held consultations 
with backbench MPs that went over several years and issued a 
report, first a report just before the 1997 election and then a 
final report after the election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to the guidance of the chairman of that committee, the 
member for Mississauga Centre, a number of very, very important 
recommendations to improve private members' business were made in 
that report and subsequently adopted by the government.  One of 
those recommendations, which is now the practice of the House and 
which led to a change in the standing order, is the idea that 
when the House is voting on a private member's bill the Speaker 
will count the votes from the back benches forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So any Canadian watching a private members' vote will see that 
the vote is counted from behind.  That way, the true backbench 
MPs do not have the opportunity to take the cue from the front 
bench.  Indeed, it has encouraged them to pay more attention to 
private members' legislation and it gives the opportunity to the 
member who has the bill, be it an opposition member or a 
government member, to actually solicit support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That has been an enormous step forward in private members' 
business, just an enormous step forward.  I think, if I remember 
correctly, because I was involved as a witness before the 
committee, that idea in fact was the idea of the member for 
Mississauga Centre.  I think she has significantly changed 
parliamentary life just by that one change to the standing order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That report had other innovations as well.  One of the great 
problems with private members' business is the fact that in order 
to have one's bill advanced for debate in the House it goes into 
a kind of lottery.  In fact, every now and then, about three 
times a year, the Commons clerical staff literally put their 
hands into a hat and draw 30 names of members of parliament.  If 
those members of parliament have motions or private members' 
bills submitted at first reading, then those bills can go forward 
and be debated in the House. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1350"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT46"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT46"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1350
<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I have to tell you that I have put in a number of 
private members' bills over the years and I have never been 
picked in that lottery in six years—six years, Madam Speaker. 
The mathematics, the statistics, of that process are such that 
with 301 MPs it is possible to never be picked for 10 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So another innovation that was brought in by the subcommittee on 
private members' business was the concept of a member of 
parliament getting the support of 100 members of parliament from 
all sides of the House.  Actually what it breaks down to is 100 
members from at least 3 parties, in which 2 of those parties 
would have at least 10 members supporting the bill.  It is a 
little complicated, but the point is that the member could show 
broad support from the backbench MPs.  It could buy his bill 
support to bypass the lottery and go directly on the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That innovation, I think, was a superb innovation because it at 
least reduces the element of chance.  Or to say it another way, 
it makes it not a factor of chance alone to advance a significant 
bill.  I think that was a very important innovation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in practice it did not work very well.  It had a lot of 
problems because a lot of members found it very difficult, 
because when they were given a list asking for the support, and 
the idea was to write their signature, they were torn between 
whether they should sign it because the bill was good or whether 
they should sign it because they liked the member who had the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the old story when we have free votes.  For free votes, be 
it signing your signature to something that is going directly 
onto the order paper or whether it is a free vote on the actual 
vote going through the House, the problem is that if we do not do 
our due diligence we might decide that we want to support the 
legislation simply because we like the member who is putting it 
forward or because the member is on our side or whatever else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess the jury is still out on that process.  I do believe 
that the subcommittee for private members' business, which has 
been re-struck just recently, is going to reconsider that matter 
and see whether there is a way of amending that bit of 
legislation to make it work a little better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should mention, that I am happy to report to 
the House that the chairman of the subcommittee on private 
members' business is the member for Mississauga Centre, so can I 
expect her to give due attention to improving private members' 
business in every way, including this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there is another problem with private members' 
legislation that I have not so far touched upon.  One of the 
advantages that the government has when it introduces legislation 
is that the government has all the power of government and the 
bureaucracy to fight off the special interests that attack 
legislation.  Any bill that is presented before the House, if it 
has any substance at all, is going to be the subject of attack 
from special interest groups, because the reality in society is 
that there are always those who support and there are always 
those who are against.  So in the species at risk bill that is 
coming up right now, you can be very, very sure that there is 
going to be an enormous pressure that will come forward from 
various special interest groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So it was, with a private member's bill that I 
put forward on reforming the Access to Information Act last year. 
It was defeated in this House, a bill that would have advanced 
transparency of government.  It was defeated in this House by 
opposition members.  It was defeated primarily by the Bloc 
Quebecois and primarily by the Canadian Alliance.  It was 
supported primarily by the NDP and supported by the 
Conservatives.  It was defeated, not because they were against 
private members' business.  It was defeated because every one of 
those MPs over there was subject to pressure from special 
interest groups, because when you bring transparency to 
government, when you bring transparency to crown corporations, 
they are going to put a lot of pressure on individual MPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot to do here, but we are making a 
lot of progress, perhaps not with as much help as I would like 
from the opposite side. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I have a couple of points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the beginning of his remarks the member implied that it is 
our position that the throne speech contains no attempts to 
improve parliament.  That is not our position.  Our position is 
that the provisions of the throne speech to improve parliament 
are pathetically inadequate.  I just want to make that clear.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My comment and question really is on the first part of the 
member's remarks, wherein he dismisses the idea that energy 
consumers would be better helped by a tax reduction rather than a 
rebate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This member and other members opposite have resisted every 
suggestion to reduce consumption taxes on fuel or anything else 
by saying that it will not be passed on to the ultimate consumer, 
that it will be absorbed by the oil company, the manufacturer, 
the distributor or someone else.  This is their argument as to 
why there is no point in reducing consumption taxes:  that they 
cannot do it because they cannot pass it on to the consumer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the Liberal Party itself promised to eliminate a 
consumption tax, the GST.  It would never have promised that if 
it had not believed that there was some mechanism to ensure that 
the reduction in that tax was passed on to the taxpayer.  Why 
does the government not take that mechanism, which it had in 
place when it planned to eliminate the GST, and use it to pass on 
a reduction in fuel consumption taxes to hard pressed energy 
users? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Madam Speaker, the answer is clearly 
speed and target.  What we had to do is that we had to get a 
break on fuel taxes to the people who needed it most.  The 
problem with just an across the board rebate is of course that it 
benefits the rich and the people who do not need it quite as 
desperately as those who do.  We are definitely a government 
that, if we are going to respond, we are able to respond to what 
I think was a real crisis in fuel prices.  We responded quickly. 
If we had chosen the rebate route it would have taken about a 
year and it would have helped a lot of people who do not need 
help.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
find it rather paradoxical to hear our colleague on the 
government side talk about government integrity, and the greater 
role members have been given by the government, when this very 
morning we could read on the front page of <I>La Presse</I> that the 
Liberals were getting ready to vote against one of the red 
book's promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the member rise in the House, talk about independence of 
thought, integrity, giving more power to members, when just like 
in <I>The Silence of the Lamb</I> he, along with every government 
member, is going to vote against the red book? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sincerely believe the member is one of the too many Pharisees 
on the government benches. Let us hope that one day in the 
future we and the other opposition parties will be able to wake 
up the government so that it lives up to the promises it made in 
the red book.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Canadian

Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot— 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
put a question to the member. He cannot talk about independence 
of thought and flee like Louis XVI in <I>The Hunchback of 
Notre-Dame</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B> I remind the hon. member 
that we do not refer to whether someone is here or not here in the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Harris:</B>  Madam Speaker, you were quite right 
to advise the member of the Bloc not to talk about the fact that 
the member for Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot fled the 
House.  You were quite right to bring that up, Madam Speaker. 
There he is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was almost laughable, if it was not such a serious thing, 
when the Liberal member in his presentation talked about how, in 
order to catch the cabinet members, the whip and the Prime 
Minister off guard, for private members' bills they count from 
the back down.  How surprised the Prime Minister and the cabinet 
must be with the votes.  How surprised they must be.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us say this to all Canadians, that that is not exactly the 
way it happens.  Prior to the members coming in, sitting on their 
desks, private member's bills or not, is either a demand or a 
recommendation from the government whip.  We have seen those on 
the government benches.  When the member so piously talks about 
how the Liberals have such free votes and how the whips cannot 
see how the members are voting, that is absolute hogwash.  The 
member knows it and now Canadians know it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Actually, Madam Speaker, that is not 
done by the whip.  The whip does not attempt to interfere in 
private member's business.  What was actually happening with 
that, and it was something that evolved when the legislation got 
very controversial because it was not always well thought out, is 
that I think the person responsible for private members' business 
was sending notices around indicating the government's position. 
All it does is indicate usually the Department of Justice's 
position on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was the initiative of the member who was the chairman of 
the subcommittee on private members' business at that time, not 
the member for Mississauga Centre I should stress.  It was a 
subsequent member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a very, very poor practice and I never want to give the 
impression that we have perfected the operation of private 
members' business on this side or on the other side.  I am hoping 
that in this parliament that will be discontinued and we will not 
do that, because I felt the pain of that when my access to 
information bill came before the House.  I think some members 
were influenced by what was before them on their desks and I hope 
that will stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say further that I have watched that side, 
particularly that party, particularly when it was under the 
leadership of the member for Calgary Southwest, and there was not 
a ripple of dissent during most private members' bills.  There 
was always unanimity.  On this side we have had free votes.  We 
have voted contrary to the government's preference more than 2000 
times.  That is 2000 votes since free votes were instituted for 
private members' business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No, what Canadians need to see during a vote is to have the 
camera panned and watch everyone on the other side jump up and 
down like monkeys.  On this side you will see dissent on private 
members' business, Madam Speaker, and that is healthy dissent. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I think I can give a simple explanation to the member 
opposite about the apparent perception of us voting according to 
instructions.  As a matter of fact, I have never ever voted the 
way I have been told.  I have always been persuaded, and that is 
the way the House should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that the discrepancy between us apparently all voting 
together and the members over there voting is that we are all 
subject to collective fine minds and good wisdom.  However, over 
there occasionally, that being lacking but still being a whipped 
vote, we get an unwise vote on that side and a good one on this 
side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could give many examples of different votes which were held in 
the previous two parliaments which were not good for this 
country.  I think of only one, the Nisga'a agreement.  I think of 
the vote on hepatitis C.  Did I say only one?  I mentioned two 
before I could stop my tongue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea of votes and members of parliament representing their 
constituents here is absolutely critical.  It just cannot be two 
or three people putting their heads together and every time 
without fail getting it perfect.  So, why not listen to 301 
members who are properly elected and who put forward amendments? 
Surely we would be able then to get better legislation for the 
Canadian people because we could improve it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mechanism now is that once it is brought in by the 
government, even in committee, amendments are denied.  We bring 
amendments in here and they are denied.  I have had members over 
there say to me that some of the amendments I put forward in 
committee were good amendments.

</I></B></P><P align=left>However, when I asked why they voted against it in committee, 
one of the Liberal members shrugged his shoulders and said that 
they really did not have a choice.  There was a contradiction 
between what the member is saying and what I heard from another 
one of his colleagues.  I would really like to know what it is, 
but clearly we do need to have the freedom as elected members to 
represent—

Vancouver East. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
first may I congratulate you on becoming the Acting Speaker of 
the House.  It is very nice to see a woman in the chair.  I hope 
that it is a worthwhile and rewarding experience. I will be 
sharing my time today with the member for Palliser. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I will thank the people of Vancouver East who supported 
me and voted for me in my re-election.  We went through a very 
interesting federal election campaign and here we are again, back 
in the House and listening to yet another throne speech by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say that I came back with some anticipation and maybe 
even a little bit of eagerness that we might hear something new 
from the government side, that something from the Canadian people 
had resonated with the Prime Minister and government members in 
terms of what would be in the throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Picking up on the debate that we have just been listening to 
about parliamentary reform, I would like to begin with that 
point.  Speaking to backbench members of parliament, whether from 
the government's side or opposition members, there is a very 
strong feeling in this place that parliamentary reform and the 
opening up of the Chamber, in terms of the kinds of rules and 
procedures that apply, is something that is long overdue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of us were listening keenly to the throne speech to know 
if there would be any indication that the message had fallen on 
receptive ears on the government's side.  Unfortunately that was 
not the case.  I would agree with the member for Calgary 
Southwest who said that the so-called comments about 
parliamentary reform in the throne speech were absolutely 
pathetic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle who has long 
championed the issue of parliamentary reform.  I think of the 
discussions I have had with our House leader, the member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona, a person who really understands what 
fundamental changes have taken place in the House regarding 
parliamentary democracy.  It is really a sad day that we have 
come to a point where a lot of us are talking about parliamentary 
reform but nothing has really changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In listening to the throne speech, the thing that I was paying 
attention to was whether the government would be willing to 
address what is truly a national crisis in our country:  the 
growing gap between the rich and the poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just the other day we had a report from the Vanier Institute 
that clearly showed that the gap between the rich and the poor 
was growing.  It pointed out that 20% of families with the 
highest income saw their share of earnings rise 6.6% while the 
lowest fifth, the lowest 20%, saw their share shrink by 5.2%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day in question period I told the government that the 
growing inequality in our country, the growing poverty where more 
and more families are experiencing difficulty in paying the rent 
and finding work, or living on substandard wages, is a direct 
result of a decade of failed Liberal policies that have created 
this inequality.  I must say that the throne speech failed 
miserably to address that issue in any substantial way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the concerns I have, in reading through the throne 
speech, is that the reference to a national project on poverty 
was nothing more than a new guise for a program that one could 
consider a workfare type of program, where low income parents on 
welfare would be motivated or compelled to work in the low wage 
ghettos and be subsidized.  It is really a subsidization program 
for employers who provide very low wages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the government's answer to dealing with poverty.  It 
does not deal with the reality that one in six Canadians live 
below the poverty line.  It does not deal with the reality that 
many aboriginal people are living in destitution and poverty on 
reserves as well as off reserves.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The messages and the commitments in the throne speech were 
utterly disappointing in addressing what I believe is truly a 
national crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same goes for housing.  Any organization that has dealt with 
this issue, national housing groups, housing advocates and people 
who deal on the front line, have said over and over again that 
what the government must do is get back into the housing supply 
program.  There is no getting away from that simple 
straightforward fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, what did we see in the throne speech?  We saw one 
reference where the government will stimulate the creation of 
more affordable rental housing.  What this says to me is that the 
government is now ready to begin a program of basically 
subsidizing developers.  This is not a national housing strategy. 
This will not provide affordable housing for families, single 
people and seniors, the people who really need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada had good housing programs.  They were dismantled by this 
government.  It was one of the things that fell under the axe 
when the finance minister brought in his draconian cuts which 
were basically done on the backs of the poor people.  The housing 
program was one of the victims of that.  As a result, we now have 
something like 200,000 people sleeping on the streets.  We have 
millions of Canadians who are inadequately housed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very disappointed that we got a mere line in the throne 
speech and no reference to a real national housing strategy. 
This is particularly reprehensible when one considers that the 
finance minister, who is sitting on a big fat surplus, 10 years 
ago in the opposition actually produced a very good housing 
report.  The report called for a lot of the kinds of programs 
that people today are still today calling for.  Does that 
minister believe in his own report that he wrote a decade ago? 
It is the kind of hypocrisy that makes Canadians feel very 
cynical about the political process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the spokesperson in our party on the issue of post-secondary 
education, I try to stay on top of what the government is doing 
or is not doing when it comes to helping students.  We only heard 
about the innovations of the high tech future of Canada, the 
vision of the future and the knowledge based economy.  All these 
platitudes there were in the throne speech.  There was not a 
single reference to the crushing debt that students are facing in 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is Canada only one of three OECD countries without a 
national grants program?  Why is the average student debt now 
$25,000?  Why have student loan bankruptcies increased 700% since 
1989?  It is because the government has abandoned post-secondary 
education.  The retreat of public funding and the dramatic 
increase in tuition fees of about 240% is now hammering students. 
They are graduating into poverty.  That is the Liberal answer to 
post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to issues of justice and equality, the throne 
speech had nothing to offer.  When we put the picture together 
and looked at where we are headed as Canadians, I and my 
colleagues and in the New Democratic Party have very deep 
concerns about the vision of the government.  We have concerns 
about the very role of government.  It has changed its vision of 
helping people, of providing a social safety net and of 
strengthening democracy.  It has now become the propaganda 
machine and the movers and shakers for globalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were also looking for references that would deal with the 
threats of corporate globalization, that would respond to the 
concerns from Canadians about how the free trade area of the 
Americas and the WTO and these trade agreements and how the 
issues and concerns about weakening democracy in those agreements 
were going to be dealt with.  Again, the throne speech was silent 
on this matter.  There were no references to banning bulk water 
exports, something that Canadians are extremely concerned about. 
There was no commitment to environmental labour or public concern 
about meeting to carve out these issues in any trade deals.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the New Democratic Party see this as the most pressing 
issue before us.  Whether we are talking about health care, 
education, culture or our very democratic foundation, we are 
threatened by globalized trade agreements that are literally 
transferring power from democratically elected governments to 
private corporations that have no accountability.  The government 
is allowing that to take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are just a small group but we will be a very strong force in 
taking on this issue in parliament and challenging the government 
on its agenda in this regard.
