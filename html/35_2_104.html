<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BILLC-234-SPEAKER'SRULING">BILL C-234-SPEAKER'S RULING</A></H4>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I am now ready to rule on the point of 
order raised by the chief government whip on November 4, 1996 
concerning the admissibility of the motion moved by the hon. 
member for Crowfoot with regard to Bill C-234, an act to amend 
the Criminal Code.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I thank the Chief Government Whip, the hon. member for St. 
Albert and the hon. member for Crowfoot for their views on this 
matter.
<P>
	The text of the motion is as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, no later than the conclusion of Routine Proceedings on the tenth sitting day 
after the adoption of this motion, Bill C-234, an act to amend the Criminal Code, 
shall be deemed reported back to the House without amendment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The chief government whip challenged the admissibility of the 
motion. There are two aspects to the argument that he presented. 
First, that the hon. member for Crowfoot did not have the right to 
move this motion on the rubric Motions in Routine Proceedings. 
Second, that the motion represented an attempt to interfere 
improperly with the committee's proceedings on the bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In support of the contention that the hon. member for Crowfoot 
should not move his motion during Routine Proceedings, the Chief 
Government Whip referred to the rulings of May 30, 1928, May 11, 
1944, May 2, 1961 and April 28, 1982. I want to assure the House 
that, in examining this matter, I have taken these precedents into 
account. The Chief Government Whip also referred to Speaker 
Fraser's ruling, at page 17506 of the <I>Debates</I> of July 13, 1998, in 
which he stated that Routine Proceedings are not the exclusive 
purview of the governement. As I noted in my ruling of September 
23, 1996, I am in agreement with the view of Speaker Fraser.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I would like now to turn to the second aspect of the chief 
government whip's presentation in which he claimed that the 
motion, particularly the words ``without amendment'', would 
constitute an improper interference with the proceedings of the 
committee and would violate the conditions set down in my ruling 
of September 23, 1996.
<P>
	As members may recall, in my ruling on page 4561 of the 
<I>Debates</I> I indicated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the Chair may well accept, after due notice, such a motion, on the condition that 
it is strictly limited to the terms of the committal of a bill to a committee and that it 
is not an attempt to interfere with the committee's proceedings thereon. In so 
doing, the House would have an opportunity to determine whether the bill should 
remain in committee or be reported back.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Chief Governement Whip argued that the motion was a clear 
attempt to interfere improperly with the committee's proceedings 
on the bill, that it would order the committee to complete its study, 
and that the committee could not amend the bill. I must disagree 
with the hon. members's interpretation of the terms of the motion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The motion as it stands on the Order Paper does not interfere 
with the committee's ability to complete its consideration of Bill 
C-235 and report it back with or without amendment. The motion 
does not require the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal 
Affairs to complete its study of Bill C-234 by a certain time.
<P>
	The motion moved by the hon. member for Crowfoot in fact 
provides the committee with a period of time in which to consider 
and report the bill if it so chooses. At the same time, the motion 
provides the House with a mechanism to remove the bill, which is 
its property, from the committee so that the House itself can take up 
consideration of the bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In fact, such a mechanism is not unusual to our practices. 
Standing Order 81(4), dealing with the referral of the main 
estimates to committee, states that the committee shall report, or 
shall be deemed to have reported back to the House not later than 
May 31.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6520"> 6520 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As the matter now stands, the committee has not reported the 
bill. Speaker Francis noted in a ruling at page 3963 in the <I>Debates</I> 
of May 23, 1984:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Chair can hardly be aware of what is taking place in the committee without a 
report from the committee.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is also noted in May's 21st edition at page 500:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The House is not formally aware of the detailed proceedings of any committee 
until the bill has been reported.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The House does not know what has occurred in committee and, 
consequently, cannot know what amendments the committee has 
made to the bill. Therefore, if the House wishes to, once again, take 
possession of the bill, then the inclusion of the words ``without 
amendment'' establishes clearly that the House will be dealing with 
the text of the bill it adopted at second reading.
<P>
	This can be the only logical course that the House can follow and 
it has been done in the past. I would refer hon. members to the 
motion adopted on March 22, 1995, pursuant to Standing Order 
78(2), with regard to Bill C-77, an act to provide for the 
maintenance of railway operations and subsidiary services. This 
motion, to be found at pages 1259-60 of the <I>Journals</I>, stated in 
part:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-if the Bill [was] not reported from the committee during Routine Proceedings on 
March 23, 1995, the Bill [would], at the conclusion of Routine Proceedings on that 
day, be deemed to have been reported from the committee without amendment.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Finally, I can find nothing in the terms of the motion which 
would prevent the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal 
Affairs from reporting Bill C-234 back to the House either before 
the adoption of the motion or before the sitting day specified in the 
motion, if it were adopted by the House. Should the committee 
report the bill before the 10th sitting day after the adoption of the 
motion, as currently worded, the House would deal with it in 
accordance with our usual practices. The objective of the motion 
moved by the hon. member for Crowfoot, that the bill be reported 
back to the House, would have been met.
<P>
	Therefore I find that the motion as it stands on the Order Paper is 
in order.
<P>
	In the discussion on this question it was mentioned that if the 
matter is not disposed of, it is transferred to Government Orders. It 
was suggested that the Chair intervene in this procedure. The 
wording of Standing Order 66, however, is quite clear, as is our 
practice. It is not the place of the Chair to interfere in this.

	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.)</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-351, an act to provide for the limitation of interest 
rates, of the application of interest and of fees in relation to credit 
card accounts.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, in presenting this bill today, I would 
like to pay homage to the member for Simcoe North who is the 
father of this bill and its author. He is presently a parliamentary 
secretary and therefore is prevented from pursuing the aim of this 
bill, which has a threefold purpose.
<P>
	First, it will limit the amount of interest that financial 
institutions and retailers can charge on outstanding credit card 
balances.
<P>
	Second, it sets out a method for calculating interest charges 
based on the Bank of Canada rate of the previous month.
<P>
	Third, it provides a mandatory grace period for partial payments 
on all types of credit cards.
<P>
	Today banks in Canada continue to set record profits. Interest 
rates are the lowest in 30 years with the prime rate at 4.75 per cent, 
yet Canadian consumers are paying exorbitant rates ranging up to 
20 per cent on some retail cards.
<P>
	On behalf of the public, the government has a responsibility to 
regulate when unfair actions damage the public's interest. In 
addressing interest rates on credit and charge cards, this bill asks 
the government to intervene on behalf of the public interest.

Bourassa, Montreal North and elsewhere.
<P>
	The petitioners are asking Parliament to start procedures to 
abolish the Senate. Their request is based on a number of 
arguments, including the fact that the Senate is made up of 
non-elected people who are accountable to no one, that its annual 
operating budget is $43 million, and that it refuses to account to 
House of Commons committees for this money.
<P>
	The petitioners point out that the Senate duplicates the work 
done by members of the House of Commons and, in this period of 
economic restraint, they wonder about the relevance of maintaining 
institutions that are as costly as they are useless.

the following questions will be answered today: Nos. 83, 84 and 85.
<P>
[<I>Text</I>] 
<P>
Question No. 83-<B>Ms. Meredith:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Can the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration indicate: (<I>a</I>) if special 
arrangements were made or contemplated at Taiwan, during the recent confrontation 
between the governments of China and Taiwan, to authorize the transportation of 
prospective immigrants and temporary entrants to Canada who had not been 
examined by authorized Canadian personnel and (<I>b</I>) if any such applicants were 
permitted to proceed to Canada without properly conducted oral examinations?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> (a) During the recent confrontation between the 
governments of China and Taiwan, no special arrangements were 
made or contemplated at Taiwan to authorize the transportation of 
immigrants and visitors to Canada who had not been examined by 
authorized Canadian immigration officials.
<P>
	(b) No such applicants were permitted to proceed to Canada 
without properly conducted examinations by Canadian 
immigration officials. However, following normal procedures, an 
oral interview of an applicant is only conducted by immigration 
officials if there is a need to clarify the admissibility of an applicant 
to Canada. If such a determination can be made using written 
documentation then an interview may not be required.
<P>
[<I>Text</I>] 
<P>
Question No. 84-<B>Ms. Meredith:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Can the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration indicate the relative importance 
of personal suitability in the selection process under the point rating system and for 
the screening of sponsored family members other than spouses and children?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> A maximum score of 10 units for Personal 
Suitability is possible under the current points system for 
assessment of independent immigration applicants. An 
independent applicant must score at least 70 points to pass the 
assessment. By comparison, the maximum scores available for the 
other selection criteria are:
<P>
	1.	Education 	16<BR>
 	2. 	Specific Vocational Preparation	18<BR>
 	3. 	Experience 	8<BR>
 	4. 	Occupational Demand 	10<BR>
 	5. 	Arranged Employment or Designated Occupation 	10<BR>
 	6. 	Demographic Factor 	8<BR>
 	7. 	Age 	10<BR>
 	8. 	Knowledge of English and French Languages 	15
<P>
	Since the point rating system is only applied to members of the 
Independent and Business Classes of immigrants, neither the 
Personal Suitability criterion nor any of the other criteria in the 
point rating system are applied to sponsored family members.
<P>

Question No. 85-<B>Ms. Meredith:</B>

classes, for the last five years ending March 31, 1996, of all applicants who have 
been granted entry visas without oral examinations?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Table 1 provides a statistical breakdown by 
category for persons granted immigrant visas and/or Minister's 
Permits to enter Canada without a selection interview. Figures 
cover only applicants processed for permanent residence at 
overseas missions. The figures are for the total number of persons, 
including spouses and dependent children.

	Table 2 gives the number of persons for whom the interview was 
waived as a percentage of total persons issued immigrant visas or

<P>
put by my hon. colleague from Kindersley-Lloydminster. It has 
been on the paper since February. Normally we would expect a

has been on the paper for a long time. Does the member have any 
idea when we might expect an answer?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> Madam Speaker, I am sorry I do not have a specific 
answer on when that question will be returned to the House. It is a 
very large question, a request that goes to all government 
departments. I have been informed that it is in the final stages of 
being revised. I hope we can have that information soon.
<P>
	I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.

	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Madam Speaker, on a point of order, the first two 
speakers from the Reform Party, the members for Port 
Moody-Coquitlam and Mission-Coquitlam, will be splitting 
their time.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Today being 
the final allotted day for the business of supply ending December 
10, 1996, the House will proceed as usual to the review and 
adoption of a supply bill.
<P>
	In light of recent practices, does the House agree to have the bill 
distributed now?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today and 
also to split my time with my colleague from Mission-Coquitlam. 
My colleague and I share some of the same community. Certainly 
that community like other communities across Canada is very 
much affected by the decisions of this House and the priorities it 
sets. The topic of today is how government priorities affect 
children and parents, indeed all people of this nation.
<P>
	Today, one day after national child day, we want to highlight the 
Reform Party's proposal make tax relief for Canadian families a 
priority in government policy.
<P>
	The proposal I will elaborate on today reflects a recognition of 
the importance of family units and the importance of choices for 
parents in public policy. The greatness of our country today is a 
reflection of the legacy of the greatness of the families which have 
built it, families both from abroad and those that are Canadian 
born. Today we must not forfeit the source of our success as a 
country.
<P>
	Existing government priorities seem only too eager to ignore the 
family unit. For instance, there is but a single reference to the word 
family in the Liberal red book. This certainly illustrates the reality 
of government neglect of this important institution. The years of 
sowing the seeds of neglect of the family in public policy are now 
yielding a whirlwind of social, economic and judicial 
consequences. Our homes, our streets and even the statistics on 
youth crime, youth suicide and teen pregnancy all give too great 
evidence that government priorities and policies must change in 
this area.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	What are the government's priorities and policies? What is the 
Liberal vision of government? Today I would like to remind the 
House that we have a government that is wedded to big spending, 
high taxes and big government. The Liberal government is addicted 
to expenditures exceeding $150 billion a year and it has shown no 
sign of changing that philosophy.
<P>
	The deficit reduction that has been accomplished has been 
accomplished on the backs on the Canadian taxpayers, the families 
of this country. The reduced deficit is due only to the increase in 
revenues.
<P>
	The Reform vision in contrast is a vision of smaller government, 
lower taxes and more choices for the Canadians who must pay 
those taxes. We would like to reduce government expenditures by 
$15 billion a year. We would like to balance the budget, not just 
talk about balancing the budget. That would give tax relief to our 
overtaxed Canadian families.
<P>
	A major plank of the Reform fresh start program will extend the 
following child care deduction to all parents, including those who 
care for their children at home: $5,000 for every preschool child 
and $3,000 for every child seven to 12 years of age. We will make 
this as fair as possible for families of all income levels. We will 
turn the deduction into a tax credit so that everyone will receive the 
same saving.
<P>
	The Liberal plan that now exists for the child care deduction is 
very unfair. It favours parents who choose to have paid child care 
over those who choose to take care of their own children. It also 
favours rich parents over poor because it is a tax deduction.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6525"> 6525 </A></B>
<P>
	How does it favour parents who choose to have paid child care? 
The Liberal plan for the child care deduction applies only to 
receiptable day care expenses. Therefore it denies the value and the 
choice to care for one's own children. It denies the flexibility of the 
family to choose to have another family member look after the 
children or to have some kind of co-operative arrangement within 
the neighbourhood.
<P>
	This morning in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> there was an article which 
described how many children are in step-families. The article 
stated that in 1994-95, 32.4 per cent of children under 12 years of 
age were in the care of someone other than the parent. In other 
words 67.6 per cent were cared for by a parent.
<P>
	These choices in child care are completely ignored by the 
Liberal plan for the child care deduction. The government through 
its plan rewards those who would use outside care. The government 
discriminates against 67 per cent of parents who want to take care 
of their own children in their own home.
<P>
	This government by its policies denies choice to parents. Also it 
denies the value of parenting.
<P>
	I mentioned that the tax deduction given by the Liberal 
government is more valuable for higher income earners. If we look 
at a quick example, a tax deduction of $5,000 to a person earning 
more than $100,000 could be worth approximately $2,500 at the 
end of the tax year. To a struggling Canadian who is making 
$20,000 a year, that tax deduction would only be worth 
approximately $1,500. It is a discriminatory practice which works 
against those who need it most.
<P>
	For all the puffery of the finance minister, perhaps he would like 
to admit that he fails to mention that his rich friends benefit the 
most by the present system of the child care tax deduction. That 
same minister is also proud of extending day care deductions to 
16-year olds from the 12-year old ceiling. These two things 
illustrate the misplaced priorities of government policy. Is it not 
those who need it most that should be given the greatest attention in 
government policy?
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	Earlier I mentioned that the government has no appreciation of 
the value of parenting. More and more I see that interest groups, 
from day care advocates to affirmative action zealots, all ignore 
parents in order to push their own agenda in government policy. 
With what this government does and its priority in budgeting, and I 
noticed something unique in the government's budgets in that it 
recently tripled the budget for the status of women while other 
budgets are being cut. What kind of priority does this show to 
families?
<P>
	The priorities of government in budgeting and in legislation are 
predicated on other things, not the priorities of the nation's 
families. For example, when the finance minister claimed that 
doubling the working income supplement helps families and also 
stated that our party did not support the bill, he failed to point out 
that this provision, that is, the doubling of the working income 
supplement, was but a small part of the amendments to the Divorce 
Act.
<P>
	Bill C-41, like so many bills brought by the government to this 
House, had some good elements in it. Tragically however the 
incidence of divorce, the bitterness of the disputes in a divorce and 
the resulting devastation on the children and families will only 
escalate given the mindset of the provisions of Bill C-41. It totally 
ignores essential elements or provisions that should have been put 
in place, such as mandatory mediation, unified family court and 
more basically, equal treatment of the parties involved in divorce 
so that enforcement of access and support are both looked at by 
government.
<P>
	Divorce hurts children. Single parenthood and broken families 
are the surest way to predicate financial needs. It is a cruel joke for 
the Liberals to increase the working income supplement and in the 
same legislation fuel the number of families that will need that 
supplement.
<P>
	When Reform challenges the Liberal government for its lack of 
concern for Canadian families, the only answer is a list of programs 
through which increased funding will be given to targeted groups. 
The federal government has in place over 25 programs which 
specifically target at least a portion of its spending to children, over 
25 programs costing billions of taxpayer dollars.
<P>
	Many of these programs have existed for years, yet the 
government over the last decade has never undertaken a thorough 
evaluation of them to determine if they are accomplishing the 
intended outcome. Using the government's own figures, child 
poverty has risen from 15 to 20 per cent since 1989 despite all of 
the government spending that took place on behalf of children. 
Where is the evidence that more spending is going to reduce these 
figures?
<P>
	This government is clearly not interested in evidence. It would 
rather listen to the people who tickle the ears of the Liberals with 
cries for help. They like to listen to people who see government as 
their source of funds.
<P>
	Reform makes families a priority. The well-being of our nation's 
children cannot be separated from the well-being of our nation's 
families. A happy child is not the sum of government programs, but 
it is found in the strength of personal relationships that surround 
that child. Reform's fresh start seeks to strengthen families with the 
basic philosophy that a dollar left in the hands of the taxpayer is 
better than a dollar in the hands of any bureaucrat.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, first I want to congratulate the member for Port 
Moody-Coquitlam for her presentation this morning in the 
House. I listened very carefully to her comments. I have a couple of 
questions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6526"> 6526 </A></B>
<P>
	She mentioned that government of big spending leads to high 
taxes and big government. I think everyone in this House and all 
Canadians by this time are well aware that this government has 
taken those actions which were demanded by Canadians to reduce 
the size of government, to reduce the size of expenditures, to 
reduce spending, and to do it in a balanced fashion so that we could 
look forward to balancing our budget.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	As everyone in this House and most Canadians know, the hon. 
Minister of Finance took those actions by setting targets which to 
date have been either met or exceeded. Economists not only here in 
Canada but throughout the world are suggesting that Canada leads 
the world, or at least the industrialized countries of the world, in its 
actions and meeting its commitments to date. Therefore I wonder 
why the hon. member would state that.
<P>
	All members of this House are well aware that we are not talking 
about bigger government. This government made a commitment, 
not one that it particularly wanted to do, but one that was necessary 
because Canadians said that they wanted to see a smaller 
government. The government committed to a reduction of 45,000 
positions in the federal government over a three or four year period 
which affected every department.
<P>
	We also know that one of the first steps taken after this 
government took office was to reduce the size of ministers' staffs. 
Previously junior portfolios had 50 to 60 staff persons and senior 
portfolios 100 to 120 staff persons. They are now down to 10 to 15 
staff members. That is responsibility.
<P>
	With respect to deficit reduction we have met or exceeded those 
targets to date. I might add that we are on target for the future for 
this year and certainly will be for subsequent years. The result has 
been interest rate reductions to levels that have not been seen for 
the past 30 or 40 years. This has put money in the pockets of 
Canadian families.
<P>
	The hon. member spoke of Liberalism and the Liberal 
government not being for the family. I have been involved for a 
number of years with the Liberals and I can say that the family is 
always first and foremost for all Liberals I have met. They are a 
family and they also have the greatest respect for the family. I have 
not seen a group of men and women across this country who work 
more for the family, for family units.
<P>
	I would point out to the hon. member for Port 
Moody-Coquitlam that this government has taken action. 
Obviously in the weeks and months to come further actions will be 
introduced in this House that will continue to promote the family.
<P>
	The hon. member referred to children. There is no question that 
children have to be first and foremost on all of our minds.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The hon. 
member for Port Moody-Coquitlam, you have 45 seconds.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> Madam Speaker, that is short work for some 
interesting points.
<P>
	I remind my friend of the red book. If the Liberals are so 
concerned with family, why is it just mentioned once?
<P>
	With respect to government targets and the ability of government 
to meet them, it still has no specific goal for deficit elimination. In 
terms of that we can talk about money spent here but what about 
the record personal bankruptcies that Canadian families are 
addressing across this country? We have a 10 per cent 
unemployment rate.
<P>
	Whatever the government is doing certainly it does not seem to 
be getting to the people who need it the most. I remind my 
colleague that because the government has not addressed its deficit 
position, real income in the last three years has decreased for the 
average family by $3,000.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is my privilege today to speak on Reform's supply day 
motion which reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should provide tax fairness for 
all Canadian families by extending the child care tax deduction to all families of all 
income levels and converting it to a credit, thereby removing the tax bias against 
parents caring for their own children.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Canadians have told us that they want a tax system that is fair to 
all families. Let us take a look at the taxes paid by families today. 
The average family pays an incredible 46 per cent of its income 
each year in taxes, almost half of its income.
<P>
	High taxes have stripped families of the disposable income they 
need to plan for their future and exercise choice in how to arrange 
their lives. A Reform government will provide real tax relief for all 
Canadians and simplify the tax system to make it fairer for families 
at all income levels.
<P>
	Children are this country's key to the future, but more often than 
not the policies and programs of the federal government have a 
negative impact on Canadian families. We must give parents 
greater freedom to spend time parenting and to succeed 
economically while doing so.
<P>
	That is why Reform will extend the following child care 
deduction to all parents, including those who care for their children 
at home: $5,000 for every preschool child and $3,000 for every 
child seven to twelve years of age. To make this as fair as possible 
for families at all income levels we will turn the deduction into a 
tax credit so everyone gets the same savings.
<P>
	These changes are necessary since fiscal burdens and 
government intervention both mean that Canadian parents have 
fewer choices about how to raise and care for their children. Big 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6527"> 6527 </A></B>
<P>
government programs such as universal day care, which the 
Liberals promised in the 1993 election campaign, only add to the 
burden of government debt and high taxes and contribute to 
removing choices away from Canadian families.
<P>
	The Reform Party believes that parents are the people best 
equipped to make these decisions and wants to leave them as much 
choice and decision making power as possible. Reform believes 
that returning money into the hands of families will provide them 
with the choice and the flexibility they need to make the best 
decisions for their children.
<P>
	Reform therefore opposes state run day care, supporting in its 
place child care programs that subsidize financial need, not the 
method of child care chosen, and that subsidize children and 
parents, not institutions and professionals.
<P>
	These initiatives are important because more parents are 
choosing to stay at home to look after their young children.
<P>
	According to Sherry Cooper, the chief economist for the 
Canadian investment firm Nesbit Burns, birth rates are rising in 
Canada and traditional families, father working and mother at 
home with the children, are growing from a record low of 28 per 
cent of all households in the 1980s toward the level of 44 per cent 
by the year 2005. Demographic trends, she says, point to the 
resurgence of traditional family life. Canadian parents who want to 
stay home to raise their children find that government policy 
penalizes them for their decision. Consequently many spouses are 
forced to work outside the home even if they do not want to.
<P>
	Given today's unemployment rate of 10 per cent surely the 
government would have enough sense to realize more jobs will be 
available for the unemployed if working parents can stay home and 
raise their children rather than go out to work and take up the jobs 
that are in the marketplace.
<P>
	Consequently Reform supports a revision of the federal income 
tax regulations to end discrimination against parents who provide 
for child care at home.
<P>
	How does Reform view Canadian parents? We are convinced 
that the majority of Canadian parents are caring, are capable and 
are responsible. They know what is best for their own children. 
What is more, they demonstrate it every day through the large and 
the small sacrifices they make, that the well-being of their children 
is their top priority.
<P>
	In the case of divorced parents we want to see fair and equal 
treatment for all parties involved in a support ruling. It is vital in 
any child access or custody settlement that the needs of the child 
and the parents' ability to pay are the first consideration. This 
government constantly puts forth flowery phrases of how 
supportive it is of  family. Yet its actions makes lies of its words. 
Children need the loving care and visits from all family members.
<P>
<B>(1050 )</B>
<P>
	Yet this government, in contradiction to Canada's acceptance of 
the convention of the child and of a child's right of access to their 
families, voted down the grandparents bill which would have given 
grandparents the right to ask the judge at the time of divorce if they 
could continue to see their grandchildren.
<P>
	How could this government do this, knowing that many of our 
seniors have already died without seeing their grandchildren in 
their later years? How could it be so cruel as to continue to deny 
families the right of access?
<P>
	This government cares about families, we heard the Liberal 
member say a few minutes ago. Oh, yes.
<P>
	What about this government's promise to remove the GST on 
reading material and thereby enable families to have reading 
material in their homes without paying GST on those essential? 
Remember, the Deputy Prime Minister promised that there would 
be no GST on books which were as necessary as food.
<P>
	The member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell said it would be 
undemocratic to put GST on books. Yet Atlantic Canadians are now 
paying 15 per cent on books at retail book stores in the Atlantic 
provinces. That is not helping families.
<P>
	Who are the victims in the terrible crimes across this country? 
Good law-abiding families have been made to suffer while the 
rights of criminals have been upper most in Liberals' minds since 
1971 when the Liberals at the time decided that the rehabilitation of 
criminals was more important than the victims of crime and the 
families of victims.
<P>
	What did the government do when Mr. Niven, a good family 
man, was kicked to death outside a 7-Eleven store just outside my 
riding? This government passed Bill C-41 which dealt with 
sentencing. It stressed that the murder of a gay deserved a stiffer 
sentence than the murder of a family man like Mr. Niven.
<P>
	The new Bill C-41 deals with punitive measures for support 
payments in arrears. Once again this government did not help 
families. This government was concerned only with punishment. It 
could have dealt with a comprehensive package which would have 
included access and visitation rights.
<P>
	In the American legislation under the Florida statutes its package 
was comprehensive. It did deal with all those issues. This 
government did not even care about families. What is worse, this 
government took the drawing up of guidelines out of the hands of 
parliamentarians. It ended up with inflexible and unrealistic 
guidelines.
<P>
	Elected members of Parliament could have ensured that families 
were encouraged to make realistic  settlements, settlements which 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6528"> 6528 </A></B>
<P>
dealt with the needs of the child and the ability to pay and add that 
these agreements be considered first by the judge rather than going 
first to the inflexible guidelines, which is what that bill instructs the 
judge to do at this time. That is a recipe for failure.
<P>
	In the guidelines there are a number of omissions and additions 
that would result in many unfair awards. For example, the lack of 
an adjustment of awards for the time the child spends with a 
non-custodial parent. However, that is not in there. There is also the 
completely different and extreme treatment of joint custody 
situations, which is getting very common in our country today.
<P>
	Mr. Bouchard, co-ordinator of the National Alliance for the 
Advancement of Non-Custodial Parents, stated: ``Fair and 
equitable guidelines would go a long way to bring some 
consistency to support awards''. Support awards must be paid and 
it is essential that parliamentarians be responsible and set 
guidelines which will help prevent future arrears in these necessary 
support payments.
<P>
	In fact, the Equitable Child Maintenance and Access Society 
stated that the federal, provincial and territorial task force was 
supposed to deal jointly with the issues of custody, access and 
maintenance. This government ignored two-thirds of this mandate 
and gave the area of child support preferential and exclusive 
treatment.
<P>
	Studies in the area of divorce show that children suffer more 
from the custody and access conflicts and therefore priority must 
be given to these areas in conjunction with financial support.
<P>
	The result is that Bill C-41 is designed to specifically exclude the 
paying spouse from the definition of family. The finance minister 
brags about all the wonderful things this government is doing for 
families.
<P>
	What about the new tax treatment of child support payments? No 
deductions and no inclusions. Who benefits from this set up? It is 
not the families, Mr. Finance Minister. It is a major tax grab at the 
expense of families. The spouse paying support, usually the higher 
earner in family settlements, will now not be able to claim 
deductions and consequently will pay higher income tax to the 
government, causing him to have less money to look after his new 
family and his first family.
<P>
	In short, by eliminating the deduction inclusion system there is 
less money to go around for divorced families and both sides suffer 
while government revenues obviously rise.
<P>
	It is essential that we as parliamentarians put families first. In 
this way we do not only help to build character and self-respect in 
our children, we also help our literacy rate to rise and help prevent 
crime.
<P>
<B>(1055 )</B>
<P>
	By including those parents who are able to stay at home and raise 
their children without state run day care and by giving them child 
care deductions which can be turned into tax credits, we are also 
helping those who are unemployed in our society. After all the 
fanfare this government made about supporting families, it seems it 
is up to the Reform Party to raise a motion in the House to reinforce 
support for families.
<P>
	It is time to make a fresh start for families. Therefore I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting the word ``should''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I was truly touched by the 
attempt by the hon. member opposite to put a human face on the 
gibberish we normally hear from the Reform Party.
<P>
	I was also struck by the fact that she seemed to be talking about a 
different kind of world than most Canadians inhabit.
<P>
	I wonder if she would share with us her understanding of the 
composition of the Canadian family out there today. I hear it 
described as if all families are comprised of an Ozzie and Harriet 
vision. That is what I heard portrayed across the way.
<P>
	Also I would like her to comment on the extent to which 
Reform's recent budget proposals would adversely impact on 
families in this country, no matter how they may defined, whether 
in the Ozzie and Harriet world she lives in or in the world in which 
real Canadians live. The dramatic changes and the increased cuts 
across the board that would be made as a result of that document 
would gut this country.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jennings:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question.
<P>
	I really wish that members of this House, particularly Liberals, 
would stop the insulting remarks. I find it degrading for 
parliamentarians. Having been a teacher for 30 years, I abhor this 
kind of speech in the House of Commons. I do not wish to hear it 
again.
<P>
	I am very glad that this member was truly touched by what I had 
to say.
<P>
	With respect to the different kind of world, I suggest that the 
member should take a moment to think. The Reform members, 
apart from one, have all been from the private sector, from the 
public sector, but not members of Parliament. Because we have not 
been members of Parliament in the past we have been in touch with 
real Canadians. We have worked with real Canadians. We have 
been teachers. We have been doctors. We have worked in the 
resource industries. We have been there. As citizens of Canada we 
have been more than aware of the issues that are out there.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6529"> 6529 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned some gibberish about Ozzie and 
Harriet. I agree that would be a wonderful situation. I am sure the 
member agrees that it would be wonderful. Unfortunately, with the 
high rate of divorce and the difficult unemployment levels which 
the government has helped to create by not lowering taxes, that 
situation no longer exists. Reform is the first to acknowledge that. 
That is why Reform would introduce child care tax deductions in 
the amount of $5,000 for each preschool child and $3,000 for each 
child between the ages of 7 and 12.
<P>
	I wonder if the member knows that over 80 per cent of Canadian 
families are comprised of a husband, a wife and children.
<P>
	I believe that those who are not connected with reality are the 
Liberals. Surely common sense dictates that if the Liberals would 
lower taxes, and not have 46 per cent of the income of Canadians 
going to the tax structure, and leave more in their pockets so they 
could employ more people in their businesses it would encourage a 
more positive outlook. Perhaps the Liberals should look at the fact 
that retail sales are down. They were up at the beginning of 1995 by 
about 7 per cent. They have gone down all the way through 1995 
and 1996. People are cautious and worried, they are not spending.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	By my last accounting bankruptcies are over 52,000, up 23 per 
cent. This suggests a government that is unaware of what going on 
out there. I think the member who asked me to answer a question 
spoke a lot of nonsense.
<P>
	I recently read an article in the September <I>Reader's Digest</I> and 
even Mr. McKenna, a Liberal premier, said that duplication in 
provincial and federal programs is costing us $5 billion a year.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, when I first heard 
the supply day motion, I was briefly tempted to congratulate the 
hon. member and the Reform Party for raising issues that were 
genuinely worthy of consideration.
<P>
	Improving tax fairness is something the government believes in 
strongly. That is why it has taken concrete action in each of its three 
budgets to close loopholes and eliminate inequities.
<P>
	Then there is the action that would benefit children in need. Who 
would dare deny the special responsibility the government holds to 
use available resources actively and aggressively to protect and 
sustain the most innocent and vulnerable of all our citizens. Here 
again we have as a government taken concrete action, especially in 
the 1996 budget.
<P>
	These are the issues the motion may appear to address. 
Unfortunately it takes only a moment's reflection to see through 
the illusion, to recognize that there is actually little or nothing 
about equity and nothing about compassion here at all. What is at 
work, masquerading in the guise of fairness and family, is an 
attempt to buy electoral support. Because underneath the rhetoric 
the motion proposes nothing less than a $5 billion tax cut. The 
hidden agenda behind the motion goes beyond deception into the 
realm of duplicity.
<P>
	Not only are we being asked to endorse a dramatic tax cut in a 
year when the deficit is targeted at about $24 billion, it is a tax cut 
that will create unfairness in two ways. First, if the motion became 
law it would actually create inequity in the tax treatment of child 
care deductions. What is more damning is the fact that the real 
beneficiaries of this motion would be the affluent and the wealthy 
and their children at the expense of poor Canadians and their 
families.
<P>
	This not so hidden agenda will come as no surprise to anyone 
who has studied the philosophy and the rhetoric of the Reform 
Party. Theirs is the gospel of comforting the comfortable and 
abusing the afflicted. Perhaps that sounds a little intemperate, but 
the false logic and perverse pandering of today's motion deserves 
no respect.
<P>
	Let me prove my point by addressing the first aspect of this 
motion, the mistaken idea that fairness as enunciated by the 
Reform Party requires ``extending the child care expense deduction 
to all families of all income levels''. This is in keeping with the 
Reform's continuing allegation that the Income Tax Act 
discriminates against families that provide care at home for their 
children. They ask why working Canadians should be able to claim 
a deduction for their expenses when stay at home caregivers cannot 
claim the expense they incur.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Do you think they do not work?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> This is not just a case of apples and oranges logic. 
This is apples and sour grapes logic. It is attempting to make night 
equal day. In reality, the rationale for the child care expense 
deduction is to prevent discrimination and unfairness. It does this 
by recognizing for tax purposes the child care expenses that 
taxpayers must incur in order to earn income or to study.
<P>
<B>(1105)</B>
<P>
	In other words, the deduction is a way for the tax system to 
acknowledge that when both spouses work, these taxpayers 
generally have less of a capacity to pay taxes than other taxpaying 
families with identical incomes that do not have these child care 
expenses. That may sound a little bureaucratic but it is not.
<P>
	Of course families with a stay at home spouse has child care 
expenses. That is why in addition to the regular child tax benefit of 
$1,020 for each child, the tax system also provides a supplement to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6530"> 6530 </A></B>
<P>
help modest income parents who choose to remain in the home to 
raise preschool aged children.
<P>
	The fact is when both spouses work they will have higher child 
care expenses than families where one spouse stays at home. Those 
additional expenses will include day care, work transportation for 
two people and other costs incurred in earning income.
<P>
	This takes me back to the bottom line. Despite Reform's 
implication, the child care expense deduction is not anti-family 
social engineering. It has nothing to do with providing a benefit or 
acting as an incentive for people to participate in the workforce. 
Instead the child care expense deduction seeks to ensure that 
families where both partners must work or study do not suffer a 
disadvantage by being taxed on gross income when child care costs 
mean that they have reduced capacity to pay.
<P>
	Incidentally, I should point out that the child care expense 
deduction parallels the approach applied to business. Firms do not 
pay taxes on expenses they incur to generate income but only on 
their profits. By the same logic, the child care expense deduction 
does not tax-up to a certain limit-the expenses incurred when 
both parents must work to generate income.
<P>
	I have established that this motion clearly fails to recognize the 
real purpose and process of the child care expense deduction. That 
purpose is to deliver neutrality, in effect, real fairness, within the 
tax system.
<P>
	I will address the more fatal flaws of today's proposal: fiscal 
irresponsibility and rewarding affluent Canadians at the expense of 
those in real need. The motion seeks to extend the child care 
expense deduction to all families of all income levels and convert it 
to a credit.
<P>
	This raises an obvious question which the hon. member has not 
answered. What is the cost? Assuming we use the current structure 
of the deduction, which is $5,000 for children under seven years of 
age and $3,000 for children between seven and fourteen, the cost in 
lost revenue will probably be in the vicinity of $5 billion. That 
compares to about $400 million under the existing deduction 
system.
<P>
	That $5 billion can only come from one of three places: adding 
$5 billion to the yearly deficit, not just this year, not just next year, 
but year after year after year; or raising other taxes by the same $5 
billion; or cutting federal spending by a further $5 billion, which 
would be on top of the most dramatic government spending cuts in 
Canada's post-war history. Inevitably that would require new cuts 
to transfers to provinces for social assistance and health care.
<P>
	Who would be the real beneficiaries? There would be some 
benefits to families with stay at home parents, a group which is less 
than 25 per cent of Canadian families. This benefit would have 
little to do with real need and the problem of child poverty which 
should be the priority issue in family policy.
<P>
	Let us look at Reform's priority. The simple fact is that under 
this motion every professional and executive, people who earn 
$75,000, $100,000 or $1 million a year, those who can best afford a 
stay at home spouse probably with housekeeping help and a nanny 
to boot, would enjoy a nice fat tax break. But this motion adds 
nothing for the low income family where both partners must work 
or choose to work.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Have you ever heard of a tax credit?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> There is another damning downside. There is a real 
risk that for the less affluent families with a stay at home spouse, 
any improvement provided by the revised deduction could easily 
disappear. The reason is simple.
<P>
<B>(1110 )</B>
<P>
	As I have pointed out, the $5 billion cost of the so-called Reform 
child care expense deduction has to come from somewhere, from 
higher taxes, from reduced spending on social programs or a deficit 
that puts new pressure on interest rates. Obviously raising taxes to 
pay for an effective tax cut is just going in circles so that cannot be 
the Reform's agenda, although going in circles seems to be what 
they do best.
<P>
	Cutting social programs is part of the Reform agenda and their 
fresh start manifesto makes it clear. It is the needy and the less 
affluent who will feel the impact when welfare transfers, 
equalization and employment insurance are cut. All are contained 
in their fresh start. It should be called a phoney start. The needy and 
the less affluent will ultimately pay for Reform's child care break 
for the affluent executive.
<P>
	Or we could let the deficit jump, although that hardly fits the 
Reform Party credo. If we did, it is the needy who suffer again 
under the pressure of higher interest rates, higher mortgage costs 
and a reduction in the business investment that fuels jobs and 
incomes.
<P>
	As a parent and grandparent I share the heartfelt concern of 
every member here that there are children in Canada who suffer 
real hardship, whose future prospects are dimmed by the burden of 
poverty and neglect. As a taxpayer I understand the driving desire 
for fairness in the tax system and that we continue to eliminate 
inequities and absurdities.
<P>
	As someone with a background in economics and as a legislator 
who understands the importance of the continued battle to reduce 
the deficit, I cannot support the Reform's motion today. These 
proposals are not based on need. Instead they will shift vital 
resources away from those who we as legislators are most obliged 
to help, and in order to do what? To reward families who already 
enjoy a superior standard of living. This would mean a meaner and 
a more inequitable Canada.
<P>
	In conclusion, the child care expense deduction should be 
maintained in its current form because it plays an  important role in 
recognizing the particular circumstances of working parents. When 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6531"> 6531 </A></B>
<P>
both parents work outside the home, additional child care expenses 
are a necessary cost of earning income that is subject to tax. 
Because of these child care expenses, families with two working 
parents have a reduced ability to pay that tax compared to a single 
earner family with the same gross income. That is why the 
deduction supports a tax neutrality that makes for a fairer tax 
system.
<P>
	The choice is clear. We can support this motion if our goal is a 
meaner Canada with a more inequitable tax system, or we can 
reject this proposal and by doing so show that we stand for a 
country marked by compassion and fairness.
<P>
	I urge hon. members to vote no because that is what good 
conscience and good government demand.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member 
stresses that he has a background in economics. I think it must have 
been a way back because I have never in my life heard such an 
Alice in Wonderland dissertation or so many distortions in one 
short speech in this House. It is incredible.
<P>
	The Liberal and Tory governments have condemned Canadian 
families to economic serfdom and now a catch-22. The government 
says: ``We are going to make it easier for you to pay your taxes. We 
will make it easier for both to go out and work''. What great hearts 
the Liberals have.
<P>
	Study after study show that taxes and taxes alone are the largest 
single expense faced by working parents. Did the hon. member 
ever consider, or is he capable of considering, the bitter fact faced 
by real Canadians, not the strata of society he comes from but real 
Canadians, that there might be couples out there who would not 
both work, who would like to have somebody stay at home, if it 
was economically possible for them to do so. Did he ever consider 
that one of the reasons so many couples in the lower income levels 
both have to work is that they are paying 46 per cent of their 
income in taxes to the three levels of government that there is 
nothing left for them?
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Madam Speaker, I am delighted to hear the member 
for Swift Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia. I have lived in Swift 
Current, by the way. I know the real people in Canada. I know the 
real people in Swift Current.
<P>
	Our child care expense deductions treat real people fairly and 
equitably, not like the Alice in Wonderland proposals the Reform 
Party puts forth. If the Reform Party formed a government it would 
be like a Mad Hatter's tea party.
<P>
	Talk about knowledge of economics. I am appalled at 
Reformers' suggestions on economics. I am appalled that they 
cannot even mention a $5 billion cost here. They talk about a $5 
billion cost and they do not even say where they are going to get the 
$5 billion from.
<P>
	Higher taxes, is that what the Reform Party stands for? 
Goodness, Reformers are always complaining about tax levels the 
way they are now, yet they are going to give $5 billion more. Are 
they going to cut social programs? Yes, they are going to cut social 
programs. Yes, they are going to cut unemployment insurance. Yes, 
they are going to do the poor in. Yes, that is it: the Reform Party for 
the wealthy; the poor can go to the blazes. That seems to be the 
Reform Party's sense of economics.
<P>
	That is not the sense which this party has. That is not the Liberal 
government's plan. That is not what this government will be doing. 
We do not have the sense that the senior executives get the tax 
breaks and the poor get nothing which is exactly what today's 
motion proposes. It is not a plan that shows the meanness and the 
inequities of the system; it is meanness and inequities that the 
Reform Party stands for. It is not fairness, it is not equitable 
treatment. It is simply meanness and inequity. That is the Reform 
Party's policy and it should have meanness and inequity written on 
its banner.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to hear from the secretary of state exactly 
how we differ from previous administrations. Exactly how many 
increases are there on the record for this House that this 
administration has brought forth in personal income taxes since 
this government took power?
<P>
	Could he explain exactly what the advantages have been of 
bringing our deficit under control, meeting our targets and bringing 
down interest rates to the lowest levels in the past 30 or 40 years? 
What has this meant to Canadian families regardless of the 
make-up of Canadian families, and how has that put money in their 
pockets?
<P>
	Finally, the question was put forth about when we would have a 
balanced budget. It would seem to me with the hon. Minister of 
Finance's projections of reaching a deficit reduction of $9 billion 
by 1998, that the step subsequent to that would be a balanced 
budget in this country for the first time in decades.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member has some very 
important and interesting questions.
<P>
	The first one I am not able to answer. He asked me how many tax 
increases have we had in personal income taxes. I am not able to 
answer that question because there have not been any. There have 
been none, so I cannot give him an example. I cannot give him even 
one example over the past three years.
<P>
	The hon. member asked me about deficit reduction and lower 
interest rates which have been brought about. When this 
government came into power we were faced  with a $44 billion 
deficit, a deficit that was absolutely shocking in size. We thought it 
was 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6532"> 6532 </A></B>
<P>
going to be $34 billion. The promise in our red book was to bring 
that deficit down to $25 billion or 3 per cent of GDP. However, 
bringing it down from $44 billion to $25 billion is a lot different 
problem from bringing it down from $55 billion to $34 billion. We 
faced up to that problem. We said we were going to do that and we 
did it.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	Our program has not been a single purpose one. It has not been 
about setting a target. The previous government set many targets 
every year and did not meet any of them. Our program has not just 
been to set targets but to meet targets. I would suggest that the 
Reform Party has never met a target in its existence. We have not 
only set targets, we have met those targets.
<P>
	The result has been a massive increase in the credibility of the 
Canadian government. We are now the darlings of the international 
financial community. We were much less than that three years ago. 
We have lowered interest rates in this country so that the bank's 
prime rate is 3.5 percentage points below the U.S. prime rate. I 
cannot remember in all my years, and that goes back a long time, 
since we have had interest rates as low as they are now.
<P>
	I can tell the hon. members across the way who seem to keep 
chattering away while I am talking that lower interest rates are a 
real boon for Canadians. Lower interest rates lead to lower 
mortgage costs and lower credit costs for Canadians. This makes 
jobs. It enables industries to bring new plants into being which 
creates jobs for Canadians. The results are clear and they will be 
coming as we progress in this economic recovery with our low 
interest rates. We are already seeing those results in the increase in 
the number of jobs this country is producing now and it will be seen 
even more so in the future.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I must admit that what I am hearing today boggles my 
mind. I listened to the hon. member and most of what he said goes 
completely against the facts and figures I have here.
<P>
	I certainly have some questions to ask him. Before I do, I want to 
make a quick comment. He mentioned the expensive tax cuts and 
went on about the low interest rates which we now have. Yes, we do 
have low interest rates, but we also have a 10 per cent 
unemployment rate. That is a scourge on the Canadian population. 
If low interest rates create jobs, what happened?
<P>
	I would also like to put to him that rather than low interest rates 
we also need an economy that has a future, that has hope and has 
jobs. Tax cuts are what we need in this country more than anything 
else. We need tax relief for overtaxed families, overtaxed and 
over-regulated  businesses. That is where there is a blind spot 
within that party.
<P>
	When the member talks about reverse pandering and who gets 
the benefits as to what the programs are, can he tell me, yes or no, 
does the child care tax deduction give more benefits to a higher 
income earner or a lower one? In the present system put forward by 
this government, someone making $100,000 and someone making 
$20,000, who would get the larger benefit from the present child 
care deduction?
<P>
	The member also made the point that dual parent families have 
less ability to pay their taxes and therefore need added benefits. 
Can he tell me which kind of family would pay the higher taxes: 
one with an income of $60,000 from two wage earners, or one with 
an income of $60,000 from one wage earner? I would like to put to 
him that it is the dual earner family that has the benefit in our 
present tax system.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The question 
and comment period has expired. I will allow 30 seconds for the 
hon. secretary of state to answer.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peters:</B> Madam Speaker, first I would like to tell the hon. 
member that these are not benefits. The child care expense 
deduction is not a benefit. It is an expense deduction. If the 
expenses are not incurred, then the deduction is not allowed. So it 
is not a benefit and the whole argument has been stood on its head.
<P>
	Second, we have a 10 per cent unemployment rate and yes it is 
far too high. Yes, interest rates are low. What would the Reform 
Party do about this? It would raise interest rates and ask whether 
that would increase employment. That would increase 
unemployment. As usual, the Reform Party's policies are mistaken.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, before 
commenting on the Reform Party's motion, I think it would be 
helpful to viewers to repeat the text of the motion, which reads as 
follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House-and there was an amendment-the 
government should provide tax fairness for all Canadian families by extending the 
Child Care Tax deduction to all families of all income levels and converting it to a 
credit, thereby removing the tax bias against parents caring for their own children.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	My first comment takes the form of a question. In the motion, we 
are not told whether this deduction will be converted to a 
refundable or a non-refundable credit. The motion does not say. 
However, if our information is correct, the Reform Party would like 
this deduction converted to a non-refundable credit, which means 
that a person paying tax could benefit from a deduction, whereas a 
person not earning enough to pay taxes would be deprived of this 
assistance for child care.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6533"> 6533 </A></B>
<P>
	In other words, this could mean that a person or a couple earning 
$100,000 a year could be allowed a deduction for child care, but a 
couple earning $20,000 a year and paying no, or practically no, 
taxes, would not be eligible for a refundable credit.
<P>
	The question then arises as to who is being helped. Is it those 
most in need of child care assistance, or those least in need of it? 
That is the first question.
<P>
	However, if we consider the spirit of the Reform Party's motion, 
our conclusion must be that there is indeed a real problem, but we 
could still agree with it. There are people who need help, and we 
want to help them. The reference is to a policy, a policy on the 
family or an anti-poverty policy. Reform members tell us that this 
motion is part of their family policy.
<P>
	At this point, perhaps we should consider the concept of family 
as seen by the Reform Party. As far as Reform members are 
concerned, a family is a group of individuals who are related and 
whose union is recognized by the state. We are therefore talking 
about a group of individuals related by blood, marriage or 
adoption. Clearly, Reform members, who are ultra-conservative, 
are dreaming of a concept that hardly applies today.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	Some families today are single-parent families, but families 
nevertheless. With a concept as obsolete as the one held by Reform 
members, obviously their solutions to family problems will differ 
vastly from what we might expect of people with a more modern 
outlook.
<P>
	Although we agree that Reform members are addressing a very 
real problem this morning, we do not quite agree with the way they 
intend to deal with that problem.
<P>
	First of all, the Bloc Quebecois feels that providing assistance to 
families should be strictly a matter of provincial jurisdiction. What 
has the federal government done about all the promises it made 
during the last election campaign that it would help our families? 
The Liberal government promised to spend about $700 million to 
create 150,000 new daycare places. What did the Liberal 
government do about the promise it made in the red book? What 
did the Liberal government try to achieve? A fraction of that 
promise. The Liberal government claimed that because no 
agreement was reached between the federal government and the 
provinces, that was ample justification for the government to 
withdraw its commitment.
<P>
	The Liberal government could at least have taken the money it 
had promised to spend and transferred it to the provinces, which 
would then have been able to implement the daycare plan or create 
spaces for children according to a plan of their own choosing and 
adapted to their own needs. The bulk of the responsibility for the  
lack of a family policy lies with the federal government, led by the 
Liberal Party.
<P>
	It is also perhaps worthwhile at this point to indicate that, 
wishing to make this a provincial responsibility, Quebec and other 
provinces have recently been looking at family issues. In the wake 
of an economic summit at which this was much discussed, the 
Government of Quebec has taken certain steps. It is, I think, worth 
mentioning that Quebec's policy puts its children first.
<P>
	If the federal government acknowledges that this is a provincial 
responsibility, it might be worthwhile to look at a picture of the 
Quebec family of today. Although the family plays as fundamental 
a role in our society as it did in the past, the changes that have 
occurred in Quebec society must be taken into consideration, and 
this is what was proposed at the summit.
<P>
	These changes indicate just how necessary a new family policy 
is. I am defining the present family situation in Quebec because our 
commitment at the time of the election was to work in the interest 
of all Canadians, particularly Quebecers.
<P>
	At this time, there are 1.66 million children in Quebec, one third 
of them under the age of six. They belong to 960,000 families, 20 
per cent of which are headed by single-parents.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	Twenty-three per cent of our families have an income of less 
than $25,000, while the average family income is $50,000. In 70 
per cent of two-parent families with young children, both spouses 
work, while 20 years ago the figure was 30 per cent, so that the 
family profile has changed significantly. Furthermore, a steadily 
increasing number of people are self-employed or work at 
non-typical jobs, that is to say, jobs that are unstable, involve 
irregular working hours or are strictly casual employment.
<P>
	These changes oblige us to rethink our policies and adapt them to 
the new needs of our society, to make them fair, consistent and 
sensible. That is why Quebec's family policy will be revised and 
restructured around three central themes, and we hope the federal 
government will recognize the relevance of these changes.
<P>
	The policy's first theme is how we provide services for young 
children and includes the following: first, plans for making 
full-time kindergarten available to all five-year-olds will be 
implemented as of September 1997; second, accelerated phasing-in 
of part-time educational services and free daycare for 
four-year-olds from disadvantaged families; and the phasing-in 
over a six-year period of low cost daycare for all young children 
whose parents are either employed or going to school.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6534"> 6534 </A></B>
<P>
	Phase one of daycare for four-year-olds will be implemented as 
of September 1997, while phase 5 for children under the age of one 
will start in 2001.
<P>
	The second central theme of this program will be to improve 
financial support to families as follows: a comprehensive 
allowance covering the essential needs of all dependent children of 
low income parents, whether they are employed or on welfare. This 
new allowance will include the Quebec family allowance and that 
part of social assistance payments that is used to cover children's 
needs. This will be in addition to the federal tax credit, for the time 
being, provided the federal tax credit does not disappear sometime 
in the coming months. That may be the case when the next budget 
is brought down by the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	The third component is a parental insurance that will provide, 
upon the birth of a child, benefits equivalent to 75 per cent of net 
earned income, for a period of 25 weeks. Here is a measure that 
will help families and pregnant women who want to look after their 
children but still have the possibility of returning, within a short 
period of time, to their job outside the family home. This parental 
insurance will also provide additional benefits for a period of six 
months, starting with the third child. It increases from $39,000 to 
$49,000 the ceiling for eligible earnings, and it provides an 
insurance fund that will be funded partly by recovering part of the 
contributions made by employers and employees to the 
employment insurance fund, as provided for under federal 
legislation, and partly by collecting additional contributions from 
workers who are not covered by the employment insurance 
program.
<P>
	Again, we hope the federal government will co-operate and 
allow the Quebec government to take advantage of the federal 
provision that authorizes the use of the employment insurance fund 
for such purposes.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	The Quebec government will also provide substantial help to 
children and young families. The beneficiaries of this reform are 
the people who immediately come to mind: women. For several 
years, women's groups in Quebec have been asking for concrete 
measures to help women reconcile their roles as mothers and active 
members of the workforce, without penalizing them.
<P>
	The biggest winners of this family policy are the 550,000 
Quebec children who are under six years of age, including those 
living in socioeconomically disadvantaged environments. Early 
childhood services include half-day classes and free child care for 
disadvantaged children under four. This is undoubtedly the best 
solution to ensure that all children benefit from equal 
opportunities, and to prevent teenagers from dropping out of school 
in such large numbers.
<P>
	This policy also promotes a better balance between work and 
family. In a society where both parents work, adequate and 
available child care services are an absolute requirement. 
Educational and child care services are essential in a modern 
society, but they are insufficient.
<P>
	The Quebec government wants to ensure that child benefits are 
based on the principle of fairness and constitute an incentive to 
work. These premises guided the development of the new 
integrated allowance that will better meet the basic needs of all 
children from low income families.
<P>
	Finally, the new policy takes into account the profound changes 
that have occurred in the workplace, by proposing the creation of a 
new parental insurance program. This new system will be more 
accessible and more generous than the system now provided 
through employment insurance.
<P>
	Furthermore, one of the most important indirect benefits of the 
new policy is that the rapid growth of day care services will 
encourage the development of the social economy, as well as 
facilitate the battle against the underground economy. For the 
Province of Quebec, as for Ontario and other Canadian provinces, 
this has become a very serious problem in recent years.
<P>
	It must be pointed out that the proposed family policy shows 
that, despite a difficult budgetary context, which exists in Quebec 
as well as in Canada, we in Quebec at least have shown that we 
have the imagination and creativity to remain a progressive society 
that puts its children first. It is in this perspective that, in Quebec, 
the government has decided to adapt so as to continue to be a tool 
for social development and the key to its future success.
<P>
	We sincerely believe that this is a progressive policy and that it 
confirms the dynamic role of the government to which citizens are 
so deeply attached. I wanted to highlight these statements by the 
Government of Quebec because it is what we would most like to 
see happen. The Reform Party motion proposes a very restrictive 
and limiting measure, and we feel that this is not the right 
approach.
<P>
	The best chance for finding solutions lies in leaving this 
authority with the provinces, who are still in the best position to 
decide what is required so that the choices made by the provinces 
will better correspond to the real needs of their society, to the actual 
composition of their families, and will provide the best future for 
their children.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to make a brief comment and then pose a 
short question to the member. I thank him for his intervention on 
this issue.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6535"> 6535 </A></B>
<P>
	He mentioned toward the beginning of his speech refundable and 
non-refundable tax credits. I thought I would speak to that for a 
moment to clarify the issue.
<P>
	I believe that most people, certainly those who look to fairness 
and equity within the system, would agree that the present system 
of a child care tax deduction is not equitable and not fair to 
Canadian families. In fact, the benefit of that system goes to the 
more wealthy who pay the greatest amount of income tax.
<P>
	The reverse of that would be a tax credit which would give an 
equitable benefit to all Canadians no matter what their income 
level might be.
<P>
	A non-refundable tax credit could be used to reduce the amount 
of federal tax a person pays. However, it could not be used for a 
refund. For example, if someone were required to pay a tax of 
$2,000 and a credit were determined to be $2,500, that taxpayer 
would not receive a refund nor would they be taxed. The tax would 
be eliminated and they would not receive a refund. However, if the 
tax credit were deemed to be refundable, they would have a tax 
levy of zero and they would receive a payment of $500 in addition 
to that. That is the difference between a non-refundable tax credit 
and a refundable tax credit.
<P>
	In our proposal we have not specifically said what kind of credit 
we would put forward. We are looking at the issue of a refundable 
versus a non-refundable tax credit. Assuming this is accepted by 
the House, we would lean toward a refundable tax credit for 
Canadian families. Indeed that would be our preference.
<P>
	Either way, refundable or non-refundable, the issue of a tax 
credit over deduction would certainly be the choice of Canadian 
families.
<P>
	My question to the hon. member is quite specific. Could he tell 
me what he feels is more important? In his speech he mentioned 
that he thought it more important to provide more day care for 
families. He thought this was a priority in the province of Quebec. 
Would he think it more important to provide day care spaces for 
families or to provide a choice for families as to whether they want 
day care or whether they want to stay at home with their children? 
Which would be the more important policy that a government 
should look at, simply providing day care or providing choice for 
parents?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
providing me with the opportunity to clarify the comments I have 
just made.
<P>
	What is important for the members of the Bloc Quebecois in this 
issue is to ensure that all families, and all women, have an equal 
opportunity to raise their children. I mean all families, all women, 
all men, all couples. Whether families are poor or not, whether 
there are one or two parents in the home, what we want is for  no 
one to be at a disadvantage for deciding to stay home, or to work 
outside the home.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	No mother ought to be penalized because she has made one 
choice or the other. This is a fundamental freedom of choice we 
acknowledge for women, or for men who might be in the same 
situation.
<P>
	We feel that rearing children must come first. We also feel that 
mothers, while providing this child-rearing, must also have access 
to the fundamental freedom to realize their potential by working 
outside the home or within the home.
<P>
	We would not like to see a government policy which favoured 
one choice over the other. What we want is to see the fundamental 
policies designed and implemented in such a way as to ensure that a 
person is not penalized for having made a free choice. We would 
not like to see government policies advocating practices or 
programs that would encourage or discourage one or the other 
choice. We would like to see the individual's most basic rights 
respected.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I was very pleased to hear from 
the hon. member opposite. He always has very cogent remarks to 
make in the debates in this House. I welcome his comments about 
not skewing the system one way or the other but I am confused 
about a situation that prevails in his own province of Quebec.
<P>
	For many years Quebec governments have provided a significant 
benefit to parents for having children, indeed an increasing amount 
of money. They have expended tens of millions of dollars in this 
effort to engineer more births in the province of Quebec and I 
understand without much success. I wonder how that program 
squares with his comments about equity and not providing unequal 
incentives. What about couples who have chosen not to have 
children or not as many as the government of Quebec wanted them 
to have?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurin:</B> Madam Speaker, if the hon. member opposite 
wants to discuss the family policies of the federal government and 
those of the provincial government, perhaps we should go back in 
history and see how the Government of Canada treated the Quebec 
government when in Quebec most families had ten children or 
more. The hon. member may care to recall what the federal 
government did at the time. What kind of choices were made then 
to help families?
<P>
	In Quebec, families were raised without waiting for subsidies 
from the government. Quebec couples did not wait for subsidies to 
have children. They knew what their responsibilities were, and they 
believed in the future of the family. Family policies came much
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6536"> 6536 </A></B>
<P>
later, and it was the Quebec government at the time that would have 
appreciated more flexibility to be able to help these large families, 
which was not necessarily the case in other Canadian provinces.
<P>
	At a time when Quebec would have liked to see specific criteria 
for providing assistance in situations peculiar to Quebec, it did not 
get the federal government's co-operation. When we want the 
power to deal with our own problems, that is the kind of situation 
we are referring to.
<P>
	Today, Quebec is in favour of a family policy that is in fact quite 
unique and quite different from what the federal government had in 
mind. We believe that Quebec's needs are different, and because 
they are, Quebec needs all the political resources available to meet 
those needs.
<P>
	It always boils down to this: since we have different views on 
most of the problems facing us today, we keep asking for all the 
powers we need to implement our vision and guarantee the 
development of our families as well as our cultural, economic and 
social development.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
two of the issues that face families today are high unemployment 
levels and taxation. We constantly hear from across the floor the 
parliamentary secretary talking about all the jobs that the 
government has created. I find it very odd that when the Liberals 
came to power there were 1.4 million Canadians out of work and 
presently there are 1.4 million Canadians out of work.
<P>
	It is not low interest rates that are causing the problem. Low 
interest rates should fuel the economy-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Resuming 
debate, the hon. member for Fraser Valley East.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to rise to speak to this supply day motion. It is 
always a pleasure to talk about issues involving the family. All of 
us here come from a family and so we all have an opinion on it and 
a strategy on how we would like to see families strengthened. That 
is what this debate is about. It is a pleasure to enter into that.
<P>
	The Liberal speech from the throne was delivered in February of 
this year. It was 13 pages long by my count. It was read into the 
record about all of the priorities of the government, the direction it 
is taking, the things it wants to emphasize, the promises it says it is 
making to the Canadian people. Although the throne speech was 13 
pages long and although it emphasized a lot of things within that 
text only once in the 13 pages did it mention the word family. Even 
at that it was just a passing reference.
<P>
	The red book, which is the gospel according to the Liberals, 
mentions family only on one page in the entire book which is 100 
and some pages long. Where it mentions the word family in the 
entire red book is on a page where it says that the Liberal 
government promises to create thousands of federally run day care 
spaces. That is their entire reference to the family.
<P>
	I hope it is an error of omission and it does not reflect the priority 
that they place on the family, but we do notice a disturbing trend. It 
is interesting that Parliament has created an auditor general for 
finances, an auditor general for the environment, an ethics 
counsellor for lobbyists, secretaries of states for various functions 
from women to youth and so on. I do not know why but there does 
not seem to be anybody who wants to touch this issue of should we 
be concerned about the family. The Liberals it would seem do not 
want to touch that with a ten foot pole.
<P>
	A couple of years ago I did bring forward a private member's bill 
which would have created a small office called the auditor general 
for the family. That office's role would have been similar to the 
other auditors general to check legislation that affects the 
environment or the finances of the nation and so on.
<P>
	The office I conceived of would also check on the government to 
see how legislation affects families. For some reason that was 
defeated. The government did not want to see how legislation 
affected families and I to this day do not understand why.
<P>
	In a town hall meeting today if I give a speech it is something 
like this: ``The family today feels burnt out, stressed out and in 
crisis''. I go down a list for the crowd which goes something like 
this: ``Let me describe your situation for you. You are working two 
jobs or more. Both parents are working. You have no time to spend 
with your children. Your credit cards are maxed out. You are 
worried about your job. You wish you could spend more time 
teaching your children to read but you do not have that time any 
more. It seems it has been taken away from you. You are working 
harder than ever but are not getting further ahead''.
<P>
	When I make a statement like that a hush comes over the room. 
The people just start nodding their heads. They say: ``You are 
describing my situation. That's the way I feel. I'm stressed out, I'm 
burnt out, I'm working harder than ever, and it doesn't seem like 
I'm getting ahead. I'm just not getting ahead''.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	It is no wonder that in a recent Angus Reid poll, 63 per cent of 
people said that the family is in crisis. People are not just stressed 
out but they feel that the family is in crisis. No doubt there are a 
variety of responsible factors. But the list I went through is part and 
parcel of what determines that crisis.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6537"> 6537 </A></B>
<P>
	I mentioned how families are not emphasized in this place often 
enough. We talk about all other categories of people. We seem to 
put them all in little slots. We have royal commissions, 
investigations, priorities, auditors general, you name it; but we do 
not do the same for the family. That is one of the things that 
differentiates the Reform and Liberal parties as we head into the 
next election which will likely be in 1997.
<P>
	The Reform Party has decided on some principles concerning the 
family. Those principles are important to the framing of the debate 
today as we talk about child tax credits, tax benefits and tax relief 
for families.
<P>
	The first principle could be stated as follows: That the family is 
the fundamental building block of our society. It is the primary 
institution for the transfer and protection of beliefs, culture and 
social stability. The first principle of the Reform Party in the 
foundation of our beliefs is that the family is key. The family is key 
in crime prevention. It is key in education, in providing financial 
benefits to children and in providing for its own financial prospects 
down the road.
<P>
	Study after study proves that the family is the key institution for 
passing on attitudes, beliefs, respect for others, educational 
opportunities, standard of living, you name it. That is why the 
strengthening of the family unit is a cornerstone of our social 
policy. I re-emphasize that the state, the government, is not the 
fundamental building block of society. It is the family.
<P>
	The second Reform principle is our belief that parents must have 
the primary responsibility and opportunity to nurture and provide 
for their children. It must be re-emphasized that the state does not 
have that primary responsibility. The state does not bring people 
into the world. The state does not form a family. The state is not the 
primary building block of society. It is the family. It is not the 
welfare worker, although they are important. It is not the teacher in 
the school. It is not the legal system. It is not an advocacy group. It 
is not the Reform Party of Canada. It is the family that has the 
primary responsibility.
<P>
	The family not only has responsibility and obligation but it also 
needs opportunity. It needs governments to move out of its way. As 
someone put it, government should be doing for the family only 
what the family cannot do for itself. In other words, the 
government should fill in where there are cracks. Obviously some 
programs are needed to look after people across Canada.
<P>
	The family needs to be reinforced, encouraged and endorsed, 
patted on the back both morally and financially to do the job it does 
best if it is to fulfil its role as a primary building block of society.
<P>
	In exceptional cases the government does need to be involved, 
for example, in situations of child abuse or child neglect. We have a 
collective obligation to ensure that the least protected in society, 
the least able to defend themselves, have the protection of the state. 
Obviously we need adequate legal protection and a welfare system 
in the country to ensure the well-being of those children who are 
being abused.
<P>
	We have been studying this big problem in British Columbia. 
The Gove commission and others have made recommendations in 
an attempt to ensure those cracks are not so wide that children fall 
right through them. However, those interventions should be kept to 
a minimum and not try to impose a national government idea of 
what that family should do or how they should behave themselves.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	I get repeated letters and phone calls from people who are 
concerned about the government trend to interfere in the lives of 
families. For example, there is a concern, at least at the United 
Nations, about the government interfering in a families' right to 
exercise fair discipline. Families are saying that how they raise 
their children, as long as they are not abusing or physically hurting 
them, and how they exercise corrective measures in their home is 
their business. I agree with them.
<P>
	We have had many questions about what is a family. How does 
one define a family? For the purposes of government benefits, 
which is often what we are talking about, I ask the question: What 
is a family?
<P>
	The Reform Party defines a family as follows: Individuals 
related by ties of blood, marriage and adoption. When I was in a 
different position here, I had a member from the NDP jump up and 
tell me that a family is anybody who is related by close emotional 
ties. That was her definition of a family. That is not a family. I have 
close emotional ties with many people. I sometimes feel quite 
emotional about quite a few things. I can even get quite emotional 
about the people at the Table but we are not a family and it is not a 
family relationship.
<P>
	A family is people related by blood, marriage and adoption. Just 
so we are clear on that, does that mean a single parent with children 
is a family? Of course, they are related by blood. If somebody 
adopts children are they a family? Of course they are a family. If 
somebody is related by marriage is that a family? Of course.
<P>
	The definition is important because we are now going to get into 
benefits that are offered by the government to those people.
<P>
	We also need to talk for a few minutes about marriage because I 
am going to talk about spousal benefits in a few minutes. What is a 
definition of a marriage? The current definition of marriage, which 
is used in all existing federal statutes and should be retained, is that 
a marriage is a union between a man and a woman as recognized by 
the state. It is important to have those definitions in place because 
benefits derive from those definitions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6538"> 6538 </A></B>
<P>
	We ought to resist all attempts to redefine marriage. The 
Supreme Court of Canada backs up this position in the Egan <I>v.</I> 
Canada case in 1995. Justice LaForest stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-marriage has from time immemorial been firmly grounded in our legal 
tradition, one that is itself a reflection of long standing philosophical and religious 
traditions. But its ultimate raison d'être transcends all of these and is firmly 
anchored in the biological and social realities that heterosexual couples have the 
unique ability to procreate, that most children are the product of these 
relationships, and that they are generally cared for and nurtured by those who live 
in that relationship.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We simply agree with the Supreme Court of Canada when it 
made that statement a year ago and when it talked about benefits 
that this Parliament gives to married couples.
<P>
	Obviously marriage, by definition, also includes common law 
couples. Again, that is recognized by the state. One does not have 
to be married in a church, although that is my experience and what 
I have gone through, but the state does recognize common law 
relationships and church or civil marriages and that is what we 
should stick with.
<P>
	We also agree with the Parliament of Canada. We debated a 
private member's bill about whether spousal benefits should be 
extended to same sex couples. A private member's bill was brought 
before the House. We all spoke to the issue. It was then defeated by 
all parties in the House, including the Liberal Party and the front 
bench, who said that Parliament was not going to redefine marriage 
like that and spousal benefits would not be extended for that. I 
think our party voted unanimously against it. The Liberals voted 
against it and cabinet voted against it. I also agree with the Prime 
Minister. He said in Winnipeg that he does not agree that marriage 
should include same sex couples. That is not his idea of marriage. 
This is unusual. Parliament, the Prime Minister and the Reform 
Party all agree. It has all been debated in the House, voted on, 
passed and is a matter of record.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	Although it is a matter of record, what has transpired since then 
is also a matter of record and it has not followed the wishes of 
Parliament or the wishes of the Prime Minister. That is why we 
know that the definition of marriage is going to come under attack 
and has come under attack. The reason is Bill C-33.
<P>
	The justice minister said in the House that Bill C-33 was not 
about entitlements and repeatedly denied that the amendment 
would lead to same sex benefits. He said that time and again and 
promised it time and again. But what has followed has proven him 
wrong.
<P>
	Just to get it on the record again, in the Montreal <I>Gazette</I> of May 
9 he was reported as having said: ``Everyone should be clear on 
what this amendment is not about. It does not confer benefits on 
same sex couples or on homosexual individuals''. However, it was  
reported in a magazine in my end of the country, the <I>Extra West</I> 
magazine, a gay magazine from Vancouver: ``If the government 
takes the position that you cannot discriminate, it follows as a 
matter of logic that you have spousal entitlement to benefits''. That 
is what he said outside the House in Vancouver.
<P>
	The redefinition of marriage and spouse has begun on that side 
of the House in contradiction of the wishes of Parliament. I think 
that is unfortunate. If Parliament wanted to do that, it should bring 
forward a bill, have a debate on it, pass it and let people know 
where it is heading and what it wants to do. That is fair and we can 
all live with the consequences. I would argue and vote against it.
<P>
	But when all that was done and the private members' bill 
defeated, the government did not listen to the will of Parliament. It 
sneaked in its own definition of spouse and marriage through the 
back door, and we see the results of that today.
<P>
	The human rights tribunal has now demanded of the government 
a list of all laws that will be changed when the definition of 
marriage changes. It is being compiled. I do not know how long it 
is going to take because many statutes state the definition of 
marriage is the union of a man and a woman as recognized by the 
state. The Minister of Justice got into this and got himself into a 
mess.
<P>
	Why then do we need this change in the child tax credit? We 
need it because the average family income has dropped $3,100 
since 1993. We need it because Canadian families deserve the 
option of how to raise their children. In other words, if families 
choose to raise children at home, they deserve as much of a tax 
break as those who choose to put their children in a day care centre.
<P>
	Families deserve to see some light at the end of the tunnel, so 
that instead of decreasing family incomes and increasing stress and 
diminishing their time with their children, they will be able to see 
down the road they are going to have more money, more time and 
some options.
<P>
	This motion is about options for families. It means that we 
believe that the state does not have the answer for families. 
Canadian families should exercise their options and not be 
restricted by tax policy to do what the government wants, but that 
they should have the freedom to do as they wish. That would 
happen if this motion were passed. I urge all members to support it.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity 
to participate in today's debate.
<P>
	The motion before us relates to a topic dear to every member of 
this House and to Canadians everywhere: the well-being of our 
children. Indeed, the matter is so important that we must be 
especially vigilant to ensure that we think about it as clearly as we 
can. Unfortunately, the motion as proposed tends not to clarify but 
rather to obscure some very important points about the purpose of 
the child care expense deduction, about genuine tax fairness, about 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6539"> 6539 </A></B>
<P>
fiscal responsibility and about the important steps this government 
has taken to advance the well-being of Canadian children.
<P>
	Let me begin with the first point, the purpose of a child care 
expense deduction.
<P>
	As we have already heard, the child care expense deduction is 
designed to help modest income families with two working parents 
shoulder the child care expenses they must incur in order to earn an 
income or to study. In other words it exists to help ensure that the 
tax burden of these families is fair compared to those with similar 
incomes who do not face these additional expenses.
<P>
	This leads me to another point that deserves to be emphasized. 
The existing system is designed to assist parents with modest 
incomes. In these tough fiscal times if not always, it would be 
unrealistic and even unfair to use taxpayers' money to introduce 
new benefits that would largely go to affluent Canadians.
<P>
	These are issues that by themselves are sufficient to show why 
today's motion does not deserve the support of this House.
<P>
	There is another important point I would like to turn to now. That 
is to remind hon. members of the important steps, the targeted steps 
our government has taken to advance the well-being of children, 
especially those of families in need.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In fact, despite the austerity we are forced to come to terms with, 
the federal government continues to provide significant support, 
through the child tax benefit, to low and middle income families 
with children. These benefits are tax exempt; they are revenue 
based and paid monthly.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Maximum payments go to families with net incomes below 
$26,000 and include a basic benefit of $1,020 per child, as well as 
an additional $75 for the third and each subsequent child in the 
family.
<P>
	In addition, there is also the child tax benefit supplement which 
specifically helps parents who stay at home to raise their preschool 
age children. This supplement provides modest income families 
who do not have deductible child care expenses with an additional 
$213 for each child under the age of seven.
<P>
	Beyond this, federal assistance to families with children is 
further enhanced by the working income supplement. This 
supplement helps low income working families meet some of the 
extra costs related to earning employment income. It is important 
to recognize that the working income supplement is not just limited 
to two income families but also applies to single earner families 
where one spouse stays home as the caregiver.
<P>
	The bottom line for this program is both clear and considerable. 
The total annual cost of the child tax benefit including the working 
income supplement is over $5 billion.
<P>
	It is also vital to note that these are not static programs. This 
government recognizes that the issue of child hardship and poverty 
is of growing concern to us all. That is why we have taken 
effective, targeted action to enhance them.
<P>
	For example, until the 1996 federal budget the maximum value 
of the working income supplement was $500 annually. The budget 
doubled this benefit to $1,000 to be phased in over two years. Over 
700,000 working families will benefit from the increased working 
income supplement. The average benefit they will receive will 
increase from $350 a year to $700. About 250,000 families will 
receive the maximum increase of $500. When this measure is fully 
implemented in July 1998, benefits to low income working 
families will be enhanced and enriched by $250 million a year. I 
would add that about one-third of the families that will benefit 
from the increased working income supplement are single parent 
families.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	I would also like to mention another important measure in last 
year's budget which will help families with children. In fact it will 
help them with one of the most important investments a young 
person in his or her family can make for the future and that is 
education.
<P>
	I am referring to the learning package, an additional $80 million 
a year in tax assistance to help students and their families deal with 
the increased costs of education. Students receive assistance with 
their educational costs under two tax provisions: the tuition fee 
credit and the education credit. As tuition fees rise, the amount of 
assistance provided by the tuition fee credit rises automatically.
<P>
	In the 1996 federal budget the amount on which the education 
credit is based was increased from $80 to $100 per month. In 
addition, the limit on the transfer of tuition and educational 
amounts, for example from a student to her parents, was increased 
from $4,000 to $5,000. Moreover the annual limit on registered 
education savings plans contributions was increased from $1,500 
to $2,000 and the lifetime limit was raised from $31,500 to 
$42,000.
<P>
	Finally, we have also taken action to improve the child care 
expense deduction, the issue at the heart of today's debate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6540"> 6540 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The 1996 budget broadened eligibility for the child care expense 
deduction by allowing single parents studying full time to receive 
the benefit and deduct it from all other income. Families with both 
father and mother studying full time may enjoy this benefit as well.
<P>
	Furthermore, and this is a first, the benefit is now available to 
parents completing high school. At the same time, the age 
determining deduction eligibility has been raised, thus enabling 
parents with older children to take advantage of the deduction.
<P>
	The measures I have just set out have provided considerable 
support to many children and parents in Canada, but I am not 
claiming that these measures alone are enough.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Surely there is more that could and should be done but in this 
period of limited resources we have to make sure that we are doing 
the most good we possibly can do with every dollar we spend. On 
this score the measure before this House fails miserably. It is 
proposed without regard to cost; incredibly it is proposed without 
regard to need and without regard to impact. Everyone agrees that 
we must do the very best we can for our children. To that extent I 
appreciate the intent of today's motion, but is it really the best we 
can do? Would children in need derive the most benefit? I think 
not.
<P>
	What is needed is for better thought out and better targeted 
proposals to be brought before this House. But typical of the party 
opposite, we have simple solutions offered to complex problems.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	However, today's debate and for that matter every issue under 
debate in this House would be of national interest only if it were 
grounded on clear intentions and proposals of substance, which 
must be expressed in clear terms and accompanied by accurate 
figures. Today's motion miserably fails the test on both counts.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Reform Party claims it is concerned about families, about 
family time, about providing a better standard of living and care for 
Canada's children, but in its proposals here today and in other 
venues it proves conclusively that it places no real priority on child 
poverty and has little true understanding about family life in the 
1990s.
<P>
	Families with two working parents exist for a number of reasons. 
Financial need is just one. The operation of the tax system might be 
another but it is not the sole reason that parents make a decision to 
stay home or seek work outside the home.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	Reform has nothing to offer the majority of Canadian families 
who must or choose to have both parents work. Even more 
troubling, today's motion dares to suggest that tax fairness would 
be enhanced by providing a credit to every family irrespective of 
income level. This simply means to a host of families who enjoy 
material benefits which low and modest income families can only 
dream of that they would benefit even more.
<P>
	The real agenda here is very clear. Reform has staked out a 
policy of a broad national tax cut, a policy that has not won the 
hearts of very many Canadians. Canadians see through the cheap 
appeal of Reform's tax proposals. Those Canadians are the ones 
with real common sense. They will not allow governments to buy 
electoral success by promising rapid and wide ranging tax 
reductions. Canadians will not be fooled by this phoney reform of 
the human face. When communism was collapsing in eastern 
Europe we started to hear about communism with a human face. 
That is what is happening here. Canadians will not be fooled by this 
political cross-dressing.
<P>
	In closing, there is no politician who would not like to lower 
taxes as far as possible. But good government means acting with 
constraint and consideration and making sure that today's tax cuts 
do not come at the price of increased pain and suffering tomorrow 
for those who are most vulnerable. That is why this government has 
opted in its three budgets to take targeted action that works within 
our fiscal conditions and that serves those who are most in need.
<P>
	That is what real political leadership and nation building is 
about. It is not about picking winners and losers. And because 
today's motion does not meet those tests of real leadership, does 
not increase real tax fairness and does not focus its benefits on 
those most in need, I have no hesitation whatsoever in urging all 
hon. members to vote against today's superficially appealing but 
essentially misleading motion.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, earlier I addressed questions to the hon. member's 
colleague. I would like to repeat them so I can clarify what the 
actual answer would be from the Liberal side.
<P>
	I do want to make a comment before I ask the questions though. 
The member mentioned that he does not know a politician who 
does not want to lower taxes. I happen to know a bunch of 
politicians who do not want to lower government spending and that 
is a problem. They sit on the Liberal benches. They refuse to reduce 
the size of government and so refuse to allow the relief that 
Canadians need and want both in their personal lives and in their 
businesses.
<P>
	Could the member please tell me who benefits the most from the 
existing child care tax deduction? Would it be someone earning 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6541"> 6541 </A></B>
<P>
$20,000 or someone earning $60,000? Who benefits most from the 
present tax system: a dual wage earner family earning $60,000 or a 
single wage earner family earning $60,000?
<P>
	As I may not have time to reply to his answer, I would say that it 
is the rich who benefit most from the present child care tax 
deduction and it is the dual parent family that benefits most by the 
income tax system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it somewhat incredible that 
the hon. member opposite would speak about members on this side 
of the House not being in favour of reducing government spending.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	As the hon. member would know if she had read the last three 
budgets, or would recall if she thought about it, we took 
unprecedented steps in the three budgets we have presented as a 
government to reduce government spending to its lowest level in 
many years as a percentage of the gross domestic product; in fact, 
soon to its lowest level since the late 1940s.
<P>
	I know that the hon. member opposite and her colleagues would 
like to see government spending go down even more. They have 
this small problem of telling us how that would happen without 
having an unfortunate negative impact on this country without 
leading to the kind of meanness and nastiness that my hon. 
colleague, the secretary of state, referred to.
<P>
	The government will continue to stand alongside Canadians. It is 
not going to stand aside and out of the way. We are going to stay in 
the game, helping and working with Canadians.
<P>
	The kinds of spending reductions we have achieved have been 
done in a reasonable, realistic and compassionate way, but not 
without impact and not without cost.
<P>
	It is incredible that the members of the third party stand up day 
after day telling the government to cut further because it does not 
affect anybody.
<P>
	As to the questions which were asked, I am going to respond in 
the following way. The hon. member asked some questions and 
then proceeded to answer them. I am going to ask her who would 
benefit most from the proposal that is in the motion before us. I 
would just note that it is proposed to be a tax credit. There is no 
indication that it is a refundable tax credit with the result that 
people without income would not benefit and it would not be 
available to them.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I still did not hear his answer. I 
assume from his non-answer to my two questions that he agrees 
with my answer, which rather flies in the face of everything we 
have heard in question period lately from a finance minister who 
rails on other parties and perhaps even casts us as a party that 
speaks for the wealthy, when in fact it is his very party in the  
present circumstances that gives the advantage to the higher 
income earner. That is yet another example of the spin or the 
duplicity of some of the comments made in the House. I find it 
most notable.
<P>
	In our fresh start program we have outlined where government 
expenditures can be reduced. The government continues to require 
in excess of $150 billion a year in order to operate. That figure is 
far higher than we feel is necessary. Without undue stress on the 
population our fresh start program outlines where the cuts can be 
made to government and indeed would put more money in the 
hands of the tax paying public and not in the hands of government 
bureaucrats.
<P>
	Again, does the member feel that money is better in the hands of 
bureaucrats than in the hands of taxpayers? What we propose 
would take approximately $5 billion out of the hands of 
government and put that $5 billion directly into the hands of 
families across the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, very briefly. I find it fascinating 
that as we look at the opposition motion today, it is not costed.
<P>
	I heard the hon. member state a great concern about spending 
and cost deficits, which we hear from that side of the House and 
which is a concern we share and one which we are acting on. As I 
reread the motion, there is no indication whatsoever about what 
this would cost. Estimates I have seen range into the billions and 
billions of dollars and the suggestion in the fresh start document 
that they would have to find only $12 billion would be blown out of 
the water. Some would look at the motion and say ``if you do this 
along the lines you have been saying, your costs would be 
additional billions of dollars''.
<P>
<B>(1235 )</B>
<P>
	I find it really distressing that we are debating a motion of a 
party, which consistently is concerned about government spending, 
government revenues and taxation levels, which is not costed. It 
has offered us no indication today whatsoever about the costing of 
this motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my simple 
question is why does the government continue to maintain the 
facade that program spending rather than tax cuts is the way to go.
<P>
	Chapter 19 of the auditor general's report which was tabled in 
September 1996 dealt with the child tax credit in detail. He pointed 
out that in many cases the program appears to be spending money 
on child tax credits for children who, quite simply, do not exist. 
The department does not have the programs and the checks and 
balances in place to find out how many dollars are being paid to 
families that do not have children and that are not entitled to those 
moneys. That is the type of waste and abuse that we find in 
program spending, which tax cuts would prevent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6542"> 6542 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like the parliamentary secretary to tell us why program 
spending, his vision, is so much better than what we are talking 
about, which is tax cuts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member asked two 
questions. The first is why we address the deficit through program 
cuts rather than tax cuts The answer is simple: because it is 
working.
<P>
	The second question that he asks is about the auditor general. I 
would reply by wondering out loud what the auditor general would 
have to say about this House's adopting a motion which is not 
costed in this fiscal climate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, just 
following up on the question which I asked a minute ago, which 
clearly points out the fundamental philosophical difference 
between members on this side of the House and members on that 
side of the House, they believe in taxing and spending because 
Canadians exist to provide money for the government so it can turn 
around and give it back to whomever it wishes and under whatever 
basis it feels is appropriate.
<P>
	This side of the House quite definitely believes that Canadians 
work for themselves, that Canadians feel that small government is 
important, that government should not be in their lives any more 
than it has to be and that they are prepared to pay a small amount of 
money toward government to ensure that some services and some 
uniformity of programs across the country are provided.
<P>
	This is the point. Canadians do not exist to create wealth for the 
government so the government can turn around and give it back to 
them in some form or another. That is a fundamental philosophical 
difference.
<P>
	When this government uses that type of program spending, as 
the auditor general pointed out in chapter 19, there is waste, there is 
mismanagement, there are bureaucrats to be paid, there are all 
kinds of overhead expenses. As I have said before, a tax cut with no 
administration cost could be implemented the day it is announced. 
That is the type of thing that people want. They want to take charge 
of their lives. Taking charge of their lives means they will pay less 
tax.
<P>
	We have laid it out quite clearly in our fresh start program, step 
one and step two.
<P>
	This country is in a financial mess. It is $600 billion in debt. We 
are running at almost a $30 billion deficit for the year ending 
March 31, 1996. When the Minister of Finance appeared before the 
finance committee and announced the results of the figures and a 
budget deficit of $28.9 billion, there was applause from the 
Liberals on that committee. It was incredible.
<P>
	It all stems from the philosophy that government should take 
money from Canadians because they owe it to the government so
<P>
that it can turn around and deliver it back in programs. We say the 
opposite.
<P>
<B>(1240 )</B>
<P>
	Our first point is to balance the budget and stop digging 
ourselves into a bigger hole. Once we have done that we want to 
help Canadians by giving them tax cuts. Step one, get the fiscal 
house in order. Step two, start giving back to Canadians control 
over their lives.
<P>
	What are we proposing for families after the budget is balanced? 
We are proposing to make families our priority and to ensure that 
government policies and regulations are family friendly. That is 
from the Reform Party's fresh start booklet published a month ago.
<P>
	We also said extend the $3,000 to $5,000 child care deduction to 
all parents including those who care for their children at home. It is 
a valid point and the essence of the resolution we are debating 
today. We want to extend the child tax credit of $3,000 to $5,000 
which this government is currently giving to families that obtain 
day care services outside their homes.
<P>
	We want to give people the choice. We want to give every 
Canadian parent the ability to make the decision of how they want 
to raise their child based on their family circumstances and not 
based on a tax policy imposed on them by the Minister of Finance. 
There is a fundamental and significant difference.
<P>
	We want to give parents charge of their lives. We want them to 
make the choices that are right for their families. We do not want 
them to have to make a decision based on the tax policy of the 
Minister of Finance. We do not want him to dictate to families in 
Canada.
<P>
	I forgot to inform the Speaker that I will be sharing my time with 
the member for Medicine Hat. I will take only 10 minutes.
<P>
	We go on to strengthen families in other ways. From the fresh 
start program for Canadians, we are going to increase the spousal 
amount from $5,380 to $7,900 which will level the playing field for 
parents who choose to stay at home to look after young children. It 
will help families meet the needs of a more demanding economy.
<P>
	Is that not a wonderful idea, that we help families to keep one 
spouse at home to look after the kids? It is better than having a tax 
policy that says ``I am going to put my kids next door with the 
neighbour, the neighbour will put his kids next door and I will look 
after them, and if we do a swap we can meet the requirements of the 
Minister of Finance, but if I want to raise my kids in my house and 
my neighbour wants to raise his kids in his House, it cannot be 
done''. The tax policy says you cannot do that.
<P>
	Surely it is an incredible statement that you cannot raise your 
own kids, you can raise only your neighbours  kids. I like to raise 
my own children. I believe that every family in this country would 
love to raise their own children. Yet the Minister of Finance by his 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6543"> 6543 </A></B>
<P>
own tax policy which he is imposing on these families says ``No, 
you cannot do that. I do not want you to do that. We are going to 
institutionalize your children and put them in day care. We are 
going to have them raised by somebody else because we feel that is 
the way to go''.
<P>
	As Reformers we say that is detrimental to families, that is 
harmful to families, that causes pressure on families. We have so 
much marital break-up and we know that marital break-up is 
horribly painful to children. They are the innocent victims of 
marital break-up. They are the young and the innocent who are 
involved in sometimes messy situations. They are pulled and 
dragged by each side. They are in the courts. People go to court to 
find out whom the children will be raised by, the mother or the 
father. It is a horrible situation.
<P>
	I am sure the House would agree that anything that can be done 
to protect the family, to remove the tax disincentive, to keep the 
family together surely must be in the best interests of Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1245 )</B>
<P>
	I cannot stress it strongly enough that we have to help families 
rather than thinking we are going to introduce all kinds of policies 
and programs to pick up the broken pieces. Let us work 
beforehand.
<P>
	We are not asking for government intervention with a thousand 
more bureaucrats and programs across the country. We are saying 
to give back to families control of their own lives by removing the 
tax policies that want to put the kids somewhere else.
<P>
	We heard the parliamentary secretary tell us that programs are 
the way to do it: tax and spend; take the money from Canadians and 
pass it through to the bureaucrats who try to put it back into this 
segment or that segment of society. There are programs for 
widows, programs for single parents, programs for kids and 
programs for businesses. Bombardier was given $87 million. Name 
it and there is a program for it. Let us leave people alone and allow 
them to make their own decisions without having to worry about 
taxes.
<P>
	I picked up a pamphlet entitled: ``Canadian Families: 
International Year of the Family, 1994'' which was produced by the 
Vanier Institute of the Family. I am just picking out a few of the 
quotes. Under the heading ``What counts in Canadian Families'', it 
is stated: ``The desire to spend more time with the family is 
unlikely to wane in the years ahead''. Another quote: ``Although 
Canadian families experience many problems, for better or worse, 
the majority of Canadian marriages do last for a lifetime''.
<P>
	It is an interesting little pamphlet about Canadian families. The 
whole concept behind the pamphlet is to give families the 
opportunity to look after themselves and  they will likely do the 
best job in raising their kids. They will likely do the best job of 
looking after their own circumstances.
<P>
	This is what the Reform Party wants to do. We want to give the 
control back to the families. This is only a small start in getting 
bureaucrats out of their hair, getting the taxation policy of the 
Minister of Finance out of their hair and allowing Canadian 
families to do what they do best which is to raise their own kids.
<P>
	We all know that an institution is no substitute for a family. I 
cannot imagine being raised in an institution. My kids would hate 
the idea of being raised in an institution. A number of years ago 
when my son was in grade three or four, we put him in day care for 
one afternoon. It was tax time and I was busy so we had to put him 
in day care for a few weeks. We thought he was having a good time 
because as an older kid he was helping the younger ones. He still 
remembers that we put him in day care for a number of weeks and 
he would have preferred to have stayed at home with his mother.
<P>
	The point is that our motion is concerned about doing something. 
It has the right idea. It gets bureaucrats out of the families' hair and 
lets them raise their kids. It lets parents love their own kids. This 
will help Canadians, Canada and everyone else.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
real pleasure to rise in support of today's motion. I cannot stress 
enough how proud I am to be a member of a party that upholds the 
traditional place of the family in society as the most important 
institution in society, period. It is absolutely the most important 
institution in society. That is why I am just thrilled to be standing in 
support of today's motion.
<P>
	I will start by talking about the tremendous importance of 
families for a moment. I heard my hon. colleague from St. Albert 
talk about his personal situation. There is no question that the 
family is the institution which people rely on overwhelmingly to 
supply their children with values. Rather obviously, people need to 
have good, strong values of some kind in order to be good citizens 
and contribute to society. These values come from families.
<P>
<B>(1250 )</B>
<P>
	Families are needed to provide education. I was on the finance 
committee and people from the various groups promoting literacy 
were there. I made the argument that the most effective, the best 
and the most cost efficient institution for providing education in 
this country is the family. Only a family can really instil the joy of 
learning. Only a family can provide all that knowledge that people 
do not necessarily get through their schools. The literacy groups 
made the point that the people who do learn in schools are the ones 
who get a good grounding in education from their own families. It 
is vital for education that we have strong families.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6544"> 6544 </A></B>
<P>
	Families provide security for their members. When people for 
some reason are thrown out of work, the best place for them to go, 
initially at least, should be their families. That is where they not 
only get monetary support and other resources but they also get the 
moral support they need in a situation like that.
<P>
	Finally, families provide roots so that people can become part of 
a larger community which really contributes to their sense of 
well-being and their sense of purpose in life. If people are part of a 
strong family and therefore part of a stronger community, they feel 
that their life really does have a sense of meaning and a sense of 
purpose. It is vital that we have strong families just for that reason 
alone.
<P>
	I want to make the argument that families do not get the 
recognition they deserve. If we were able to put a monetary value 
on what families contribute to society, it would certainly be a lot 
more than what governments at all levels put in in terms of trying 
to support families. There is no question that people today in 
families no matter how we describe them put a tremendous amount 
of value back into society. We must do whatever we can to ensure 
that those families are supported, that they prosper and that the 
children who come from those families go on to be productive 
citizens in society.
<P>
	It is clear that today's families are under a tremendous amount of 
stress. The hon. member for St. Albert spoke about the broken 
families. Sociologists and psychologists have pointed to the 
negative impact of broken families. One of the reasons there are 
broken families today is that there is so much stress due to the fact 
that people's finances are tight. People have to work night and day. 
Both parents often have to work night and day just to bring home 
enough money to provide the basic necessities of life.
<P>
	Here is how it works: People make their income; the finance 
minister gets half and then mom, dad and the kids get the other half 
to live on. The finance minister gets half the bowl of porridge and 
mom, dad and the kids get to share the other half of the bowl of 
porridge. Unfortunately in September, 6,500 Canadians went 
bankrupt; they could no longer live on that half a bowl of porridge. 
That is one of the big stresses on families today.
<P>
	As a result of having to work all day and in some cases six and 
seven days a week, people simply do not have the time to spend 
with their children. I know they regret that very much. I regret how 
much time I have to be away from my family to do this job. It 
means that I cannot devote the time I would like to to be with my 
children, to do some of the things I have talked about: to provide 
them with the education that can only come from families; to give 
them a sense that they are part of a larger group, a part of a 
community and a tradition and a history in our own family; to give 
them the security by  talking about the big safety net that a family 
provides. And of course we have to instil values.
<P>
	All of that takes time. People come home after working all day 
and they are tired. It is extremely tempting to sit children in front of 
the electronic babysitter, the TV. It is not a replacement for people 
who actually give their children guidance. The family is under 
stress today.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	I mentioned a minute ago all the debt which people are carrying. 
There were 6,500 bankruptcies in September, a 20 per cent 
increase. This country has record high levels of personal debt. 
Again people feel that they have to go out and work and work and 
work to try to pay down their debt.
<P>
	As a result of the high taxes not only do we have personal debt at 
record levels and not only do we have all those bankruptcies, we 
have tremendously high levels of unemployment. Unemployment 
is about 10 per cent right now in Canada. That does not include the 
half a million people who have given up completely looking for 
work. It does not include the one in four people who are constantly 
worried about being able to find a job. Because of high taxes this 
country has a real problem with high unemployment.
<P>
	We have unfair taxation policies. Not only do we have high taxes 
which are unfair, but we have taxation policies that encourage and 
have incentives for people to spend even less time with their 
children. Families are rewarded for having their children brought 
up outside the home as opposed to being rewarded for bringing 
them up at home where a lot of people would like to do it.
<P>
	About a year ago in a <I>Maclean's</I> magazine poll about 70 per cent 
of Canadian families where both parents were working said that, 
given their druthers, they would have one parent at home. Seventy 
per cent. We are not talking about a minority. We are talking about 
a majority of families who have both parents working today who 
would like to have the option.
<P>
	The facts are clear. When families have a tax burden that 
constitutes 46 per cent of their income, about half of their income, 
it is almost impossible for many families, especially low income 
families, to have one parent at home to spend time with their 
children. It makes it virtually impossible and it is getting worse.
<P>
	In the last three years, since 1993, we have seen that families 
have been left with $3,000 per family less in purchasing power than 
when this government came into office. That is $3,000 a family. It 
makes it virtually impossible for people who are struggling to get 
ahead to be able to ever hope to spend more time with their children 
at home, especially in those early years when the guidance of the 
parents is so needed. Obviously there is a huge problem in this 
country.
<P>
	I have heard government members today say that they have done 
this and they have given them that and they have done this for 
families. It is not enough. The problem also is that it comes at it 
from a bureaucratic, big government point of view. The 
government is saying that it has decided it will give back to parents 
money in such and such a form if they conform to such and such a 
behaviour. That is not right.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6545"> 6545 </A></B>
<P>
	Families make a lot better decisions about how to spend their 
own money and about how to raise their own children than a big 
bureaucratic bloated government will ever do. Most people agree 
with that. It is time to shrink the size of government. It is time that 
we gave taxpayers and families more money in their pockets to 
decide what to do with their children, to decide how to raise their 
own children.
<P>
	That is what the Reform Party fresh start for families is all about. 
That is what today's motion is all about. We want to give Canadian 
families that choice. They want that choice. We are not saying that 
both parents cannot go out to work. Of course they can.
<P>
	In my own situation, for years my wife worked in the workforce 
along with me. It is not that we particularly wanted to have it that 
way but that is how it worked for a number of years, because we 
wanted to try to get ahead. People should always have that option, 
absolutely.
<P>
	We are not saying they should not have that option. But we are 
saying that they should also have the option to stay home with their 
children. We are just asking that people have some freedom.
<P>
	I heard the hon. parliamentary secretary for finance say that the 
Reform Party wants the Ozzie and Harriet approach to child care. 
That is a strawman and let us knock it down right now. What the 
hon. member is worried about is that this motion is striking a chord 
with Canadians. He knows how stressed out families are today. He 
knows that people want to have some options. He knows that 
people want to have the choice of being able to raise their families 
the way they decide, not the way the hon. parliamentary secretary, 
the finance minister, the government, the bureaucracy or a bunch of 
special interest groups decides. Give families the ability, the 
freedom to raise children as they choose. The best way to do that is 
to leave more money in the pockets of those ordinary Canadians 
who just want government to leave them alone.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	The question has been raised about how that can happen. How 
can that be done? The deficit is $28.6 billion right now. In fact, the 
government is going to add about $107 billion to the total debt by 
the time its mandate is done. So far it has already added to the 
personal tax burden of Canadians approximately $3,000 per family.
<P>
	What can we do when there is a deficit situation like that? We 
have said that we would balance the budget and we would run 
surpluses. We would shrink the size of government, get rid of all 
the ridiculous spending. We do not need to spend money on 
Bombardier. We need to spend it on families. We need to spend it 
on health care. We do not need to spend it on CBC television. We 
need to spend that money on families to ensure that people get to 
keep more money in their own pockets.
<P>
	Our fresh start for families allows people to keep $2,000 per 
family by the year 2000. That is a great start. It gives people some 
hope that they will have the opportunity, if they so choose, to stay 
at home with their children so that they can provide them the 
guidance, education and the protection that many Canadian 
families want today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
before I come to my point, I want to say that I am a father of five 
children, a grandfather of four and I am one who strongly believes 
that the family is the fundamental building block of our society. I 
think that families that are in a position to have at least one parent 
home when the children are growing up, especially in the formative 
years between the time of birth and when they go to school, are 
indeed very fortunate.
<P>
	In my case, all of our children had the good fortune of having at 
least one parent, always their mother, at home in those formative 
years before they went to school. So I believe in that very strongly.
<P>
	It is very interesting to note when looking at polls that only 7 per 
cent of women support the Reform Party. One might ask the 
question: With a party that is so strongly in support of the family, 
why would so few women support the Reform Party? I think I know 
the answer, as do most Canadians.
<P>
	Women, perhaps more than anyone else in the country realize 
that if their families do not fit the certain preconceived model of 
the Reform Party, they are out. They do not care about them. 
Everyone knows that the Reform Party has a particular model in 
mind when it comes to the family and if you do not fit that model, 
you are nobody. For example, the mother who wants to work 
outside the house or who has to work outside because there is a 
need for additional income, does the Reform Party place any 
emphasis on that parent, on that woman?
<P>
	I have been listening to the debate and rarely does the Reform 
Party ever say anything about the woman who either wants to work 
outside the home or who has to work because of financial needs. 
That is the reason why women do not trust that party. They have 
this funny notion that there is a particular kind of family and if the 
model does not fit you, just forget it. Your family is out in the cold. 
That is my observation about this party.
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member may have been sitting 
there, but I do not think he was listening. I used my own family as 
an example of a family where my wife went out into the workforce, 
partially because she had a tremendous career. She was a very able 
person in her chosen line of work and she wanted to pursue it. 
Ultimately, of course she brought in income. That enabled us to 
provide some of the basic necessities for our family after the 
government had taken its half, which it always gets. It is ridiculous 
for the member to throw up that red herring.
<P>
	I feel that I must also point out that we have many people in our 
caucus who come from all kinds of backgrounds. We have mem-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6546"> 6546 </A></B>
<P>
bers in our caucus who are single mothers. Maybe the hon. member 
was not aware of  that. There are people in our caucus who are 
divorced. We have people who come from all kinds of 
backgrounds. We are sensitive to what goes on out in the real 
world. That is why we are offering people complete choice.
<P>
	If the Liberals do not believe in choice, why do they not just state 
it?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to be able to speak on this opposition motion today.
<P>
	Members will know that I have had a very active role in the 
House on issues dealing with the family. I have advocated many of 
the things which members have spoken of today. I am also a 
legislator. I have a responsibility to do the job in the best way I can.
<P>
	My first point is to advise the House that I will not be supporting 
this motion. I would like to explain to the House why.
<P>
	The motion states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should provide tax fairness for 
all Canadian families by extending the child care tax deduction to all families of all 
income levels and converting it to a credit, thereby removing the tax bias against 
parents caring for their own children.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The first thing that members should be doing is assessing the 
motion. This motion says that we ``should'' provide this rather than 
the typical wording ``consider the advisability of''. This motion is 
an absolute. It says: ``You should do this''. When a motion says 
specifically that we should do something, it has to be judged on the 
merits of the motion; not on its intent or what the crafters of the 
motion were trying to say, but on what the motion says. That is 
what is before the House.
<P>
	I support the concepts of equity and fairness in the tax system. 
However, when a motion contains errors or omissions it must be 
defeated. The error in the motion is the reference to the child care 
tax deduction. In the Income Tax Act there is no such thing as a 
child care tax deduction. There is, however, a child care expense 
deduction which is available to taxpayers who incur child care 
costs outside of the home.
<P>
	The motion also refers to converting the child care expense 
deduction to a credit. There are two forms of tax credits. There is a 
refundable tax credit and a non-refundable tax credit. Just by brief 
explanation, a refundable tax credit-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Penson:</B> Sounds like an accountant.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> I am a CA. That is right. I think it is important to 
explain the difference. It is an important difference. It is important 
to the acceptability of the motion.
<P>
	A refundable tax credit is available even if a person has no 
income taxes payable. For instance, the GST rebate is  a form of a 
refundable tax credit. Even if you have no income, you may file a 
tax return and get a refund for the amount of the GST credit.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	However, there are also non-refundable tax credits which can 
only reduce taxes otherwise payable. They cannot generate a 
refund. On that basis and by virtue of the fact that this motion does 
not even explain who would be able to claim this credit, if it were a 
non-refundable credit, a spouse working in the home, managing the 
family home and caring for preschool children, who had no income 
would not get any benefit from this. This is precisely what I have 
been working against.
<P>
	This motion has twisted the language in such a way that it could 
ultimately lead to something even worse than what already exists 
today. It could provide even further benefits in other situations and 
absolutely no benefit to a parent who chooses to stay at home and 
care for a family member.
<P>
	Typically private members' motions state ``that, in the opinion 
of this House, the government should consider the advisability'' et 
cetera. As such the House is dealing with a principle without 
quantification of the financial implications. That is typically the 
private member's motion. It deals with principles. If the principles 
cannot be accepted then it does not matter what the dollars are. We 
have to first buy into the concept, then we can talk about how we 
can implement it.
<P>
	However, this motion does not say ``consider the advisability''. 
It says ``do it. This is what you have to do''. But it does not explain 
the detail.
<P>
	I want to thank the whole House for supporting Motion No. 30 
on November 5, a motion which proposed a child care tax credit for 
those who choose to provide care in the home to preschool 
children, the disabled, the chronically ill or the aged. That vote 
passed in this place by 129 to 63.
<P>
	If members look at the record they will see that the full cabinet 
and almost all of the parliamentary secretaries did not support the 
motion. I know why. They could not support the motion because of 
the absence of a reference to cost and because of the detail in the 
debate.
<P>
	The intent of Motion No. 30 was not to impose an action on the 
government, but rather to ask it to deal with the principle, the 
advisability of giving a tax break to families who choose to provide 
care to a family member in need.
<P>
	As a result of that, if the vote were adjusted for those who could 
not vote for it because of the technical nature, the vote would have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6547"> 6547 </A></B>
<P>
been something like 129 to 13. No matter how it is cut, on 
November 5 the House of  Commons sent a very powerful message 
to the government that members, on behalf of their constituents, on 
behalf of all the people they encounter, knew in their hearts that 
investing in families was the right thing to do.
<P>
	The motion suggests that tax fairness, the removal of tax bias, 
can be achieved by making the change it proposes. The National 
Forum on Health just issued a dialogue paper to which I will refer. 
In its press release on November 12, the national forum states: 
``The forum believes that there is an urgent need to invest in 
children. The draft proposals include a combined 
federal-provincial child tax benefit for low and moderate income 
families, a reduction in the tax burden on families with children 
and home visiting programs for preschool children at risk''. That is 
a tremendous endorsement for Motion No. 30, a motion that was 
passed by this place.
<P>
	It will provide ample support for the argument that the 
government must very seriously consider tax reform as it relates to 
children and families.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	Members will know that in the reports just out from the 
Canadian Association for Social Development the child poverty 
statistics are unacceptable. One in four children is living in poverty 
in our country.
<P>
	The National Forum on Health report is a dialogue paper which 
includes their draft proposals and is available for public comment. 
The final report from the National Forum on Health will be coming 
out in early 1997. I encourage members and Canadians to inform 
themselves of this report and to make and to have an input. That is 
the kind of thing that makes changes in legislation and tax law that 
will affect the family, children and all things important to members 
as expressed in their vote on Motion No. 30.
<P>
	The report states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We believe there is an urgent need to invest in children. Failure to invest in the 
early years of life increases the remedial costs to the health, education, social services 
and justice systems. The problems are compounded when a separation or divorce 
occurs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Members will know we just dealt with Bill C-41, dealing with 
the terrible situation of family breakdown. That exacerbates the 
situation but notwithstanding in addition to a recommendation to 
combine the existing child tax benefit which is not taxable, it is 
outside the tax system, with current provincial welfare programs. It 
means that the federal and provincial governments should be 
working together to start to consolidate many of these benefit 
programs that are in fact already available to families and children.
<P>
	The National Forum on Health was started by the Prime Minister 
and he is the honorary chair of this forum. From the report I 
thought this one paragraph was the most important:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>At the heart of pro-child and pro-family policies should be a recognition of social 
and familial responsibilities for the well-being of children. Currently, Canada is the 
only western country that does not take into account the cost of raising children 
when determining how much families with children should pay compared to those 
without children. Simply put, families are penalized by the income tax system for 
having children. The tax<I>transfer system could be reformed in a manner which 
reduces the net tax burden of all families with children.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is a very important, major endorsement for Motion No. 30 
which this House passed on November 5.
<P>
	I want to conclude this section of my speech that I am opposed to 
this motion for technical reasons. I understand the spirit but as a 
responsible legislator I cannot allow a motion which has an error in 
it and which has technical limitations, no detail, no specificity. I 
know the cabinet could not possibly endorse this. The 
parliamentary secretary cannot and I cannot because I want the job 
to be done right the first time. I do not want false starts and I do not 
want things happening that are going to possibly make the situation 
worse.
<P>
	There is a saying I enjoy quite a bit, that for every complex 
problem there is a simple solution. It is wrong. This is a complex 
issue we are dealing with. We are dealing with the complexity of 
families, with the complexity of addressing the child poverty issue 
and we are dealing with the concepts of positive and good health 
outcomes of our children. One motion in this form is inadequate in 
the extreme to address those serious problems.
<P>
	We need to work together to seriously consider the broad range 
of initiatives that we can come forward with to make a meaningful 
and a vital effort to deal with the issues of family breakdown, child 
health, child poverty and a healthy country.
<P>
	I consider this motion to be dysfunctional. It cannot be 
implemented in its present form and I cannot support it in this 
form. I am glad that so many members have risen in this place to 
talk about the family. We can see from the speeches from all sides 
there is no question the family is the heart of our country. Strong 
families make a strong country.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	Members know I have been presenting petitions in this place, 
probably ad nauseam. One I have had circulating across the country 
since 1994. I am sure members can probably now recite it from 
memory. However, I would like to put it on the record once again. 
The petition simply states that the petitioners draw to the attention 
of the House that managing the family home and caring for 
preschool children is an honourable profession which has not been 
recognized for its value to our society. The petitioners therefore 
pray and call on Parliament to pursue initiatives to eliminate tax 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6548"> 6548 </A></B>
<P>
discrimination against families that choose to provide care in the 
home for preschool children, the chronically ill, the aged or the 
disabled.
<P>
	I have had a wonderful response from Canadians on that petition. 
The reason I frequently presented this petition is when people hear 
that and hear the nice reaction it is given by members who are here 
to respond to petitions, it gives them hope that there are people who 
are actually thinking forward, envisioning the problems, how to 
solve them and what is going to make this country even better than 
it is today.
<P>
	I look back at some of the things I have done. Like all members 
of Parliament, I keep a little tally on some of the issues I have 
worked on. One of the first bills I ever presented was Bill C-256, 
splitting income between spouses so one could stay at home and 
care for preschool children. That was back in 1994. It taught me a 
lot. I received a lot of correspondence from people and had a lot of 
members come to me and support this. However, it was not a 
votable bill. It involved the expenditure of money and did not meet 
the criteria and I understand that.
<P>
	However, that bill did strike a chord back in 1994 and stills 
strikes a chord today. We know there are things we can do. It has to 
do with a tax break for families so we can provide more choice, 
more flexibility and more options because we have a complex 
social structure today.
<P>
	I look further and I see Bill C-269 which was to provide Canada 
pension plan benefits to spouses who work in the home because it 
is a real job. Whether it is the man or the woman working in a home 
based business or simply managing the home and caring for 
children, it is a job and there is a contribution being made to 
Canada. We know intuitively that good quality parental care 
generates better outcomes for children. They are healthier, socially 
better adjusted, less likely to get into trouble with the law and solid 
Canadians who have a great start at being good contributing 
citizens to Canada.
<P>
	Let us move down. I have Bill C-240. I love Bill C-240 because 
it states convert the child care expense deduction to an 
unrefundable tax credit, make it subject to income tax and extend 
the same benefit to those who choose to stay home and provide care 
in the home to their children. This is precisely the intent of this 
motion which has been brought before the House today. This is a 
bill which has been there since May. Unfortunately it has not been 
drawn for debate as yet.
<P>
	I want to thank the Conservative Party and the Reform Party for 
adopting this in their own policy conventions they held. It 
transcends partisan lines. This is not a partisan issue. This is in fact 
a Canadian issue that is right. I want all members to know that I 
have met with the finance minister and have provided him with a 
plan under which we could re-engineer existing tax credits so that 
we could fund a caregiver tax credit.
<P>
	I simply want to conclude my comments by reading a quotation 
from Dr. Benjamin Spock. He said children are made to love. 
Parents love children because they remember being loved so much 
by their own parents. Despite all the hard work, taking care of 
children and seeing them grow up to develop and become fine 
young people gives most parents their greatest satisfaction in life. 
To reflect on children, we see that this is creation. This is our 
visible immortality.
<P>
	I thank all members for speaking on behalf of the family. 
Together we will achieve benefits for families that provide care to 
their family members.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend a 
sincere compliment to the hon. member. This is the first time today 
that we have heard a speech from the opposite side that was not 
filled with bombasts and vindictiveness. That is much appreciated.
<P>
	Since he is a man who clearly espouses family values perhaps he 
would consider administering a spanking to the parliamentary 
secretary, but in a loving way. We have to avoid any suggestions of 
the brutalization of children here.
<P>
	I have no quarrel with most of his speech. I would disagree that 
our motion is not technically feasible. I ask him, if that is his view 
and it is technically feasible, if he would join us to try, with his 
knowledge, to work out something which he would regard as 
feasible which we could then bring forward at a future date, 
possibly as a private member's bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his kind 
comments.
<P>
	The member should also understand that the parliamentary 
secretary has a role to play and it is a very unfortunate role in this 
situation because the purview of the Income Tax Act belongs to the 
government, and the details. They are the ones who will have to 
determine what we do, how we do it and when we do it.
<P>
	Simply on the basis of the tradition of this place the 
parliamentary secretary on behalf of the government has to oppose 
this motion. I am opposed to this motion on the technicalities.
<P>
	If this motion does not pass that is really not of much 
consequence because Motion No. 30 did pass. Motion No. 30, the 
caregiver tax credit for those who provide care in the home for 
preschool children, the chronically ill, the aged or the disabled, was 
embraced by this House. The finance minister now has before him 
a recommendation on how to implement that. It includes among 
other things converting the child care expense deduction to a tax 
credit, making it subject to an income test and extending it to 
families that provide care in the home.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6549"> 6549 </A></B>
<P>
	That current benefit is worth about $400 million. The spousal 
non-refundable tax credit, which is available to one spouse working 
where the other one is at home, is worth about $400 million but it 
has no relevance whether or not there are children involved here. I 
believe that should be made available for this funding of a child 
caregiver credit.
<P>
	The equivalent to married exemption actually benefits families 
that split apart more than it benefits families that stay together. It is 
worth about $600 million and it should be looked at to see how we 
can re-engineer and refocus this.
<P>
	If we take these items they would be about $2.2 billion of current 
government spending or investment in Canadians. They were 
brought in a long time ago when family configurations and choices 
were clearer.
<P>
	The caregiver tax credit, including seniors, would cost according 
to the finance department only $1.6 billion. I am absolutely sure 
that we can direct real dollars to families so that they can have a tax 
break, so they can have more choices, more options, more 
flexibility. That is already before the finance minister, before my 
caucus and before those who are contemplating other policies that 
the government can consider.
<P>
	I am very confident that it is going to get the best consideration 
given all other things that are going on. I thank the member for the 
question. I think that what the Reform Party is asking for today is 
already in process and already has the support of the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened very intently to my hon. colleague's 
presentation. I certainly want to congratulate him on it. As usual he 
is very astute when it comes to families, family relationships and 
once again has portrayed that to this House. My compliments to 
him.
<P>
<B>(1330 )</B>
<P>
	We hear a great deal about the family today and we know that 
over the last number of years there have been changes to what we 
considered the traditional make-up of the family.
<P>
	However, we know that even with all the challenges that our 
young people and our students face today, there is a tremendous 
opportunity in the future with the education opportunities for our 
young people, the changes in the world of technology and their 
adaptation to those new technologies. I think it is a tremendous 
challenge and a tremendous opportunity for the youth of today to 
develop the future of this country. I believe we have a glorious 
future when I think of our young people. Quite often we hear a 
small percentage of criticism, but it is the 98 or 99 per cent of the 
young people who are going to carry the country forward into the 
future.
<P>
	I would ask my hon. colleague to comment on that in his 
perspective with regard to the family.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member makes a good point. We 
served on the health committee together and we did a study on 
preventive strategies for the good health of children.
<P>
	Members and Canadians should know that according to the very 
best research the first three years in the life of an infant are the 
most critical in terms of the probability of positive future outcomes 
of the child. In fact, the mental health of a human being is more 
than 80 per cent locked in or established by the age of 3. That is 
why parents intuitively know that they want the choice to provide 
direct parental care during those first three years. If we looked at 
the statistics we would find that the demand for child care spaces 
for ages 0 to 3 years in Canada is about 270,000 spaces but from 
ages 3 to 5 years it jumps up to 524,000 spaces. That means that 
after a child reaches the age of 3 years, more and more families feel 
they have stabilized the situation.
<P>
	The member is quite right that we must focus our attention on 
the formative years. That is when children get a good start. If we do 
that there will be a healthier outcome, lower health care costs, 
lower social program costs, lower criminal justice costs and a 
healthier country because healthy families and healthy children 
make a strong country.
<P>
	Also the finance minister said that good fiscal policy makes 
good social policy and good social policy makes good fiscal policy. 
This is very good social policy and it will make good fiscal policy 
as well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak today on this Reform motion, as it concerns 
family taxation, an issue of particular interest to me. This is not the 
first and certainly not the last time I address the issue in this House, 
because we in the Bloc Quebecois have repeatedly demanded, but 
to no avail, that the government review its taxation policy.
<P>
	Despite all the arguments put forward by the Bloc in this respect, 
the Liberal Party never followed up by reviewing its family 
taxation policy. The ruling party was careful not to do so. It would 
rather look after the interests of the wealthy. Witness its policy on 
tax shelters.
<P>
	As for the Reform motion, it purports to ensure tax fairness by 
extending the child care tax deduction to all families. There are 
several reasons why we do not support this proposal. But before 
addressing the Reform motion, I would like to share a few thoughts 
with you about the societal value of and the role played by parents, 
usually mothers, in the home.
<P>
	All experts agree that the first three years of a child's life are 
crucial to the child's development. Some psychologists contend 
they set the foundation for the rest of their lives. This goes to show 
how important these first three years and the pre-school years are, 
not only for children and their families, but also for the communi-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6550"> 6550 </A></B>
<P>
ties  they live in. In this context, there are two views to the role 
mothers should play during the first years of their children's lives.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	I would like to make it quite clear from the outset that I have no 
intention of listing the merits of both philosophies. Having said 
that, I think it is important to respect the many child care decisions 
made by parents.
<P>
	About the two philosophies, on the one hand, some say that, for 
children to develop properly, they need to be in close and constant 
contact with their mothers during the first few years of their lives. 
In their opinion, close ties between mother and child greatly benefit 
the child's development and no one could replace the mother at this 
stage.
<P>
	By contrast, others believe that a healthy and stimulating 
environment, whether in public or private child care, largely makes 
up for the absence of the mother for a few hours, and that the 
relationship between the mother and the child will not be affected, 
and neither will the harmonious development of the child.
<P>
	As I said, I have no intention of getting involved in this debate. I 
am simply stating that I respect, and so should the state, the 
decision of a woman, whether she decides to put her career on hold 
for a few years and devote her energies to raising children, or 
whether she decides to be both a mother and a worker.
<P>
	Governments should not try to influence the choices made by 
parents. On the contrary, they should support these choices and 
guarantee a degree of tax fairness to both spouses. This is what 
today's debate is all about.
<P>
	I have some reservations about the wording of the motion. I fear 
such a measure may be interpreted as an incentive for women to 
stay home. Should this be the case, it could kill the small gains 
made by women as a result of their hard-fought battle to join the 
workforce.
<P>
	When women study side by side with their male colleagues, they 
experience the same fear of failure, the same stress, the same joys, 
the same success, the same financial constraints. In short, they 
experience the same reality as male students. However, once they 
get their degrees, the picture changes. Women then start 
experiencing the subtle discrimination which, unfortunately, is still 
too common in the labour market.
<P>
	For example, during an interview, they may be asked if they are 
or intend to get married, if they have or intend to have children. 
There is no need to elaborate, we all know the story.
<P>
	The majority of male applicants are not asked such questions. If 
the female candidate answers yes to one of these questions, she is 
often immediately excluded as a potential incumbent for the 
position. Why? Maybe because employers are afraid of children. I 
do not think it  is true of all employers, of course, but there are 
enough of them to make it harder for graduate women to find work 
than it is for their male counterparts.
<P>
	Why are employers afraid of children? Because children may 
represent a loss of productivity, of efficiency, of availability, and 
perhaps a loss of money. Obviously, I am simplifying somewhat, 
but barely. When a female employee becomes pregnant, it means a 
maternity leave. It means hiring and training a replacement, and it 
also means that the woman will be less available when she returns 
to her job. A pregnancy is not necessarily welcomed by all 
employers, to say the least.
<P>
	This is what women have been battling since they first began 
pursuing their education in large numbers. As I said earlier, it was 
only after a hard fight that they obtained anti-discrimination laws 
in the area of hiring and employment. They won maternity leave 
that did not penalize them too heavily, day care centres, and tax 
regimes that take into account expenses associated with the need to 
have day care services for their children.
<P>
	Women have come a long way, and this is very good. We can pat 
ourselves on the back. However, the survival of a society depends 
of necessity on its continuation. This is a law of nature to which no 
society is immune.
<P>
	In Canada, as in Quebec, citizens and their governments have 
decided to support the presence of children in families and the 
presence of mothers in the workforce. The form this support has 
taken has been uneven and imperfect, but the support is there and I 
think there has to be a consensus.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	This is the direction that society has therefore taken and very few 
people, except perhaps representatives of the Reform Party, want to 
change the rules of the game. Everyone wins with this policy: 
children, parents and society. Women make a very important 
contribution to the workplace. And this contribution depends on 
their training and experience, as it does with their male colleagues.
<P>
	Far from harming our society, women's contribution to the 
labour force strengthens diversity. A Statistics Canada article 
published in 1994 entitled <I>Declining female labour force 
participation</I> indicated that the entry into the labour force of 
women with children at home was the most important factor in the 
increase in the female participation rate.
<P>
	Between 1981 and 1993, when the participation rate of women 
without children at home remained relatively stable at 50 per cent, 
that of women with children jumped dramatically. The 
participation rate of mothers of children under the age of six 
jumped from 47 per cent in 1981 to 65 per cent in 1993. The 
percentage of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6551"> 6551 </A></B>
<P>
women in the labour force with children between the ages of 6  and 
15 went from 61 per cent in 1981 to 75 per cent in 1993.
<P>
	In other words, working mothers are with us to stay. The job now 
is to find the best ways of helping them balance their family 
responsibilities with their contribution to the labour force. 
Governments have adopted this approach, and now they have to do 
something, because there is still a pressing need for child care 
services.
<P>
	The Child Care Advocacy Association of Canada estimated that 
in 1995, three million children needed child care, while there were 
only 365,000 recognized spaces.
<P>
	We know that in their election campaign, the Liberals promised 
to create 150,000 new child care spaces by 1996 and did nothing. 
One wonders where the money went-$700 million-that was 
supposed to be invested in child care. One wonders where that 
money is today. From what the minister said, he had no idea; it 
seems it disappeared just like that. I would like to remind the 
government of its promises in the red book.
<P>
	So we are way behind, if we compare Canada with certain 
European countries. Sweden, for instance, has government funded 
child care spaces for about 50 per cent of children under six. In 
Denmark, 85 per cent of children between the ages of three and six 
are entitled to government funded child care. In France, 25 per cent 
of children under three are in child care funded by the government.
<P>
	If we look at the percentages in Canada, we see that only 12 per 
cent of our children are in recognized child care. We know the need 
is there. I just told you that in 1993, 70 per cent of parents with 
children were on the labour market. When we see inadequate 
financing in a child care policy, we wonder how this government 
could ever implement a genuine family policy. I may remind the 
House that women have demanded and still demand adequate, 
quality child care, which is not about to happen overnight, as I just 
demonstrated.
<P>
	Would using the state's meagre financial resources to help 
families, as the motion proposes to do, not threaten the funding of 
child care services networks developed by the provinces? 
Unfortunately, I have to ask the question, but we know perfectly 
well that this government has no intention of proposing any kind of 
funding so we can really embark on a genuine family policy. So 
how can you expect the government to respond to a Reform motion 
when that same government has shamefully hidden, I do not know 
where, the $700 million which had been promised for creating 
150,000 child care spaces? I have my doubts about this 
government's political will to implement a genuine family policy.
<P>
	This motion might not have been debated today if the 
government had moved. So I think that, considering the importance 
of such a policy, the multiple needs of families and the realities 
they are facing, the government has failed to meet the expectations 
of the public.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	Now for the second reason we are against today's motion: the 
family is an area of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. The federal 
government, having gradually and stealthily encroached upon this 
field over the years, ought quite simply to pull out and transfer the 
equivalent tax points to the provinces. I am not saying abolish the 
funding, I am saying transfer it. There is a difference. I do not want 
people accusing me of not wanting a family policy, because I am 
calling for it to be transferred. There is a difference.
<P>
	We know, for example, that at the end of the summit on the 
economy and employment, Quebec announced the implementation 
of a parental leave plan. This is a measure designed to broaden 
Quebec men and women's access to parental leave. This 
government should transfer tax points so as to contribute to the 
efforts made by a province-Quebec, in this case, but it could be 
another province-to implement a real policy to facilitate access to 
parental leave.
<P>
	I would like to see this government distribute funds to the 
provinces in order to enable them to implement a true family 
policy. The Government of Quebec is calling for the transfer of a 
portion of the unemployment insurance fund. We know very well 
that it is destined to pay off the federal deficit, while the provinces 
will be required to provide more and more of the services the 
public is demanding.
<P>
	In the same vein, it is important, within the spirit of 
decentralization so dear to the Liberals-in lip service at least, but 
we have yet to see it in action-that all tax points corresponding to 
fiscal and financial measures for families be transferred to the 
provinces. They are the ones in the best position to judge what 
policies are necessary for the development of society. I believe that 
we will continue to demand such transfers from the federal 
government, and we know that this trend is spreading to the other 
provinces.
<P>
	We are well aware at this time, with all the cuts to the Canada 
social transfer, that this is another way of preventing the provinces 
from providing a true family policy. The least well off families will 
be the first to be penalized by cuts in education, in welfare, in 
health. I hope that, one day, the federal government will give in to 
the demands from the provinces.
<P>
	Finally, the third reason behind our rejection of the motion is that 
its universality is a thing of the past. It is unacceptable in a society 
that boasts of wanting to redistribute the collective wealth. In the 
present context, the families with the greatest need have to be 
helped.
<P>
	According to the Reform motion, the tax credit would be the 
same for all families according to revenue. If we were in fact in a 
period of wealth, as we have been in the past, as the federal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6552"> 6552 </A></B>
<P>
government has already stated, if the government had all this 
money at its disposal, we might have to consider it.
<P>
	However, at the moment, when the government cannot even 
provide a day care policy, how can it expect to provide a policy on 
tax credits for women who have decided to stay home to look after 
their children?
<P>
	I would like ask the government for the umpteenth time to think 
about ways to recognize the work women do at home. These 
women play an important social role and are totally ignored by this 
government. This is why the government must once again review 
investments so that, for once, there will be specific measures to 
ensure that families may count on government assistance.
<P>
	It is high time the federal government recognized the fair 
contribution of all citizens whatever their role in building Quebec 
and Canadian society. I remind the government of the importance 
of balance in all its policies, and I invite it to very carefully follow 
its plan for balance between the sexes to analyze the impact of 
current tax measures on families in Quebec and Canada.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois favours a tax system that ensures equal 
opportunities for disadvantaged children. This should go even 
further, but we have to take the current state of the economy into 
consideration. The Bloc Quebecois favours tax policy that takes 
account of family needs and of the families with the greatest need. 
The proposal by the Reform Party does not do so, because it would 
apply to all families including those in the high income bracket.
<P>
	We would like the government to consider a real family policy. 
In my opinion, what we have before us as family policy is nothing. 
Fewer and fewer families can count on support from this 
government. The wording of this motion is unacceptable. I propose 
to the government that it give some thought to a real family policy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome the member's comments on debate. I recall that she spoke 
on Bill C-256 with respect to splitting income between spouses and 
made a very similar speech, arguing on behalf of the women who 
want to have careers.
<P>
	I would like to mention another point that I failed to mention in 
my speech. This motion comes on an allotted day, under supply in 
the estimates, and therefore constitutes a motion of non-confidence 
in the government. On that basis alone the Reform Party probably 
should have realized that this motion must be defeated. However, I 
thank members of the Reform Party for raising the issue because it 
gives members a chance to talk about the family.
<P>
	The issue that the hon. member for Quebec raises with regard to 
family policy and child care policy are very important. I believe all 
members would agree. However, in the province of Ontario the 
average income of a trained child caregiver in a day care centre is 
about $19,000 a year. That is absolutely obscene when we consider 
what is expected of those trained people. As a result of that, the 
turnover in the child care industry is extremely high. That says to 
me that the security and the consistency of the bonding of a child 
with an adult during the period of institutionalized care is not as 
good as it would be with a parent. A person could probably make 
$19,000 a year working at McDonald's.
<P>
	I do not believe that anyone is suggesting, and I hope the 
member is not suggesting, that there has to be one model and that 
women must work. I hope the member agrees that we have a 
complex society and complex family structures. We need 
flexibility and options more than anything else. If there is a choice, 
we should let the families, not the women, but the parents make the 
choice.
<P>
	The member continues to talk from the perspective of women. I 
respect that. However, as members of Parliament we must speak on 
behalf of families and the parents who are trying to make choices.
<P>
	The member well knows that under the current Income Tax Act 
the lower income spouse must claim the child care expense 
deduction. That usually means that the net take home pay after 
taxes, child care expenses and the cost of employment is so small 
that it is less than $100 a week. That is one of the reasons we have 
to make an effort to reform the tax system in order to help bridge 
that gap so that the decision is not financial, but a decision based on 
a family value, on a societal value and on a parental value.
<P>
	Would the member at least concede that the important thing is 
what the parents want to choose for their children? Should we as 
legislators try to provide those options, those choices and that 
flexibility so that they can provide the care arrangement which they 
feel best fits their family and social values?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon (Québec):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
his question. He is in a better position that I am; he is a government 
member. He should get his government to act on the decisions 
made in terms of family policy.
<P>
	The advantage is yours, dear colleague, and I urge you to talk to 
your government to ensure that women can choose between staying 
at home to care for their children or joining the labour force.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	You are in the best position to do that.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6553"> 6553 </A></B>
<P>
	I realize that, ideally, the decision should not be made on a 
financial basis. There is also a need to give women the opportunity 
to achieve their full potential through employment. And this is no 
easy task nowadays. Many women are facing divorce. We know 
very well how hard it is for women who are returning to work.
<P>
	In this respect, I would like to say a word about a policy put in 
place by this government with its new employment insurance plan 
that will penalize any woman who has been away from the labour 
market for any length of time. Women will be required to work 
many hours to qualify for benefits under the new Employment 
Insurance Act. We all know that the magic number is 910 hours of 
work, just to qualify for benefits under the new employment 
insurance policy.
<P>
	I could go on for hours about some government policies that do 
not necessarily help women decide whether to stay at home to raise 
their children or to re-enter the workforce. Start by implementing 
real, equitable measures for women, then raise the issue again for 
discussion.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I will give you half a minute.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member just raised the issue of 
doing nothing for women. In fact, if the member would look, she 
would find under the new EI program wage subsidies and training 
allowances that allow parents who take parental leave to get back 
into the workforce.
<P>
	I ask the member again if she would not concede that the 
important element of any strategy dealing with families is to 
provide choice, flexibility and options for families and not to deal 
with it on any basis other than what is the choice and the value of 
the family and parents.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon (Québec):</B> Again, Mr. Speaker, we know about 
the policy that was put in place and how flawed it is. We know full 
well that this requirement will exclude community organizations 
and that employment must be ensured.
<P>
	Do not come and tell me that measures are being introduced to 
help women decide whether to stay at home to raise their children 
or to join the labour force. I suggest my hon. colleague press his 
government to put in place real measures to help families.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> As it is about 2 p.m., we will now proceed to 
Statements by Members.

story which shows that Canadians do care for those who suffer 
misfortune.
<P>
	The following story appeared in the London <I>Free Press</I>. Elaine 
Pomajba received an emergency liver transplant from the Lung and 
Health Sciences Centre's multiple organ transplant service which 
saved her life. In gratitude, Ms. Pomajba decided to donate the 
proceeds from selling her prize steer at the Royal Agricultural 
Winter Fair.
<P>
	Before selling the steer, the auctioneer recounted her story. 
Buyers then bought and sold the same steer seven times. Manuel 
Taveres of Dominion Meat started the process and it snowballed 
from there. Other buyers included Norwich Packers in the riding of 
Oxford; St. Helen's Meat Packers, Expedite Plus, MCI Packers and 
Longos Brothers who donated the meat to University Hospital. 
Elaine Pomajba donated a total of $13,776 to the transplant centre.

<P>
	The Quebec government has been negotiating for several months

federal government, it remains silent on this issue. I am asking the 
government to review, with diligence and compassion, the plight of 
these 800 workers, whose future depends, in many cases, on their 
being retrained. Current negotiations would also be easier if 
Ottawa showed some openness and specified how Kenworth can

government's treatment of former Liberal cabinet minister John 
Munro.
<P>
	In 1991 Mr. Munro was acquitted of charges of corruption, 
charges based on allegations that arose while he was a minister of 
the crown. The defence of his reputation cost Mr. Munro 
approximately $1 million in legal and related fees. Mr. Munro 
requested that the government pay his legal fees which would be 
consistent with previous policy and practice. In 1996, five years 
after he was acquitted, the government rejected his request for 
compensation.
<P>
	In law Mr. Munro is innocent. Yet he has been impoverished 
because of the unsubstantiated allegations with respect to his 
conduct while a Liberal cabinet minister. In fairness the Minister of 
Justice should reconsider the decision to deny compensation to Mr. 
Munro or at the very least explain why compensation has been 
denied.

aboriginal people that he wanted  ``aboriginal issues to be front and

chance to do it.

	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to emphasize for my parliamentary colleagues the importance of 
mining to Canada's economy.
<P>
	In 1995 the metals and minerals sector accounted for $23 billion 
worth of economic activity, an amount equal to 4.4 per cent of 
Canada's gross domestic product. These numbers represent 
340,000 high quality, high paying jobs of the future. Indeed, over 
85 per cent of those working in the mining industry use advanced 
technology every day.
<P>
	Mining pays a higher average wage than any other industrial 
sector in Canada and these are not seasonal but year-round jobs.
<P>
	I applaud all those who are working to promote mining in 
Canada, including the mining industry representatives and labour 
we saw this week, as well as the Minister of Natural Resources.
<P>
	I look forward to continuing my work with this industry,

	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Liberals are pushing copyright legislation through this House in 
their usual ramrod way. Bill C-32 is before committee as we speak. 
We have had 190 briefs and 65 witnesses in eight weeks. It is called 
legislation by exhaustion.
<P>
	The Liberals want to charge a blank tape levy on audio tapes that 
will hit churches, schools and their shut-in supporters. Why? 
Because some tapes happen to be used to copy music. This is tape 
tax.
<P>
	The Liberals will not protect broadcasters in Canada from 
vexatious charges by composers and performers for the technical 
transfer of music but will hit those same broadcasters with new 
performance levies. This is called a performance tax.
<P>
	However, to show how rushed this flawed copyright bill is and 
the lack of prior consultation, consider the archivists and people 
wanting to trace their geneology. Unbelievably, the Liberal 
legislation would slam the door on tracing family trees and 
reviewing property documents. This is typical Liberal legislation,

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, after more than five years of hearings, including a two 
year extension under the present government, and $58 million of 
the public's money, the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples 
has just tabled a voluminous report of over 4,000 pages on the 
situation of native peoples in Canada.
<P>
	My question is for the minister of Indian affairs. Does he agree 
with the royal commission that the solution to aboriginal problems 
lies in a royal proclamation followed by a series of legislative 
measures by the federal government?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the royal commission tabled a 
few hours ago a voluminous series  of reports involving 440 
recommendations, covering everything from housing to royal 
proclamations. It involves just about every ministry in the federal 
government and probably every minister of the provincial and 
territorial governments.
<P>
	The royal proclamation is something that the premiers of the 
provinces, the Prime Minister and the First Nations will have to 
discuss. They will need time to read the report and come up with 
whatever recommendations they see fit.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, since a good many aboriginal problems come under 
provincial jurisdiction, how does the minister of Indian affairs 
intend to proceed in order to respect this jurisdiction, bearing in 
mind the recommendations of the Dussault-Erasmus report with its 
extremely centralizing approach?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the commissioners and the 
commission make it quite clear that on many aspects of the report it 
will need co-operation of the provinces and territories and the 
federal government.
<P>
	There are only 89 recommendations where they say the federal 
government has the direct right to implementation. In the 
overwhelming majority, I think over 200, they are saying it will 
require consultation with the provinces, sometimes cities and 
sometimes territories.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my supplementary is for the Minister of Finance.
<P>

Dussault-Erasmus report to increase the Indian Affairs budget by 
some $2 billion in order to solve aboriginal problems strikes him as 
acceptable and realistic?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
pardon me, but I have such faith in my colleague, and he is so 
familiar with the numbers, that my attention was elsewhere. As my 
colleague has just said, the report is very interesting. We intend to 
examine it more closely and I will discuss it with my colleague, the 
minister of Indian affairs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Indian Affairs.
<P>
	Although the Bloc Quebecois is in favour of aboriginal 
self-government and the economic development of the aboriginal 
community, the creation of a third tier of government, as called for 
by the royal commission, strikes us as unrealistic.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Indian Affairs share the conclusions of the 
royal commission, which proposes an aboriginal chamber within 
the Canadian Parliament?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is a matter of evolution. I 
certainly feel that the AFN powers should be enhanced by First 
Nations people. We are certainly trying to deal in the provinces of 
Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Nova Scotia with larger groupings. 
At some point that may evolve. How or where, it is too soon to say 
but there will be a separate chamber for aboriginal self-government 
in this country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, I see that 
the minister is not only distancing himself from the report but also 
being extremely prudent with his answers.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that the Dussault-Erasmus report 
proposal, in addition to creating some twenty new organizations on 
top of all the existing ones, will require an injection of more than 
$2 billion in public funds and accentuate one of the fundamental 
problems of Canadian federalism, namely the problem of costly 
and inefficient duplication and overlap?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the question is, will there be 
duplication or overlap? Who can say? I would prefer that there be 
less duplication and less overlap.
<P>
	If we truly mean that we want aboriginal people to be 
self-sufficient and self-governing, then we have to trust them and 
let them do it. As the Prime Minister said when he had this job, we 
made a lot of mistakes on their  behalf through the Indian agents. It 
is time for them to make a few mistakes on their own.

<P>
	The Minister of Health said a few weeks ago that we should vote 
for a party other than the Liberals if they failed to get their tobacco 
control legislation passed before the next election. So, yesterday 
once again, the minister put off the official announcement of the 
tobacco control measures he plans to propose.
<P>
	How does the Minister of Health explain his last minute retreat? 
Could it have anything to do with the numerous leaks about a 
possible increase in the price of cigarettes, resulting in speculation 
in the tobacco market?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I think the House would really like to know where the hon. member 
stands and in particular where the Bloc stands as it relates to 
tobacco legislation.
<P>
	As I indicated yesterday both in the House and outside the 
House, we are in the process of finalizing our package. It will be 
comprehensive and we will bring it forward soon.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we see a lot 
of smoke signals, but the message is unclear.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that he struck out again, because he has 
very awkwardly placed the Minister of Finance in an absolutely 
untenable position? Does he realize that?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I accept the premise of the hon. member's question that he is 
concerned about tobacco legislation. I would hope that the hon. 
member and members of the Bloc would support the government's 
initiative which is to reduce tobacco consumption particularly 
among youth which causes in this country and in the province of 
Quebec 11,000 deaths every year.
<P>
	I look forward to and thank the hon. member for his support on 
the tobacco legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
leak of the government's tobacco taxation measure is an extremely 
serious breach of parliamentary convention. When tax changes are 
leaked, insiders are given the ability to manipulate the stock 
market. In the past the Liberals have called for the resignation of 
other finance ministers over similar breaches. This is of particular 
concern when it is clear that the boards of directors of tobacco 
companies are interchangeable with the Liberal Party hierarchy.
<P>
	Can the finance minister tell us why this tax measure was leaked, 
who leaked it, and what action he has taken to ensure that the 
financial integrity of the government is not compromised again?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member, as is his wont, is engaging in idle speculation. 
The government will make an announcement when there is an 
announcement to be made.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Liberal ties to the big tobacco industry are well known. Yesterday's 
actions by the government made it clear that it puts its friends in 
tobacco above the health of young Canadians. How ironic that 
yesterday was National Child Day. The finance minister needs to 
explain to Canadians why he and his government have sacrificed 
the health of our children so that his friends in the tobacco industry 
are appeased.
<P>
	Is this legislation being blocked by the finance minister, a former 
director of Imasco?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
both the substance and the tone of the question are inappropriate.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	In its analysis of corporate taxation presented this week, the Bloc 
suggested abolishing the partial capital gains exemption for 
businesses and using the money, which represents nearly one half 
billion dollars annually, to offer small businesses a tax rebate tied 
to their job creation performance.
<P>
	If the Minister of Finance wants to demonstrate his concern for 
fairness and job creation, is he prepared to make a commitment 
before this House to eliminate this useless expenditure 
immediately and allocate the money saved to tax measures that will 
promote employment?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, as 
a member of the Standing Committee on Finance, the hon. member 
must be aware that this committee looked into the matter a few 
years ago, and at the time, the government made a survey of small 
businesses in Canada to find out whether the $500,000 exemption 
was helpful in creating jobs, or whether we should find another 
way.
<P>
	All small business associations in Canada, including those in 
Quebec, and most small businesses that appeared before the

<HR>
<B><A NAME="6560"> 6560 </A></B>
<P>
Standing Committee on Finance or met with  government officials 
said that this exemption was crucial to maintain fairness, and is still 
crucial for creating jobs, and that is our position.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am afraid I was misunderstood. I was not referring to the 
capital gains exemption on the first $500,000 but the partial 
inclusion of capital gains which consists in taxing only 75 per cent 
of capital gains and leaving the remaining 25 per cent fully tax 
exempt.
<P>
	The minister referred to the Standing Committee on Finance. So 
far, at the hearings we had in June, July and August, the conclusion 
was unanimous: this measure is a very costly one, and there is no 
good reason for keeping it. When even the Canadian Bankers' 
Association wants to see it abolished, that certainly means 
something. So we have $500 million annually that is absolutely 
nothing. The purpose of this measure was to avoid double taxation 
where there was a wealth tax. Today, the government takes $500 
million and just throws it away, especially in the pockets of the 
wealthiest in this country.
<P>
	Will the minister promise to eliminate this unnecessary tax 
expenditure and allocate $500 million annually to job creation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
once again, the hon. member is wrong. We have analyzed the 
situation. The vast majority of small companies in the high-tech 
sector, a very important industry in Quebec, have told us that to 
increase their equity, to raise capital, it was very important to have 
access to research and development credits.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No, no.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (LaSalle-Émard):</B> Yes, yes. Capital gains are 
used to raise money. Unfortunately, the hon. member does not 
understand. In fact, I can tell you that people with the FTQ 
solidarity funds said they agreed with this exemption because it 
helped them raise money.

deal with poverty, with schools, with roads, with social assistance, 
with economic development, and this member's idea of equality is 
to send $10,000 to each Indian in this country. I just heard him on 
television. That is his policy which I have waited three years to 
hear. If we do that, then who is going to deal with the poverty? Who 
is going to build the hospitals? If that is his idea of equality, then 
the Reform Party should go out there and talk to a few Indians.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this morning on television the minister of Indian affairs 
could not answer this simple question: Are aboriginal people 
equal?
<P>
	Will the minister promise Canadians that none of the royal 
commission's recommendations will be implemented unless they 
can pass the test of equality?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, for this hon. member I will 
answer that question.
<P>
	The idea of the Reform Party on Indians and equality is to keep 
them poor, keep them uneducated and keep them on the reserves. I 
have heard the idea of the Reform Party for three years. It thinks 
Indians live in paradise. The member who is grinning stood in this 
House and said that he knows that aboriginal men burn their wives 
with cigarettes. That is ignorance. I do not think anybody in this 
country accepts that.
<P>
	When the leader of the Reform says that Canadians are not 
hearing the message of the Reform, they are hearing it and they do 
not like it. That is why Reform is sinking.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a few minutes ago I asked the Minister of Finance a 
question. However, either my explanations were not sufficiently 
clear, or the minister was a bit mixed up, so I would like to try 
again. 
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6561"> 6561 </A></B>
<P>
	There has been partial inclusion of capital gains since 1987; 75 
per cent of the capital gain is taxed at the corporate tax rate; 25 per 
cent of this capital gain, which is income like any other income, is 
completely tax exempt. This 25 per cent is placed in a capital 
dividend account and paid to shareholders, not reinvested.
<P>
	Since there is general agreement in Quebec, and in Canada, that 
this partial inclusion of capital gains must  be eliminated, that it is 
costing $400 to $500 million a year that other taxpayers must pay, 
will the minister undertake to eliminate it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the answer to the question is exactly the same one I gave earlier. It 
is part of the refundable tax credit. Capital gains exemptions make 
it possible for our companies to raise capital and benefit Canadian 
shareholders. This is an advantage they have over a company that 
must borrow money and pay interest, for example, or an American 
company that must raise capital in the United States, but is looking 
for Canadian investors.
<P>
	What we want to do is encourage investment in Canada. That is 
part of a sound system. If we make changes here, other changes 
will have to be made somewhere else. The fundamental question is 
how we are going to help Canadian companies increase their 
equity. That is part of the system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when a Quebecer or a Canadian earns a dollar, the whole 
dollar is taxed, all of it, at a rate that can go as high as, or higher 
than, 40 per cent. When a rich shareholder, a rich corporation 
holding shares that appreciate in value year after year, is taxed, it is 
taxed on only three quarters of the amount at a reduced rate, not the 
full 100 per cent.
<P>
	How is it justified that 25 per cent of this capital gain is handed 
back in this ineffective and unproductive manner to the richest 
holders of Canadian capital, who do not reinvest in the economy, 
when the rest of the population must pay the full amount?
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the member does not seem to understand that we have an equity 
problem in Canada. We are having difficulties in Canada compared 
to other countries. Our SMEs, our Canadian companies, are having 
trouble raising money to establish an equity base they can use for 
lending, investing and creating jobs.
<P>
	There are exemptions for political reasons, for creating jobs or 
investing in the future. This is what we are talking about. It is part 
of a sound system. We can change it, but if we do, there will be 
repercussions elsewhere.
<P>
	Furthermore, there are many incentives in Quebec, and at the 
summit the government decided to keep them for exactly the same 
reason: to create jobs and stimulate economic growth.

<P>
	The R and D stakeholders that I met across western Canada as 
part of the Prime Minister's task force on commercializing 
government science research made it absolutely clear that 
effective, public-private R and D partnerships in strategic sectors 
of our economy are critical to enhancing Canada's

<P>
	How will the investment announced yesterday benefit Canadians 
in British Columbia, in the west and throughout the country with 
Ballard Power Systems, the environmental technology company in 
Burnaby?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jon Gerrard (Secretary of State (Science, Research and 
Development)(Western Economic Diversification), Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for her question.
<P>
	The government believes in developing new technologies in 
Canada and building the industries of the future in these new 
technologies. One of these new technologies is fuel cells which 
produce electricity in an environmentally friendly way from 
hydrogen and oxygen. Ballard Power Systems is a company which 
holds 83 world leading patents in this area, providing an advantage 
to Canada.
<P>
	The investment yesterday of $30 million through Technology 
Partnerships Canada in Ballard Power Systems provides an 
example of how the government is working in partnership with the 
private sector to create jobs and industries in Canada.

	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Liberals have pulled a CF-18 flip-flop. In 
opposition they criticized the tendering process. When they are in 
power they have a chance to right a wrong and they refuse to do it. 
Like the Tories they awarded Bombardier an untendered $216 
million contract. John Turner opposed it. Brian Tobin opposed it. 
The current foreign affairs minister opposed it. The current health 
minister opposed it.
<P>
	How can the Minister of National Defence justify this shameful 
Liberal flip-flop giving Bombardier an untendered $216 million 
contract?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the extension of 
the contract for the maintenance of the CF-18s was done in June.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6562"> 6562 </A></B>
<P>
	However, there is one thing about which I want to make certain. 
As we pursue this line of questioning, which is interesting, I want 
to make certain that I understand the position of my friends in the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	Very recently three contracts for Hercules were awarded to CAE 
of Edmonton, Alberta, totalling $108 million. It was done on the 
same basis. Very recently Computing Devices Canada was awarded 
a contract for the land forces communications system on the same 
basis. It is worth $90 million.
<P>
	I want to know if it is a question of cherry picking, a question of 
principle or do they know the difference between the two.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
The principle, Mr. Speaker, is quite simple. It is value for money. It 
is taxpayers' money.
<P>
	The only way to ensure that Canadians get value for money is to 
put contracts out to tender. If Bombardier is the best, it will win. 
Even the Tories put the contract out to tender before they rigged it.
<P>
	The minister keeps talking about keeping the costs down. If the 
minister cares about keeping the costs down, then why did his 
department fail to conduct a review of the contract before handing 
it to Bombardier? They did not even review the contract.
<P>
<B>(1445 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a very thorough 
review of the situation is required when a contract like this is 
extended. It was the third or fourth contract extension since the 
original competed contract was awarded.
<P>
	The important thing is that even the hon. member in conducting 
a review himself or anyone who was interested, would know that 
Canadair is the only company in Canada at this time equipped to do 
this kind of work.
<P>
	There are a number of directed contracts. What I want the hon. 
member to do is to make sure he addresses the question of the 
Hercules contract in Edmonton and also the contract that I referred 
to earlier for CAE. Is it just a question of trying to pick the divisive 
kind of elements which the hon. member likes to raise from time to 
time? Is it a question of principle or is speaking of principles in 
matters like this with the Reform Party like talking to an alley cat 
about a marriage licence?

	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday in the official languages committee, the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage stated that there was no assimilation of 
francophones outside Quebec, despite all of the statistical evidence 
to the contrary.
<P>
	If assimilation does not exist, as the minister claims, what 
explanation is there for the fact that, since the adoption of the 
Official Languages Act in 1969, the percentage of francophones 
now using English in the home has risen from 15 to 24 per cent in 
Ottawa, from 55 to 65 per cent in Hamilton, from 17 to 30 per cent 
in Sudbury, and from 42 to 52 per cent in Winnipeg and St. 
Boniface?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, what the hon. member 
refuses to consider is that, at the present time, our young 
francophone and anglophone Canadians are the most bilingual 
generation in the history of Canada.
<P>
	It is equally true-another fact he denied yesterday-that, 
according to Statistics Canada, up to 99 per cent of francophones 
outside Quebec who wish to study in French are able to do so, 
precisely because of the constitutional and official languages 
policies.
<P>
	Yes, the statistics were based on francophones outside Quebec, 
despite the hon. member's false allegation that they included 
francophones in Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, is 
the attitude of the Minister of Canadian Heritage not an 
embarrassment to the government? She, despite being the person 
responsible for the application of the Official Languages Act, is 
just about the only one left refusing to see that the assimilation of 
francophones outside Quebec continues to progress in leaps and 
bounds.
<P>
	Why does the minister persist in denying such evidence?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member really 
wants to combat the problem of anglicization across Canada, he 
ought to talk to his Quebec colleague, the Minister of Education, 
who has just raised by 70 per cent tuition fees for francophones 
from the rest of Canada wishing to study in Quebec. If the hon.

in Canada, he should talk to his friend, Mrs. Marois, and tell her to

	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr.

have to be changed and there are the large annual costs of 
advertising, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6563"> 6563 </A></B>

ticketing, warehousing and distribution. All these costs will be 
passed on to already overtaxed consumers.
<P>
	Will the minister stop this new burden on consumers in Atlantic 
Canada by withdrawing the required tax in pricing until the federal 
sales tax is implemented nationwide? It is a request made by 
Canadian retailers and strongly supported by the Reform Party.
<P>
<B>(1450 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
the hon. member knows, the vast majority of retailers have already 
incurred the costs of transition. That occurred some time ago when 
the previous government brought in the GST. Therefore, the costs 
of transition are quite within the bounds of acceptability.
<P>
	The ministers of finance of the three Atlantic provinces have 
agreed to meet with all of the retailers-in fact, that is happening at 
this very moment-to work out any difficulties which any retailer 
may have. The provincial governments and the federal government 
have said to those retailers that we would be quite flexible in 
making sure that the transition costs are manageable.
<P>
	Now that those retailers can take the input tax credits there has 
been a substantial reduction in their costs which we expect will be 
passed on to the consumer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, different information is coming from the retailers of 
Canada to us and to the minister.
<P>
	The tax-in pricing policy was recommended by the Reform Party 
in its minority report on GST reform, but only in the context of a 
nationwide introduction of a federal sales tax. Reform, as well as 
national retailers, oppose tax in-pricing when it is applied only in 
Atlantic Canada because it costs too much and has already caused 
the closing of some retail outlets.
<P>
	Will the minister stop trying to download on consumers in 
Atlantic Canada the costs of his party's indefensible, irresponsible 
and politically opportunistic election promise to eliminate the 
GST? Do the right thing and scrap the federal sales tax for Atlantic 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would suggest that my friend is in the process of engaging in a little 
historic revisionism of what the Reform Party's position has been 
on this issue.
<P>
	The Reform Party has supported harmonization publicly, not 
necessarily in the House, and it has also supported tax inclusive 
pricing. I congratulate the Reform Party for that. It is unfortunate 
that it now, for political purposes, chooses to forget its original 
position.
<P>
	The hon. member knows full well that this will lead to a 
substantial reduction in costs for retailers. There will be a 
substantial reduction in costs for consumers.
<P>
	For the sake of discussion, take a look at Newfoundland, where 
the reduction is between 4 per cent  and 5 per cent. In Nova Scotia 
and New Brunswick it is between a 3 per cent and a 4 per cent 
reduction on the vast majority of goods, all of those which were 
previously covered by the GST. In fact, this is very good for the 
consumer.

	The Atlantic groundfish strategy, otherwise known as TAGS, is 
off the rails and now we know why. This week we learned that the 
qualifying rules for TAGS had been ignored and each regional

According to an internal department audit, and I quote from that 
audit: ``The ignoring of these rules was one of the reasons for 
excessive cost over-runs''.

deny benefits to legitimate fishermen who really need them?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a little late. 
The TAGS program was announced in 1994 and it has already 
almost spent its entire $1.9 billion.
<P>
	The minister of fisheries is also culpable in this Atlantic 
Canadian tragedy. The audit revealed that one-third of the licence 
buyouts by his department, some of which could amount to 
hundreds of thousands of dollars, are unsupported by 
documentation. Only Quebec files were found to be in order.
<P>
	This grotesque display of incompetence cost millions of dollars 
in over-runs and legitimate fishermen are being denied benefits as a 
result.

backfired in his face?

	A federal-provincial meeting is taking place in Toronto. Our 
government is sitting down with the provinces to discuss how we 
can build a national child benefit and how we can build it together. 
We are talking about how to align our programs and services so that 
we can do the most to help children living in poverty.
<P>
	The idea for this initiative has been around for a long time. It was 
discussed during the federal social security reform. More recently, 
the issue of a national integrated child benefit was raised in the 
ministerial council report last March.
<P>
<B>(1505)</B>
<P>
	Our government responded favourably. It became a shared 
commitment of both levels of government at the first ministers 
meeting in June. Alberta is the co-chair on behalf of the provinces 
while the Minister of Human Resources Development is 
co-chairing on behalf of the federal government.
<P>
	This is an example of the federal government's renewing 
federalism and renewing our social union by working with the 
provinces. It offers so much more than hollow calls for unilateral 
tax policy changes that would only stand to benefit those families 
that already have a measure of security, middle to upper class 
income families.
<P>
	The government, on the other hand, is concerned with the plight 
of low income families, in particular their children. At a time of 
limited finances, this is the direction Canadians are telling us we 
should go. Nine out of every ten Canadians say that the level of 
child poverty in this country is a problem. They also tell us they do 
not want to return to programs that treat rich and poor families 
alike. If public money is going to be spent, they want it to go where 
it will meet the real needs. That will be the point of a national child 
benefit.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6566"> 6566 </A></B>
<P>
	A national child benefit is something for the future. But what of 
the present? How is this government addressing the needs of 
parents and children?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In our opinion, the best way to fight child poverty is to help the 
parents find work. I would point out simply that nearly 500,000 
people have found work since our government's election.
<P>
	In fact, between 1993 and 1995, Canada created more jobs than 
Japan, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Spain combined. 
This is a pretty impressive result, and it benefits our children.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We recognize that many Canadians work at jobs that offer 
relatively low pay. These are people who benefit from the child tax 
benefit and the working income supplement. I remind members 
that our government doubled the maximum level of working 
income supplement in the last budget. Over the next two years it 
will go up from $500 to $1,000. That means more financial help for 
low income parents to address the extra costs of working.
<P>
	Helping Canadians get back to work is also the goal of the new 
employment insurance system. Despite the criticisms of the third 
party in this place we succeeded in passing legislation a few 
months ago to build a new system. The key is a set of active 
employment measures to help people get the skills they need to 
find new jobs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Another element of employment insurance that benefits the 
family and children is the new family income supplement, which 
comes into effect in January. It will be available to families eligible 
for the child tax benefit and the earned income supplement.
<P>
	These families will receive an average of $800 a year, and the 
children will be the first to benefit.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	More than that, EI claimants who get the family income 
supplement will be exempt from the new intensity rule that would 
reduce the benefit levels of repeat claims. This is yet another step 
that reflects the interests of children in lower income families.
<P>
	Active measures under EI part II will also help Canadians 
develop the skills they need to build stronger careers. Other 
measures include grants and loans to students. Here again we have 
targeted our assistance.
<P>
	We recognize that parents can find it very difficult to pursue full 
time studies. Last year we introduced a system of grants for part 
time students with high financial needs, many of whom are single 
parents. In the 1995-96 year we started a process that offers as 
many as 10,000 of these students each year up to $1,200 for every 
academic year of enrolment. This support will help them get the  
education that will enable them and their families to prosper.
<P>
	I will address the issue of child care. A year ago the federal 
government presented a proposal to provinces to expand child care 
as was outlined in the red book. Although provinces recognize the 
importance of child care to working parents, there was no 
consensus on the need to significantly expand child care. The 
federal government remains committed to further discussions on 
child care if provinces and territories can reach a consensus on an 
approach. However, that has not stopped us from taking action 
where we can.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	For example, our government launched the First Nations/Inuit 
child care initiative last December. The goal is to bring the quality 
and quantity of child care services in aboriginal communities in 
line with those of the general population. The result will be some 
4,300 new child care spaces and the improvement of 1,700 existing 
spaces for a total of 6,000 quality child care spaces. This involves 
an investment of $72 million over the first three years of the 
program.
<P>
	Another example is our child care visions program. This is a 
research and development fund. It supports studies to help us learn 
more about the adequacy, outcomes and cost effectiveness of 
different child care practices. In a world where many parents have 
no realistic choice but to work, despite nostalgic notions promoted 
by the Reform Party, this program helps us learn what kinds of 
child care will be best for our little ones.
<P>
	Then there are the other joint projects that our government has 
funded under the strategic initiatives program. For example, 
thousands of families with young children are benefiting under an 
improved access to child care project in British Columbia. In 
Manitoba about 400 lone parents on social assistance are getting 
help to put them into the workplace. Federal support for Quebec's 
APPORT program is supporting 27,000 low income wage earners 
and social assistance recipients.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In all these cases, the children benefit when their parents have 
better job opportunities and extra help for quality child care 
services. In all these cases, however, the benefit flows from 
co-operation between the federal government and the provinces.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Yesterday on national child day we paid special attention to the 
needs of children. What better way to help children in need than by 
continuing the commitment to co-operation and action that our 
government is showing?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask  the 
hon. member, since she has raised again for the umpteenth time 
today the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6567"> 6567 </A></B>
<P>
chestnut that our tax proposals would benefit the well to do rather 
than the poor, how she would equate that with the numbers which 
we have run past independent analysts who say that 737,000 
Canadians who should not be paying taxes now would disappear 
completely from the tax rolls if our proposals were adopted.
<P>
	The analysts state that a working parent in a single parent 
environment earning $30,000 would see his or her taxes reduced by 
89 per cent. I wonder if she has actually taken the time to sit down 
and read our proposals and, more to the point, if she has read any of 
the independent analyses of them.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Whelan:</B> Mr. Speaker, the motion under debate proposes 
that the government should provide tax fairness for all Canadian 
families by extending the child care tax deduction to all families of 
all income levels and converting it to a credit, thereby removing the 
tax bias against parents caring for their own children.
<P>
	At first blush it might appear it is a good idea but after all, 
Canada's children are our future and one of our most important 
resources. Who can honestly say they would oppose-not me of 
all-that we need to come up with something for children?
<P>
	However, let us take a look and really examine the Reform 
Party's motion, which I have done. If we think about this motion 
we will note the proposal could mean two radically different things. 
First, if the Reform Party plans to convert the existing child care 
credit deduction into its equivalent value in tax credits it will 
provide about $850 for every child under seven years of age and 
$150 for every child between seven and twelve years of age. If this 
is what the Reform Party is proposing, it is far from clear that is 
what it means, given the clever wording used in the motion. This 
motion would hardly provide sufficient incentive or compensation 
to allow one parent to remain home and care for their children. As 
well, it would not provide much assistance to any families, 
especially low income families.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	On the other hand, if the Reform Party plan is to give $5,000 tax 
credit for every child under seven and a $3,000 tax credit for every 
child between seven and twelve years of age, then this program 
would provide substantial assistance. Unfortunately it would also 
break the bank.
<P>
	In Canada today there are 2,402,027 children age seven to 
twelve. At a cost of $3,000 per child the proposal would cost $7.2 
billion. As well, there are 2,789,995 children under the age of 
seven. At a cost of $5,000 per child the proposal would cost another 
$14 billion. In total this proposal if implemented would cost $21.2 
billion.
<P>
	The existing child care tax credit cost $305 million in 1989. This 
means the proposal would cost $20.9 billion more than the present 
child care tax deduction. I would like to know where this $20.9 
billion will come from.
<P>
	I suppose the Reform Party could double the GST in theory. That 
would raise another $18 billion. It could cut off federal transfers for 
health care. That would raise close to the $20 billion, although the 
money would of course go straight to medical services.
<P>
	Reform of course projects a cost that is much lower than this. 
The total package of tax breaks in its fresh start document is to cost 
only $12 billion. However, as we can see, the numbers do not add 
up. One might legitimately ask what the Reform Party is really 
proposing.
<P>
	In their speeches members of the Reform Party talked about a 
$3,000 to $5,000 benefit per child, but if we look at its budget plan 
the figure is much lower. What is the Reform Party proposing the 
House of Commons do? By passing this motion are we committing 
the government to giving every child under seven years of age $850 
or does it mean we are going to give these children $5,000?
<P>
	The motion is fuzzy and cannot be supported for that very 
reason.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and 
Addington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to 
congratulate my seat mate, the hon. member for Essex-Windsor, 
on her excellent speech. It certainly had a lot of information about 
our government's doing many concrete things to help Canadian 
families, the rich, the poor and the working people of this country.
<P>
	I also note that the hon. member made an excellent speech in 
both official languages, which I believe is the first time I have 
shared with that, if I may say that.
<P>
	I appreciate hearing about employment insurance. There is a lot 
of misinformation about the benefits for all Canadians. Today 
anyone can fall between the cracks and find themselves in dire 
circumstances. There is an allowance there for anyone with an 
attachment to the workforce in the last three years who could be 
eligible for these benefits, for training and any of the other 
attachments.
<P>
	Does the hon. member have any other ideas and points that she 
wants to share with us at this opportunity? I think it is very 
important that we hear the correct information on this.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Whelan:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for 
his question. There are many points that we could share today on 
what we need to do for children in benefits. I would like to restate 
that EI claimants who get the family income supplement will be 
exempt from the new intensity rule that will reduce benefit levels 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6568"> 6568 </A></B>
<P>
of repeat  claims. That is very important for all Canadians to know. 
People need to know this step reflects the interests of children in 
low income families.
<P>
	I also think people should know that part II will allow them to 
develop the skills they need to build stronger careers. Again, in part 
II we have targeted our assistance. We also recognize that parents 
find it very difficult to pursue full time studies.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	It is important to make another point about the child tax benefit. 
The child tax benefit right now recognizes the contributions of all 
families by providing a basic credit of $1,020 per child per year, 
plus an additional $75 for the third child and subsequent children. 
It recognizes the cost of young children by providing a supplement 
of $213 for each child under the age of seven. It targets the greatest 
benefits to families in need by reducing the total benefit by 5 per 
cent on family income over $25,921. I believe the current child tax 
benefit recognizes the contribution of all parents and at the same 
time directs more resources to those most in need. That is good 
family policy.
<P>
	The Liberal government is working with the provinces to 
improve this by developing, as I said before, an integrated child 
benefit. I believe this would be a better use of scarce and limited 
public resources than the Reform proposal. It would provide 
greater public benefit to the entire community, while Reform's 
proposal would channel more resources to one type of family 
regardless of financial need.
<P>
	Families do want choices, but they want real choices. Reform 
talks about choices, but the impact of its policies would only 
provide real choices for the group of families who can afford to 
have one parent stay at home, and most families do not have that 
choice.
<P>
	Reform based this motion on its proposals in its fresh start 
program on the notion that a one income earner family of $60,000 
is the same as a two earner family with an income of $30,000 each. 
That is not reality. It is not the case.
<P>
	If a parent earning $30,000 in the Reform plan decides to stay 
home, the family might get a tax credit of somewhere between 
$2,000 and $4,000, depending on the age of the children. That 
would give the household a family income of $32,000 or $34,000. 
The family, obviously, would not have the same choices as a 
household earning $60,000.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise to 
speak to the Reform Party's motion today. It is so very rare that one 
has the opportunity in the House to address a motion which has 
substance, makes sense and has some possible benefits down the 
road.
<P>
	I would like to begin by making a brief comment on the 
comments of the hon. member for Essex-Windsor. Her reply to 
my question made it very clear that she has indeed not read the 
Reform Party's fresh start program, nor has she read any of the 
professional critiques of it. She is bemused by whatever they are 
telling these people in the inner circles of the Liberal Party. She has 
joined other members opposite in their unanimous contention that a 
tax break for families is unaffordable. Coming as that does from 
her, from a charter member of the very far left side of the Liberal 
Party, which historically has believed that there are no limits to 
what we can spend on anything, it is rather astonishing.
<P>
	They keep asking where the money will come from. I will not go 
through a long list of cuts on which our fresh start proposal is 
based, but I can give a couple of examples. I can do that without 
mentioning such obvious and immediate candidates for cutting as 
the $87 million to top up the treasury of a Liberal friendly and 
profitable corporation or the millions of dollars which have been 
spent to give away free flags. Let us talk about the heavy duty stuff.
<P>
	Part of the source of the numbers in our fresh start program was 
the privatization of the CBC, for an annual saving of about $1 
billion. Which is more important, Yorkville-centric culture or 
giving a break to children?
<P>
	I am the Reform critic for international institutions. I along with 
our researches identified $800 million which could be cut without 
taking one penny away from Canadian overseas humanitarian aid. 
There would be major slashing in contract work for friends of the 
Liberal Party and there would be a turning away from bilateral aid, 
with all of its attendant corruption, to providing matching funds for 
NGOs who historically have shown they know what they are doing. 
If there are any hon. members who would like to go into the point 
by point details of the other $13 billion, they should talk to their 
friendly Reform Party critics.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	Let us bury once and for all the slander that we would cut federal 
funding to medicare. Those who were around for the 1993 election 
campaign know very well that one of our platforms was to stop the 
cuts, which were initiated by the Tories and ruthlessly continued by 
this government, to the federal contributions to medicare. The 
contributions are now down to about 23 per cent of total medicare 
costs. So who in the name of heaven are the bad guys, the Liberals 
who are doing it or Reformers who the Liberals claim would do it? 
It is a false claim.
<P>
	The Liberals say they have not made specific increases in 
income tax rates. Fair enough and whoopee. But they always fail to 
mention, very conveniently, that they have increased other taxes, 
directly and indirectly, 31 times. Count them, 31. Among others, 
they have increased gasoline taxes, park fees and the taxable 
portion of income through deindexing, which is a rather sneaky 
way  of increasing income tax, deindexing the basic deduction. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6569"> 6569 </A></B>
<P>
government has changed the RRSP rules and it has subjected 
maritimers to increased sales taxes through their rather convoluted 
changes to the GST rules.
<P>
	The bottom line is that federal tax revenues have increased by 
twenty four and a half per cent since this government took office, 
and now this government is crying poor. It does not have the money 
to give tax relief to ordinary Canadians.
<P>
	I will speak more directly to the motion before us that, in the 
opinion of this House, the government provide tax fairness for all 
Canadian families by extending the child care tax deduction to all 
families of all income levels and converting it to a credit, thereby 
offering Canadians freedom of choice in caring for their children.
<P>
	This motion addresses a specific proposal and targets a specific 
problem. What is the problem, some might ask. In a survey of 
healthy women in Toronto conducted this year by researchers at a 
Toronto hospital it was found that the most common health worry 
of women was not heart problems, not breast cancer, but fatigue.
<P>
	When the researchers broke down the reasons why women were 
tired they identified these factors: financial worries, lack of 
exercise, marital relationship problems, poor sleep, lack of 
personal time, care of an ill family member. But the number one 
reason why women feel tired today is the combination of home and 
outside work which is forced on them in many cases by the 
inability to make family ends meet because they are paying so 
much money in taxes.
<P>
	It is not just federal taxes but provincial taxes, municipal taxes. 
Forty-six per cent of the average family income is being sucked 
away by government. The average family can no longer make it 
without two incomes. It is a big treadmill.
<P>
	In an international Gallup survey which was conducted this year 
in Canada as well as in 22 other countries, more than half of 
Canadian women believe the country would be better off if one 
spouse were able, the key word, to stay home and take care of the 
children. But the Liberals through their voracious appetite for 
taxes-31 tax increases in the last three and a half years-are 
making it impossible for families to have that choice.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	Families have to work hard. Right now two out three two-parent 
families have two or more jobs. Moonlighting families have 
increased by 50 per cent over the last 10 years. Sixty per cent of 
families now have to have two incomes to make ends meet.
<P>
	The tax system discriminates against one income families. Two 
income families pay $7,000 less in income taxes per year than one 
income families, if the net family income is $60,000. The average 
family income in real terms has dropped more than $3,000 since 
1993. This year the average Canadian family will have to pay 
$27,000 in taxes alone.
<P>
	It is not the desire of the Reform Party and it is certainly not my 
desire to force choices on families. What we have now are choices 
being forced upon families by the present government. It is the 
Liberal government that forces both parents to work to survive. It is 
the desire of Reform to increase choices for the family so that 
families can care for their children in any way they wish.
<P>
	One of the Liberals' broken promises, one which was fortunately 
broken I would suggest, was the creation of a host of new day care 
spaces so that they could further raise taxes and further reduce the 
choices of Canadian women. What does subsidized day care mean 
to you? I will tell you what it means to me as a country boy. It 
means that a professional couple in Toronto can load their child 
into a BMW and take it to the Silver Spoon Happy Centre For 
Lucky Tots while a Saskatchewan farm woman who lives 50 miles 
from the nearest urban centre has to strap her toddlers into the truck 
seat beside her while she helps with the harvest because she and her 
overtaxed spouse cannot afford to hire extra help.
<P>
	The Reform Party would reduce spending by $15 billion. We 
would balance the federal budget by March 31, 1999. We would 
provide smaller less intrusive government because that is what 
Canadians want. After the deficit is erased, Reform would increase 
spending on health and education by $4 billion a year. I say it is not 
a bad suggestion.
<P>
	A smaller government would enable us to provide tax relief to 
everyone. We would increase the spousal amount of the income tax 
deduction from $5,380 to $7,900. We would change the $3,000 to 
$5,000 child care deduction to a $3,000 to $5,000 credit available 
to all parents including those who look after their kids at home.
<P>
	This would have an enormous effect on a family earning $30,000 
which would have its taxes cut by 89 per cent. A dual income 
family of four with earnings of $60,000 per year would save 31.7 
per cent in their taxes. Altogether 727,000 low and middle income 
taxpayers would come off the tax rolls. That would be a real hit 
against child poverty in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	Giles Gherson, a columnist for the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> who is 
certainly no friend of the Reform Party, calls the Reform platform a 
war on poverty. I quote: ``Simply raising the income tax personal 
and spousal exemptions-will remove an estimated one million 
low income families from the tax rolls, people who never should 
have been paying taxes in the first place-the Liberals admit they 
are not planning anything nearly so generous-.On the menu at 
next year's election: a real and surprising choice in Canada's 
stalled war on poverty''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6570"> 6570 </A></B>
<P>
	With policies like the Liberal government's policies, is it any 
wonder why the family is in trouble in Canada? It would be so 
much more efficient, so much better for the family to lower taxes 
and enable parents to do what they want to do with their own 
money and to have a better quality of home life. Reform is all about 
child care choice and tax relief for families.
<P>
	I will end on a rather personal note. Unlike some of the fat cat 
ivory tower theorists opposite, I have walked the road of single 
parenthood and I never even considered the option of day care. My 
family helped me out during vacations. I was able to employ an 
elderly live-in housekeeper at much less than the cost of day care 
for school days. It was not easy. We did not maintain the style of 
living as a single parent household that we had as a two parent 
household, but we made out. We did not whine to the government. 
And I am proud to say that I raised two very well adjusted and very 
successful young people.
<P>
	In case anybody over there is going to be tempted again to throw 
the slur across that what we are trying to do is to help out the well 
off and damn the middle class and damn the poor, I would like to 
put it on the record that this is not the case. Most of us in this 
caucus have actually been there, whereas I think it would be a 
rather small minority among the Liberal government caucus.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex-Windsor, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member asked a question of me earlier and I feel I have to 
respond. I forgot to mention the part of the Reform Party plan in the 
motion they are making today about the child care credit. I am 
wondering if it is going to be refundable.
<P>
	The statement that it goes to all families implies that it would be 
refundable. At the same time the statement that it is a tax benefit 
could limit the credit to tax paying families which would leave the 
poorest families, unemployed families on social assistance without 
any benefit at all. Which is it? Nowhere in the motion does the 
Reform Party say that the credit would be refundable. This leaves 
me to suspect that it may be planning to exclude the most needy 
families who do not pay taxes.
<P>
	As well, I think there is a mixed conception here. We are talking 
about child care options. I do not hear that from the Reform Party 
when they talk about day care or taking care of children. We are 
talking about options available for families so that if one spouse 
wants to stay home, those options are there.
<P>
	There are no options in the Reform Party platform. There is no 
choice either. Reformers do not support any of the measures that 
would allow women to combine work and family life, which is 
what a lot of women would like to do. The Reform Party does not 
support the inclusion of parental leave policies in employment 
insurance. It did not support and does not support employment 
insurance for part time workers.
<P>
	In fact the Reform Party would eliminate the CPP provisions 
which cover a parent's contributions for any years away from the
<P>
workplace. I do not believe and I do not see how that assists 
children.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> I thank the hon. member for her comments. I am 
afraid she misses the point. What we are saying with respect to tax 
relief is that if money is left in the hands of individual Canadians or 
Canadian families, they will then be able to provide their own 
choices.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member seems to think that day care has to be a big 
government heavily subsidized entity. That is not true. If the hon. 
member shakes her head and says that is not what she had in mind, 
then I retract that statement. The point is that when families do not 
have money, families do not have choices. When families are taxed 
until they squeak, they do not have money. It is a simple corollary. 
That is why we say that the taxes must be lowered in order to give 
people the chance to make their own choices.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I must say 
that the hon. member for Essex-Windsor has given a detailed 
response to the motion to which I attach myself very proudly. Her 
knowledge of this subject is obvious. She has done a tremendous 
amount of homework studying it.
<P>
	The Reform motion, on the face of it, is quite compelling. The 
motion calls for the extension of the child care tax deduction to all 
families of all income levels and so on. I will forgive the technical 
glitch. It speaks of a child care tax deduction, but it should speak of 
something else.
<P>
	When we examine the motion, the problem is that we begin to 
ask questions about what the motion really means. If it means, as 
my hon. friend from Swift Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia has 
said, transferring the $5,000 to a tax credit, then it begins to raise 
even more questions.
<P>
	My hon. friend from Essex-Windsor asked the question: What 
would happen if the Reform Party's second chance program were 
to come into play and more people were taken off the tax rolls? 
That $5,000 tax credit would be available to people who would not 
be paying any taxes. What would happen to those people with low 
incomes?
<P>
	One could go on to ask a number of questions like that to get into 
the detail of this motion. While the spirit of the motion may be 
quite commendable, it is not workable. It is not doable. If the 
Reform Party were the government of the day-perish the 
thought-it would be introducing something which would have 
rather horrendous implications.
<P>
	My friend from Swift Current-Maple Creek-Assiniboia spoke 
of certain loans that our  government has made recently to various 
companies. He has attempted to discredit them in the face of the 
need for adequate financing for children. He referred to the war on 
poverty. Let me make it very clear that the most effective war on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6571"> 6571 </A></B>
<P>
poverty is employment. When people are working and putting 
bread on the table, that is the most effective war on poverty.
<P>
	I would like to respond to the charges about the $87 million 
which was lent to Bombardier. It is a repayable loan. It was not 
given to the company. It is a loan which is repayable in royalties 
when the next new generation of Bombardier aircraft are out on the 
line, built and flying.
<P>
<B>(1545 )</B>
<P>
	Actually the aerospace industry, as my hon. friend will 
acknowledge, is one of the greatest exports Canada has at the 
present time. To bring us into a position where Canada will become 
the fourth largest manufacturer of aerospace equipment, aircraft 
particularly, it seems to me that research and development 
partnerships with industry are a very suitable way to go, especially 
in they are in the form of repayable loans.
<P>
	Recently some money was loaned for the further development of 
the tar sands. It was done on a similar basis. Thirty million dollars 
was given to a company in Vancouver that is a specialist in fuel cell 
production. It represents the vanguard of some of the new energy 
utilization we will have in this country.
<P>
	The Liberal government has always believed in these kinds of 
partnerships. This is not done as a handout to industry. It is done in 
the spirit of investment because this kind of investment pays huge 
dividends.
<P>
	The hon. member speaks of income declines in recent years. I 
wonder if he would pay the same attention to interest rate declines. 
If someone has a young family at the present time, it is pretty 
common to have a mortgage on a home. If you go to the bank today 
to renew your mortgage after five years, you will walk out of there 
with $3,000 to $4,000 more in your pockets than you had 
previously. The financial policies of the government have been 
instrumental in the resulting decline in interest rates-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison: </B>Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. Is there a 
question in there somewhere or is the hon. member making a 
speech on my time?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member is in fact making a speech but it 
is my understanding that it is on his time. There were questions and 
comments with you and he now has the floor on debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reed:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sorry the hon. member did not 
realize that you had called for debate. I am in a very forgiving 
mood this afternoon so I will acknowledge that the hon. member 
just did not hear it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> Mr. Speaker, with respect, I do not think debate 
was called.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Actually I should have done it if I did not because 
he is now debating and he has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reed:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is probably because I am closer to the 
Speaker that I heard the word ``debate''.
<P>
	There is no question that the financial policies of the government 
as they relate to economic recovery and renewal are probably one 
of the strongest things that can be done for the family. As a result of 
policies which have strengthened the dollar, lowered interest rates 
and raised export levels to record highs, the country is in a position 
where 700,000 new jobs have been created. The country is now in a 
position to move on and be one of the strongest, if not the strongest, 
economy in the G-7. It seems to me that has a direct impact on the 
family.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	In spite of the fact that Canadians have come through a serious 
period of constraint in the last few years and has partnered with the 
Canadian people to asked them to bear with it in its attempt to fix 
the economy, the government has continued to provide substantial 
assistance to low income families and those who need it most.
<P>
	I give the example of the child tax benefit. It was recognized that 
as the economy strengthens that the effort must be increased, 
especially the war on child poverty, and to strengthen the 
institution of the family as much as possible. We are headed that 
way, but perhaps in a little different way than my hon. friend 
suggests.
<P>
	If this country was to adopt the policies put forward by the 
Reform Party Canadians would be in a horrific financial situation 
because the arithmetic does not add up. Money cannot be given out 
here and there on the never, never without some revenue to 
compensate for it. That is the direction we are heading under 
Reform.
<P>
	I am very comfortable in declining to support the motion. I have 
great sympathy for its intent, and I hope it is not just a populist ploy 
but a sincere attempt by the Reform Party. However, in all 
conscience I cannot support the motion. I am sure that if the 
Reform Party were to introduce something more detailed and a 
little more correct in the future, I might consider it at that time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I could not help 
but reply to the member's statement.
<P>
	He compared the money that is being put into the tar sands in 
Alberta with the $87 million no interest loan to Bombardier. He 
said, basically: ``Can you not see that we are doing as much for 
Alberta and as much for western Canada as we are for central 
Canada?'' That is a slap in the face to people who live in Alberta 
and British Columbia and who suffered through the $80 billion 
rip-off by the government through the national energy program. It 
took the money that belonged to those  provinces and walked away 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6572"> 6572 </A></B>
<P>
with it for the benefit of central Canada and the federal 
government.
<P>
	By throwing a few crumbs back into Alberta in the tar sands 
project and suggesting that in some way it is the benevolent 
government looking out for the best interests of Alberta, I frankly 
find that a bit of a slap in the face.
<P>
	I do not forget things like that. There are a lot of people in 
western Canada who will never forget what the Liberal government 
did with the $80 billion rip-off under the national energy program. I 
will never forget that.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I know there is a question in there someplace and 
the hon. member will find it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reed:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not capable of living in the past. I 
try to live in the present and look to the future. It seems to me that 
the $400 million that is going to improve the tar sands is going to 
allow the tar sands to develop in a way that is going to be very 
beneficial to western Canada.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I might have gotten the wrong signal here. I asked 
the hon. member for Halton-Peel if he was going to use the full 
time and I thought he indicated to me that he was going to use the 
full 20 minutes. Is that correct?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reed:</B> Mr. Speaker, what I indicated to you was that I had no 
one to share the time with.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Yes you do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reed:</B> I am learning something new every minute of this 
afternoon. I would be very honoured to share my time with the hon. 
member for Algoma.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, with your consent may we give the 10 
minutes to the member for Algoma?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Algoma has 10 minutes. It 
is 10 minutes and 5 minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank my colleagues on both sides of the House for allowing me 10 
minutes of comments on an opposition day motion. It is not the 
worst motion I have seen from the opposition side but it is certainly 
not one that I can support even though they have kindly let me have 
a few minutes here this afternoon.
<P>
	There is a hidden agenda with this motion but I suppose we 
should come to expect that from the third party. As much as I 
respect individual members of the third party, the total package 
from time to time leaves something to be desired. The hidden 
agenda I sense in this motion is that the Reform Party is against a 
broad based day care, child care, system in Canada.
<P>
	I would like to begin by relating an experience that I had when I 
was a student at the University of Toronto.  At that time I was 
involved in establishing the first parent co-op day care centre at the 
University of Toronto, a day care centre I am proud to say still 
exists as the Sussex Parent Co-op Day Care Centre. It is quite an 
interesting story and maybe some other time I could go into details.
<P>
	That experience taught me that there is no one simple solution 
for the care of our children. While I accept that the pre-eminent 
place of care for children should always be the family, the 
circumstances in this present world do not always allow us to have 
that circumstance available to everybody.
<P>
	Single parents need day care whether they can afford to fully pay 
for it themselves or whether they need publicly assisted day care. 
In some families it is absolutely necessary that both parents work 
in order to pay the bills that are part of family life.
<P>
	To suggest that simply providing a child care tax deduction to all 
families of all income levels pretends that there is a uniform 
situation for families. I think we tend to fool ourselves sometimes 
by talking about the typical family or standard family. There are 
many varieties of family arrangements in the modern world and we 
cannot try to adapt the social culture to take care of all situations 
with the simplistic solution we are offered here today.
<P>
	The tax system provides a measure of relief for low and middle 
income families.
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	I would be the last one to say it is perfect. In times past, when my 
children were younger, I was happily able to take take advantage of 
that tax deduction. My children are old enough now that I do not 
have to worry about that, but I was sure glad it was there for me at 
the time when I was a low to middle income person in my younger 
years.
<P>
	I do not think even well-to-do families would generally agree 
they need a tax deduction for which I have seen estimates of 
billions of dollars. I ask the Reform Party to take note of these 
numbers and do their own arithmetic. I wonder if the arithmetic 
might not be better than we have seen in the past.
<P>
	I will quote from some research notes. If Reform means to give a 
$5,000 tax credit for every child under seven years of age and a 
$3,000 tax credit for every child aged seven to twelve, the cost of 
the program would be approximately $21 billion or far greater than 
the figures Reform projects when it says its total package of tax 
breaks is worth $12 billion. Even $12 billion is a lot of money. I 
wonder whether the upper income families the Reformers may be 
thinking about need that kind of tax break at this time.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6573"> 6573 </A></B>
<P>
	I am not against targeting tax cuts and tax incentives for needy 
sectors of our society at the proper time when the deficit is taken 
care of. However this smacks of a  broad based tax break from 
income zero to income millions per annum and I must object to 
that.
<P>
	The other hidden agenda, besides being against a broad based 
community day care system, is that the Reform Party is telling 
women to stay home to take care of the children. I accept that a lot 
of women would choose that. Some are able to and some cannot 
because of life circumstances.
<P>
	It is an individual decision on the part of the mother. It is not a 
decision we as a society should be imposing on any woman. It 
should be that men and women are equals in society. I resent the 
subliminal message in this Reform motion that women should stay 
at home to take care of the children.
<P>
	The government has already answered-and I admit we have a 
way to go-the concerns of families with children. I wish we could 
go further right now. In due course I suspect we will be able to. We 
should be focusing our attention on the the whole issue of children 
and poverty among children in our society.
<P>
	I do not think this plan which would redistribute tax dollars to 
upper income families would allow us to do what is needed to 
ensure the poor and the poorest in society have a proper share of 
what this great country has to offer.
<P>
	With great respect to the fine members who are here, I do not 
know how Reform Party members can argue on the one hand for 
deficit reduction-and I would argue the government is doing a 
great job with that program-and then propose a plan that would 
cost $10 billion to $21 billion according to our estimates. Perhaps 
they could explain that to me as other members participate in the 
debate.
<P>
	As I much as I appreciate it is the privilege of the opposition 
members to bring forward ideas for debate, they have missed an 
opportunity to bring forward a good idea. They brought forward an 
idea I cannot support.
<P>
	I conclude by saying that there are among other things two 
hidden items: that the Reform Party is against broad based child 
care and that it is asking women to stay home to take care of their 
children.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
great deal of respect for the member opposite. He and I shared 
some time together on the Standing Committee on Finance. I got to 
know him as being an honourable gentleman. Therefore I can only 
assume he has not taken the time to understand what the Reform 
Party is about.
<P>
	My wife and I have some very dear friends. When their children 
were growing up he was a school teacher and hated his job. His 
wife was a dental assistant and loved her job. They decided he 
would become a home husband, which we applauded.
<P>
	The description the member has given of the Reform Party was 
completely out of place. The Reform Party is about choice. This is 
something that he and unfortunately his Liberal friends do not 
understand. The reality is that when he talks about one simple 
solution, his one simple solution is some kind of a national child 
day care program.
<P>
	The difference is that the Reform Party is saying we should put 
the money in the hands of the people at the bottom end of the scale. 
We should give them the opportunity to have a choice, whether 
they are single parent families with a man or woman as the parent, 
whether they are traditional family units or whether they are in 
multiple family arrangements.
<P>
	Let us assume for the sake of discussion we are talking about a 
woman with two or three children. This person is now in a position 
where she has a choice. She can do what the Liberals tell her to do, 
or not get any support if she decides to use a family member as the 
person who would be helping her with the rearing of her children or 
somebody she respects in the neighbourhood, perhaps a friend 
through some kind of charitable organization or church she belongs 
to. The Liberals, NDPers and Conservatives have the simple 
solution of some kind of massive child day care program.
<P>
	Another point I am rather surprised by is that my friend, a very 
intelligent person, went along with the $21 billion figure. He seems 
to have lost the relationship between a tax credit and a tax 
deduction.
<P>
	The Reform Party is talking about a tax credit. We want to get up 
to a million families away from paying taxes. Those million 
families would be at the bottom end of the scale and not at all as he 
described.
<P>
	Rather than just reading the notes he was handed by the Prime 
Minister's office, which seems to have a good time coming up with 
all sorts of interpretations and misinformation of what Reform is 
all about, has the member actually taken the time to read the fresh 
start document so that he understands the Reform Party is about 
giving Canadians a choice in how they choose as parents their 
values and how they bring up their children?
<P>
	<B>Mr. St. Denis:</B> Madam Speaker, with great respect, the hon. 
member talks about creating choice if the Reform Party motion 
were adopted and implemented. I think it would lead to less choice.
<P>
	As I understand, it is an income based proposal. The more 
money made, the more potential tax credit would be available.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> That is dead wrong.
<P>
	<B>Mr. St. Denis:</B> In a scenario like that one we will be tilting this 
significantly toward higher income families in society.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6574"> 6574 </A></B>
<P>
	This will lead to a further drain on the funds of the country as 
they are tilted toward higher income families, giving the 
government less freedom and less flexibility to deal with the real 
issue facing many families, the issue of poverty, particularly child 
poverty. Regardless of how it is cut I do not see how it is a 
progressive suggestion. Our tax system is not perfect. We hope it is 
as progressive as it can be, but it is not perfect. I do not see this idea 
as being progressive, that the better off we are in terms of income 
the more choices we have because there will be more tax benefit. 
The choices for lower income families would still be very limited.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister promised during the campaign that when the 
finances of the country allowed we would deal with the issue of a 
national child care program.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to take part in the debate.
<P>
	I would like to set the hon. gentleman straight on the tax credit. 
Reform policy says that it will be at the lowest possible tax rate, 
which is about 17 per cent. If I am correct that means about $850 
per child, which to a low income family is a lot of money. It would 
probably take care of their household needs for a month. For a 
millionaire like the gentleman was talking about, $850 probably 
does not pay for the car licence for his Mercedes. That is the 
difference. That is why we targeted low income families. Nobody 
gets a higher rate of tax credit than low income families. That is the 
Reform tax credit. It is a very wise decision.
<P>
	I started farming in 1957. When our family came along in 1962, 
$850 bought us groceries for a long time. Even though the cost of 
living has risen a lot, to the low income families it still means a 
great deal. That is why the motion is so important to farm or rural 
communities. If there were this type of tax credit during the years 
my wife and I farmed pretty well on our own, it would have meant 
our children could have been looked after by someone locally who 
wanted to earn a few dollars. That tax credit was not available at 
that time. We needed every penny we had to keep our farm 
operating.
<P>
	From 1961 to 1994 the average family saw its before tax income 
increase by 768 per cent, which is a tremendous increase. If we 
look at the other side of the story we see that taxes grew by 1,200 
per cent. If we take that into consideration plus the increases in the 
cost of food, clothing and shelter, the family on the farm today is 
probably in a lot worse position than it was when I started farming.
<P>
	We always had enough money to put food on the table without 
my wife taking a second job. We always had enough money to pay 
our bills and to pay the interest on the money we borrowed to buy 
our farm. That is not the case on the rural scene any more.
<P>
	According to Statistics Canada 48 per cent of net farm income 
today comes from off farm jobs. This is very sad and very serious. 
We have seen farms increase from a half section to probably two 
sections as the average today. The expense and the stress are 
unbelievable, as well as mother or father probably having to work 
at an off farm job. The extra money will be beneficial to rural 
families trying to survive on one income.
<P>
	In 1971 the average family earned $3,600. Only 39 per cent of 
those families had dual income.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	It was rare if we saw a dual income on the farm in 1957, 1961 to 
1970, but today we see that happening on almost every farm. By 
1990 the average family income had crept up to $43,500 but 60 per 
cent of those families had dual incomes. We can see what has 
happened in society and with family income.
<P>
	As the hon. gentleman explained, it seems that Liberals or 
Conservatives in power during those 35 to 40 years had all the good 
ideas. I am wondering why we are $600 billion in debt, why our 
families today have to pay interest to the tune of almost $45 billion 
on money that was never earned during this period but was 
borrowed. We are expecting our younger families to take over this 
burden and take care of that debt that was made before they ever 
had any input into how government should be run.
<P>
	It bothers me when I see that we want take credit for things that 
we really do not deserve credit for. Sure things were tough in the 
1950s, 1960s and probably the early 1970s but the communities 
were there and they looked after each other. There was a lot of fun 
even when we did not have that much money. We had local curling 
and skating rinks. Today they are gone. They are in the larger 
centres, and farm families and other industries that look after 
farmers such as fertilizer dealers drive 40 or 50 miles to take their 
kids to hockey games or hockey practises or to music lessons. This 
has all disappeared because we had the good idea that we could live 
on borrowed money and now it is catching up. I do not want to take 
too much credit for making things better on borrowed money.
<P>
	When I look at the latest statistic that a single income family has 
to pay $7,000 more in taxes than a dual income family it really 
worries me. That is why things are being geared to a two income 
family where one member of that family pretty well works full 
time for the government.
<P>
	With the Reform's fresh start child care policy we are directing 
the tax cuts to those families that desperately need it. Under 
Reform's plan a single income family of four making $30,000 will 
pay 89 per cent less tax. To me that means a tremendous benefit, 
that there is that amount of money left to spend on necessities that 
this family probably was not able to afford before this tax cut.  
People will appreciate this and will take that into consideration in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6575"> 6575 </A></B>
<P>
the next election because it is the family that still drives the nation. 
If we do not realize that very soon I think we are in big trouble.
<P>
	One of the farm papers was mailed to me. In it a gentleman 
writer portrays what is happening with this Liberal government. It 
is comic: ``You are driving up to Goodale's General Store''. 
Whether there is a store like that I do not know but that is what this 
writer says: ``Your wife has asked you to pick up a loaf of bread. 
You ask the storekeeper for one loaf of 100 per cent whole wheat 
but the storekeeper hands you a dozen grade A large eggs. `No', 
you protest, `a loaf of bread is what I came in to buy. I do not need 
eggs. My wife said we need a loaf of bread'. The storekeeper tells 
you this is better for you. He says `believe me, I have been running 
this store for three years now and I know what is best for my 
customers, including you. When I run across something I do not 
know myself my suppliers explain it to me and tell me what to do. 
Here are your eggs and that will be $3, please'. Since there is no 
other general store in this country you will have to take it and like 
it''.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	That is what I have seen happening in this political arena for the 
last three years. We have a government that thinks it knows what is 
best for families. It tells us: ``This is even better for you than you 
yourself know. It is better that two parents should be working than 
one paying taxes so we can afford some handouts''. I think it is are 
dead wrong and I will say why.
<P>
	When I see that 48 per cent of net farm income today is coming 
from off farm jobs, what is left to the rural lifestyle? Not very 
much. I must tell this House that not only has the Liberal 
government increased taxes over the past number of years, but it 
has really decreased farmer incomes by making certain moves 
which I believe are disastrous to the farm community.
<P>
	In 1975-76 when we were told under GATT that we could import 
76,000 tonnes of beef, the Liberal government knew better. It 
increased that to 119,000 tonnes of offshore beef imports. We had a 
beef industry that was already realizing decreases in prices because 
of overproduction due to depressed grain prices. This added fuel 
and the prices continued to slide.
<P>
	Yesterday I phoned one of the farm input dealers. We got talking 
about what was happening in the farm scene. He said: ``It's sad, 
Jake. I have had a number of young beef producers come in 
recently and tell me that they cannot afford to pay their bills. With 
interest rates at a record low, the lowest in 40 years, the banker is 
still telling them to liquidate''. These people who diversified three 
or four years ago because of low grain prices are now told that they 
should liquidate.
<P>
	What else has happened to these young farmers? We know we 
had to restructure the western grain  transportation subsidies. Every 
farmer realized that would have to happen. But what did we do? 
The entrepreneurial young farmers who went into beef production 
because of low grain prices were excluded from these western grain 
transportation subsidies because their tame hay farms or silage 
corn farms did not qualify. They were not able to get funding out of 
that WGTA payout. They got a double whammy. That is very sad.
<P>
	Just as these young people started to rebuild their lives with the 
hope that grain prices would stay low for a number of years, it 
backfired. The prices went up. Cattle prices went down. Now they 
are told to liquidate with the lowest interest rates we have seen in a 
long time. That is not building a country; that is destroying a 
lifestyle and a country.
<P>
	Once agriculture is destroyed there is not much left. It drives the 
engine of a country. It is the backbone of a country and we had 
better start to realize that.
<P>
	The marketing of grain prices has also helped to decrease grain 
prices. We had record high prices last year from January through 
June. Now we find out through Stats Canada that we have a record 
carryover of durum wheat and feed grains because of poor weather 
conditions. This is depressing prices again while young farmers 
who have started in the livestock industry are being told to go out 
of business. This means we will need less of these grains when the 
product is building up. Again we are going to destroy that type of 
industry.
<P>
	I cannot imagine it. A young farmer from my province, Mr. 
McMechan, spent four months in jail because he violated a 
customs regulation that said he could not export grain without a 
wheat board export permit. This young farmer sold his grain for the 
best price he could get, a price that the wheat board was not willing 
to pay him. So he went to jail. He is not the only one to be 
prosecuted. There are approximately 300 farmers who are being 
prosecuted for the same thing. Why? We had record amounts of 
grain on hand and the wheat board sold 31 per cent less durum last 
year than the previous year when the demand was tremendous. 
How is that supposed to build a country?
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	Sure that farmer violated a law, but in a democracy when we are 
deprived of selling our product for the best price available, that 
industry is not going to survive very long. If we are going to 
provide a democracy where nobody gets a price lower than the 
next, that is going in the wrong direction.
<P>
	What are we going to do about this? Are we going to overturn the 
system? The agriculture minister is asking western grain farmers to 
either defend the wheat board or totally sell under single desk. This 
no allowance for an option for people to decide what they want to 
do.
<P>
	There is no allowance for competition between grain companies 
and the single desk marketing system. Competition is what keeps 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6576"> 6576 </A></B>
<P>
the system fair and honest. But that seems to be something the 
government is not interested in doing.
<P>
	I picked this out of an article in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>: ``Canadian 
families are more like the Cleaver family of the 1950s television 
than the patchwork of mixed families portrayed in the media during 
the 1990s. A landmark Statistics Canada survey of 23,000 children 
found that 83 per cent of the kids under 12 lived in a two parent 
family in 1994. Only 16.5 per cent lived with a single parent. 
Moreover, the vast majority of their families were biological 
families, not reconstructed by marriage or other means''.
<P>
	The biggest difference between the TV household of the Cleaver 
family where the mother stayed at home is that today in 36 per cent 
of the two parent families, both parents have full time jobs. That is 
a good thing if the mother wants to work or the father wants to 
work. But what is parenting?
<P>
	Another article states: ``A child's prospects were at least as good 
with positive parenting in a single or disadvantaged family as with 
negative parenting in a family with two parents or more money''. 
That tells me that any advantage we can give to the traditional 
family can improve its lifestyle and standard of living will only be 
positive for the country. That is what Reform's fresh start family 
policy does.
<P>
	Another thing surprised me in a another article on behavioural 
problems. It stated that a single mother, low income family has 34 
per cent more behavioural problems than a two parent family; a 13 
per cent difference between the same lifestyle or income because of 
the parenting. A single mother not in a low income situation has 28 
per cent more problems than a two parent family.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	Parents are very important in creating good young citizens for 
the future.
<P>
	One thing that really impressed me, and I have said it before in 
this House, was when an RCMP officer from northern Manitoba 
said: ``Jake, it is so much easier to build a good kid than to fix a 
broken adult''. I hope we can do that in this House.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Before going 
to questions and comments, it is my duty, pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, to inform the House that the question to be raised tonight 
at the time of adjournment is as follows: the hon. member for 
Mackenzie-Canadian Airlines.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I want to pick up on a sentence that the member delivered 
in his speech when he said: ``Any help we''-being the Reform 
Party-``can give to the traditional family this party supports''. I 
believe that is an  accurate phrase from the member's speech. I see 
the member nodding in agreement.
<P>
	I would like to suggest humbly that the Reform Party can talk 
about its commitment to the traditional family. I believe the 
member is sincere when he talks about that. However, at the same 
time, I do not think the Reform Party realizes that its campaign that 
has gone on in this House for the last three years plus on cuts in 
every sector of government, the lean, mean machine type of 
approach to government, in fact not only directly but indirectly 
causes a tremendous assault on the traditional family.
<P>
	It is important, when we have the opportunity to debate some of 
these issues, that we realize we have to look not just at the micro 
issues but at the macro effect. The Reform Party has not been 
sensitive to traditional family values. It would be interesting to see 
if the member would say that maybe this is a conversion as we are 
heading into an election year or something.
<P>
	Maybe the member could clarify why the Reform Party now 
believes that its campaign on cuts over the last three years has been 
an assault on the traditional family and that it is prepared to 
reconsider that approach and start looking at a more generous 
approach in using government agencies and departments to look 
out for the needs of families?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
that question. I am very sincere when I say we need to direct our 
help to low income families.
<P>
	When I started farming in 1957 I think the national debt was 
something like $16 or $17 billion. I was able to buy a farm by 
borrowing the money. I did not have a cent at that time. I paid 6 per 
cent interest at the bank. The government at that time had brought 
in a program that gave me 4.5 per cent financing over 29 years. 
That is what helped me get started.
<P>
	I was able to expand. On a half section I grew enough product to 
pay my bills and put a few dollars aside for a rainy day if something 
went badly wrong because we did not have crop insurance at that 
time. I was able to raise my family and still have a fairly 
comfortable livelihood.
<P>
	Then, all of a sudden, we started to live beyond our means. We 
needed things we never dreamed we would need. We needed a 
pickup truck. We needed a car also. Then all of a sudden we 
realized we were losing implement dealerships and we had to go 
further and further. Why? Because taxes kept increasing. Taxes 
went up, up, up.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	The amount of taxes that today have to be paid by a young family 
running a half section farm is unbelievable. They have to have an 
outside job or they cannot survive on a half section farm. They 
need at least a two section farm to make it viable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6577"> 6577 </A></B>
<P>
	If you cannot raise half a million dollars today you cannot start 
farming because of over taxation, because of all the government 
programs.
<P>
	In 1957 I needed $10,000 to buy a farm which my dad put up for 
me. That is all I needed. Today you cannot even buy a garden 
tractor for that. Why? Tell me why. We have the same land, we 
have the same natural resources but we have lived beyond our 
means.
<P>
	Canada's debt is $600 billion. It will never be paid in my lifetime 
or that of my children or my grandchildren. That is debt we 
borrowed on the backs of future generations. We must give the 
consumer some buying power.
<P>
	In 1991 a family could buy an average sized car with 28 weeks of 
work. In 1996 statisticians tell us that it takes 36 weeks to buy the 
same type of car. How are consumers supposed to be able to buy 
the products that they need? Sixty per cent of the domestic 
economy is still driven by consumer spending.
<P>
	When the prime interest rate is at 3.5 per cent and consumers 
cannot afford to spend, something is wrong in the country. The 
buying power is gone to a few elite people. That is why we are 
directing this tax credit to the lower income families because an 
$850 tax credit to that family buys a lot of stuff for them as 
compared to the elite.
<P>
	The other thing that has happened is that today a lot of high paid 
people are running corporations. These multimillionaires do not 
pay a cent of tax. They do not even need this tax credit. However, 
our $600 billion debt has to have the interest paid on it. Who is 
paying it? The middle income earners, the low income earners.
<P>
	With our new fresh start program we will take almost one 
million people out of that tax bracket, or at least lower it for 89 per 
cent to give them some buying power. When they have buying 
power then the economy is going to start booming again like it did 
in the fifties and the sixties.
<P>
	We have to realize that we have had 40 years of Conservative 
and Liberal governments that had a lot of good ideas and we are 
bankrupt. If a farmer or a businessman had that debt load compared 
to his income as the government has today he would be foreclosed 
on.
<P>
	I see the hon. member wants to ask another question, so I will 
give him some time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Madam Speaker, I agree 
with many parts of the member's comments. I agree with the 
statement that consumer spending is what drives a big part of this 
economy. I think the member mentioned that close to 60 per cent of 
the economy is made up of consumer spending.
<P>
	That leads me to ask the member a question about monetary 
policy. I personally believe that one of the real challenges we have 
in the House is to review the whole monetary policy, in other 
words, the management of the distribution of money in this 
country. As a member pointed out a couple of days ago, the Bank of 
Canada is totally independent of this Chamber. The relationship 
with banks is such that they can decide basically on their own what 
monetary policy is all about in this country.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	I would like to ask the member, one of the leaders of the Reform 
Party, if he would agree that the issue of monetary policy needs 
serious debate in this Chamber.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
his question. I happen to agree with him, but I do not have the 
answers. I am a farmer. I am not a financial wizard. However, I 
know that if I spend more than I make I will get into financial 
difficulty.
<P>
	That is what this country has done. It has spent more money than 
it has received in revenue. It has had to borrow. Whether we blame 
that on the Bank Act or whether we blame it on the people who run 
the government and who should look after the Bank Act is the 
question. I believe it is the government who is to blame. It has 
allowed the banks to get a crippling hold on us. When you owe 
banks money they own you. When we do not owe them money they 
come to us to borrow it. That is the big problem. I hope I have 
clarified that somewhat.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am very pleased to be able to speak today on the Reform Party 
motion which calls for the child care tax deduction to be converted 
to a tax credit.
<P>
	I was interested in the comments of my colleague, the member 
for Broadview-Greenwood, when he asked the Reform Party 
member who spoke earlier about this new generosity of spirit as it 
relates to social programs. It seems to be a new position which has 
been taken by the Reform Party. I thought I heard a hint of increase 
in corporate taxes as well.
<P>
	I will be sharing my time today with the hon. member for Parry 
Sound-Muskoka.
<P>
	As members have said today, when the Reform Party refers to a 
child care tax deduction, I believe it is really referring to the child 
care expense deduction. It is a matter of terminology and wording, 
but it is a point which should be clarified.
<P>
	I am firmly committed to child care programs. I support a strong 
federal government role in the area of child care support. In fact, 
the government is on record as supporting a national child care 
program. The obstacle, certainly in the province of Ontario, is 
getting the provincial government to agree to cost share the 
program. Some would say that if the provincial governments will 
not cost share, why does the federal government not move 
unilaterally? I believe it would be wrong to do that. I do not see any 
rationale, in terms of  fiscal policy or public policy, which would 
indicate that the federal government should unilaterally move on a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6578"> 6578 </A></B>
<P>
national day care program, even though I feel strongly that we need 
one.
<P>
	Perhaps members of the Reform Party will talk to their 
colleagues at Queen's Park. They certainly seem to have their ear 
on many issues. Maybe they could convince them that they should 
move swiftly to co-operate with the federal government on a child 
care program.
<P>
	Coming back to the specific motion which is before the House 
today, not unlike many Reform Party initiatives, it provides no 
relief to the individuals in our society who need the help most. 
Converting the child care expense deduction to a tax credit benefits 
only those who are paying income tax. Members of the Reform 
Party can talk about numbers here and numbers there and who 
benefits and who does not, but the fact remains that if it is changed 
to a tax credit, or even if it is an income tax deduction, it only 
affects people who are paying income tax.
<P>
	I would like to speak about the individuals in my riding who are 
on unemployment insurance or welfare. They would not benefit 
from what is being proposed in this motion. These are the people 
who need it the most. Let me provide a specific example.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	In my riding in Etobicoke North there are many members of the 
Somali community and many single parents, many mothers 
separated from their husbands with large families to support and 
maintain. In many cases they have no child care support so they 
cannot leave their dwelling to learn English. If they could learn 
English, they could better integrate into Canadian society. A child 
care tax credit with respect will do nothing for these individuals. 
There are many other individuals in our society who are in the same 
predicament.
<P>
	Besides this major reservation of mine for this motion, the 
motion states that the Income Tax Act currently has a bias against 
parents caring for their children. Nothing could be further from the 
truth. Our government currently provides nearly $1 billion in tax 
assistance to families who provide care in the home for dependants. 
This is in addition to the $5 billion that the federal government 
provides in child tax benefit assistance.
<P>
	Let me describe first the assistance the Income Tax Act provides 
to both parents and children and to persons with disabilities and 
families caring for elderly or disabled relatives. The child care 
expense deduction, which has been referred to today by my 
colleagues opposite, helps parents with modest incomes with child 
care expenses they incur while earning income or attending school 
full time or taking an eligible vocational training course.
<P>
	In addition to the regular child tax benefit of $1,020 for each 
child, the child tax benefit supplement helps parents who choose to 
remain in the home to raise preschool age children. Assistance is 
provided to modest income families who have preschool age 
children but do not have deductible child care expenses. The 
supplement is $213 for each child six years old or younger.
<P>
	Some of the Reform Party members earlier spoke of their models 
and of consultants who have run the numbers. I can say that the 
models I am familiar with indicate that the motion before us today 
would really impact beneficially 25 per cent of those people in this 
predicament and need.
<P>
	The working income supplement is another. It helps low income 
working class families meet some of the extra costs related to 
earning employment income with a non-taxable benefit of up to 
$500. Changes introduced in the 1996 budget will double the 
supplement to $1,000. The working income supplement is 
available to two income families as well as single earner families 
where one spouse stays at home as a caregiver.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Income Tax Act also provides assistance to persons with 
disabilities and to families caring for elderly or disabled relatives.
<P>
	The disability tax credit provides important benefits for persons 
suffering from long term mental or physical disabilities. It reduces 
applicants' federal tax by approximately $720 and is equivalent to 
a tax rate of 17 per cent. The unused portion of the credit can be 
transferred to a parent contributing to the support of the disabled 
person.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Additionally we have the medical expense tax credit which 
provides tax relief to those with extraordinary medical expenses by 
providing a credit for medical expenses up to $5,000 in respect of 
part time attendant care expenses. This is specifically intended to 
help families caring for elderly or disabled relatives at home by 
providing tax assistance for part time or temporary attendant care. 
Families who care for elderly or disabled relatives can claim the 
unused amounts of the credit.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Persons caring for disabled relatives may also claim a disabled 
dependent credit, which was significantly increased in the 1996 
budget. The credit reduces the federal tax payable by a maximum 
of $400, or the equivalent of a maximum deduction of $2,352 for a 
person whose income is in the 17 per cent tax bracket.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Reform Party motion states that the government should 
convert the child care tax credit, meaning I believe as I stated 
earlier, the child care expense deduction to a tax credit. However, 
there is no discussion of the cost to the government of such a tax 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6579"> 6579 </A></B>
<P>
expenditure. I find this most surprising from the Reform Party 
because it is supposed to be a fiscally responsible party. Perhaps I 
should not be surprised given its recent flip-flop from its focus on 
the deficit to its focus on tax reductions.
<P>
	In the next few weeks I will supporting Bill C-214, a private 
member's bill proposed by the hon. member for Durham which 
calls for a full disclosure of costs for all legislation introduced into 
this House.
<P>
	I have stated before in this House that the best social policies are 
jobs in a healthy economy. When the Minister of Finance brings in 
his budget next year I am quite confident he will not introduce 
measures such as this one to assist individuals in our society who 
do not need help or those who are already benefiting significantly 
from benefits already in the Income Tax Act. For this reason, I will 
not be supporting the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
suspect that this hon. gentleman, as every other one of the Liberals 
who have stood up, have not taken the time to look at the Reform's 
actual document, the fresh start for Canadians. In taking a look at it 
they would realize that there is a very specific plan.
<P>
	Let me talk specifically about the fact that we would be 
increasing the basic amount of the basic personal deduction from 
$6,456 to $7,900.
<P>
	I have two questions and I will keep them very short. I wonder if 
this member and every other member of the Liberal caucus is 
aware of this fact. Since 1983-and we always say, Liberal, Tory, 
same old story, and the Tories started this-they decided that they 
were going to de-index the relationship of the basic personal 
exemption from anything to do with inflation unless it exceeded 3 
per cent. This was really cute because obviously if inflation only 
went to 2.9 per cent, then the basic exemption would not increase. 
It was a very subtle and quiet way and one which most Canadians 
were not aware of that if there had been full indexing as originally 
had been envisioned with the basic exemption, that in fact the basic 
exemption today instead of being $6,400 and change would be 
$7,800 and change.
<P>
	It is no coincidence then that the Reform Party is simply giving 
back to Canadians that which the Liberals and the Tories have taken 
away. When we increase the basic exemption from $6,400 to 
$7,900 we change the fact that the people at the low end of the scale 
who are earning for the sake of argument, $500, $600 or $1,000 a 
month, would suddenly find themselves not paying any tax at all. 
That by the way is also part of the story where we are increasing the 
spousal amount from $5,380 to $7,900 as well.
<P>
	I wonder if the member is also aware of the way that he and the 
Tories have been very quietly taking money from people. In fact we 
have been accused of doing a flip-flop on the $4 billion to be able 
to support health care and the Reform Party position is that after we 
have achieved a balanced budget we would then proceed to put $4 
billion back into health care. It is he and his colleagues over a two 
year period who have removed $7 billion from that package, yet 
they have the audacity to say that we are the people who are doing 
the cuts. It is the Liberals who have done the cuts and the Reform 
Party is going to put the cuts back where they should never have 
been taken from in the first place.
<P>
	Is the member aware of the fact that this basic exemption creep 
has been happening as a result of the traditional old parties just 
taking more and more money out of Canadians' pockets? Is he also 
aware of the fact that it is he and his colleagues who have removed 
$7 billion from health care funding in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cullen:</B> Madam Speaker, on the first question I would 
comment in a couple of ways, first on the indexing of the basic 
exemption. I have not seen the member's numbers. Frankly I am 
not sure if he is planning to give us the fresh start document as a 
stocking stuffer but I would be glad to read it over the holidays.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	The member opposite was talking about the rate of inflation in 
Canada monetary policy. It is clear that inflation has been kept to a 
very low level. I would be surprised if those numbers even if 
indexing went forward would produce the kind of difference the 
member is talking about but I would be glad to look at his numbers.
<P>
	As a government we would like to implement a lot of things and 
do more with tax but our job is to reduce the deficit. It is quite 
intriguing that the member talks about the Reform plan to first 
balance the budget and then put money into social programs. It was 
only six or eight months ago that the Reform Party was talking 
about reducing or completely eliminating the national debt. It was 
only in the last election that the Reform Party was talking of cuts of 
$12 billion out of social programs. In addition to what the finance 
minister had in his fiscal plan, now the member is talking about 
putting money into social programs. This new approach I find 
refreshing but it is a little inconsistent.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Mitchell (Parry Sound-Muskoka, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to rise in debate on this 
motion by the third party.
<P>
	We can probably begin the debate by certainly agreeing that 
everybody in this House and indeed every Canadian in the land 
would support the concept that we need to help children in 
Canadian society. I do not think anybody would disagree with that. 
However the way that the Reform Party has made this suggestion 
does not totally provide all of the facts and ramifications to the 
Canadian people. It is important that we do just that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6580"> 6580 </A></B>
<P>
	First of all, the actual concept of how this would work is not 
spelled out either in the resolution nor is it spelled out that I can see 
in the Reform's particular plan. Reform talked about it being turned 
into a tax credit. Is it an equivalent tax credit or is it a tax credit for 
the amount of the deduction? They are not clear about that and it 
makes a tremendous amount of difference on the economic impact 
of this item.
<P>
	Is it going to be a refundable or non-refundable tax credit? Again 
not only is that an important concept in terms of the fiscal 
ramifications but the way Reform is planning to work this socially 
makes a big difference on whether it is refundable or 
non-refundable.
<P>
	Regardless of which way the Reform come at it, and to be fair to 
the Canadian people they ought to be saying which way they want 
to approach this, this is going to be a tremendous cost to the 
Canadian taxpayer. Estimates I have received from various sources 
range from $1 billion up to $12 billion. I think that $5 billion to put 
this plan in place is probably a pretty good bet. Is it worth $5 
billion? Perhaps, but what the Reform Party fails to tell us in the 
House and Canadians in general is where it is going to get that $5 
billion. What will Reform cut? What is Reform going to take it 
away from? How is it going to fund this?
<P>
	The Reform Party talks about honesty and integrity in 
government, yet it makes a major proposal like this one and it does 
not clearly identify where that money is going to come from. 
Reform ought to do that. I will get to Reform's green book in just a 
minute.
<P>
	The expanded plan is going to deal with 25 per cent of Canadian 
families. Those families have a need and a requirement as do all 
families in Canada. I have a lot of difficulty when we are putting in 
a program like this one. We could very well be introducing it 
for-and I have often heard this expression before-these 
millionaires who would be able to get tax breaks and so on. There 
are going to be those individuals who will benefit from it.
<P>
	The Reform Party should agree and I think most Canadians 
would agree that in a time of limited financial resources we should 
use those resources for those Canadians who need it most. That is 
why we have a tax system with a child tax benefit built into it 
which that. It helps those Canadians who need it most. Quite 
frankly we should not be surprised that the Reform Party's proposal 
is not well costed or does not make a lot of economic sense. This is 
evident when we look at its overall economic policy and the 
suggestions in its new fresh start.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	In summary, the fresh start proposal suggests cutting taxes, 
putting $4 billion of new money into health care and balancing the 
budget. They will do all this at the same time, starting with the $24 
billion deficit we have today. That is the basis of what Reformers 
are trying to sell to the Canadian people. However Canadian people 
know and basic math tells them that it will not to work.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> It is magic.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> A good word for it.
<P>
	The party opposite suggests that some things be done for 
Canadian families. Reform will reduce our support of health care 
so we will only fund core health care services. This means 
individuals will need supplementary private medical insurance to 
supplement that core.
<P>
	Reformers would make changes to the EI program and have 
talked about eliminating parental leave. That is hardly a policy that 
supports family. They will eliminate the Canada pension plan. 
They want to replace it with RRSPs. Again individuals will have to 
buy into their own plans. It seems the people who will be helped by 
this will be the banks and insurance companies that sell RRSPs and 
private insurance. Perhaps they are the beneficiaries.
<P>
	I agree with the party across the way that low income families 
will get tax cuts. That is absolutely right. However high income 
families will get even bigger tax cuts, and that is not the way we 
work in this country. When we have limited financial resources we 
make sure Canadians who need the help most receive the most 
help.
<P>
	Several times in today's debate we have heard members opposite 
hark back to the good old days of the fifties and sixties. That speaks 
volumes. It shows the Reform Party looks to the past. It is not 
capable of handling the present and certainly has no vision for the 
future.
<P>
	More than that, it shows the Reform Party does not understand 
the basic fabric of Canada. It does not understand that we are more 
than individuals, that we are more than just small islands unto 
ourselves, or that Canadians form a society. For 50 years we have 
recognized that we have a collective responsibility to each other, 
that one Canadian helps another Canadian who helps another 
Canadian, and that we have the vehicles in government to allow 
that to happen.
<P>
	That is why Canadians support an old age security system paid 
for by general tax revenue. That is why they support a public 
pension plan so the wealthiest Canadians are not the only ones who 
can afford a pension. That is why Canadians support public health 
care, to ensure every Canadian has an opportunity for health care 
and not just the wealthy.
<P>
	That is what the fabric of Canada is about. That is what 
Canadians support and that is why Canadians elected a Liberal 
government and will elect a Liberal government again.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Swift Current-Maple 
Creek-Assiniboia, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I love those caring, 
sharing Liberals: 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6581"> 6581 </A></B>
<P>
``From each according to his ability to each according to his 
needs''. I think I heard that before somewhere.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Come on across.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> That was a quote from Karl Marx. It is a pity the 
hon. member was not here during the day when all this was being 
debated. He would have heard the answers to most of the questions 
he raised in his little diatribe.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> He has never read his red book.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> He should have read the background material, 
the fresh start booklet and the independent analysis stating that our 
numbers work, that the cuts we have suggested can me made 
without, as he says, tearing the heart out of our social programs.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> I never said that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> I am paraphrasing with a little hyperbole. Let us 
take one specific example the Liberals love, the false accusation 
that the Reform Party is out to destroy medicare.
<P>
	Which government cut $6 billion out of the transfers to the 
provinces in the last three and a half years?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That would not be the Liberals.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> I do not think it was Reform. We are not 
government yet.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> And never will be.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> It must have been these caring, sharing Liberals 
who gutted medicare, hung the provinces out to dry, cut the total 
federal contribution down to 23 per cent and in effect told the 
provinces to go out and get it wherever they could find it because 
they were through with meeting their obligations.
<P>
	Would the hon. member comment on that and perhaps tell us 
how they can at the same time be caring, sharing and gutting a 
national program which incidentally started under a Liberal 
government?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Madam Speaker, I particularly appreciate the last 
comment from the member when he pointed out that public health 
care was put in place by a Liberal government. He is darned right it 
was put in place by a Liberal government and maintained by the 
Liberal government all of these years because Canadians wanted it.
<P>
	The member opposite pointed out something that is very 
important, something Canadians understand and, most important, 
something the Liberal government understands: that as a 
government we have two responsibilities and not just the one of 
fiscal responsibility the Reform talks about all the time.
<P>
	Our record on the fiscal side has been one of achievement. The 
deficit has been reduced. When the budgetary plan of the Minister 
of Finance flows out it will have been reduced 80 per cent. We will 
reach a point with the latest budget plan where we will no longer 
need to borrow. It will be the first time in 30 years we have been 
able to do that. There have been a 21 per cent reduction in 
departmental spending and a 14 per cent reduction in program 
spending.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I am sorry but 
I would at least like to hear what the member is saying.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morrison:</B> But we don't.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Madam Speaker, the government has done a good 
job on its fiscal responsibility. It has made the reductions that were 
necessary. It has reduced the deficit without having to raise 
personal income tax rates.
<P>
	In stepping up to that fiscal responsibility, something the 
government had not done for 10 years prior to this party coming to 
power, we understood we had a social responsibility to Canadians, 
a responsibility to make sure that when individuals go to hospital 
they are not first asked how much money they have or, if we were 
to follow the Reform plan, which insurance company they are 
insured with. That is not what Canadians are asked when they go to 
a hospital today. They are asked how sick they are and how they 
can be helped.
<P>
<B>(1710 )</B>
<P>
	That is the kind of nation we have been able to form because we 
understand that government has a dual responsibility. We 
understand the government has a fiscal responsibility to ensure that 
each and every taxpayer's dollar is spent in the most efficient 
manner. We have been doing that as a government. The results are 
there for everybody to see. The 94 per cent of Canadians who do 
not support the party opposite understand that. At the same time we 
understand our social responsibility to individual Canadians and 
the basic fabric of this nation that is Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
wonder if the member could help us understand something. He is 
very proud of the fact that the Liberal government set up medicare. 
At that time the irrevocable promise never to be broken was that it 
would always be funded on a 50:50 basis: 50 per cent by the federal 
government and 50 per cent by the provincial governments.
<P>
	Now he turns around and says: ``We are the protectors of 
medicare''. They removed $6 billion or $7 billion over the last 
couple of years and are down to 20 per cent of the funding, not 50 
per cent. This is one of the best kept secrets in Canada. The 
Liberals are getting away with it wholesale.
<P>
	I know the member is a very honourable gentleman. He certainly 
would want the Canadian people to know and to understand that it 
was he and his colleagues who removed $7 billion from health 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6582"> 6582 </A></B>
<P>
care. Only 20 per cent of  the funding for health care is covered by 
the federal government. He knows that.
<P>
	Would he be prepared to admit in the smallest way that maybe 
some of the Liberal talk about being the protectors of health care is 
perhaps a little thin? In actual fact it is the federal Liberal 
government that is destroying health care funding, forcing 
provincial governments to make very hard and very difficult 
decisions, and letting provincial governments take the fall when it 
is the Liberals who are short-changing them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Madam Speaker, the Liberal government has and 
will continue to ensure through the sound fiscal management we 
have applied in the last three years that social programs will be 
sustained for the future.
<P>
	It is interesting to look at the questions framed on this issue. As I 
said in my speech, where is the vision or where is the view? It is to 
the past. It is back to the good old days, whenever those were. The 
vision is backward. It is back there, and back there happens to be 
right across the way.
<P>
	They do not have a plan for today. They do not have the fiscal 
management tools and plans we have put in place. Even worse, 
they do not have a vision for the future because they do not 
understand the fabric of Canadian society. They do not understand 
that Canadians recognize they are more than individuals, that we 
are a society of individuals, that we have a collective responsibility 
to each other, and that it is through government we exercise that 
collective responsibility, understanding both the need to be fiscally 
prudent and the need to exercise social responsibility.
<P>
	That is what Canada is all about. That is what Canadians are all 
about. That is the type of government the Liberal government is 
bringing to the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Madam Speaker, how does the member feel about 
the fact that his party is building up a $10 billion surplus in 
employment insurance funds at the cost of jobs to Canadians? His 
party is not lowering what has now become a job tax. Does he 
support his party's trying to lower the deficit of Canada on the 
backs of companies and workers by enlarging the surplus to $10 
billion?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mitchell:</B> Madam Speaker, yes, I am proud of the fact that 
our government has cut the UI premiums three years in a row. They 
have been cut three years in a row.
<P>
	I was pleased to see that we put in place a program to help 
companies and encourage them to hire employees. Most important, 
I am absolutely glad that we understand as a government the 
importance of having a UI surplus so that if the economy goes into 
a recession, unlike last time when we had to raise premiums at 
exactly the wrong time, we will have a surplus there so increases 
will not be necessary and jobs will be protected.
<P>

	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.)</B> moved 
that Bill C-223, an act to amend the Citizenship Act (oath of 
allegiance), be read the second time and referred to committee.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, Bill C-223 proposes to amend the 
Citizenship Act and, in particular, to amend the oath of allegiance 
which individuals must take when they become new citizens. For 
the most part these are immigrants who have been resident in 
Canada for at least three years and have met the requirements for 
Canadian citizenship. In order to finally become a citizen they must 
take the oath of allegiance.
<P>
	At present the oath of allegiance reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I swear (or affirm) that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty 
Queen Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Canada, Her Heirs and Successors, and that I 
will faithfully observe the laws of Canada and fulfil my duties as a Canadian citizen.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It is my experience that this oath comes as a surprise to many 
new citizens. Many cannot understand why, if they are becoming 
Canadian citizens, the principal thrust of this oath is to pledge 
allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II who, in their opinion, is a citizen 
of the United Kingdom and not truly representative of Canada.
<P>
	The purpose of this oath and any oath of allegiance is to pledge 
allegiance to assure loyalty and to assure good citizenship. 
Consequently, one would expect that the principal thrust would be 
allegiance to Canada, to assure loyalty to Canada and good 
Canadian citizenship and not loyalty to Queen Elizabeth II.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6588"> 6588 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	The present oath is ambiguous. It speaks of allegiance to Queen 
Elizabeth II, and later asks persons ``to fulfil one's duties as a 
Canadian citizen''. This is confusing and ambiguous. At a time 
when national unity is under attack there should be no ambiguity 
and no confusion with respect to our oath of allegiance. It should be 
absolutely clear that our loyalty is to Canada and not, 
unfortunately, to the tainted monarchy in the United Kingdom.
<P>
	As a result my proposed oath, which is in the bill, would read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I swear (or affirm) that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Canada and the 
Constitution of Canada, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of Canada and 
fulfil my duties as a Canadian citizen.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That oath is not ambiguous. There would be no confusion in the 
minds of new citizens. In taking such an oath they would know that 
they were making a serious commitment to Canada.
<P>
	The present oath refers to Queen Elizabeth II as the Queen of 
Canada. It is true that the present Citizenship Act and some other 
laws use the expression ``the Queen of Canada'' but it is a legal 
fiction. It is not a reality. Queen Elizabeth II is as English as you 
can get. She is not a Canadian. She is not representative of Canada.
<P>
	In recent history there have been several occasions when Canada 
disagreed with the United Kingdom and voted against the United 
Kingdom at the United Nations. The most flagrant case was in the 
Suez crisis, when according to the legal fiction the Queen of 
Canada voted against the Queen of England even though she is the 
same person.
<P>
	If we want citizens to be truly loyal to Canada should we use 
such an absurd fiction? This proposal to change the oath of 
allegiance is consistent with other steps which we in Canada have 
taken since the end of the second world war to assert our national 
identity and our maturity.
<P>
	I have in mind first of all the Citizenship Act of 1947. Prior to 
1947 we did not have a Citizenship Act. We were merely British 
subjects. The first Canadian Governor General was appointed in 
the late 1940s. Prior to that we had English Governors General. 
Since that time all our Governors General have been Canadian.
<P>
	In the late 1940s the Privy Council was abolished as the final 
court of appeal for Canada and the Supreme Court of Canada was 
established as our final court of appeal. In 1964 the present 
Canadian flag was adopted as our unique and only Canadian flag. 
In the 1980s O Canada was adopted as our national anthem and we 
no longer have God Save the Queen as our anthem. Finally in 1981 
the Constitution was repatriated to make our Constitution a fully 
Canadian document.
<P>
	Recent studies and polls have supported such a change. Last 
summer consultants for the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration held 12 sessions with Canadian citizens in various 
cities of Canada: Vancouver, Lethbridge, Toronto, Montreal, 
Trois-Rivières and Halifax. Strong opposition was voiced in these 
sessions by citizens to swearing allegiance to the Queen. Most 
preferred an oath which pledged loyalty to Canada.
<P>
	A similar study was done when David Crombie was secretary of 
state in a Conservative government in 1987, but unfortunately no 
change was made at that time.
<P>
	This is not a bill to abolish the monarchy. It is simply to change 
the emphasis in our oath of allegiance. The abolition of the 
monarchy would require a constitutional amendment and I am not 
proposing a constitutional amendment. My proposal is to pledge 
allegiance to the Constitution of Canada. It still includes the 
monarchy so it is a question of emphasis.
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	This bill would not abolish the monarchy but is consistent with 
other measures taken. It would downplay the role of the monarchy 
in Canada as it was when we adopted O Canada as our national 
anthem rather than God Save the Queen, when we adopted the 
Canadian flag, the Canadian Governor General and so on. I am 
proposing that we continue in the same tradition.
<P>
	This change would not in any way change our role in the 
Commonwealth. Several Commonwealth countries like India and 
others are republics yet they still remain strong members of the 
Commonwealth and accept the Queen as the head of the 
Commonwealth, but that is a different matter.
<P>
	I am proposing an oath which will emphasize Canada rather than 
Queen Elizabeth II. I am not wed to the exact words of the new oath 
in my bill. If someone in this House or elsewhere can come up with 
better words or expressions that have the same goal, to place the 
emphasis on Canada, then I would certainly be pleased to accept 
such a change.
<P>
	My goal in doing this is Canadian unity and loyalty to a united 
Canada. The people of the United Kingdon are our friends and 
allies but they are a separate, independent country and no longer 
the masters of Canada. Let us have a made in Canada oath for 
Canadians, for Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to speak to Bill C-223 on the oath of 
allegiance, tabled on March 6 by the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce.
<P>
	The hon. member proposes to replace the present oath of 
allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, her heirs and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6589"> 6589 </A></B>
<P>
successors, with an oath of allegiance to Canada  and the 
Constitution of Canada. The new text would read as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I swear (<I>or</I> affirm) that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Canada and 
the Constitution of Canada, and that I will faithfully observe the laws of Canada and 
fulfil my duties as a Canadian citizen.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is the fourth time the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce has tabled this kind of bill. The other bills 
were introduced in 1972, 1988, 1989 and 1991.
<P>
	Some of the arguments made by the hon. member in support of 
this bill are as follows: the Queen is the head of state of several 
Commonwealth countries; it is hard to decide to whom our loyalty 
should go, when Canada has a disagreement with other 
Commonwealth countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia 
or New Zealand.
<P>
	We note that citizens of British origin, which include the hon. 
member, represent only 23 per cent of the Canadian population. 
The remaining percentage consists of francophones, native people 
and people from many other countries.
<P>
	As we know, all new citizens must swear allegiance to Her 
Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, her heirs and successors. Immigrants 
come from all over the globe: from China, India, Italy, Portugal, 
Poland, Chile, El Salvador, Algeria, Morocco, and so forth. In fact, 
more than one third of the Canadian population comes from 
countries other than Great Britain or France.
<P>
	Immigrants come here and after three years' residence, they can 
apply for Canadian citizenship. Please note they did not apply for 
British or any other citizenship. Some of them are confused and do 
not understand to whom they are swearing allegiance. In fact, 
according to the present wording of the oath, they swear allegiance 
to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. To some people, swearing this 
oath of allegiance does not mean much, while others do so 
reluctantly. I myself swore allegiance to the Queen in 1978, when I 
became a Canadian citizen, and in 1993 before taking up my duties 
as a member of Parliament. I felt it was somewhat anachronistic to 
have to swear allegiance to a foreign queen.
<P>
	According to the hon. member, Bill C-223 is entirely in line with 
the Canadianization of institutions, symbols and traditions that has 
been going on since the end of the Second World War. It is 
interesting to note that formerly, governors general were always 
British subjects. The Privy Council in London was the court of last 
resort. It has since been replaced by the Supreme Court of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	Canadian citizenship has been in existence only since 1940. 
Before that time, Canadians were British subjects. The flag was 
adopted in 1964, followed by a Canadian national anthem.
<P>
	According to public opinion polls, a significant percentage of 
Canadians believe it is time Canada broke its ties with the 
monarchy. This percentage is even higher in Quebec.
<P>
	In 1994, acting on a specific request from the ministers, the 
Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration, of which I 
am vice-chairman, started an analysis of the Citizenship Act, one 
of the main points of which is the oath of allegiance.
<P>
	A number of witnesses analyzed the role of the monarchy, since 
the oath refers to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. Some people 
wanted the oath to remain as is, since it reflects the constitutional 
nature of Canada, whose head of state is the Queen. Many 
witnesses, however, came out in favour of eliminating all 
references to the monarchy. They wanted the oath to give pride of 
place to Canada as a country. This would better reflect the diversity 
that is so typical of our society.
<P>
	The committee decided to recommend a new version of the oath 
which would continue to refer to the monarchy while adding 
Canada. In a minority report, the Bloc Quebecois came out against 
this version.
<P>
	Although I agree with eliminating any references to the Queen 
and to the monarchy in general, I cannot support the text proposed 
by the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce. This version 
favours swearing allegiance to the Constitution of Canada, which 
Quebec never ratified. We should recall that Quebec had certain 
demands and that despite its refusal to ratify the process, Canada 
decided in 1981 to patriate the Constitution. The federal 
government ignored the historic rights of the only French-speaking 
society in Canada.
<P>
	In 1994, Australia, another Commonwealth country, removed all 
references to the queen in its oath of allegiance, which it calls 
``Pledge of Commitment''.
<P>
	The former Minister of Citizenship and Immigration had 
promised to table in the fall of 1994 a bill to amend the Citizenship 
Act, a promise the government has so far failed to keep. In 1995, 
the Department of Immigration had a meeting in Vancouver with 
ten authors and five public servants to revise and draft a new oath, 
which reads as follows:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``I am a citizen of Canada and I make this commitment to uphold 
all our laws and freedoms, to respect our people in their diversity, 
to work for our common well-being and to safeguard and honour 
this ancient northern land''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
The wording is not the inspiration of the century, despite the 
$30,000 cost to taxpayers.
<P>
	Shortly after her appointment in January, the new minister 
declared that the country needed a new oath of allegiance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6590"> 6590 </A></B>
<P>
	I have noted that the debate on the oath of citizenship and the 
monarchy is often very heated in English Canada, while it is not 
important in Quebec. This is another difference between Quebec 
and Canada. The Quebec National Assembly has just passed a 
motion calling essentially for the abolishment of the position of 
lieutenant-governor, as it is primarily symbolic and a hold over 
from a colonial past.
<P>
	For these reasons and especially because Quebec was left out of 
the Constitution, I must vote against Bill C-223.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak to Bill C-223 proposed by the 
hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce. This bill aims to amend 
the Citizenship Act with respect to the oath of allegiance.
<P>
	Currently, new citizens of Canada are obliged to recite an oath 
that is for all intents and purposes claimed by many to be lacking in 
contemporary elements. They say that the current oath does not 
truly represent present day views of the rights and responsibilities 
of Canadian citizenship. As new eras come an go we can expect 
that certain beliefs, behaviours and traditions will be changed in 
some way. This is simply the nature of history as we know it.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	Before us today is an opportunity to make a change in the way in 
which new citizens first experience our country. The new oath 
would ask new citizens to pledge allegiance to Canada and the 
Constitution of Canada, faithfully observe the laws of Canada and 
fulfil their duties as Canadian citizens.
<P>
	For those who choose to become Canadians, taking the oath 
before a citizenship judge is the final step in becoming a Canadian 
citizen. With citizenship comes numerous responsibilities for 
helping to build a stronger, more vital Canada. These 
responsibilities could be better highlighted by emphasizing a 
pledge of allegiance specifically to Canada and the Canadian 
Constitution and the laws of the land.
<P>
	The time is right for such an amendment. Changing the oath to 
make it more contemporary does not imply that other existing ties 
and traditions as described in our Constitution would be 
eliminated. Nothing could be further from the truth. The fact of the 
matter is that our Constitution explicitly outlines the nature of 
Canada's relationship with certain symbols and traditions. These 
symbols, traditions and institutions cannot in any way, shape or 
form be altered through an amendment to the present oath of 
citizenship.
<P>
	It is much more important in these times of strained national 
unity to promote Canada to our new citizens. What better 
mechanism could we utilize than the citizenship ceremony and the 
oath of citizenship?
<P>
	We should really take this opportunity to let new Canadians 
know that Canadians are not afraid to stand strong and proud for 
their country. We should let them know that we are not afraid to 
pledge allegiance directly to Canada.
<P>
	Let us examine more carefully the significance of an oath of 
allegiance to one's country. To first generation Canadians as well as 
to families that have been here for many generations an oath may 
be simply a verbal expression of one's love of one's country. Others 
say it is simply a necessary condition of citizenship.
<P>
	It is more than a verbal expression. I see it as a declaration of 
faith, a declaration of trust in all that my country has done, all that 
my country is doing and all that my country will do to improve and 
enhance my life, the lives of my family members and the lives of 
all Canadians.
<P>
	To the new Canadian it is a declaration of acceptance, accepting 
the laws, the rules and regulations of a highly organized and 
developed society. It is a declaration of belief and trust in Canada's 
people, its governments, its institutions, its laws and all that the 
new Canadian perceives about Canada at that very special moment 
when the oath of allegiance is stated.
<P>
	This is done on a voluntary basis. Out of the dozens of choices 
available, the new Canadian has chosen Canada. The new Canadian 
has faith.
<P>
	From a very personal viewpoint, as I declare my allegiance to 
Canada and all that it represents, I feel that I am making a serious 
obligation to commit myself to doing whatever I am capable of 
doing to reciprocate for what my country has done for me directly 
or indirectly. It is a personal relationship with my country, a sacred 
relationship that stirs the emotions. I too have faith.
<P>
	Speaking of emotions, the citizens of this country recently 
experienced services of remembrance for all those who sacrificed 
so much during times of international strife. We emotionally paid 
special tribute to those who have made the ultimate sacrifice.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	Do we believe for a moment that Canadians who came from 
Saskatchewan lost their lives only to protect the citizens of 
Saskatchewan? Of course not. Do we believe that the Canadians 
from Ontario lost their lives only in the defence of the freedoms the 
citizens of Ontario enjoy? Of course not. Do we believe that the 
young Canadians from Quebec died so that only future generations 
in Quebec could enjoy the highest standard and quality of life in the 
world? Certainly not.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6591"> 6591 </A></B>
<P>
	All those who served and paid the ultimate sacrifice did so with 
one objective in mind: to defend and preserve the democratic way 
of life in Canada. They too had faith. They had faith that future 
generations would carry the torch of freedom for all Canadians and 
this would be revealed through a declaration of allegiance to 
Canada.
<P>
	In my riding of Thunder Bay I receive on a daily basis all forms 
of expressions of love for this great and wonderful country of ours. 
Not only do the people express it, they also demonstrate it through 
their behaviour and their relationships with each other.
<P>
	My riding is composed of many ethnic communities and they 
most vehemently support the Canadian way of life. They are more 
than accommodating, more than tolerant of each other. They learn 
from each other by sharing and demonstrating their cultural 
differences. They certainly are dismayed by any anti-Canada act 
performed by individuals, by special single issue groups and by 
national or provincial political leaders with overinflated egos who 
lust for power and control at the expense of all other Canadians.
<P>
	Many of the citizens of Thunder Bay and Atikokan are first 
generation Canadians who came to Canada because they, like the 
rest of the world, saw Canada as a symbol of hope. Canada has 
reached a stage in its evolution that no other country can match. It 
is a sophisticated civilized society in which societal differences can 
survive in harmony.
<P>
	The path we follow as we attempt to further enhance our 
Canadian way of life has many obstacles, but these can be 
overcome in a civilized and rational manner. We must have a 
beacon to guide us. I firmly believe, as do the vast majority of 
Canadians, that the beacon is an oath of allegiance to Canada and 
all that it implies.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak to Bill C-223 put 
forward by the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce. His bill 
calls for amending the oath of Canadian citizenship.
<P>
	The current oath reads as follows: ``I swear that I will be faithful 
and bear true allegiance to her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, Queen 
of Canada, her heirs and successors, and that I will faithfully 
observe the laws of Canada and fulfil my duties as a Canadian 
citizen''. Bill C-223 would replace that oath with the following: ``I 
swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Canada and 
the Constitution of Canada and that I will faithfully observe the 
laws of Canada and fulfil my duties as a Canadian citizen''.
<P>
	The bill replaces the oath of allegiance to the monarchy with an 
oath of allegiance to Canada and the Canadian Constitution. 
Although this bill only changes a handful of words, it is actually a 
very significant change in the very essence of what it means to be a 
Canadian.
<P>
	I will review what it means to be a Canadian citizen. As every 
Canadian schoolchild knows, Canada became a country on July 1, 
1867. Many Canadians may be surprised to learn that while Canada 
has existed for over 129 years, Canadians have existed for less than 
50 years. That is right. There was no such thing in law as a 
Canadian citizen until January 1, 1947. We were considered to be 
British subjects residing in Canada. When travelling abroad we had 
to use British passports. The first Canadian citizenship act did not 
exist until 1946 when It was presented in the House. It received 
royal assent in July 1946 and came into effect January 1, 1947. 
Given this history it is not surprising that many Canadians are at a 
loss to explain what it means to be a Canadian citizen.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	I recall speaking to an immigrant from Pakistan who was proud 
to recently become a Canadian citizen. However, he commented 
that when he took the oath of allegiance it was an oath very similar 
to the one in the country he had left and had very little to do with 
his commitment to his new country.
<P>
	I believe that most Canadians would accept the idea of amending 
the oath of Canadian citizenship to include an oath of allegiance to 
Canada. The controversy is should that oath be allegiance to 
Canada in addition to the oath of allegiance to Her Majesty or 
should the oath of allegiance to Canada replace the oath of 
allegiance to Her Majesty?
<P>
	The hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce has chosen the 
second option. He has replaced reference to Her Majesty with an 
oath of allegiance to Canada and the Canadian Constitution. 
However, he does state that it is understood that Her Majesty is an 
integral part of the Constitution of Canada. I wonder if most 
Canadians would accept that. Do most Canadian accept that Her 
Majesty is an integral part of the Constitution of Canada? I think 
not.
<P>
	The member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce was a member of the 
House in the early 1980s when the repatriation of the Canadian 
Constitution was drafted and as a member for Quebec is is 
painfully aware that the Government of Quebec never consented to 
the repatriation of the Constitution, as the members of the Bloc 
Quebecois point out on a regular basis in the House.
<P>
	Would an oath to the Constitution of Canada mean any more to 
the average Canadian than the current oath to Her Majesty? After 
all, there are 47 different constitutional acts and documents that 
relate to Canada. Of these 47 acts and documents, 30 are mentioned 
in the schedule of the Constitution Act, 1982. I doubt that very few 
of us in the House know which 30 constitutional acts and docu-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6592"> 6592 </A></B>
<P>
ments appear in the schedule of the Constitution, never mind the 
average Canadian.
<P>
	To the average Canadian the Constitution of Canada and the 
subsequent Meech Lake accord of 1987 and the Charlottetown 
accord of 1992 were all deals made by a few men in back rooms. As 
the 1992 referendum on the Charlottetown accord demonstrated, 
when the people have a say on constitutional change, it is not 
necessarily the same one that the politicians have.
<P>
	In my riding the vote against the Charlottetown accord was 71 
per cent. That was not to say that people were happy with the 
current Constitution, but rather that they were unhappy with the 
entire process of constitutional amendments.
<P>
	The Constitution of Canada does not belong only to members of 
this Parliament and the provincial legislatures. It should belong to 
all the people of Canada. If that were to happen, if we could 
develop a Constitution adopted by the majority of Canadian 
citizens, then the oath of Canadian citizenship as proposed by the 
hon. member from Notre-Dame-de-Grâce would have true 
meaning.
<P>
	For us in the House to change the oath of Canadian citizenship 
without consulting with Canadian citizens would be wrong. And I 
do not just mean having a few hand picked advocacy groups 
appearing before the Standing Committee on Citizenship and 
Immigration. I mean letting all Canadians have a say. In true 
Reform Party tradition I did that earlier this year.
<P>
	In a householder survey that was sent out in May, I asked the 
following two questions: (1) should the oath of Canadian 
citizenship be amended to introduce an allegiance to Canada in 
addition to allegiance to the Queen? or; (2) should the oath of 
Canadian citizenship be amended to introduce an allegiance to 
Canada replacing the allegiance to the Queen?
<P>
	I asked my constituents that if they agreed that the oath of 
Canadian citizenship should be amended, which one of these two 
options would be preferable? Almost 95.5 per cent of the 3,209 
constituents who responded to my survey said the oath should be 
changed. Of that total, 40.6 per cent said there should be an 
allegiance to Canada in addition to the allegiance to Her Majesty. 
But 54.8 per cent of respondents agreed that an allegiance to 
Canada should replace the allegiance to Her Majesty.
<P>
	I do not know if the majority of my constituents would agree 
with the wording of Bill C-223. However, it is clear that the 
majority of my constituents agree with the sentiment of the bill.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	Canadians have a lot to be proud of about our country and our 
past, but the fact that Canada existed as a country for almost 80 
years before Canadians existed as a people is not something to be 
proud of.
<P>
	Canada has reached the stage of maturity as a nation that we 
must now have a new oath of allegiance to our  own country. 
However, whatever that allegiance is, it should not be left only to 
the 295 members of the House and those patronage appointees of 
the other place to decide. We need to let all Canadians participate in 
determining what Canadian citizenship really means. We have to 
trust the common sense of the common people.
<P>
	I congratulate the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce for 
putting this important bill before us. It is a shame that it was not 
made a votable item. It reflects poorly upon this House that it was 
not. Sooner or later, and I hope it is sooner, there should be and will 
be an oath of Canadian citizenship in which people actually pledge 
their allegiance to this great country of ours.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> Madam Speaker, I understand that if there are no 
other speakers, as mover of the motion I may close the debate.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Yes, you may 
close the debate. The floor is yours.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> Madam Speaker, I simply want to respond to 
some of the speeches that were made in the House. They were very 
good speeches and very positive.
<P>
	As I said in my opening remarks, I believe the oath must be 
changed to put an emphasis on Canada. I want to assure my 
colleagues from British Columbia and from Thunder Bay that I am 
not wed to the exact formula that is in my bill.
<P>
	Unfortunately this is not a votable bill, but I believe the debate 
was important to give the minister, who is thinking about these 
things, a chance to hear the views of the different parties.
<P>
	It seems there is strong support for changing the oath to put an 
emphasis on Canada. I have proposed that we pledge allegiance to 
Canada and to the Constitution of Canada.
<P>
	I realize that the Constitution of Canada is not always an easy 
concept to grasp. In constitutional law we talk about the 
Constitution of Canada as including all constitutional documents. 
As my hon. friend from British Columbia pointed out, there are 30, 
40 or 50 statutes which make up the Constitution, although the two 
principal documents are the Constitution Act, 1867, formerly 
known as the British North American Act of 1867, and the 
Constitution Act, 1981, the act that repatriated the Constitution.
<P>
	This is not a votable item. However, it appears that there is 
consensus among the various parties of the House that a change is 
needed. Even my friend from the Bloc Quebecois admits that. He 
was on the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration. 
He reported to the House that in the hearings before that committee 
there was a consensus for changing the oath, although he does not 
like the present formulation. He and I have  different views on this. 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6593"> 6593 </A></B>
<P>
He would not want to pledge allegiance to Canada as a member of 
the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	That is one of the reasons I am putting forward an oath of 
allegiance. I do not want any ambiguity for our new citizens to be 
in the oath. I do not want them to be unclear about what they are 
doing. I want them to be absolutely clear on what they are doing. I 
want people who come here and become citizens to know what they 
are pledging allegiance to. I do not want them to think on the one 
hand they are pledging allegiance to a Queen who is principally 
British and represents the United Kingdom, although as I said there 
is a legal fiction that she is the Queen of Canada, and then on the 
other hand to be pledging allegiance to Canada.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	I think the time has come when we can clarify the oath, make it 
absolutely clear that when you pledge allegiance to Canada as a 
new citizen you are pledging allegiance to this country and to 
nothing else.
<P>
	I understand the views of the Bloc Quebecois members. They 
have been elected to support a movement to separate Quebec from 
Canada and to break up the country and they do not want to pledge 
allegiance to Canada. As a matter of fact, when we sing ``O 
Canada'' in the House once a week they are significantly absent 
because they do not want to sing that anthem and they do not want 
to give allegiance to our flag either.
<P>
	It is for those very reasons that I want people to pledge 
allegiance to Canada. I think our unity is under attack. Our unity is 
being threatened. I want to make clear to new citizens that when 
they come here and become citizens of Canada and pledge 
allegiance I want that pledge to be meaningful. I want it to be 
significant. I want to make sure that their loyalty is with Canada 
and not with any other country, that their loyalty is to the traditions, 
to the way of doing things in this country.
<P>
	I thought the approach of the member for Thunder Bay was 
emotional. Mine was rather legalistic I thought he made a very 
good speech supporting the bill.
<P>
	In closing the debate, I hope the minister and the government 
take notice of this debate and bring in soon a government bill which 
will give us a new oath of allegiance which will emphasize 
allegiance and loyalty to Canada.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> There being no 
further members rising for debate and the motion not being 
designated as a votable item, the time provided for consideration of 
private members' business has now expired and the order is 
dropped from the Order Paper.

	Do we have unanimous consent to proceed with deliberation on 
the motion to adjourn?

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIANAIRLINES">CANADIAN AIRLINES</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Madam Speaker, two 
days ago I rose to ask some questions about the Canadian Airlines 
International situation and asked if the federal government had 
done any substantial analysis of that situation and what changes, 
regulatory or financial, the government was prepared to make in 
face of the potential losses that were described by some analysts on 
the west coast.
<P>
	They had looked at the situation and had shown that if there are 
16,400 jobs lost, which is the employment at Canadian Airlines, 
another 54,000 indirect jobs would be lost at airports, ticket outlets, 
agencies, fuel suppliers, caterers and so on. The total loss in 
contributions to unemployment and pension funds would be $314 
million.
<P>
	The total loss to the federal government in income taxes would 
be an additional $1 billion. The loss in GST rebates would be $21 
million. The loss in fuel, airport taxes and other minor taxes would 
be an additional $225 million. The taxes lost to declining disposal 
income would be an additional $168 million. For those who are 
able to get jobs their income would decline. Unemployment 
insurance costs for all workers for one year would be $1.5 billion, 
making a total of $2.9 billion in losses to the federal treasury.
<P>
	If 30 per cent of the employees find work immediately within a 
year, that loss is reduced to $2.5 billion. If two-thirds of them find 
employment, the loss goes down to about $2 billion, but there is 
still a new loss to the treasury for the first year after Canadian 
Airlines hits the wall, which is now expected to be the case about 
November 30 if nothing else changes.
<P>
	The federal government will lose between $2 billion and $3 
billion. I would have thought the government would have had a 
contingency plan available. According to the response I got that did 
not seem to be the case. That was strange because in June 1993, just 
prior to the last election, the Liberal leader of the day who is now 
Prime Minister said that the key features of his airline policy would 
be safety, competition and Canadian control. He went on to 
promise that he would do something to make the industry more 
stable.
<P>
	This you will remember, Madam Speaker, was about a year after 
a previous restructuring of Canadian Airlines International and at 
which point the company successfully urged some of the 
employees to buy stock in the airline at $16 a share. Those shares 
are now worth  about $1.80. We do not hear them offering shares 
any
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6594"> 6594 </A></B>
<P>
more to employees, they are simply offering wage cuts of 10 per 
cent. Yet even the Prime Minister has said a loan would not make 
this company any more profitable, it just extends the problem a few 
more months or years. A 10 per cent cut in wages is equivalent to a 
loan.
<P>
	I think the government, given that it has more than $2 billion at 
stake, should do a better job of handling this situation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is with some regret that I hear 
the information given by the member because he takes a position 
that is negative from the very beginning and continues that way. I 
am sorry because the member opposite is showing a lack of 
confidence in the ability of Canadian Airlines to carry out a 
successful operational reorganization.
<P>
	The company has already identified the ingredients it needs to go 
forward successfully. The company plan does not include any 
government assistance. It also does not include any request for 
changes in the regulations. This company wants to make it on its 
own.
<P>
	Those, like the member, who are calling for re-regulation of the 
air services sector fail to see how counterproductive such action 
would be. Turning back the clock would not be in the interests of 
the travelling public. Outlawing seat sales and shutting down 
discount carriers will not ultimately save a single job at Canadian 
Airlines.
<P>
	Government policy is serving the interests of the travelling 
public. Look at what it has already accomplished. First, an increase 
in new routes and services into about 100 transborder markets, 
making air travel more accessible for more Canadians. Second, low 
discount fares, thanks to the arrival of new air carriers and 
increased competition. Third, Canadians are travelling in 
increasing number. Domestic travel this year will be up some 10 
per cent.
<P>
	The government continues to follow the situation closely and we 
have all the confidence that the management, the employees and 
the shareholders will take the action necessary and required for this 
company to turn in the right direction.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The motion to 
adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 
a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.48 p.m.)
