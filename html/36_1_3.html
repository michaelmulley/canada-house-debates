</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Wood (Nipissing, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to invite all members of Parliament to join me this evening at 
the National Aviation Museum for the unveiling of the Monitor jet 
trainer aircraft.  This state of the art jet will be manufactured 
in North Bay, Ontario, in my riding of Nipissing, by the Canadian 
Aerospace Group in partnership with Sikorsky Aircraft, creating 
140 jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud of this success story which will see a surplus 
defence department hangar utilized to build the first Canadian 
made military jet in over two decades.  The hard work of the Air 
Base Property Corporation using Industry Canada and National 
Defence adjustment funds has paid off.  Their partnership with 
Canadian Aerospace and Sikorsky will develop a new aerospace 
industry in North Bay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask all members of the House to join me this evening at the 
Rockcliffe airport from 6 to 8 to view the future of military 
aviation manufacturing in Canada.  Experts from the Canadian 
Aerospace Group and Sikorsky will be on hand to explain this 
unique project.  I look forward to seeing all members there this 
evening.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am honoured to speak in the House for the first time.  More than 
700,000 people of Chinese ancestry live in Canada today, but that 
was not always so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1902 a royal commission decided that Asians were “unfit for 
full citizenship—obnoxious to a free community and dangerous to 
the state”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1923 Mackenzie King's Liberal government passed the exclusion 
act which suspended Chinese immigration.  Canadian Chinese call 
July 1, 1923, the day the exclusion act came into effect, 
humiliation day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1947 the exclusion act was repealed and Canadians of Chinese 
ancestry won their right to be reunited with their families.  I 
would not be standing here today if that act had not been 
repealed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>1997 marks the 50th anniversary of the repeal.  Justice will be 
served only if Canada has learned a lesson from this bleak moment 
in history.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judi Longfield (Whitby—Ajax, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the outstanding achievement of the Whitby 
Warriors Junior A Lacrosse Club.  This past August the Whitby 
Warriors won the Minto Cup as the best Junior A lacrosse team in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of losing the first two games to the Burnaby Lakers 
they persevered and came back to win their next four games to 
take the best seven championship round in six games. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Warriors were led by their top scorers Paul Sallie, Pat 
Jones and Gavin Prout and backed up by the most valuable player 
awarded winning performance of goal tender Mike Wye. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Whitby Warriors are coached by Jim Bishop whose involvement 
in the sport of lacrosse spans some 51 years.  Whitby's win was 
Mr. Bishop's eighth Minto Cup, coming 28 years after coaching the 
legendary Oshawa Green Gaels to seven consecutive Minto Cup 
championships.  The determination and sportsmanship of the Whitby 
Warriors are an inspiration to us all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know all members will join with me in honouring the Whitby 
Warriors as the Junior A champions in Canada's national summer 
sport.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno—Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in 1989, the Department of National Defence was ordered by the Canadian 
Human Rights Commission to enrol more women in the next ten years. At 
the time, only 9.9 per cent of the members of our armed forces were women. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1405"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, eight years later, their numbers have remained virtually the 
same, with women accounting for a mere 10.7 per cent of the Canadian Armed 
Forces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We note today that the Department of National Defence has not done 
a thing to recruit women. But now they would have us believe they are 
complying with the Human Rights Tribunal order by launching a recruiting 
campaign aimed exclusively at women and known as “Operation 
Minerva”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>DND knows very well it is impossible to integrate women fully by 
1999. All I have to say to that is: too little too late.

wrongdoing.

environment minister at 3 a.m. before the premier would dispatch 
air monitoring equipment to the toxic fire site?  Why did the 
province first refuse and then later accept federal government 
assistance? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are questions of compliance with the Ontario fire code, 
inventory lists, security, and locating a recycling plant near a 
hospital, schools and a high density residential area.

today in the House on a very important matter to my constituents

prosecution of war criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Thornhill, especially the Jewish community, 
believe that Canada must be vigilant in prosecuting war 
criminals.  Canada has a moral obligation to deport those who 
have been found guilty of committing crimes against humanity.  We 
must not be seen as a haven for Nazi war criminals and others who 
have committed war crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents are aware of the commitment by the Liberal 
government to move on denaturalization and on deportation of 
those convicted of war crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally Canada is taking action.  Canada is doing more now to 
track Nazi war criminals than almost any country in the world. 
Since 1995 many deportation cases have been initiated and I am

extent of the law.

death.  This godly and gracious woman was a beacon of hope to the

life that challenged the modern world by teaching us that 
lifestyle is not more important than life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She accumulated no material possessions, shunned political power 
and never succumbed to moral compromises. Her life was consumed 
by the simple goal of providing food, education, medical care, 
love and hope to the sick and desolate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Her notion of charity was not to hold black tie fundraisers and 
send others to do the messy work.  No, Mother Teresa's example 
was to pick the maggots out of people's open wounds herself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No human has done so much, for so many, for so little.  But her 
life's work, not even respect for the dead, could spare her from 
those who want to protect their world from her message. Fully 
half of the media's coverage of Mother Teresa's death was devoted 
to criticism of her life and beliefs.

to be cleansed by the millions she inspired.  She will be

on Canada in the 21st century.  The reality of the matter, however, 
is quite something else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister not acknowledge that the Speech from 
the Throne sanctions his vision of Canada, where all major 
decisions will be made in Ottawa, with the provinces being 
relegated to the position of subsidiaries of Ottawa, and where 
Quebecers as a people have no place? 
<P><A NAME="LINK49"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we made frequent reference in the Speech from the Throne to the 
partnership we want with the provinces.  We made frequent reference 
in the Speech from the Throne to what we intend to do for the 
children of poor families in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make it clear to the former Leader of the 
Opposition that, at the first ministers' meeting in June last year, 
all the provincial governments and premiers in attendance, 
including the Premier of Quebec, agreed to our establishing a child 
credit program to help poor families.  This shows that we can work 
together within Canada as partners. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister uses the term “partners” because he thinks it is a 
popular term and would give it the same meaning it was given by the 
sovereignists. However, we have no illusions about this, because when 
the Prime Minister talks about partnership, it is the kind of 
partnership in which the political decisions are made in Ottawa and the 
provinces are asked to carry them out. The provinces are being treated 
like so many municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the Prime Minister agree that the throne speech has 
demonstrated, more clearly than ever before, that there are two 
diametrically opposed visions of Canada: one in Quebec where, since Jean 
Lesage, people have wanted to be 
“maîtres chez nous” and one in the rest 
of Canada, the one in the Calgary declaration where Quebecers are just 
as unique as Pacific salmon? 
<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
leader of the third party overlooks the fact that we have worked very 
hard with the provinces since we came to power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take, for instance, Quebec's traditional demands regarding manpower 
training. We have entered into an agreement with the provincial 
governments, including the Government of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many years, the Government of Quebec and the other governments 
complained that we were involved in areas they would rather see us out 
of. That is why we withdrew from forestry, mining, tourism, social 
housing and manpower training. We have adjusted many programs. Of 
course, there is no way we can accommodate someone who wants separation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK52"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday in the 
Speech from the Throne, the Prime Minister wanted, he said, to launch an 
appeal to citizens to work together to save Canada, except that nothing 
about the speech is likely to please Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Prime Minister.  Will he confirm that his 
party has buried the concept of distinct society once and for all and 
replaced it with the concept of “unique character”? 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to point out to the member for Roberval that he voted against 
distinct society here in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to point out to the member for Roberval that, when he 
was an MNA, he voted against the Meech Lake accord in the National 
Assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have terms that are acceptable both to Quebecers and to all 
Canadians.  What the premiers wanted to do was to show Quebecers that it 
is possible to be a francophone, to retain one's French culture, to live 
in Quebec, to be very proud of what sets one apart, and to be perfectly 
at ease within Canada.  And I am very pleased with the premiers' 
attitude in this regard. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in exchanging 
niceties with the Prime Minister, might I remind him that he was 
the one who was traipsing all over Quebec during the last election 
campaign promising Quebecers that he would sell the rest of Canada 
on the idea of a distinct society, not I.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have always stressed the necessity of recognizing the distinct 
character of Quebec because of its language, its culture, and its 
Civil Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The formula the premiers saw fit to accept a few weeks ago is 
a new one which describes the Quebec reality, something we continue 
to fight for, while the Bloc Quebecois, in the House of Commons, 
and the Parti Quebecois, in the National Assembly, have voted 
against anything which could accommodate Quebec so as to enable it 
to prosper within Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
waited a long time for this moment.  My question is to the Prime 
Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of 1.4 million unemployed Canadians, will the 
government commit today to set clear timetables and targets for 
the reduction of unemployment?  The government has done it with 
respect to deficit reduction. When will the government do the 
same for unemployment and show that it is serious about putting 
Canadians back to work? 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, first I would like to welcome the hon. leader of the New 
Democratic Party to the House of Commons.  I am happy to have her 
here.  I know she has waited a long time and I hope she will stay 
for a long time too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say that we want to reduce unemployment and we 
are working very hard on it.  In fact during the last 46 months 
the Canadian economy has created 975,000 new jobs. The level of 
unemployment went down from 11.5 per cent to 9 per cent but we have to keep 
working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing we had to do was to put the finances of the 
nation in order. A few years ago we had a deficit of $42 billion 
and very soon we will have reduced it to zero.  We have 
to do that in order to create jobs.  When there is no inflation, 
low interest rates and a competitive dollar, we can produce and 
be very competitive.  It is in that way that we will create the 
jobs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>   Mr. Speaker, it is 
obvious that 155 Liberal cheerleaders over there are pretty 
pleased with their record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the last Liberal throne speech promised to tackle youth 
unemployment, 26,000 more young people in this country have not 
been able to find jobs and they are not cheering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question. Will the government commit today to set targets and 
timetables to reduce unemployment?  If not, will it admit that it 
has simply given up doing anything to help the young people who 
most desperately need its help? 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have tried to explain in a few words that we must have 
the basic elements to create jobs in the country. It is not by 
spending money that we will cure the problems of the nation. We 
have to do it in a responsible way and we have to put the books 
of the nation in order.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote some advice I read on February 10 of this 
year.  It was said that we have come too far and have worked too 
hard to restart the cycle of careless spending.  Therefore, we 
will not follow the advice of the leader of the New Democratic 
Party. We will follow the advice of Mr. Roy Romanow who spoke in 
front of the Saskatchewan Chamber of Commerce.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Prime Minister. It has to do with his government's shameful 
abuse of the unemployment insurance system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His government said in the Speech from the Throne that it cares 
about unemployment in general and about youth unemployment in 
particular. The government could take concrete action immediately by 
reducing employment insurance premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and the Canadian 
Federation of Independent Business, as well as Quebec's Chamber of 
Commerce and Conseil du patronat, are asking for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is this government waiting for to end this abuse and put 
people back to work? 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first 
of all, I wish to welcome the Conservative Party leader, who is now back 
in the front row. We are happy to see him and look forward to be closer 
to him and to see him more often than in the last Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative Party leader should know that, when we came to 
office, the unemployment insurance fund showed an enormous deficit, 
because the Conservative government had not exercised prudence. The 
Conservatives had to increase premiums from $2 to $3.30, at a time when 
unemployment was on the rise in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These premiums were to go up to $3.30 on January 1, 1994 under the 
legislation passed by his party's government. We reduced them to $2.90, 
and will lower them again to $2.80 on January 1, 1998. We are reducing 
premiums gradually, but we must do so responsibly, because we still have 
work to do to clean up the fiscal mess we inherited in 1993 from the 
Conservative Party leader's government. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to thank the Prime Minister for his kind words in welcoming 
me back to the House.  I would caution him against wishing that I 
be here too often and remind him of the old Chinese proverb that 
he may end up getting what he wishes for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I want to offer the Prime Minister a great opportunity, an 
opportunity to do something for unemployed Canadians and young 
unemployed Canadians.  If he acts today he can put thousands of 
people back to work in the next few weeks by reducing employment 
insurance premiums, this tax, this rip-off on Canadians to the 
tune of billions of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be clear, I want to ask the Prime Minister one simple, 
straightforward question.  Does he and his government believe 
that this employment insurance system should be used for the 
purpose of reducing the deficit, yes or no? 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we did not want to run the affairs of the nation the way 
that the previous government did.  It never had any surplus in 
the unemployment insurance fund. When Canada was in a deep 
depression in 1991, a time when there were more and more 
unemployed in Canada, the Tories took the insurance premium from 
$2 and moved it up to $3.30. That is not the way we want to do 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to act as prudent managers in order to make sure that 
our financial situation is good in Canada and that we have low 
interest rates.  We have that now and that is what is creating 
the 4 per cent growth that we will have this year in Canada. We are the 
leaders of the G-7 countries in this.

</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the equality of citizens and provinces became a huge factor and 
played a large part in the Calgary premiers conference last week. 
In fact their framework for discussion listed the word equality 
five times. 
Yet yesterday in the throne speech we did not hear the word 
equality even once; uniqueness, diversity, all kinds of words, 
but not equality.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the Prime Minister is in yesterday's throne 
speech why in the world was the equality of citizens and 
provinces deliberately left out? 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, when we said we want to work in partnership and in 
collaboration with the provinces it is because we believe in 
equality.  That is exactly the purpose of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About the equality of individuals, I do not have any lessons to 
receive from the hon. member for Edmonton North because I was the 
minister of justice who gave the charter of rights to all 
citizens of Canada to make them equal. 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the concept of equality and the word equality is what is 
important.  Speaking of justice ministers, it is a wonder that 
this justice minister did not notice the absence of the word 
equality and insist that it be put in the throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very strange that the government would mention the unique 
character of Quebec society and the diversity inherent in the 
federation and yet not mention equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is important to him, let me ask the prime minister this 
question one more time. Why does the prime minister not believe 
in the inherent equality of all provinces and all citizens, and 
why was it not in the throne speech? 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is something I have talked about and lived by for the 
last 34 years that I have been a member of Parliament.  I do not 
have to repeat the obvious every day, but if the hon. member is 
not reassured, I am for the equality of citizens and I am for the 
equality of the people of Canada.  I have been for that all the 
time I have been in Canada, but equality does not mean that 
diversity cannot exist.  This is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equality means that we recognize the people for what they are. 
In a family equality means that sometimes we have to have 
solutions that are meeting the needs in one part of Canada but 
which are not needed elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have, for example, despite equality a terrible problem of 
poverty in Canada.  This means that those who are rich have to 
help those who are poor.  It is what we believe in.   The type of 
equality where we do not care about the poor like the Reform 
Party—

<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
directed to the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the throne speech we heard that the federal government, as its 
financial position improves, intends to intervene increasingly in areas 
of provincial jurisdiction, including health and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Prime Minister justify increasing involvement by its 
government in health and education, considering that these areas have 
always been the responsibility of provincial governments? 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canada happens to be one of the most decentralized federations in the 
world, and together we have built a federation that has provided us with 
the best quality of life of any country. And we managed to do this 
because both levels of government, federal and provincial, are learning 
to work together and to concentrate on the areas for which they are 
responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the health sector, the federal government's responsibilities are 
those that are recognized in the Constitution. There is nothing 
unconstitutional about having five moral principles that are accepted 
throughout Canada, including Quebec, and as a result can be applied 
anywhere in Canada, both in the wealthiest and the less wealthy 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I may remind the hon. member that the province that benefits the 
most per capita from the Canada Social Transfer happens to be Quebec. 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is the 
first time a federal government has so clearly indicated its intention 
of interfering in areas of provincial jurisdiction, especially 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the Prime Minister or his minister agree that his program to 
measure the readiness of children to learn is, in fact, a foot in the 
door of the education sector, with all the consequences that involves: 
federal programs, federal assessment criteria, federal employees, and on 
top of that, taxpayers who will again pay twice as a result of this 
latest duplication? 
<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am always amazed by the excessive reactions we get 
from that side of the House. However, if they get their kicks by 
measuring the orthodoxy of every word, by all means, let them make a 
study of semantics.

Canadians benefit from a study by Statistics Canada, for which my 
department is responsible. I am referring to a national longitudinal 
survey we have been doing for several years. Since we invest enormous 
amounts of money in the well-being of our children, we feel it is very 
important to measure their progress, so that when they go to school, 
they are in the best possible position to learn.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, except 
for Premier Bouchard, who did not attend the Calgary conference, all of 
Canada's provincial premiers agreed to put the question on national

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to thank the hon. member for his question. Right now, the 
provincial governments have made a joint decision to consult the people 
before adopting resolutions in their respective legislatures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Quebec, the present government of Quebec is not 
interested in consulting Quebecers on their genuine participation within 
Canada. Right now, the provinces have decided to consult their citizens 
before adopting their resolution. As soon as Quebec wants to adopt its 
resolution, I would ask the Government of Quebec to do likewise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as we are concerned, if these resolutions are passed or 
adopted by all the provinces, I said before that the House of Commons 
has voted on distinct society, and we are prepared to vote on the words 
chosen by the premiers after a debate in this House. But we will have to 
wait and see what happens in the provinces, which are working on this 
right now.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Knowing this, will the prime minister clarify how the Calgary

people were consulted. There was a referendum. Among the reforms 
that we favoured was the election of the Senate. The Reform Party 
voted against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this moment the provinces are doing their work. In due course 
we will act.  I have talked with the premiers and they are doing, 
in a very different way, the way they want, their own 
consultations before they vote on the issue.  We do not want to 
duplicate that in the other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this moment there is no debate going on before the national 
assembly on the question of the Calgary declaration.  When there 
is a debate I hope they will consult with the people.  If need be 
we might consult with them, but at this moment the timing is not

</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of Finance. Does the Minister of

afford to provide assistance to society's most disadvantaged, namely 
poor children.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, when the 
health minister was recently asked where he would find the money 
for national pharmacare, he replied: “I don't know but it's a 
really good idea”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When patients are trapped in the longest waiting lines in 
history why would anybody be thinking about a brand new national 
program? 
<P><A NAME="LINK86"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the first and fundamental challenge we face with our health care 
system, and I know the hon. member is aware of this, is restoring 
the confidence of Canadians in the basic medicare which we have 
come to know and depend on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is firmly committed to not only the five 
principles of the Canada Health Act but to working with our 
partners in the provinces, with providers and with other 
stakeholders in the system to restore the health system to the 
quality Canadians expect and deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is going to mean a lot of work.  It is going to mean 
working with provinces and others to tackle issues such as 
waiting lists.  It is going to mean dealing with—

<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, they really 
had quite a commitment as they chopped 40 per cent from the 
health care transfers.  Now they come along and promise us 
national medicare with no clue how much this program will cost, 
with no clue where the money would come from. I call that 
clueless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Medicare has suffered and lies wounded. Why would anybody carry 
on with a brand new program like this when medicare itself needs 
to be fixed? 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I know the hon. member is a better doctor than he is a 
mathematician.  He knows full well that the cuts by this 
government were nowhere near 40 per cent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I said to my provincial partners is that we are going to 
work toward pharmacare as a long term goal because this 
government believes that in the long term the partners should 
work with us in creating a system where every citizen of this 
country should have access to the drugs they need and should not 
be kept from them because of price.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development,

the throne speech, because there are several references to what we are 
going to do and have been doing for some time now.  In particular, we 
announced a youth employment strategy, which is extremely important.  We 
are working very hard on the unemployment issue and you know it.  This 
strategy, which creates work experience, is doing well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have identified tools that worked well and we will consolidate 
and extend them so that the work experience young people need to make 
the transition from school to the work place is a very positive one.

that he is not in the least concerned about the plight of seasonal and 
other workers entering the job market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is not what he is doing to help them re-enter the job

it is important that he tell his constituents and all those living in 
his riding what to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have set up a transitional job creation fund.  We do not believe 
in passive income support.  Our preference now is for active job 
creation measures, which we have transferred to the Government of 
Quebec. We are talking about $800 million in active job creation 
measures and a $95 million transitional job creation fund for Quebec 
alone, precisely so that people can have real work and not rely on 
passive income support.  That is what our workers want.

</I></B></P><P align=left>A new American law requiring Canadians crossing into the United

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the new measures 
announced by the United States are extremely damaging to Canadian 
and to American business.  They are counter to the initiatives 
taken by the President of the United States and the Prime 
Minister to dismantle controls at borders and to promote the free 
circulation of people and of goods.  They are probably counter to 
NAFTA.

something about the problem of the Pacific salmon treaty, he

Nass and Skeena Rivers, to the tune of three times what they had 
done previously under the treaty.

wish to begin with some sincere congratulations.  First I 
congratulate you on your re-election to the Chair.  I extend best 
wishes to you on behalf of the members of the official 
opposition.  We wish you patience and wisdom in your 
deliberations in guiding our deliberations and express the hope 
that the spirit of democracy expressed on the first day you were

to you, Sir, on behalf of all of us.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to congratulate the hon. member for 
Laurier—Sainte-Marie, the leader of the Bloc Quebecois, and his 
colleagues on their election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we disagree profoundly with the policies of the Bloc, we 
respect the democratic process that permitted the election of Bloc 
members to this House.  We will continue to try to convince them

and preferable to separation from it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the hon. member for Halifax and our NDP colleagues we extend 
congratulations as well.  I also ask the leader of the NDP to 
convey our best wishes to her predecessor, Ms. Audrey McLaughlin. 
So often members leave the Chamber of their own accord after 
serving their time with little acknowledgement or recognition.  I 
ask members to simply join in applauding Ms. McLaughlin for her 
hard work, her compassion and her contribution to Canada.

if he will not try to bury it in mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the Right Hon. Prime Minister.  He has had a long

</I></B></P><P align=left>Jason Moscovitz on the night of the election said that the 
member for Sherbrooke won the leaders debate, that Reform won the 
campaign but that the Prime Minister won the election.  We would 
have preferred his victory to ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to congratulate the prime minister and his 
gracious wife Aline on their 40th wedding anniversary a few weeks 
ago. Forty years is a long time and we take inspiration from the 
fortitude of Madam Chrétien.  If she can put up with the prime 
minister for 40 years I guess we can put up with him for another 
four. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To all hon. members I would like to extend congratulations on 
elections and re-elections.  I want to pay a welcome and special 
tribute to our 60 Reform MPs.  We have 40 members who are 
returning and we have 20 new members, including some of the 
youngest members in the House of Commons, three under 30 years of 
age. I would like to say to all the younger MPs and to the new 
MPs that we wish to encourage them.  I think they can bring 
invigoration and a fresh spirit to this institution which 
sometimes shows signs of age.  I would encourage all members to 
encourage these new members and to give them the respect they 
deserve.  They do represent really the vanguard of the future and 
we welcome them to this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last of all but not least I want to acknowledge and thank the 
people of Calgary Southwest.  As I have frequently said to them, 
this seat in my judgment does not belong to me.  It does not 
belong to my party.  It is their seat.  I consider it an honour 
to sit in it, occupy it on their behalf and to represent their 
views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning to more important business, on June 2 over 12 million 
Canadians participated in the federal election.  When the ballots 
were counted the seats were allocated, whether we like it or not, 
the way we see them in the House.  It seems to me at the outset 
it would be important to ask ourselves precisely what did 
Canadians do on June 2 and what message were they endeavouring to 
send by what they did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest they were saying four things.  First, they reduced the 
representation of the both the government party and the official 
opposition of the last Parliament; fewer seats for the Liberals 
and fewer seats for the Bloc.  There is a message in that of 
dissatisfaction.  It was not enough dissatisfaction to upset the 
government but it was dissatisfaction that the government needs 
to heed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the public increased support for three very different 
parties, the Reform Party, the NDP and the Progressive 
Conservatives.  There is a message in that.  The public is 
searching for different ideas and different personalities to 
represent different realities in the country.  That is one the 
public wants to see, for better or for worse, reflected in the 
House.  It is incumbent on us to reflect that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third is one of the most interesting things.  When 
historians write about the 1997 election I think this is one of 
the things they will single out.  The Canadian people 
regionalized this Chamber in a way that they have not done for a 
long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the votes, while Reform got one million votes east 
of the Manitoba-Ontario border, all our seats are in the west. 
The Bloc is exclusively a Quebec party.  Even within Quebec its 
vote is regionalized primarily in the area east of Montreal.  The 
NDP is divided between members in Atlantic Canada, in the west, 
but with no seats at all in central Canada.  The Progressive 
Conservatives have 90 per cent of their seats east of Ontario, 
with a majority in Atlantic Canada. While the Conservatives will 
continue to represent themselves as a national party in the House 
they are in essence an Atlantic party with a Quebec contingent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the government of course two-thirds of its seats are in 
Ontario, with half of the remainder in Quebec.  While in theory 
it too is a national party, or claims to be a national party, in 
fact in the House it is an Ontario party with a Quebec 
contingent.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is a lesson in this, it is that this country continues 
to pay a price for failing to reform the upper house. In Germany, 
Australia, the United States and in other big federations of the 
world regional interests are expressed in their federal arenas 
through an effective upper chamber.  When you do not have that 
one of the consequences is a regionalization of your lower house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who think regionalization of this House is a backward step 
or something that will hurt national unity should join the ranks 
of those who demand an effective upper chamber to represent 
regional interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth thing that Canadians did in 1997 was allow a 10 year 
old federal party, with roots in the west and proud of it, and 
with aspirations to become a truly national party, to occupy the 
role of official opposition and to become the alternative to the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we begin that new role and analyse the Speech from the 
Throne, we owe it to the public to share with it how we see this 
role being discharged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see ourselves as having a twofold mandate.  The first is to 
hold the government accountable, to commend it on actions which 
we consider in the national interests but to criticize it on 
actions which we consider not to be in the national interests. 
Second, we see our role as one of proposing constructive 
alternatives consistent with the big themes of equality, 
accountability and fiscal responsibility on which our members 
were elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In relation to the Speech from the Throne I would like to 
perform these two functions.  I want to commend the government 
where it deserves commendation.  We want to criticize the 
features of the speech which we consider inadequate.  Most 
important, we want to present constructive alternatives where we 
see those deficiencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Speech from the Throne remarked, the 36th Parliament of 
Canada is a transition Parliament.  It is the last Parliament of 
the 20th century and the first of the 21st century.  Therefore 
people can ask in which direction it is going to look.  Is it 
going to continually look back over its shoulder at old ideas and 
concepts from the past or is it going to squarely face the 
future? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech professes to look ahead.  It is important that 
we look at the reality behind the words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see a great historical and political analogy between the end 
of the 19th century politically and the end of the 20th century. 
By the end of the 19th century the governing party, the 
Conservative Party, had run out of leadership, ideas and energy. 
It had run out of steam. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Macdonald, the guiding light, was gone.  The lesser lights, 
though well meaning, who took his place were unable to build on 
the foundation which he had laid.  Once new ideas, such as the 
federal union, the national policy or the transcontinental 
railway, were by that point in time the status quo.  As J. Arthur 
Lower the historian put it, the once vital era of Macdonald 
sputtered to a dreary conclusion after the death of its guiding 
spirit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While an exhausted government was still running the country, 
Canada itself was bursting with the new ideas, new energies and 
new potentials of the 20th century, and while the government was 
mired in the past, the people started to seek ways and means to 
express their frustrations with a government whose time had past. 
With their desire to see new ideas expressed in the federal arena 
they started to search for new personalities and new groups.  The 
personality they settled on was Sir Wilfrid Laurier and the new 
group of MPs around him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech quotes Sir Wilfrid Laurier.  I would like to 
quote Sir Wilfrid Laurier back to the government.  He said about 
the government of the day's unwillingness to face realities: 
“A true patriot does not, like the ostrich, hide his head in the 
sand and ignore the facts, but he looks the real situation of the 
country in the face”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was talking about fiscal realities.  He described Canada not 
as a country led and inspired by government policy but as a young 
giant shackled and manacled by government policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said about the Conservative government which was re-elected 
in 1891 but with a reduced majority:  “Another such victory and 
the government is undone”.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said about the need for a fresh start: “I say that the time 
has come for gentlemen on the other side to cease their boasting 
and self-glorification and for the people of the country to open 
their eyes and see that a new departure must be made from the 
policy which has been followed for the last 10 years.  I have 
said that a change has become absolutely necessary to the 
well-being of the country”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sir Wilfrid Laurier on the weakness of the previous government's 
legislative program in a debate on the speech from the throne, 
precisely like this, said: “The speech from the throne has been 
for some years past a very dry skeleton.  This year it is drier 
than ever and the few bones that are in it rattle together with 
an ominous sound”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see a striking parallel between the end of the 19th century 
politically and the end of the 20th.  The once great Liberal 
Party is running out of steam.  The leading lights, Laurier, 
King, Trudeau, gone.  Once new ideas, constitutional change, 
unity through special status, the welfare state as a way to care for 
people, prosperity through government spending; all of those 
ideas are either passé or hopelessly out of date. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada outside of Parliament is brimming with ideas, excitement, 
ways to solve problems, ideas that see little reflection in the 
representations of the government or in the speech from the 
throne.  I suggest that the current government, like the old 
Tories that followed Macdonald's day, is mired in the past and 
out of touch with reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The throne speech, despite forward looking language, offers no 
brilliant illumination of the horizon of the new millennium. 
There is no connection to the forces of innovation and change and 
reform that are at large in the country which if harnessed to 
national policy will help propel Canada into the 21st century 
with vigour and optimism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say in applying glorious analogy to this throne speech, it is 
a dry bone speech lacking in the flesh and blood and muscle and 
sinew and heart and soul required to inspire Canadians for the 
21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would apply the words exactly: “The speech from the throne 
has been for some years a very dry skeleton.  This year is drier 
than ever and the few bones that are in it rattle together with 
an ominous sound”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this sobering historical parallel and Laurier's analogy 
before us let us analyse the government's speech from the throne. 
We want to examine the dry bones.  We want to give credit where 
credit is due.  As any dog will tell you, a dry bone is better 
than no bone at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where deficiencies exist what we will endeavour to do is not 
simply to be critical but to offer new ideas that can perhaps 
turn this dry bones throne speech into something vibrant and new 
and appropriate to leading the country into the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me look first at the economy.  The government proposes 
little with respect to the economy.  It mentions none of the 
resource sectors.  It mentions nothing about the manufacturing 
sector.  It does mention investing in knowledge and creativity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We find all the government's references to high technology 
tiresome because the rhetoric is there and yet we cannot even get 
electronic voting in this House.  Let us start practising high 
tech if we believe in high tech and not just talking about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principal argument in the government's throne speech with 
respect to facilitating economic recovery is that it now has the 
deficit under control.  When we first came here in 1993 our 
analysis was that the federal financial vehicle had four flat 
tires.  One of them was the deficit, one was that spending was 
out of control, one was the debt out of control, the other was 
taxes out of control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has partially fixed one of those flat tires, and 
we give it credit for doing that.  We disagree with the way it 
was done.  We do not think the timetable was right but at least 
one of those tires is now getting close to being in good shape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is what to do about the other three tires.  In the 
speech from the throne there is virtually little or nothing on 
the subject of how to fix the problem of the debt and how to fix 
the problem of excessive taxation and how to ensure that future 
spending will not get out of control the way it did in the 
past.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ask where are the commitments in this speech from the throne 
to debt reduction targets and tax reduction targets?  Where are 
the principles that will guide us on these issues?  Does the 
government have a view on what is the optimal size of government, 
on what is the optimal revenue that it should be taking out of 
the economy?  Does it have a view on what is the optimal debt 
size for a government of this nature in this type of a country? 
The government may say wait for the budget, but the government 
had no hesitation at all about naming 29 measures for spending 
more money with absolutely nothing on these other great 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the member for Medicine Hat, has been circulating 
a discussion paper entitled “Beyond a Balanced Budget”.  What 
he is finding and what we have found for the last three years is 
that there are all kinds of ideas out there in the country, with 
the think tanks, with the business people who have had to 
rationalize these problems within their companies or they would 
go under, with younger Canadians who have been thinking about 
these things because it is their future that is jeopardized. The 
tragedy is that very little of that thinking is seen at all in 
the government's program or in the speech from the throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues in their discussion of the speech from the throne 
and in legislation that comes before this House will endeavour to 
bring that muscle, sinew, tissue, spirit and body required to add 
some substance to the dry bones on economic recovery contained in 
the throne speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk for a moment about the social safety net.  The 
government to its credit acknowledges that the social safety net 
is frayed, that we are in trouble with respect to health care, 
with respect to pensions, with respect to child poverty and in 
some respects with regard to education.  We agree with that 
assessment. However, in the throne speech there is only dry 
bones, administrative tinkering to deal with the problems of 
these programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The social safety net in our judgment requires a new approach. 
It requires acknowledgement that the frontline caregivers in this 
country, mothers, fathers, families, and services given by 
governments closer to the people are the elements of social 
safety nets that need to be strengthened by government policy. 
Where is the recognition in the speech from the throne that many 
government initiated social programs, no matter how well meaning 
they would be, are simply no longer affordable, no longer 
workable and no longer even supported by the clients that they 
were intended to serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The speech from the throne refers to children but it seems to 
refer to children as if they were disembodied spirits not 
connected in any way, shape or form with families.  In fact they 
are in most cases connected with families, many of them in 
desperate straits.  That family is the most important primary 
caregiver in our judgment and if you want to do something for 
social policy, do something for the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Calgary—Nose Hill and other of our 
colleagues will be advancing some new principles and ideas for 
real social reform in the days ahead.  We do not just criticize 
the government's attempts to patch up a creaking welfare state. 
We think that there are new ideas that involve personalizing, 
decentralizing and localizing social service delivery that can 
offer more hope to people in the future.  That will be our 
contribution to this throne speech debate in the area of social 
reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to criminal justice, we look at the speech from the 
throne and we ask what happened to the new justice minister's new 
tough agenda on criminal justice that was announced in August. 
She was going to do something to tighten up the Young Offenders 
Act.  She was going to have sentencing reform.  She was going to 
have parole reform.  Yet there is absolutely nothing on that in 
the speech from the throne at all.  The one sentencing measure 
actually made sentencing easier rather than tougher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the response to the needs of victims of crime?  I think 
of the families of the victims of Clifford Olson and what they 
have endured as a result of the faint hope clause.  Did the 
government not feel any twinge of conscience in seeing those 
people watch Clifford Olson parade passed the cameras on his way 
to a parole hearing?  Our hearts go out to them.  I feel like 
apologizing to them on behalf of at least part of this Parliament 
for our inability to prevent them from suffering the pain that 
they did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the government's response to families that suffer and 
are at risk because of violence and because of defects in the 
Young Offenders Act, defects in the parole system, defects in the 
court system and defects in the penal system?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the member for Surrey North, himself a victim of 
crime with the murder of his son, and how he has struggled and 
fought to get to this House so he could represent victims. When 
it comes to the speech from the throne, this being the passion of 
his political life, what does he see?  He sees a little section 
with three or four paragraphs in it.  It would have been better, 
Mr. Prime Minister, to have not had that section in the speech 
than to have it there with such a bare bones agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues, particularly the member for Crowfoot and others 
interested in criminal justice reform on the Reform side, will 
endeavour to remedy this deficiency in the government's 
legislative program by proposing reforms, particularly those that 
put the rights of victims ahead of anything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to accountability, members who were here in 1993 
will remember that the throne speech referred on numerous 
occasions to integrity, to ethics, to ethics commissioners, to 
guidelines for ministers, to accountability.  We cannot help but 
notice in this year's throne speech that element is completely 
missing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In no way does the government accept responsibility for 
political interference with the Somalia inquiry.  In no way does 
it acknowledge its responsibilities in that area and agree to 
implement the recommendations of that aborted inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see no acceptance of responsibility by the government in 
stonewalling the Krever inquiry.  It was all for that inquiry as 
long as it was looking into the misdeeds of the Tory government. 
As soon as it started to get back to the period before that, the 
government stonewalled the inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps most serious of all is that we see nothing in the throne 
speech which would make ministers more accountable to this House 
and politicians generally more accountable to the people of 
Canada. If you go out not just in this country but in virtually 
every country in the world, there is a current running around 
ordinary people demanding a greater degree of accountability from 
their politicians.  This is not just a phenomenon in Canada.  It 
is a phenomenon in eastern Europe.  It is a phenomenon in China. 
It is a phenomenon in Asia.  It is a worldwide phenomenon: 
democratic revolution from the bottom up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet there is not a flicker of recognition in the speech from the 
throne of that desire for accountability, not even a willingness 
to look at some of the mechanisms that can be used to hold people 
more accountable:  greater use of referenda mechanisms; greater 
use of citizens initiatives; treating petitions with respect 
instead of parading them here in the House and storing them in 
the basement the next day never to see light again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In speaking on the speech from the throne, one of the things 
that we will endeavour to add to the non-existent skeleton of 
public accountability is a proposal for making this chamber and 
its members, not just ourselves but all members, more accountable 
to the people whom we serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly I want to turn to the never ending subject of national 
unity. I note that the government has made some modest changes in 
its approach to national unity, small steps I suggest, but in the 
right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 prior to the last referendum the government was 
completely unwilling to challenge the legality of a unilateral 
secession.  It was unwilling to address with frankness and 
clarity the practical, hard questions that arise when some 
province decides to secede; issues like boundaries, debt 
allocation, what happens to minorities who do not want to remain 
in the seceding province, et cetera. Not only did the government 
not have that on its agenda, but it castigated as traitors to the 
unity effort those who insisted such questions be dealt with and 
that such consequences be communicated to the people of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until recently the government has also been putting all its 
unity eggs in one basket, a basket with a hole in it.  It has 
been relying on the distinct society clause to move public 
opinion in Quebec, despite the fact that that has been tried 
before and despite the lack of support elsewhere in the country 
for that approach. 
That was the government's position in 1995.  As I say, we see now 
some modest changes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, to his credit, is 
starting to address the negative consequences of secession and we 
commend his efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government appears to be accepting some advice from the 
premiers, although we question this based on the Prime Minister's 
replies in question period today.  However, we thought there was 
some movement in accepting the inadequacies of the distinct 
society clause and accepting the premiers' view that the language 
has to be changed and the concept has to be changed.  The concept 
should be changed by marrying it to the principle of equality and 
making crystal clear that any recognition of uniqueness in Quebec 
or elsewhere, a uniqueness that we applaud, will not confer on 
one province powers not conferred on another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes are far too small.  They do not add up to a fresh 
vigorous vision or federalist initiative to unite the country for 
the 21st century.  They are just a skeleton, dry bones rattling 
against each other.  If the government desires to clothe the 
skeleton of its national unity strategy with real spirit, 
substance and muscle, I would urge it to start accepting more 
substantive proposals from other quarters beginning with the 
premiers. Let me mention what some of these would be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The section in the throne speech on unity is extremely brief. It 
contains only one paragraph recognizing the work of the premiers 
in Calgary on September 14.  The paragraph reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will work closely with provincial and territorial 
governments to further advance the progress made by nine premiers 
and the territorial leaders last week in Calgary toward the full 
recognition of the diversity inherent in the federation, 
including the unique character of Quebec society. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members who have read the premiers' declaration from Calgary 
will note the selective editing in the speech from the throne. It 
quotes what the premiers said about diversity and uniqueness.  We 
have no quarrel with that.  However, it completely ignores what 
they said about equality of citizens and provinces, and it 
completely ignores the subject to which they devoted 
three-quarters of their communique, namely a process to involve 
the public at the front end of the consideration of any proposals 
having to do with national unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition urges the federal government to pay more 
attention to what premiers and Reformers have said on both 
equality and on public participation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premiers' framework of principles for discussion mentioned 
equality five times.  In the throne speech the government uses a 
hundred adjectives to describe Canada but it does not make one 
single mention of the equality of citizens and provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government thinks it can develop a unity position that 
ignores the principle of equality of citizens and provinces and 
more importantly, ignores practical measures to make it workable 
in the real world, which involves getting equality into the 
exercise of the federal spending and taxing powers, if the 
government thinks it can ignore that principle, it will be 
designing a unity position that will not be acceptable to 
millions of Canadians.  Why take that chance on the unity issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also say if we take the premiers seriously that the 
government should develop a deeper commitment to public 
consultation on unity initiatives.  It could start by doing two 
things.  It could start by assuring this House that it will 
respect the output of the public consultations the premiers are 
initiating in their provinces even if it does not agree with all 
the points that are raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More particularly, the government will answer definitively the 
question asked today by the hon. member for Edmonton—Strathcona: 
What is its role going to be in ensuring that unity proposals 
developed in the rest of the country are heard and considered in 
the province of Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lack of meaningful public involvement was the single greatest 
weakness of past constitutional efforts.  It marred the 1982 
Constitution.  It was not just some Quebec politicians who were 
left out of the 1982 Constitution, it was the public who were 
left out.  It marred Meech.  It was fatal to Meech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there was the consultation that was done in Charlottetown. 
The public's view was that it was after the fact consultation. 
Meech was just packaged up in a slightly different form. Spicer 
went out across the country and came up with dozens and dozens of 
recommendations, not one of which really found its way into the 
Charlottetown accord.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We Canadians, in pursuit of national unity, have been like a 
family packed into the family car trying to get to a destination 
called united Canada.  But so far the only people who get to 
drive the car are old line politicians and leaders.  Canadians 
are jammed in the back asking “Are we getting to united Canada 
yet?  Are we getting to a united Canada?”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what has been our experience?  For a number of years we let 
Mr. Trudeau drive the car.  Everyone remembers Trudeau, one hand 
on the wheel—he was a great cavalier driver—and the other hand 
out the window giving the finger to Alberta and other places.  We 
forgive him in retrospect.  Canadians in the back are asking 
“Have we got to a united Canada?”   And what did Trudeau say? 
He said “We have not got there but it just over constitution 
hill.  Get to constitution hill and we will have a united 
Canada.”  We got to constitution hill.  We got the 1982 
Constitution and we were not at united Canada.  In fact Levesque 
was getting car sick in the back and tried kick out the window. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we got another driver, Prime Minister Mulroney. Canadians 
in the back were asking “Are we at a united Canada yet?”  And 
he said “No, but it is just over there by Meech Lake.” So we go 
to Meech Lake and we are not at united Canada.  He said “No, it 
is at Charlottetown.”  We go to Charlottetown and we are not at 
united Canada yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A little later our current Prime Minister gets to drive the car. 
He drives very, very slowly.  And we are in the back asking 
“Are we at united Canada?  Mr. Prime Minister, are we there yet? 
Are we there yet?”  But there is no answer.  He is dozing at 
the wheel and we almost went into the ditch at the referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The distinguishing characteristic of all these drivers, and 
every male member of the House can identify with this, they never 
stop to ask instructions about how to drive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying that if we stop to ask instructions that the 
public has good sense of where a united Canada lies.  That is why 
I plead with the Prime Minister to give greater weight to public 
consultation. If you come up with some new initiative on uniting 
Canada, certainly the House has to look at it and give it due 
deliberation.  What is even more important is that the public 
gets a kick at the cat at the front end because if they do not 
they are going to reject whatever package we come up with no 
matter how well it is conceived. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are some of the other things that maybe should be in a 
national unity initiative that really address where the public's 
mind is at?  I suggest one of the other ingredients which the 
premiers are starting to talk about is a rebalancing of the 
powers and also institutional change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a meeting of our little caucus unity team just this week. 
If we had been writing the speech from the throne and wanted to 
demonstrate to Canadians that we had some substances behind our 
unity proposals, what would have been in our legislative package 
that might have sent that signal?  I have a list two pages long. 
We would have had a bill expressly recognizing equality of 
citizens of provinces and applying that principle to the exercise 
of the federal spending and taxation power.  Some day in the 
House I would like to discuss in detail the inequality that 
exists in the country with respect to the exercise of the federal 
spending and taxing powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have had a bill with statutory adjustments respecting 
provincial jurisdiction over natural resources, respecting 
provincial jurisdiction over worker training, respecting 
provincial jurisdiction over social services, respecting 
provincial jurisdiction over housing, respecting provincial 
jurisdiction over tourism. We do not regard, nor do most of the 
provinces regard, mere administrative agreements which vary from 
province to province and do not exist in half of the provinces, 
as being anywhere near recognition of provincial responsibility 
in these areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would enact bills to strengthen the economic and Canadian 
union.  Where is the bill from the government to establish a 
mechanism to beat down internal barriers to trade? 
This House has the power to pass that bill whether the provinces 
agree with it or not.

standards? The federal contribution to the total health care bill 
is now less than 10 per cent.  It will be technically and 
economically unfeasible for the junior partner in health care to 
dictate standards in the way it did in the past.  That does not 
mean we will not have national standards or that people do not 
want them, but we need a new mechanism for the federal government 
to facilitate national standards for interprovincial agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at the speech from the throne and if I were an aboriginal 
person I would not pick it up.  There is nothing in it that 
really addresses the problems of aboriginal people.  Where is the 
bill that starts to decentralize and ultimately do away with the 
department of Indian affairs and transfers functions and funding 
to local aboriginal governments?  Where is the parallel bill? 
They will never get that bill accepted even by rank and file 
aboriginal people unless there is a parallel bill establishing 
mechanisms for financial accountability and democratic 
accountability on reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are the bills and motions to strengthen the regional 
sensitivity and accountability of national institutions?  Where 
is the motion in the House to amend the standing orders so that 
the defeat of a government motion does not result in the defeat 
of the government unless specifically designated a vote of 
non-confidence?  That would allow more regional representation in 
this House than it has ever enjoyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is a non-constitutional Senate reform amendment, at least 
to make the place elected?  Where is the constitutional 
resolution to at least start the Senate reform process? Where is 
representation by population in this House?  Where is the bill to 
get that?  If the upper House was regionalized we could have 
genuine representation by population in this House and it would 
be different in the upper House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is the bill to provide for constituent assemblies if and 
when this country ever decides to completely write its 
Constitution?  This House is supposed to be looking ahead.  We 
cannot wait until the day when Canadians finally decide they want 
to rewrite the Constitution to start setting the mechanism up. 
We should set the mechanisms up in advance. Two mechanisms are 
needed.  One is a bill for constituent assemblies, the other is 
an ironclad guarantee of constitutional referenda at the end of 
the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to the government that if it had brought in a package 
of those types of proposals, or even the promise of bringing 
them, it would add up to something.  They add up to a Canada that 
respects uniqueness.  They add up to a Canada that respects 
equality.  They add up to a Canada that has the institutional 
arrangements to make that practical.  They add up to a new 
division of powers for the 21st century.  There is none of that 
in this speech from the throne. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To add breadth and depth to national unity strategies we ask 
where are the policy initiatives to address the big regional 
concerns that are so apparent in this House?  If the federal 
government had been truly consulting Canadians it would be 
acutely aware of our regional differences.  I said at the outset 
that this House more accurately expresses some of those regional 
differences than many House have in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was frankly surprised when I first opened the speech from the 
throne that some of the big headings were not the regional 
interests of the country.  Where in the speech from the throne is 
the new Atlantic Canadian economic initiative, one that 
recognizes that the approaches of the past, the subsidies and 
handouts and that type of thing, are simply not working?  Where 
is the economic initiative that uses the new tools of expanding 
trade, of beating down internal barriers to trade, of expanding 
trade with New England and of making Atlantic Canada the gateway 
to European trade with the American community?  Where is the 
proposal for public-private partnerships to build roads and short 
line railways and container ports?  There is nothing in this 
speech about the new ideas that are out there and nothing related 
to Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask where is the new vision for Quebec, the troisième voie? In 
this throne speech there is no fresh vision for Quebec. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no third option for Quebec.  There is no option 
between separation and the federalism we have today.  There is 
nothing but the revamping of the division of powers under way at 
present.  There is no third option which would allow a true reform 
of the federation by rebalancing powers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>With all the new Ontario members in this House, surely in caucus 
they must have been looking for an open invitation from the 
federal government to develop a co-ordinated fiscal policy to 
sustain the economic recovery in Ontario.  We simply cannot have 
the biggest government in the country, this government, and the 
government of the biggest province in the country, Ontario, 
pursuing fiscal policies that are either going in opposite 
directions or at 90° to one another.  You could not think of a 
way to hinder economic recovery better than that.  You cannot 
have Ontario with the priority of tax relief and the federal 
government having the priority to spend.  The danger to the 
investor is he sees that whatever tax relief Ontario gives, the 
federal government will move in to that tax room and the taxpayer 
will never see it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the north, our last frontier, demographically and 
ecologically?  There is no recognition of the north, no vision of 
the north. Even Diefenbaker had a vision of the north.  He did 
not have much substance but he tried to get a vision of the 
north. The north is completely neglected, left as a distant ward 
of the federal government, ignored or forgotten. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I left the best for the last, the west. I ask the government 
members to listen for a moment.  Where is the acknowledgement and 
the recognition of the new west and what it brings to Canada's 
21st century? There is a new influence for good, for prosperity 
and for unity emerging in this country.  It is an influence whose 
strength and vitality in the 21st century is like that of 
Atlantic Canada in the 19th century and Quebec and Ontario in the 
20th century.  It is the growing influence of the new west, that 
portion of our country that stretches from western Ontario across 
the vast prairies and woodlands of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, 
into the plains and foothills of Alberta, across the mighty 
Rockies to the Pacific coast of the great province of British 
Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new west is built on the principle of freedom of enterprise, 
fiscal responsibility, compassion for the young, the old, the 
sick and the poor, equality of citizens and provinces and 
democracy that reflects the common sense of the common people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new west is exercising new muscles and energy, not simply to 
get its old grievances addressed, but by offering a new source of 
hope and energy to unify our country and strengthen our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform is the principal spokesperson for the new west in the 
federal Parliament.  Those who think that Reform is simply a 
protest party or that the new political energy in the west is 
simply protest are 15 years behind the times.  The west can take 
care of its own regional grievances.  The west believes that it 
can compete with the Americans and beat them two times out of 
three if it is on a level playing field.  It demonstrates it 
every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pacific rim trade is now twice Atlantic rim trade.  Its 
possibilities are infinite.  The greatest single private sector 
job creation machine is operating today in the city of Calgary. 
It is no longer based on oil and gas.  It is an example that can 
be multiplied in other parts of country. The west is ready to 
bring those ideas and energies to the national scene, not simply 
to advance its interests, not to protect its interests, but to 
make a contribution to the new Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This throne speech fails to speak to that spirit in the west. It 
fails to try to harness that substance to the national interest 
and thus misses a golden opportunity at the end of the 20th 
century to harness energy and vigour to the task of uniting our 
country and making our economy strong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by commenting on the the dry bones throne speech once 
again. 
Perhaps some would say that dry bones are enough.  I hear an hon. 
member saying that it is, but there are others among us who are 
not satisfied.  There are those of us who want something bigger, 
deeper, fuller and wider; who want tissue, muscle, heart, spirit 
and soul added to those bones; who want to exit the 20th century 
with a baying, not with a whimper.  This throne speech is a 
whimper.

government backbenchers who know that what I am saying is true, 
our challenge is that what realities the government has failed to

</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I last spoke in the House, we have had a general election. 
This is the 11th time I have been elected to Parliament. The 
voters of Saint-Maurice have supported me for the tenth time and 
their confidence in me inspires me in my public life. They have 
taught me that politics is about people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I've learned on the sidewalks of Shawinigan, at the kitchen 
tables of rural farmhouses, and with workers on factory floors 
enriches all I do here as a member of Parliament and Prime 
Minister. The people of Saint-Maurice want a government that 
listens to them and respects them, and that is the kind of 
government I want to lead. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament opens appropriately as another glorious Canadian 
summer comes to its end.  Our farmers reap their harvest and the 
young return to school.  This fall, Canadians, especially young 
Canadians, begin to reap the rewards of what we have done 
together in the past four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I stood before you in January 1994, many forecasted bleak 
economic harvests in our future.  In reply to the speech from the 
throne I said then that everything that we would do would be 
“aimed at rebuilding our economic vitality to ensure that every 
Canadian is able to realize his or her potential”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we can say that we needed no polls to tell us that most 
Canadians did not think that we could ever gain control of the 
massive deficit that had deeply wounded the economy and Canadian 
self-confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who then would have believed that Canada would create 974,000 
jobs between October 1993 and September 1997?  Who then would 
have predicted that our interest rates would fall far below those 
of the United States, in fact three and three-quarter per cent 
for the prime rate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who then would have believed that we would have inflation lower 
than 2 per cent, growth close to 4 per cent and the highest rate of job creation 
in the G-7?  Who then would have believed that four years later 
all the international forecasters would be predicting that Canada 
will enter the next millennium with the best economic performance 
of the G-7 countries? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who then would have believed that I would be joining Canada's 
premiers in a spirit of co-operation in the fall of 1997 to 
discuss how we could help our youth, how we could improve our 
health system, how we could strengthen our social programs in an 
era of balanced budgets? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By working together, by being bold, by conquering fear and 
despair, Canadians have done much for themselves and for others. 
We have rebuilt economic vitality. 
Indeed last week the Governor of the Bank of Canada said, 
“Canada is in better shape now than it has been for many years 
to face the economic challenges of the future”.  He said, “The 
Canadian economy has the potential for a long period of sustained 
growth in output and employment, with rising productivity and 
improving living standards”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Now is the time for Canadians to realize their vast potential, 
to turn toward the new century, to invest wisely and 
strategically in people and ideas, to build a secure foundation 
for Canada's future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We made our priorities clear in the election campaign and in the 
speech from the throne.  We will invest in children, our most 
precious resource.  We will invest in knowledge to prepare 
Canada's youth for the technologies and knowledge based society 
of the future.  We will work closely with the provinces to 
strengthen our health system following the excellent suggestions 
of the National Forum on Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a nation we invested in medicare exactly 30 years ago.  I was 
in the House when we did that.  What incredible dividends it has 
paid to Canadians, to our economy and even to our sense of 
identity.  By strengthening and modernizing medicare to meet new 
needs, our health care system in the 21st century will yield even 
greater returns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like with your permission, Mr. Speaker, to salute the 
Minister of Finance who introduced medicare, Mr. Sharp, who is in 
the gallery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien:</B>  Mr. Speaker, at the beginning 
of the election campaign we said that we would spend some of our 
fiscal dividend on health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be introducing legislation to increase health care 
transfers to the provinces in accordance with the recommendation 
of the National Forum on Health that the cash floor be $12.5 
billion. This means that in 1998-99 the provinces will receive 
$700 million more than is currently budgeted. In 1999-2000 the 
provinces will receive $1.4 billion more than is currently 
budgeted. Canada will remain the best country in which to live 
because it cares about its people. These are words that we did 
not hear in the speech from the Leader of the Opposition this 
afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will work very hard to continue to strengthen the economy, to 
continue to create a climate for more jobs and for sustained 
economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to pay tribute today to the Minister of Finance for his 
remarkable achievement in managing the finances of the nation.  I 
want to tell the House that we will never again allow the 
finances of the country to get out of control. We have already 
begun to reduce the debt as a proportion of the size of the 
economy.  By 1998-99 the government will balance the budget for 
the first time in almost 30 years.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Working together with members of Parliament, with the provinces

future that the deficit represented.  No longer will we pass on 
present problems to future generations of Canadians.  No longer 
will we have the large deficit that prevented governments from 
meeting real human needs.  No longer will anyone be able to call 
Canada a bankrupt nation worth leaving.  No longer will critics 
say that Canadian federalism does not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is working so well that leaders throughout the world are 
speaking about the Canadian miracle and the Canadian model. There 
is a new optimism in Canada.  Canadians have begun to dream 
again, and this Parliament's challenge is to live up to the 
spirit of those dreams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we must move forward together into a new millennium.  Many 
in the House today are having their first taste of Parliament. 
From my long experience I can say that the taste will be 
enormously satisfying, of course spicy at times but in the end 
satisfying.  Some denigrate what Parliament can do but they are 
wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have seen over the years how individual MPs on all sides of 
the House advance causes they believe important to them, their 
constituents and Canadians.  Over the last four years our 
government has opened this process more fully than ever before 
for private members' bills, for serious work by parliamentary 
committees and for open participation in parliamentary debate. We 
will continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation today is much better than when I became a member 
of Parliament.  Even as a private member I was able to pass an 
important private member's bill changing the name of Trans-Canada 
airline.  I worked with colleagues on both sides of the House.  I 
asked some of them to shut up and to help, and we made that 
change.  My success was shared with members on both sides of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I first got on a plane marked Air Canada I knew that the 
new member for Saint-Maurice had made a little difference.  Many 
members will, as individuals and as part of this great 
Parliament, make a difference. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell you what we can do together as Canadians and 
parliamentarians.  When I first entered Parliament, Canada faced 
a major crisis of poverty among seniors.  Despite general 
prosperity, many seniors found themselves victims of inflation 
and of the fact they had not been able to save much during the 
hard years of depression and war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The challenge was great, and the responsibility for dealing with 
it was shared. 
The federal government had an old age pension scheme, but, of 
course, the provinces had principal responsibilities in health, 
welfare and housing. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government of Canada worked with the provinces and through 
Parliament used the flexibility and creativity of our federal 
system to confront seniors' poverty. We proved then that we share 
more than we admit; we differ less than we profess.  Saskatchewan 
led in medicare; Quebec worked effectively on pensions; and 
Ontario and New Brunswick were innovative in housing.  But it was 
the Government of Canada that gave national leadership to assure 
that the creativity of our individual provinces was shared by all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the rate of seniors' poverty in Canada is less than 
one-third of what it was only a generation ago.  When the UN 
names Canada as the best country in the world to live in, it is 
partly because our seniors now live much longer lives, and are 
more comfortable financially. And in this mandate my government 
will assure seniors' security for the future.  We will introduce 
legislation this fall to sustain the Canada Pension Plan and the 
Senior's Benefit, making Canada the first G-7 country to make its 
public pension system affordable and sustainable for the 
millennium. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we responded to the challenge of seniors health and poverty a 
generation ago, we must now face the challenge of a new 
generation of Canadians.  They are the generation which will 
inherit Canada in the new millennium.  They are our children and 
our grandchildren, and they will judge our generation by how well 
we have prepared theirs for the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Election campaigns are exciting for me, as for all of us, 
because we get a real chance to meet Canadians of every kind.  My 
wife tells me that my excitement is greatest when I am around 
young people.  The hopes and the dreams of the young are an 
inspiration for me, but in recent campaigns I heard too many 
fears mixed with their dreams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say frankly that we have lots of work to do.  With the 
fiscal crisis at an end, our government has more ability to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Minister of Finance said in his last budget, “a 
government relieved of its deficit burden is not a government 
relieved of its obligations.  It is a government able to exercise 
its obligations”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We owe our greatest obligation to our young, the future of 
Canada.  As I think of the hopeful yet troubled eyes of the young 
people I met this summer, I become even more determined that our 
government will not evade its own responsibilities and 
opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know, as all of us do, that poverty is an enemy of a good 
start whether in aboriginal communities or in the urban centres 
of Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal and Halifax.  Parental love, 
family support and strong communities are antidotes to poverty's 
sting but they are not enough.  People also need our help. 
By investing now in the well-being of today's children we are 
improving the long term social and economic health of our 
society.  Together federal and provincial governments must 
respond through the national child benefit system we are now 
building.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the course of this Parliament we pledge to do more to 
meet the needs of low income families with children.  We will do 
so by increasing the child tax benefit and we will work in 
co-operation with the provinces as they invest in services for 
children.  Children must remain at the top of our national 
agenda.  We must make certain that wherever they live or whatever 
their background they have a head start on a good future.  A head 
start helps but it is not a guarantee they will win the race or 
even finish it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the best educated young Canadians in history.  Young 
Canadians can go to the best schools in the world, but too many 
drop out and too many do not find work.  Youth unemployment is 
simply too high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The private sector has created almost a million new jobs over 
the past four years, but as a society we need to do more to 
create jobs for young people.  We will discuss this and more at 
the first ministers meeting this fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will step up our efforts at offering first jobs through 
internships and summer placements.  We will challenge the private 
sector to train young Canadians to take leadership roles in the 
new knowledge based society of the future.  We will challenge the 
private sector to do more to meet the employment needs of young 
people.  We will develop with the provinces a mentorship program, 
and we will partner with the provinces and communities to give 
the young at risk a better chance at acquiring the skills and 
experience they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more education young people have, the better are their 
chances to find a job.  We will challenge parents, communities, 
schools and provincial governments to encourage young people to 
stay in school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my family every spare penny my parents could save went to 
education.  For my parents the grass was greener on the other 
side of the fence and education was the way their children could 
get into greener fields.  Even though I was a bit of a trouble 
maker at school—and I have kept a bit of it—my parents never 
lost their dream for me and my better behaved brothers and 
sisters.  Their faith and devotion to our education put the 
spring in our leap that carried us over to the other side of the 
fence.  Today, together, parents, communities and governments 
must assure the barriers are not so high that young Canadians do 
not make it to the other side of the fence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The struggle against the deficit was not undertaken so that we 
could celebrate our accounting accomplishments.  We fought to 
lessen the debt burden hanging over an entire generation.  We 
fought so that we could reduce payments to bankers and begin to 
invest in the future of our young people.  That is what we are 
going to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House, plus two or three on the other 
side, do not believe that the role of government should be that 
of the 19th century laissez-faire state waiting to deal with 
emergencies.

efficient, effective partner to make wise and strategic 
investments in areas that really count for the future prosperity 
of our country.  One of the most important of these areas is 
knowledge and learning. It is the key to growth and jobs in years 
ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why, in the last budget, we announced the creation of a 
Canadian Foundation for Innovation.  With the dividends from 
successful fiscal management, we made a one-time investment of 
$800 million designed to rebuild the research infrastructure of 
our universities and teaching hospitals.

of Finance which will be delivered in mid-October, it is no 
secret that because of the good work of the government and of the 
Minister of Finance, we are doing a great deal better in 1997-98 
than had originally been projected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I expect, therefore, that in the weeks after the Minister of 
Finance tables his fiscal update to be able to take advantage of 
another dividend from our successful fiscal management, to 
announce the deal of another one-time investment in learning and 
knowledge similar to what we did last year when we created the 
Canadian Foundation for Innovation but on a bigger scale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This time the purpose of the investment in our future will be to 
reduce barriers to access post-secondary education.  There can be 
no greater millennium project for Canada and no better role for 
government than to help young Canadians prepare for the knowledge 
based society of the next century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As our most significant millennium project we will establish at 
arm's length from government a Canada millennium scholarship 
endowment fund.  The income from the fund will reward academic 
excellence and will provide thousands of scholarships each year, 
beginning in the year 2000 for low and moderate income Canadians 
to help them attend universities and colleges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be working closely with appropriate partners to help in 
the actual design of the fund.  It will not be a monument made of 
bricks and mortar but when future Canadians look around, they 
will see its legacy everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope it can do in the 21st century for our economy and our 
country what the investment after World War II in post-secondary 
education did for our returning soldiers, for our economy and our 
country in the last half of the 20th century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a very personal basis I hope it will be able to do in a 
different area for many thousands of young Canadians what my 
parents were able to do for me, my brothers and my sisters.

make further changes to the Canada Student Loans Programme and 
will increase assistance for students with dependents.  With 
these and other measures, to be developed over the next few months 
in concert with the provinces, we will build on the progress 
made in the last budget to address the increasing cost of 
post-secondary education and the resulting debt burden on 
students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was young, pursuing my education meant that I had to 
leave home for boarding school. Small communities lacked the 
resources to support institutions of higher education. What is 
wonderful about modern technology is the way the most remote 
communities can be in thouch with our greatest institutions. 
SchoolNet, developed by our Department of Industry, allows 
schools to deliver the same information at the same time to 
Whitehorse and Weyburn, Victoria and Victoriaville.  Bill Gates 
has said that SchoolNet is “the leading programme in the world 
in terms of letting kids get out and use computers”. And we know 
that we can, and must, do even more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I travelled through Canada during the last four years, I saw 
how new technologies are strengthening rural Canada. We promised 
in our election programme that we would help rural Canada share 
new technologies and we will keep that promise. It is 
tremendously important to know that our great country with its 
millions of square kilometres will be the most connected country 
in the world by the millennium.  Distances will matter much less; 
and we will see tha differrences need not divide.  The promise 
of technology is astonishing but technology must have a soul. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was very troubled to read a survey this summer that suggested 
that young Canadians knew too little about each other and what we 
have done together.  According to the survey, in every province 
except Quebec, more Canadians thought Neil Armstrong was the 
first Canadian in space rather than Marc Garneau. Only 28 per cent of 
Quebec youth could name John A. Macdonald as our first prime 
minister, although 78 per cent of them could name Wilfrid Laurier as the 
first Francophone prime minister. Too often we forget, or do not 
know, what we have achieved together.  It is unacceptable that 
our youth may know all about computers but so little about their 
country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At one level, this is why our future youth programs will 
emphasize exchanges.  I never knew Canada until I sat at kitchen 
tables in Saskatchewan, skiied in the Rockies, walked on the 
tundra in the Arctic, played pool on Fogo Island in Newfoundland, 
and talked with aboriginal elders around fires. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, Canada touches my heart and affects my thoughts as I 
discover the grandeur of our history.  It moves me deeply to 
learn that over 150 years ago, when religion and race caused wars 
everywhere else in the world, here in Canada Robert Baldwin 
resigned his seat in the Parliament of the United Canada's so 
that his colleague, Louis Hippolyte Lafontaine, could run in a 
seat in the heart of English Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lafontaine became the francophone Catholic member for a 
thoroughly English and Protestant riding.  Working together, 
Baldwin and Lafontaine brought us responsible government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>How many young Canadians know that just over a century ago as 
religious quarrels engulfed the world, Canada, a country with a 
large Protestant and British majority, elected its first 
francophone Catholic Prime Minister?  It had the good sense to 
re-elect Laurier for three more terms, a reasonable goal for any 
prime minister, it seems to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must find ways for young Canadians to learn what they share, 
to know what we have done and to gain pride in their nation's 
accomplishments. The Government of Canada will work with our 
great museums, other federal and provincial institutions and with 
voluntary groups to develop ways to increase Canadians' knowledge 
of what we have done together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We Canadians have built together an astonishing country, 
respected, even envied throughout the world.  This fall more than 
100 nations will come to Ottawa to sign a treaty banning forever 
the use of anti-personnel landmines.  I am proud that it was an 
initiative taken by this government in 1994.  I am very proud too 
that my government, through the foreign minister, refused to 
accept a second best treaty.  The foreign minister deserves our 
congratulations for a job well done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We worked with others of like mind and showed that Canada can 
make a real difference in the world.  At one of the international 
meetings I recently attended, a world leader told me that only 
Canada could have been the leader in the campaign against 
landmines.  I most strongly agree with the recent comment of the 
opposition member for Esquimalt—Saanich, a medical doctor who 
has seen landmines tear apart human bodies and who has worked 
with us to achieve the ban.  He told reporters that the landmine 
treaty marks the “the onset of a new era in Canadian foreign 
policy using our moral force for humanitarian purposes. This 
treaty,” he said, “will save tens of thousands of lives”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That moral force comes from what we are, what we have done 
together and what values we share in common. Canadians expressed 
that spirit nationally during the Saguenay and Manitoba floods. 
As we stood at the dikes and watched the raging waters we shared 
the experience as Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My government feels the burden of that moral force in all that 
we do.  That is why we will take a very broad approach to 
promoting and strengthening our unity.  When we seek to realize 
the highest aspiration of Canadians we help make Canada more 
united. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the Calgary initiative of the premiers and territorial

affirmation of important values about what Canada is, and what 
makes us Canadian.

Canada.  The French fact is an essential part of my identity, one 
that has nurtured me, one that has given me strength and 
identity, one that has made me the Canadian I am. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the commitment of the Premiers and Territorial Leaders 
to involve the people in their provinces and territories in 
strengthening the unity of this country by joining in giving 
voice to these values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message to Quebecers, to all French-speaking Canadians, 
indeed to all Canadians, is one of openness and solidarity.  It 
is a message that should be heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the very constructive approach that the leaders of the 
Reform Party, the New Democratic Party and the Conservative Party 
are taking on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge Quebecers to hear the message coming from Calgary and to 
join in building on it.  The words form Calgary should be taken 
form what they are, an inclusive and timely message for all to 
hear.  It is an important step in building understanding and 
confidence.  Nothing more should be read into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this is not a constitutional or legal text, I would urge 
Canadians not to be drawn into a legalistic analysis of a statement of 
values. The day may come—I hope it will, and it will if Quebec ever has a 
government willing to work for those Quebecers who wish to remain a part 
of Canada, and they are the majority—when there is a legal and 
constitutional text to consider as such. The words from Calgary are an 
attempt to express worthy Canadian values and that is how they should be 
welcomed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pledge to all Canadians that we are open to all good ideas to 
strengthen the unity of our country. We invite the ideas of all 
opposition parties, and we will have an opportunity to discuss them 
either in this House or in committee. 
But we will never be hostage to demands that diminish or deny to each 
and every Canadian the benefits of his or her citizenship and our 
nationhood, our existence as an independent nation 
recognized by the UN. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to be frank and open about the consequences of 
what those who seek to partition Canada are proposing. Clarity 
does not cause fear, it is the enemy of fear. Our adversary is 
confusion. I am convinced that when things are clear, Quebecers 
and other Canadians will choose to stay together because it is 
the best choice for them and their children. As I have emphasized 
today, we are committed to collaboration and partnership with all 
those who, in good faith, will work with us to realize the 
wonderful opportunities that await Canada and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our strength, our character and our recent successes have

new challenges of a new century.

our own Canadian citizenship and even without Newfoundland. 
Alberta and Saskatchewan were not yet provinces.  The slums of 
Montreal and Halifax had a high rate of infant mortality than do 
the modern slums of Calcutta where Mother Teresa toiled.

of Gothic architecture—The cathedral was made of granite, oak 
and marble.  It is the image of the nation I wish to become. For 
here, I want the granite to remain granite, the oak to remain 
oak, the marble to remain marble.  Out of these elements I would 
build a nation great among the nations of the world.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have built that nation and we continue to shape its elements. 
Our young will do so in the next century.  Their architecture 
will be new but it will be Canadian.  Greatness may have a 
different meaning but it will be Canadian.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
may I begin by congratulating you on your election as Speaker.  I 
wish to assure you that, in this House, the Bloc Quebecois will 
always behave with the greatest respect for this institution, just 
as we have in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the last election, we find ourselves in a fragmented 
Parliament, a Parliament reflecting the true face of Canada.  The 
Bloc Quebecois finds itself as the principal Quebec party, the main 
voice for Quebec in Ottawa.  Forty-four members, constituting the 
majority of the Quebec deputation, 60 percent of the deputation in 
fact, that is what the Bloc Quebecois represents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, speaking of the true face of Canada, we had an 
eloquent example yesterday in the Speech from the Throne.  Two main 
conclusions can be drawn from the intentions of the Liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is no surprise: continuation of Plan B, the hard 
line with Quebec.  I will return to this point later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second conclusion must also be reached: after going after 
the deficit at the expense of the unemployed and the most 
disadvantaged members of society, by hacking savagely at transfer 
payments to the provinces for health and education and at 
unemployment insurance, now this government has the gall, the 
indecency, to make use of the surpluses generated by its own 
cutbacks to interfere in areas of provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, the aim is political visibility rather than 
efficiency for the public.  With this objective, this second 
conclusion falls in line with our first one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cuts to unemployment insurance, the cuts to social 
assistance imposed on the provinces and the reductions in health 
and education transfers occasioned by this government's deficit 
reduction have wreaked havoc in the lives of thousands of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than repair the damage it has done, the government is 
concerned with only one thing.  It wants to use the money it saved 
to increase its profile for purely political purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I had to summarize the speech on government policy, I would 
say that the word is federalism in capital letters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its speech, the government is inviting us to take part in 
a great debate on the post zero deficit age. 
The Liberals are proposing that half the surplus go to paying the 
debt and to reducing taxes.  The other half would go to misusing 
its spending power in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having been the cause of many social ills, the government now 
wants to set itself up as the saviour.  It will have cut $42 
billion from social programs, health care, education and social 
assistance, thus forcing the closure of hospitals, driving 
thousands of workers denied unemployment insurance toward welfare 
and causing massive cuts in schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The surpluses that will be generated after the deficit is 
eliminated should not be used for federalist propaganda, but should 
go directly to reinstating the transfer payments made to the 
provinces for social programs.  Specifically, this would mean more 
money for hospitals and CLSCs. 
It would also mean more teachers and student services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Secondly, surpluses should go to job creation through a 
targeted reduction in payroll taxes.  In its electoral platform, 
the Bloc proposed that the employment insurance fund surplus be 
used to lower employment insurance premiums by at least 35« and to 
re-invest $2.5 billion in improving assistance to the unemployed, 
including the seasonally unemployed.

<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not returning the annual surplus of approximately $7 billion in the 
employment insurance fund, and not telling workers and the unemployed 
about this surplus, is a clear misappropriation of funds. The 
suggestions I am now making had the agreement of the premiers in St. 
Andrews recently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next, the surpluses must be used in the fight against poverty.  And 
this includes improving the employment insurance system, given the deep 
cuts made over the last five years, particularly in benefits to seasonal 
workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, there is the long overdue $2 billion in compensation paid 
to the Maritimes but not to Quebec for harmonizing the GST, one of the 
demands from Quebec that was also supported by all premiers at the St. 
Andrews meeting.  And only after it has fulfilled these obligations 
should the federal government think about lowering taxes or reducing the 
debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But instead of repairing the damage caused by its policies, the 
government announces that it will now use this breathing room to 
systematically interfere in areas of provincial jurisdiction.  The worst 
interference ever seen in the history of Canada.  Even Pierre Elliott 
Trudeau never dared to go this far.  And that's saying something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is confirming its interference in the health field 
by creating a pharmacare plan, when Quebec already has its own such 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, after taking over 30 years to partially withdraw from the 
manpower training sector, this same federal government is now seeking, 
six months later, to maintain, confirm and increase its involvement in 
youth training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One the very few new things mentioned in this speech is that the 
federal government will now get directly involved in education, in order 
to, and I quote: “measure the readiness of Canadian children to 
learn”, 
through an innocuous leaflet sent to every home. And then are we going 
to have national standards in the education sector? Are we going to have 
national exams in that sector? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say we will never let the federal government get involved in 
Quebec's schools. Never. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, these measures and policies are just part of a more global 
strategy designed to achieve the first objective that we pointed out, 
namely to pursue more aggressively than ever the government's plan B. 
This is the logical consequence of the last election, when we witnessed 
repeated attacks against Quebec, its politicians and its democratic 
institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prevailing ideology in the rest of Canada is getting further 
than ever from Quebec's traditional demands and aspirations. Such 
hardening is being promoted in an irresponsible fashion by the comments 
of the Reform Party, by the actions of the Liberal Party of Canada, and 
by the collusive silence of the leader of the Conservative Party. As for 
the NDP, it has always ignored the Quebec issue, and in fact this is why 
Quebecers have always ignored the NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Slowly but surely, through the use of psychological profiles, 
changing democratic rules, hate-filled Internet sites and the promotion 
of partition, public opinion in the rest of Canada is falling into 
collective beliefs that still smack of colonialism as regards Quebec, in 
that they view us merely as a quaint entity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This attitude is obvious in the government's throne speech. Never 
before, in a Speech from the Throne, has a government so directly 
threatened Quebec's right to decide on its own future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the Liberal government is dropping the solemn commitment 
made after the referendum to recognize Quebec as a distinct society, 
after putting it in a motion passed by the House of Commons, and after 
repeating it in the form of an election promise in its second red book.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Further watering down recognition of the Quebec people, this 
government has embraced the definition in the Calgary declaration, 
referring to the “unique character of Quebec society”, as unique as B.C. 
salmon, and without constitutional amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we carefully examine this agreement, it is easy to understand 
why the Prime Minister and the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
were so enthusiastic. This is the worst it has ever been for Quebec. 
Several experts agree it is far less than Meech and even less than 
Charlottetown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federalists were rather quick to applaud the results of a 
recent survey on this agreement. They should not get carried away, 
because as Quebecers become better acquainted with the contents of this 
agreement, their support will be affected accordingly. 
In the rest of Canada, we already hear people saying that Quebec has 
been given too much. There is a very real possibility it will be 
Charlottetown all over again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only message sent to Quebec in this throne speech is that we 
should be satisfied with Canada as served up in Calgary, otherwise it 
will be Plan B. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All in the defence of national unity, the government even has the 
nerve to emphasize the bilingual character of this country, when the 
facts tell a different story altogether. They show a shocking rate of 
assimilation among francophones outside Quebec, a national Constitution 
that since 1982 has never been translated into French, and a few weeks 
ago, the closing, to all intents and purposes, of the only francophone 
hospital in Ontario, the Montfort. That is Canada's bilingual character. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have only a few words for the rest of Canada about the 
premiers meeting which was held in Calgary.  Forget the Calgary 
deal, it will never pass Quebec. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has never deviated from its basic 
principles.  Now more than ever, we deem sovereignty to be 
necessary. The constitutional impasse is still there, even more so 
since the Calgary declaration.  The main purpose of the Bloc 
Quebecois is clear: to advance the sovereignist project while 
staunchly defending Quebec's interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During this next mandate, defending Quebec's interests will 
have to involve defending Quebec's democratic institutions.  When 
we came to Ottawa, we knew it would be hard, that harsh words would 
be exchanged.  Yet we would never have dreamed that we would have 
to defend democracy, we would never have dreamed that the federal 
government would stoop so low as to question the very foundations 
of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This best country in the world is behaving like an imperial 
power looking down its nose at its ignorant colony, which dared to 
get just a little too uppity on the evening of October 30, 1995. 
A colony which no doubt needs psychoanalysis, I suppose, as the 
hon. member for Don Valley West so clearly demonstrated to us with 
his pseudo-psychoanalysis of the Premier of Quebec.  Some might 
also add that the people who voted yes did not know what they were 
doing, while everything was perfectly clear to those who voted no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet the rules governing the last two referendums were accepted 
by all parties, including the federal government.  A federal 
government which, let us recall, accepted Newfoundland into 
Confederation with a close vote in a second referendum.  Casting 
doubt on those rules now indicates obvious bad faith and, in 
particular, a profound disdain for the near-victory of the yes side 
in the last referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look a little closer at the rules the Prime Minister is 
trying to discredit with the help of his hatchet man, the Minister 
of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, all of the province's political leaders agree on 
the rules governing Quebec's move to sovereignty.  There is clearly 
a consensus in Quebec on this, which the federal government is 
refusing to recognize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This consensus is grounded on three basic principles: first, 
the existence of the people of Quebec; next, respect for 
fundamental democratic principles; finally, the integrity of Quebec 
territory.  All of Quebec's premiers, be they federalist or 
sovereignist, from Daniel Johnson senior to Robert Bourassa, have

</I></B></P><P align=left>The federalists, in their post-referendum panic and without an 
argument to stand on, are going after the process, trying to 
discredit it by all possible means.  By doing so, however, they are 
the ones discrediting democracy in Canada by deriding the rules 
underlying it.  Partition, a reference to the Supreme Court, doubt 
cast on the rule of the simple majority, a country wide referendum, 
all threats and fears are fair game. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the tutelage of the Reform Party, the Liberal Party of 
Canada has chosen not to face the issue. 
Everything is being questioned with the almost acknowledged aim of 
frightening Quebecers and with the obvious aim of saying, “You will 
never do it”.  The bidding is escalating at the expense of 
Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although they are not acceptable, these attacks against 
Quebec's democratic institutions are not the real problem. 
Although they are irresponsible and dangerous, the threats of the 
partition and hacking-up of Quebec are not the real problem. 
Although it is both absurd and disgusting, the reference to the 
Supreme Court aimed at depriving Quebecers of their right to decide 
their future democratically is not the real problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real problem is this stubborn denial of the very existence of 
the people of Quebec. This is the real problem, which in turn leads to 
all sorts of undemocratic excesses cloaked in legality and clarity. Such 
hypocrisy. This is the root cause of the deadlock. The Liberal Party of 
Canada's approach has failed, because it denies the existence of the 
people of Quebec people, a people different from the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By so doing, the big guns in the federalist camp are endorsing the 
position of the leader of the official opposition, who stubbornly denies 
the existence of the people of Quebec as one of the two founding nations 
of Canada in 1867. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are a people. The aboriginal peoples are made up of 
several peoples. People all over the world are divided into various 
peoples. If it is good for everybody else, why would it be bad for 
Quebecers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal specifically to members from Quebec in this House who, 
over and above their mandate, are citizens who must believe in 
respecting democracy and above all in the existence of the people of 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We urge you not to be part of the government's blind denial of the 
facts when it refuses to recognize that the people of Quebec people 
exists and is free to decide its own future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, let me say a word or two about Canada's future. In its 
Speech from the Throne, the government is predicting a brilliant future 
for Canada during the third millennium. It even invites us to celebrate 
this future success ahead of time. We see things differently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that Canada is at a crossroad. It has a choice. The 
federal government can remain true to its traditions of tolerance, 
openmindedness and democracy, traditions upheld by Lester B. Pearson, 
among others. 
Then, the government will give Quebec the right to decide its own future 
in accordance with the democratic rules which are part of the common 
heritage of the peoples of Canada and Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, it will become once again a model at the international level, with 
which a sovereign Quebec will be able to build a real partnership.  Not 
a pseudo-partnership where Quebec would simply carry out orders from 
Ottawa, but a fruitful partnership between two sovereign countries. 
This is simply reasonable, this is plain common sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Or the government can let itself go and drift away from 
democracy, this has already started, driven mostly by the anti-sovereignist 
phobia of the Prime Minister and his Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs. And this is the open door to all excesses, a slide towards anger and 
intolerance, towards totally anti-democratic behaviour.  This is a dead 
end street. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, it is this second alternative which seems to prevail 
at the present time, because of a Prime Minister who is blinded and 
intoxicated by the arabesques and arrogance of his Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs.  This is regrettable, but I am deeply 
convinced that in the end the Canadian people, whom I sincerely trust, 
will not allow it. 
The government will have to pay a heavy price for having defiled its own 
institutions.

<P><A NAME="LINK128"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I 
rise in my place in this Chamber for the very first time I wish 
to congratulate you, Sir, on your re-election to continue serving 
as Speaker among your 300 peers.  It is an honour for sure but 
also a daunting task. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to congratulate and thank the other candidates to the 
Chair. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know, Mr. Speaker, that it is your job to create a respectful 
political climate and at the same time favourable working 
conditions for all members who are elected to serve the public 
interest in this great Parliament of Canada. I also know that it 
is the responsibility of the Speaker to attend to the working 
conditions for all of the employees who serve Parliament here on 
Parliament Hill and in the precincts in the surrounding area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that over the last year and a half as I have served 
as leader of the New Democratic Party without a seat in 
Parliament I have looked on with some frustration and some horror 
as I have watched the deteriorating conditions for some of the 
people who are serving us here on Parliament Hill. In particular, 
I have felt a great deal of consternation at the spectacle of 
hundreds of locked out security guards.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I know that it is not because you failed to exercise 
your duties but rather the government has been willing to not 
only tolerate but actually sponsor first the training and then 
the hiring of replacement workers who have replaced workers 
earning barely above minimum wage and who are coming up to a one 
year anniversary of the time when they were locked out from their 
jobs here on Parliament Hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope it is a sign of better times to come that there is some 
indication those security guards are now looking at a tentative 
agreement.  I hope that as we come up to the one year anniversary 
of that lockout we will instead be celebrating a just settlement 
on behalf of those workers and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am delighted today to finally be taking my seat in the House 
of Commons and I am delighted to be surrounded by some 20 New 
Democrat colleagues.  It is certainly true that three quarters of 
the NDP caucus are rookies, I among them, at least newcomers to 
this Chamber.  Mr. Speaker, for that reason we will be looking to 
you frequently for guidance and counsel.  I hope we can expect a 
little patience as we learn the rules and the procedures of the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I look across the floor this afternoon I am very aware that 
someone very dear and very special is missing.  He was someone 
special not only to New Democrats but to all parliamentarians 
present and past.  I am sad that Stanley Knowles did not live to 
see this day, that he did not live to see the official return to 
the House of Commons of the party which he helped to found.  It 
is a bittersweet celebration for us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of us learned of Stanley's death as we were arriving in 
Ottawa for our first caucus meeting in June. We will all miss 
Stanley Knowles greatly, his warmth, his humour, his fierce 
unyielding dedication to justice and equality and his 
unparalleled expertise in the rules and procedures that govern 
Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all remember Stanley's lifelong battle for decent pensions 
for working people.  Stanley would never have been fooled by 
euphemisms like seniors benefits into believing that a massive 
reduction in pension benefits was an improvement.  We pledge 
today to honour Stanley's memory by fighting any further erosion 
of pension protection for our seniors. On this occasion I give 
thanks for the tremendous contribution that Stanley Knowles made 
to the House of Commons, to my party and to the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the day of Stanley Knowles' funeral, a close long time friend 
of his arrived at my office. He brought me two publications that 
were co-authored by Stanley and by my father who came to work in 
Ottawa as the first researcher for the CCF caucus in the early 
1940s.  Those publications talked about a more democratic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For me it is a humbling experience and I admit an emotional 
occasion to take my place in the House of Commons, to continue 
that struggle for a more democratic and a more social democratic 
Canada. I was born in Ottawa because of my parents' decision to 
come here and be part of that social democratic movement.  But of 
course Halifax is where I have spent most of my life and Halifax 
is the riding I have the privilege to represent here in the 
Parliament of Canada. 
Let me take a moment or two to tell the House a bit about my 
riding of Halifax. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1725"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Halifax is often said to be something of a bell-wether riding. 
I must say I never really quite believed that until the June 2 
election.  But when all four Halifax area federal ridings elected 
New Democrats to represent them in this session of Parliament, I 
knew that Halifax was a bell-wether riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Halifax is a growing modern metropolis and yet it is still 
characterized by the generosity and the openness of a small 
farming town or a fishing outport.  Our maritime traditions are 
well known; the courage of our military men and women serving 
overseas, the resourcefulness of our current armed forces and 
civilian personnel rising to new challenges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Less well known perhaps is our rich cultural ethnic diversity in 
Halifax and Nova Scotia generally.  We are rediscovering and 
reclaiming the history of Nova Scotia's aboriginal people, the 
Micmac, our black population, the proud community that was 
Africville, our Acadian communities and their valiant struggle to 
maintain their language and their culture, the many other peoples 
who have entered Canada through the port of Halifax, many of them 
through pier 21, some settling in Halifax and many others moving 
on, all of them choosing Canada as their home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That diversity I am pleased to say is very much reflected in the 
caucus that I have the privilege to lead in this Parliament. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It includes, for instance, the first Acadians in a New Democratic 
caucus as well as an aboriginal member from the Prairies. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the first Afro-Canadian member of Parliament elected 
from Atlantic Canada, several members from recent immigrant 
families and, I would add, the most women ever elected to the New 
Democrat caucus.  My predecessor, the member for Yukon, served in 
the House with dignity and devotion under much more difficult 
circumstances, outnumbered by her caucus colleagues eight to one. 
I guess it can be said that the only caucus that has ever come 
close to being gender balanced in Parliament is the past 
Conservative caucus.  I do not know anybody who is recommending 
that formula for gender balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years Canadians have watched my province of Nova 
Scotia spawn an explosion of cultural expression and cultural 
achievement, Acadian and Celtic music, Scottish dance, Atlantic 
humour—who among us does not both love and fear “This Hour has 
22 Minutes”—our vibrant visual arts, award winning film making, 
dynamic theatre and outstanding playwrights like my colleague, 
the member for Dartmouth, and amazing authors like Anne-Marie 
Macdonald, one of Cape Breton's finest, author of the epic novel 
<I>Fall on Your Knees</I>. Permit me to quote briefly a favourite 
passage: “There is nothing so congenial to lucid thought as a 
clear view of the sea.  It airs the mind, tunes the nerves and 
scours the soul”.  Maybe the inspiration of the ocean explains 
the eruption of self-discovery in Atlantic Canada these days. 
Now this quiet Atlantic revolution is sending shock waves through 
the world of politics.

responsibility, a mandate born out of suffering and out of hope. 
I want to say to my constituents and to all Canadians, Atlantic 
Canadians, today that we will not let them down in the coming 
Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians understand what this throne speech has so callously 
ignored, that something has gone desperately wrong for far too 
many Canadians with jobs being wiped out, the quality of life 
being eroded, medicare and education crumbling, national 
institutions like the CBC under siege, tax subsidies for business 
luncheons but new tax burdens for family necessities, and new 
threats to our national sovereignty from the multilateral 
agreement on investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is gratifying to see provincial and territorial leaders 
commit to the unity initiative announced earlier this month in 
Calgary, but let me also say that Canada is bigger than any 
constitution.  Far more crucial than any notion of equality among 
the provinces is the fundamental equality of Canadians, Canadians 
as citizens, equality before the law, equality of services, 
equality of opportunity.  Worsening our inequalities can only 
gladden the hearts of those who seek to divide us. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to capture the hearts and minds of the people of Quebec, 
we must prove that Canada can work well once again, that Canada can once 
again become a country where economic security, sound communities, 
interesting opportunities and real human charity prevail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Parliament must focus on rebuilding that kind of Canada. 
Otherwise, the next Parliament may very well represent a much smaller 
and a much sadder Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this government is willing to tackle the whole question of 
unity instead of focusing on the narrow agenda of those who would 
divide us then we will work with it for the shared goals of 
compassion, community and unity; but that requires that this 
government do some serious rethinking and requires a new 
commitment to the real priorities of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We promised in the election campaign that not a week would go by 
in the House of Commons without New Democrat MPs fighting for 
Canadians pressing priority, especially for jobs.  I only wish 
that the prime minister would devote as much attention to the 
creation of jobs as he devotes to the creation of senators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us examine the facts:  82 consecutive months with 
unemployment above 9 per cent, 82 consecutive months with 1.4 million 
children living in poverty, unemployment insurance protection 
dropping below the level of the state of Alabama creating immense 
hardship while the unemployment insurance fund runs a huge and 
growing surplus, and those with jobs dogged by constant 
insecurity in an increasingly part time, low wage, no benefit 
economy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Women are the most vulnerable.  It is no surprise that this 
government has abandoned women.  The first 1993 red book promise 
broken was that of a national child care program.  Canadian 
families and Canada's children are still waiting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at how this government treats its own women 
employees.  The government is still refusing to honour the $2 
billion pay equity debt owing to 80,000 women in this country. 
Aboriginal communities across the country are desperate for 
economic development and jobs while this government stalls on the 
royal commission recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Twenty-five per cent real youth unemployment is eating away at 
our country's future.  Canadians have heard lots of lofty Liberal 
promises, but the fact is that there are 20,000 more youth 
unemployed today than this time last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program reannounced in yesterday's throne speech will not 
make a dent for the 410,000 unemployed youth. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A whole generation of our young people finish their studies without 
being rewarded with a decent job offer and find themselves strapped with 
a huge debt, $25,000 on average. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is really happening with medicare?  The good news is that 
two tier health care is no longer a threat in this country, and 
the bad news is that two tier is already a reality brought to us 
by the finance minister's massive cuts, cuts in no way reversed 
by yesterday's hollow pronouncements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who bears the brunt?  Families struggling with illness and, most 
of all, once again women:  the backbone of the health care 
workforce reduced to casual workers with homemakers and 
volunteers forced to take up the slack as services are slashed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With people suffering, with families struggling, with patients' 
lives on the line, why is there any debate over what to do with 
the fiscal dividend? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New Democrats will be relentless in fighting for a real 
commitment to move medicare forward, not vague platitudes but a 
solid commitment to comprehensive home care, a prescription drug 
program and the unequivocal rejection of two tier American style 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is this government on the environment?  The short answer 
judging by yesterday's throne speech is nowhere.  Canada's most 
endangered species is a federal Liberal politician willing to 
take any responsibility to protect our natural environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be fair.  There is one solid government achievement 
that we all celebrate.  I want to give credit where it is due. 
Canada has played a pivotal role in the resolve to eliminate 
global stocks of landmines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust the government will have the humility to acknowledge the 
work of so many Canadians whose pressure on our own government 
and others laid the foundation for this important success.  I 
know all parliamentarians will join me in underlining the 
singular contribution made to Canada's effort by the late Diana, 
Princess of Wales. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty to be signed here in Ottawa will serve as a fitting 
tribute to her legacy and her memory.  Every Canadian can be 
proud of this achievement.  I pledge today my party's support to 
further the goals of that treaty and rid the world of all 
inhumane weapons of war. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I know the hon. leader of the New Democratic 
Party is just wrapping up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I might ask 
unanimous consent to make my concluding comments.  I appreciate 
and respect the time limits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the values of my party and they are the values that we 
will fight for in the coming Parliament, giving our children the 
best possible start in life, education and job opportunities for 
our young, decent pensions for our seniors, medicare for all and 
poverty for none, a healthy environment for future generations 
and strong safe thriving communities.

congratulations, not only on my behalf but also on behalf of my caucus, 
the Progressive-Conservative Party.  I also want to assure you once 
again of our co-operation in the performance of your duties, which hold 
such importance for the operation of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to congratulate the leaders of the other parties 
who were re-elected in their ridings and who will have the opportunity 
to cross swords with all the members in this Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to congratulate all those who were elected or re-elected, 
especially the new members who are here for the first time and 
who are about to experience something extraordinary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss if I did not seize this opportunity to thank, 
from the bottom of my heart, the constituents of Sherbrooke, Fleurimont 
and Lennoxville who have re-elected me for the fourth time.  I must tell 
you I owe these people a great deal.  They are remarkable.  I have had 
the privilege of representing them for many years now.  I am trying—with 
some success, I believe—to give a true picture of what they are; 
they in turn illustrate quite well what I represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To those people I want to reiterate my sincerest thanks and I want 
to confirm that I intend to serve them with the utmost dedication and 
energy. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An election campaign is a moment for the country to stop, to 
reflect, to look back and hopefully to look forward.  The last 
election campaign was an opportunity to do that.  For me and for 
my party the last three and a half or four years have been very 
much about learning more about Canada, about exploring our 
possibilities and about going forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last two years and during the election campaign a number 
of things struck me about our country that are worth repeating 
today.  Beyond the walls of this Parliament, beyond partisanship, 
beyond the rhetoric, there are a lot of good things to speak 
about in this country. There always was, by the way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take a second—and it may sound unusual to some 
members—to speak about our successes as a country in dealing 
with our deficits and debts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A very powerful consensus exists in Canada for governments to 
balance their books and get their priorities right.  There is so 
much consensus that we find New Democrats in Saskatchewan, 
Liberals in the Atlantic provinces, the Parti québècois in Quebec 
City and even, who would have thought, the federal Liberal Party 
of Canada have come around to the idea that we have to actually 
balance our books.

government in 1984 a debt that had increased 1,000 per cent fold under 
the leadership of the Liberal government, including this Prime 
Minister.  Their memory is so selective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is also a country that has done very well in the area of 
trade.  Thank God we had trade agreements.  Thank God we fought 
and won the election of 1988 and had the free trade agreement 
that allowed this country to increase merchandise export trade to 
the United States by 100 per cent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We fought and signed the North American free trade agreement. Do 
they remember that the same people who now sit on the government 
benches fought us tooth and nail on the free trade agreement? 
What do we have today?  We have a Prime Minister bent on 
travelling outside the country to increase trade with new 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is now bragging about his new amigos in Chile.  He wants to 
sign deals with Argentina.  He wants to sign deals with Israel. 
He cannot get enough of it.  Yet they fought us every inch of the 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The good news is that had it not been for these trade agreements 
that we signed, that we fought for, Canada would have had no 
growth in its economy.  Our domestic economy has been on its back 
for the last four years.  Canada's domestic economy under the 
leadership of this Prime Minister has been on its back.  We would 
have been in a recession had it not been for the trade agreements 
which we signed and fought for in 1988 and 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You have to appreciate the spectacle of the Prime Minister and 
the Liberal benches rising during question period to applaud the 
government on its brilliant record. Here is a government whose 
record will say that it has governed over the longest period of 
high unemployment in Canada, the 82nd month in a row of 
unemployment above 9 per cent, since the depression of the thirties. 
That is the record they were applauding this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the record they are applauding?  There are more poor 
children today in Canada than there were when this government was 
elected.  What is the record of the Liberal government that its 
members all applauded?  It is the record of a government that has 
left Canadians poorer today than they were in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The income of Canadians has gone down 1.3 per cent.  Yet if we follow 
the reaction from the government benches, if we watch them as 
they get up and speak, if we listen to the Minister of Finance or 
even the Prime Minister, they will quote the numbers from the 
OECD  “We are doing better than this country and that country”. 
Maybe they should travel to Atlantic Canada.  Maybe they should 
stay out of the OECD a little more, move away from Paris and 
Sweden or the Norwegian countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they spent a little more time in Atlantic Canada and in 
western Canada they might find out why so few Canadians rise to 
applaud them when they speak of their record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is also a country that saw its health care and social 
spending slashed unilaterally, without consultation.  This was 
unprecedented: a 40 per cent cut in funding.  Was there any consultation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, where was all the talk of partnership back then, 
this great notion of rediscovered partnership? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election campaign the Liberals had to back down on 
health care because the health care system in this country is 
broken.  The health care system in this country is suffering. 
The health care system in this country is threatened.  It is 
threatened because of the actions of this government and this 
Prime Minister and failed leadership. They are going to be held 
accountable in this Parliament for having done that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speech from the Throne was the opportunity for the 
government to say to Canadians what it is about this new century, 
this new era that it cares about, that it wants to focus on.  In 
fact, you will remember, Mr. Speaker, that we have had an 
election campaign—it was a first, a precedent, as far as I 
know—to allow the Prime Minister to write the Speech from the 
Throne.  “I need the whole summer”, he said.  Why did the Prime 
Minister go to the polls three years into the mandate?  Because 
he needed to write a Speech from the Throne. I do not know who 
wrote the Speech from the Throne, but I hope he was paid by the 
word and not the idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could have expected a Canadian agenda.  What did we get 
instead?  The usual expressions of goodwill.  How many times can 
we rediscover youth unemployment? Guess what, there are young 
Canadians out of work.  Gee, why did we not think of that before? 
Speech after speech, and budget after budget gives us these 
useless, meaningless words, backed up by absolutely nothing, 
except a measure announced a few days ago, $90 million for an 
internship program for 3,000 young Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About half a million young Canadians are out of work.  I think 
it is more than 400,000.  If a person has a young boy or girl out 
of work today, that person can tell them there is hope. At this 
rate in 136 years the Liberal government will actually help them 
find an internship. That is the great initiative of this Liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We expected the government to at least heed the message of the 
election campaign, to say “We have got it.  We understand.  We 
heard.”  There were many messages sent in the campaign. One of 
them at least the Prime Minister and I would agree on. He 
certainly did not return with the majority that he was hoping 
for.  He certainly did not return with the vast support from all 
of the regions of the country. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one thing the Prime Minister and the Liberal government 
must have understood, it is that they definitely did not get the mandate 
that they were hoping for and that they talked so much about at the 
beginning of the election campaign. So a message was sent to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We wonder however if that message was understood. Is there any 
indication in the throne speech that this government accepted and heeded 
the message sent by the Canadian people? I looked in the Speech from the 
Throne and I can only conclude that the answer is no. 
The government did not get it at all. We were expecting a national 
action plan, a plan that would set priorities and tell us how we would 
enter the new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did we get instead? We heard from a government that wants to 
repent, a government that tells us it will reinvest money in certain 
programs. In which programs will the government reinvest? Can you 
believe that it will reinvest in health, after cutting spending in that 
sector by 35 per cent? It will reinvest in summer employment programs for 
students, after slashing them. It will reinvest in culture, after making 
cuts in that sector. And it will reinvest in post-secondary education, 
after reducing its support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few minutes ago, we witnessed something extraordinary. I was here 
in 1995. When the 1995 budget was tabled, the finance minister rose to 
announce that he would cut the scholarship program designed to encourage 
student excellence. This was in 1995. And do you know what happened, Mr. 
Speaker? 
I see the member for Rimouski, who was there as well, and the leader of 
the Bloc Quebecois. They all rose as they did this afternoon and 
applauded the Minister of Finance. This afternoon, the Prime Minister 
announced a new scholarship program. Guess what? They all rose together 
and applauded again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what they did. But we did not applaud, because we were 
extremely sad to see such a good program being cancelled. What has 
changed in the meantime? Thousands of students have lost the financial 
support they needed to pursue their studies. Why? Because the government 
was shortsighted and unable to sort out its own priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has not changed is the docility of the Liberal backbenchers, 
who rise and applaud their Minister of Finance and their Prime Minister 
day after day.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This explains why there were 31 out of 32 from the Maritimes 
in the last Parliament.  The people of the Atlantic provinces have 
said, “We've had enough of hearing the same old tune over and over, 
now we'd like to have people who will speak up for us, including 
the Progressive Conservative members in the Progressive 
Conservative caucus”.  They will speak up for the people of the 
Atlantic provinces, since silence has reigned in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This same government is now talking about reinvestments and 
partnerships.  But if this government understands what true 
partnership means, what is it waiting for to form a partnership in 
the area of health, to co-manage our federation? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government had an opportunity with health care to 
demonstrate that it really believed in partnership instead of 
acting unilaterally.  There is still an opportunity.  The 
government could still sit down with the provinces and agree to 
national standards in health care.  Nowhere is it written in the 
Constitution that it has to be decided by Ottawa and enforced by 
Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me share a secret with the Prime Minister.  His position on 
health care is untenable.  He cannot cut the provinces by 35 per 
cent and 
then sit at the same table and say to them “I will run the 
show”.  It is not going to work.  The worst news is that it is 
not the Prime Minister's government or the provincial governments 
that will suffer.  It is Canadians in waiting rooms, Canadians on 
waiting lists who are suffering from the Prime Minister's lack of 
leadership on this issue.  They are paying the price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We await the Prime Minister's partnership.  We hope this time 
the words will be worth more than they were the last time they 
were spoken.  The same is true for child poverty or youth policy. 
This Prime Minister invited us to give him some ideas on what we 
would do for young Canadians.  I want to invite the Prime 
Minister today to look at the program, the platform we put 
forward in the last campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We spoke of a youth policy with a clear objective where every 
young person should either be in school, in training, at work or 
doing community service. The national government can do something 
useful in that regard.  You, sir, have the power to change the 
employment insurance system as it applies to young people.  You 
do not have to ask anyone's permission.  All you have to do is 
work with the provinces— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order.  I know the hon. member is an 
experienced member.  I know he intends to address his remarks to 
the Chair and I invite him to do so and to continue to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B>  I would be more than happy to 
address my remarks to the Chair, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying, the Prime Minister has an opportunity to do so. 
We hope he is sincere in his extending a hand for some advice. He 
can change the employment insurance system and pursue this 
policy.  He does not need to get involved in areas of provincial 
jurisdiction.  We should all recognize outright that education 
and training are provincial jurisdictions but the Prime Minister 
happens to have some control.  In this Parliament control of EI 
is an important lever that has an impact on the decisions young 
people make in the area of education and training.  The 
employment insurance system must be put at the service of the 
objectives we pursue in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same is true in regard to the issues as they affect 
aboriginal Canadians.  I was happy to see at least in the Speech 
from the Throne an acknowledgement of the royal commission's 
report.  I am far from agreeing with everything that is in that 
report but we cannot as a country remain in denial in dealing 
with what is going to be one of the most important issues of the 
next century, an issue that will test our values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most disappointing part is on jobs and on taxes.  The 
government had an opportunity.  This is a government that could 
have sent the signal that it has learned something about the last 
30 years.  But what has this Liberal government been saying to us 
now that we are facing the prospect of a surplus?  It is saying 
that there is new money, that the promised land has arrived, that 
happy days are back again. The Prime Minister and his government 
say that they are going to spend that money because they have 
learned nothing from the last 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government works on a few assumptions.  The first 
assumption is that if there is a problem then the answer must be 
that government has to intervene.   The second assumption is that 
if a government must intervene it has to be the federal 
government. “We're the ones who have to intervene, no one 
else”. The third assumption is that if there is a problem we 
have to spend money.  That is the Liberal philosophy.  It is 
written nicely. I assume that it is written over the Prime 
Minister's door “If you send it we will spend it”.  That is the 
way it goes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk to the real record of this government, the record 
the government was applauding this afternoon.  The real country 
with which we compare is to the south of us.  It is a quite 
imperfect comparison, but maybe the prime minister could explain 
to us why the unemployment rate in the United States 
is half what it is in Canada.  Why is it that in the United 
States real disposable income has gone up 11 per cent in the last two 
years when it has gone down 1.6 per cent while the Liberals have been in 
power?  Will they blame the Conservatives?  Of course they will. 
If something goes wrong during the term of this government it is 
the fault of the past government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if there is job creation, if the books are being 
balanced, if there are low interest rates and if there is low 
inflation it is all due to the Liberals, assuming that Canadians 
are dumb enough to buy all of that.  I believe they will find 
that all of that wears very thin. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could have offered a different course to the 
country.  With respect to taxes this government should not put up 
with the shameless rip off of employed Canadians, of the working 
poor in this country, who are being gouged because the government 
is using the employment insurance fund to pay down the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the question in the House today yes or no, is the 
employment insurance fund of the government being used to reduce 
the deficit. I cannot get a straight answer.  We know what the 
answer is.  The government is paying down the deficit on the 
backs of workers, small businesses and on the backs of the 
unemployed, especially young unemployed Canadians.  If the 
government wanted to do something today it could reduce premiums 
25 per cent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are they listening?  No, they are heckling.  Maybe I am not 
convincing.  Maybe I am too partisan.  But do members think that 
the Canadian Chambers of Commerce is too partisan?  Do members 
think that le Conseil du patronat is too partisan?  I do not 
think so. I hope the government will learn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise to ask that the 
hon. leader of the Conservative Party be afforded the same 
privilege which was afforded the leader of the New Democratic 
Party, that he be, by the unanimous consent of the House, 
permitted to finish his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent for the 
hon. member to complete his remarks? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government speaks 
of taxes.  It speaks of trade.  There is all this talk of 
rebalancing the federation. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new balance of responsibilities will be established in the 
federation. And no need to say that the leader of the official 
opposition wants a massive decentralization. However, there are areas 
where the powers of the national government must be strengthened because 
it is not by stripping the federal government of all its 
responsibilities that we will keep the country united. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this government believes in the real rebalancing of the 
federation it would also speak to the areas where the national 
government should reinforce its powers.  Believe it or not, this 
party of mine, the party which founded the country, the party of 
Sir John A. Macdonald, the party which was here through good and 
bad times, also knows that a strong central government in the 
areas in which it should be strong is the best bet in keeping 
this country together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I will offer some advice to my colleague.  If the 
government really believed in the strength of leadership it would 
offer some leadership on interprovincial trade.  How is it that 
there is more freedom to trade between Canada and the United 
States and Canada and Mexico than there is between Manitoba and 
Nova Scotia?  There is more freedom to trade between Ontario and 
Ohio than there is between Canadian provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prime minister is going to do another Team Canada trip in 
January.  Can I make a humble suggestion to him. When he returns 
to Canada, why does he not get the premiers together and organize 
a Team Canada trip in Canada? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1805"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has the power to say to the provinces “we will 
give you a year to sit down with us and conclude an agreement for 
interprovincial trade with a dispute settlement mechanism”. Who 
would object to that?  Surely not the government of the province 
of Quebec which in the 1995 referendum argued under the word 
partnership the value of the economic union of Canada. Surely not 
those who have signed on to trade agreements with dispute 
settlement mechanisms with the United States and Mexico. Why can 
we not have this for Canada and create jobs as we do it? That is 
also one of the compelling reasons why such leadership should be 
exercised.  So here are a few of the ideas of things that we 
believe in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the area of health care we think this government needs to 
move very rapidly. We hope it will use the opportunity of the 
first ministers conference to propose a covenant in health care, 
to recognize that the agenda on health care in this country will 
not be a national agenda until the national government plays its 
role.  It is fine to go out there and accuse the provinces of 
doing this or that.  But they will be out there and Canadians 
will be in a period of uncertainty on health care until the 
national government offers real leadership, not denial.  This 
includes recognition of national standards, a covenant in the 
area of health care, an agreement by the provinces to enforce 
those standards and also a dispute settlement mechanisms in the 
area of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In education and training this government could lead the way by 
offering some leadership on testing in the sciences and math, 
wiring schools, doing everything in its power to offer access to 
post-secondary education which it seemed to say today. Frankly, 
excuse us if we are a little jaundiced, but we have heard the 
same words in the past and seen exactly the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pension reform will also be very important. The prime minister 
will know that Canadians are very concerned, and they should be. 
The government has a hidden agenda.  To put it very directly, it 
is proposing pension reform that is going to overwhelmingly 
affect middle class Canadians.  Middle class Canadians are going 
to get whacked by the government. They are going to be affected. 
The people who saved for their retirements are now going to find 
out that these Liberal members are going to take that away from 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want the government to come clean. We are ready to debate it 
and prepare pension reform.  But we want to know the truth. How 
will this affect single women?  How will this affect married 
women who are in relationships where their income will be judged 
on family income, not their individual income?  How will this 
affect decisions that Canadians are going to make in the future 
with regard to how they save?  Will we have a system that will 
offer them incentives not to save but rather not plan at all 
because if they do the government will take their money away? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the area of CPP we continue to support increases in premiums 
reluctantly.  This is a payroll tax.  But we equally believe that 
if there is going to be an increase in the premiums they must be 
offset by tax reductions.  Otherwise we will end up with an $11 
billion or $12 billion bite out of the economy. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally—but do not raise your hopes too high when I say finally, 
and it would go faster if I was not constantly interrupted, but I have 
plenty of time—I come to the unity issue. The Prime Minister probably 
read the letter I sent to the provincial premiers to explain the 
position of my party on the Canadian unity issue. It must be said that 
the Prime Minister knows that, for us, the national unity issue is not 
partisan. I think that we proved it in the 1995 referendum and after. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what I would like most to share with the Prime Minister today 
is the need, the importance of leadership at the national level because 
it is one thing to ask provincial premiers to carry the ball, in the 
end, there is only one Prime Minister, only one national government and 
only one national Parliament. 
They cannot be replaced. We cannot expect the provincial premiers 
to act on behalf of a national government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have hoped that we could turn the page on the post-Meech 
period and finally start building a national, a Canadian 
action plan. Until we agree at least on a common action plan, we 
will be at the mercy of a government in Quebec whose avowed 
intention is to break up Canada. And we only react to what it does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hope I place in this Parliament and in this government is 
that they come up with an action plan. Nobody expects that 
solutions will be found overnight. Nor does anyone expect any 
constitutional amendments. 
But what we want to see is the Prime Minister at least agreeing with the 
provincial premiers on a common plan of action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would caution, however, against a plan too heavily focused on 
Quebec, as it currently is following the Calgary declaration, and doomed 
to failure because demagogues elsewhere in the country are going to 
seize on this and once again say that Quebec is running the country, 
when in fact Quebecers do not wake up every morning wondering whether 
they are a distinct society.  They do not have to ask themselves the 
question—they are a distinct society, period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And while I am on the topic, they do not need anyone's permission 
to be distinct.  Except that the redistribution of powers, the federal 
power to spend, and the new mechanisms for co-operation affect not only 
Quebecers and westerners but also people in the Atlantic provinces and 
in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will move forward if we can do so together.  That is one of the 
lessons.  There is no need to move heaven and earth.  All that is 
necessary is an action plan with three or four priorities.  The only 
person who can come up with that is the Prime Minister of the country. 
But our Prime Minister, unfortunately, seems disinclined to act. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prime minister will know that in the cabinet room in which 
he convenes his cabinet, as he sits down there is something 
written on the wall in front of him.  The next time there is a 
cabinet meeting I hope he and his colleagues will take a second 
to read what is written there.  It is from the book of proverbs: 
“Where there is no vision, the people perish”.  Fear of failure 
in this area of unity for Canada is not an excuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Plan Bs are nice but let me share with the prime minister that 
as far as this party is concerned they can pursue all the plan Bs 
they want, compete with the opposition leader in trying to be 
Canada's undertaker, but as far as this party is concerned and as 
far as Canada is concerned, failure is not an option and will 
never be an option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are happy and honoured to be in the House to offer our 
contribution to the national debate.  We look forward to 
building, continuing to build what is a great country and 
offering our children even more than what our own parents left to 
us.  That is the true test and will be the true test of this 
Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of all the things a government can effect and decide on, one 
important symbol is a passport.  If one stops a second to think 
about what we have accomplished together as Canadians through the 
last 130 years, from Sir John A. Macdonald to Laurier to yes, 
Diefenbaker, Mr. Trudeau, Mr. Mulroney, every government, the 
single accomplishment that symbolizes what we have done together 
is the value of the Canadian passport that we will pass on to our 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who would have thought 130 years ago when this country was 
founded that as a consequence of the work of these generations of 
men and women that we would pass on to our children today what is 
viewed as the most valuable passport in the world, in a world 
that is globalized, in a world where more than ever people 
travel—

</I></B></P><P align=left>When the leader of the Conservative Party asked if he would have 
a couple or three minutes to do the same, we are now into 
doubling the time allotted for his speech.  I think it is time to 
wrap it up.  This has gone on now almost 15 or 20 minutes over 
the allotted period.  I ask you to ask him to bring his remarks 
to a close. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member has not raised a 
point of order.  He is simply making a representation.  The House 
extended the time and did not place a limit on the hon. member's 
time.  I think the hon. member has expressed his view about what 
the extension should have been but in the circumstances, I 
recognize the hon. member for Sherbrooke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest:</B>  Following the hon. member, Mr. 
Speaker, he could just leave if he wanted to.  He does not have 
to sit and put up with this.  I understand how difficult it must 
be for him to listen to all of this, but that is fine.  I do not 
want to dwell on that.  If he does not want to listen, he can 
just leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying, one of the great accomplishments of this 
country in this era of globalization, in this era where we as 
Canadians are more than ever present everywhere in the world, we 
are passing on to our kids this passport that is of great value. 
This is something that we, as a Parliament, have a very direct 
effect upon.  I hope that everyone of us here will make a 
commitment, will inherit that passport and be able to benefit 
from what is one of the greatest citizenships in the world, being 
a Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Pursuant to order made on Tuesday, 
September 23, 1997, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
10 o'clock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 6.17 p.m.)
