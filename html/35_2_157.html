	<B>Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
week is National Volunteer Week and communities across the 
country will pay tribute to their volunteers and the countless ways 
in which they help individuals, organizations and causes.
<P>
	Volunteer week exemplifies the motivation and dedication of the 
millions of people across Canada whose efforts improve the quality 
of life for us all. Volunteers are a crucial component of every 
community.
<P>
	This year's theme is ``Volunteers, our greatest natural resource''. 
I invite all members of Parliament to help make National Volunteer 
Week a success in their constituency by donating a few minutes of 
their time to a local organization or cause. In doing so, we are 
helping to ensure that volunteerism in Canada will continue to 
survive into the 21st century.
<P>
	Congratulations and a huge thank you to all our volunteers.

	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister responsible for the Canadian Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation just woke up and realized that federal and provincial 
overlap is nothing but a waste of time and money.
<P>
	At the signing of a Canada-Saskatchewan social housing 
agreement, the minister stated that having a single level of 
government in charge of administering  social housing would 
maximize the use of taxpayers' money by simplifying existing 
arrangements and encouraging the development of a single window 
concept.
<P>
	When will we see powers transferred to the provinces in areas 
like forestry, tourism and mining? After three and a half years, it is 
time this government recognized that the Bloc Quebecois was right 
about the need to eliminate overlap.

	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, China is repeatedly jailing dissidents like Wei Jingsheng 
and student leader Wang Dan for speaking out on human rights. It 
has violated its joint declaration agreement on Hong Kong and its 
basic law by appointing its own legislative council, introducing 
laws on subversion and rolling back Hong Kong's bill of rights.
<P>
	Our government's response is not to support the UN declaration 
condemning China for its human rights abuses, a complete 
flip-flop. China is a superpower but it can also be a great nation. 
China and Canada need to realize that a stable business 
environment is conditional on human rights, democratic principles, 
freedoms and the rule of law. To ignore this is to imperil not only 
people but economic stability. The government must stop its 
continued silence of the lambs and must speak out for human 
rights.

	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
most young people are law-abiding citizens concerned about the 
safety of others and who deplore crime and violence in any form. I 
have worked with many who excel and who are working within 
their communities to bring about changes for the better.
<P>
	I want to congratulate one of these groups, the students of Miller 
High School of Regina who came to Ottawa this week with a 
petition to improve the Young Offenders Act. They have shown 
initiative by preparing recommendations that would make the act 
more effective and workable for offenders and their victims.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9794"> 9794 </A></B>
<P>
	In Regina crime is a serious concern. Most crimes of theft and 
break and enter are committed by repeat offenders who are already 
subject to the provisions of the Young Offenders Act because of 
past offences.
<P>
	The Miller High School students recommend reducing the age in 
the Young Offenders Act to 16 years to correspond with the 
responsibilities youths take on when they obtain a driver's licence. 
They also recommend mandatory restitution to victims. The 
students suggest that young offenders work off their crimes with 
community improvement work.
<P>
	These Miller High School students know it is time to get tough 
on crime and hope the Liberals get serious about it too. I applaud 
their initiative.

	<B>Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
my colleague from Hillsborough said, this week is National 
Volunteer Week, an opportunity to celebrate the tremendous 
contributions of volunteers to our communities across Canada.
<P>
	Millions of Canadians give freely of their time to support 
non-profit, voluntary and charitable organizations. Their 
generosity and participation builds and maintains the quality of life 
in our towns and neighbourhoods. Every year Canadians contribute 
over $13 billion to charities and non-profit organizations. 
Approximately 13 million people volunteer their time each year in 
Canada. In my hometown of Hamilton, more than 100,000 
volunteer their time and money every year.

	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
the member of Parliament for London-Middlesex I have received 
considerable input from my constituents about the new seniors 
benefit which begins in 2001. I also had the recent opportunity to 
meet with the London Council for Seniors to discuss this important 
new program.
<P>
	Based on the input I have received, the vast majority of my 
constituents who are seniors support the new seniors benefit. They 
understand that it is fairer and that 75 per cent of Canadian seniors 
will receive the same or higher benefits.
<P>
	One area of concern raised was a possible discrimination against 
married senior couples as  compared to single seniors who cohabit. 
Senior married couples want to know that the rules about combined 
incomes will be applied the same way in both cases.
<P>
	I call on the government to review this concern carefully and to 
ensure a fair and just application of the new rules as they apply to 
the income of all seniors.

	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the agreement on the management of salmon issues to be signed 
today by the Prime Minister and the Premier of British Columbia 
vindicates former Prime Minister Lester Pearson's concept of 
co-operative federalism.
<P>
	Intergovernmental relations in a federal system should be based 
not on confrontation and a rush to the law courts but on pragmatic 
accommodation and administrative partnership. Today most major 
issues transcend the problem-solving capacities of any one level of 
government and require a melding of decision making, not a 
fragmentation of power into watertight compartments of 
constitutional competence, federal or provincial.
<P>
	We all have everything to gain by this highly pragmatic, 
empirically based approach to the regulation and conservation of a 
great national resource on the west coast.
<P>
<B>(1410 )</B>
<P>
	It is to be achieved not by the frustrating processes of formal 
amendment of the Constitution, but by consensus of the respective 
heads of government, concretized in a legal agreement based on the 
constitutional principle of good faith and on mutual benefit.

	<B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
Liberal government has the power to improve the safety of 
Canadians. In criminal law the government chooses to do little or 
nothing to make our streets safer. But in Parks Canada the heavy 
hand of the government is shutting down the Jasper airstrip, for no 
good reason.
<P>
	The Jasper airstrip does not cost taxpayers' money. There is not 
one incident in the airstrip's 70-year history of environmental 
damage or injury to animals. However, there are many instances of 
the airstrip being used for emergency landings by pilots.
<P>
	While door knocking in Jasper, of the scores of people I talked 
to, all but one wanted the airstrip to remain open.
<P>
	In the future when an emergency landing is needed in Jasper, will 
the heritage minister accept responsibility for any personal injuries 
or deaths? When will the government listen to the common sense 
of the common people to do what is right for Jasper residents and 
Canadians everywhere?

but most particularly women volunteers.
<P>
	Every day countless numbers of women give their time to work 
in our hospitals, schools and nursing homes, on boards and fund 
raising committees, with literacy programs, rape crisis centres and 
more. These women come from a wide cross section of society and 
bring a great range of skills and expertise to the cultural, political, 
social and economic fabric of the country. In fact our paid economy 
could not function without the unpaid work of volunteers.
<P>
	As a nation we cannot afford to take our volunteers for granted. 
They are without a doubt the heart and soul of our country and on 
behalf of all of us I say thank you.

Mr. Speaker, a few days ago Prime Minister Chrétien announced 
that Spar Aerospace located in my riding of 
Bramalea-Gore-Malton will develop the space  shuttle's Canada 
Hand, thus creating at least 125 local jobs.
<P>
	Everyone in the riding is pleased that our highly skilled local 
workforce has once again helped sustain and create local jobs. In 
fact, an even larger impact on local companies is expected due to 
the manufacturing and marketing of commercial spin-offs resulting 
from the Canada Hand robotic technology.
<P>
	I want to thank the Prime Minister for his ongoing efforts to 
create as many jobs as possible, despite the current tough economic 
climate. Though the government cannot be satisfied with the 
current level of unemployment, its efforts to date are still 
commendable.
<P>
	Having said that, I want to point out that I plan to pursue 
additional job creation until everyone-

	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, on behalf of my party, I moved a motion dealing with the 
Bankruptcy Act.
<P>
	This motion asks the Liberal government to amend the new 
standards governing bankruptcies, so as to prevent the application 
of more stringent rules for discharge of a student loan debt than for 
other types of debt.
<P>
	Our purpose is not to remove the responsibility of students, quite 
the contrary. We know that the vast majority of students pay back 
their loans. Rather, the motion seeks to make the government aware 
of the injustice being done to students who are overburdened with 
debt and not able to pay back their loans.
<P>
	In its study on the issue of personal income tax reform, the Bloc 
Quebecois recommended the introduction of a tax credit to help 
graduating students who must start paying off their loans.
<P>
	Instead of going after students, the Liberal government should 
make a commitment to create jobs, which is the only concrete 
solution to the student debt problem.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this week at the National Assembly, members of all 
parties voted unanimously in favour of a resolution asking the 
government to amend section 93 of the Canadian Constitution, in 
order to establish school boards in Quebec along linguistic lines.
<P>
	The resolution comes after more than 30 years of debate-this 
goes back to the Parent report-and after more than a year of 
consultations held across Quebec, throughout the regions. Today, 
the federal government tells us this was not enough.
<P>
	I want to ask the Prime Minister whether he realizes that he is 
preventing the passage of an amendment to section 93 before the 
next election and thus delaying the introduction of linguistic school 
boards in Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the resolution was passed last night. We received it this 
morning. The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs explained the 
party's position to the press.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	We will table a resolution in this House as soon as possible, I 
hope by the end of this week, but the government does not have full 
control over the rules of procedure of this House and the Upper 
House. We need the co-operation of all concerned. However, we 
will proceed as soon as possible, as I said yesterday.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister knows perfectly well that creating a 
joint parliamentary committee will keep the amendment from 
being adopted before the next election. The government is aware of 
that. This is no accident.
<P>
	And speaking of his Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, how 
could he say this morning that if Quebec had a federalist 
government, it would be less of a problem, when we know that all 
members of the National Assembly, both sovereignists and 
federalists, voted in favour of this resolution? How could he make 
such a statement?

<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> -as is often the case with 
francophone minorities in other provinces.
<P>
	The minister mentioned that fact, and there was a parliamentary 
committee in the Senate the last time, when we had a resolution 
from Newfoundland, and we believe there should be a 
parliamentary committee once again. And to speed things up, we 
have decided to have a joint committee of the Senate and the House 
of Commons that will conduct hearings where people will be able 
to express their views. There is nothing wrong with that. However, 
the government intends to support the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the Prime Minister wants to compare the position of 
language minorities in Quebec with that of language minorities 
across Canada, I warn him that the official opposition is willing to 
have an emergency debate on the subject here in the House, at any 
time.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is saying that the federal government is the 
custodian of democracy in Quebec and that the democratic process 
in Quebec is flawed. The Prime Minister is applying the theory of 
Pierre Elliott Trudeau that federalism should be the bulwark of 
democracy in Quebec. Does he realize this is an affront to the 
democratic process in Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is the government's responsibility to act as directed by 
the Canadian Constitution, and we intend to act on those 
responsibilities as we always have.
<P>
	Perhaps the hon. member should read the book published a few 
days ago by one of his members, the hon. member for Québec-Est. 
People thought some of his comments were not very nice to the 
minority.
<P>
	Personally, I am fighting for the French minority outside Quebec 
and the English minority in Quebec, because the Canadian 
government has a duty to defend minorities wherever they happen 
to be in this country.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Denying the democratic legitimacy of the National Assembly in 
the matter of linguistic school boards, Ottawa will be launching 
public hearings, while all of the stakeholders in Quebec have long 
ago made their opinions known on this matter. Yesterday Quebec 
spoke in the National Assembly; now it is Ottawa's turn to listen.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister admit that his government is taking 
refuge behind the unelected Senate in order to preclude any 
possibility of this constitutional amendment being passed before 
the coming election? After the Supreme Court, now the senators, 
who are not elected, are the ones to set Quebec's education policy.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, what the hon. member is suggesting is contrary to 
both the spirit and the letter of the Constitution of Canada. The two 
parliaments, provincial and federal, must decide on this 
amendment. Both have to make up their minds.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	The Canadian Parliament is also the Parliament of Quebecers. 
The elected representatives of Quebec also sit in the House of 
Commons. Canada in its entirety belongs to the people of Quebec.
<P>
	Moreover, the federal government has specific responsibilities 
toward minorities. This does not mean that the provinces are not 
concerned about them, but it is our responsibility. Because we have 
required a consensus, which the opposition did not want to seek, we 
have protected minorities everywhere in the country. A 
government proposing a constitutional amendment under section 
43 which affects its minority requires the support of that minority if 
it wants to get that amendment from the Parliament of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, just 
having a school bag does not make a person smart.
<P>
	When the Government of New Brunswick was calling for a 
constitutional amendment in 1993, Ottawa held no public hearings.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister justify his acting without any public 
hearings, in the case of New Brunswick, while he refuses to do the 
same in the case of Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in the case of New Brunswick, the Government of 
New Brunswick had the decency to establish a parliamentary 
commission in that province in 1990.
<P>
	Quebecers greatly respect democracy. They must not be very 
proud of the way their provincial government has handled the 
school board matter.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dion:</B> Absolutely. It is scandalous that groups were not even 
given the opportunity to express themselves. The Parliament of 
Canada will give them that opportunity, knowing that Quebecers 
greatly respect democracy.

this obsolete idea? Why does he have nothing fresh and new to

had a list of things that had to be done. We said that we did not want 
to have a grand meeting that produced nothing. We were to do it 
step by step, province by province.
<P>
	As I said, the House of Commons has given a veto to all regions 
of Canada including Quebec. We voted for distinct society for 
Quebec. We are settling the question of manpower training with the 
provinces. Today we are settling the problem of fisheries with 
British Columbia.
<P>
	We settled the duplication in forestry, in mining and in the 
environment. I could go on and on and on. The practical way is to 
give Canadians an answer to one problem at a time. It is the modern 
way.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the government is so void of new ideas that it has to go to 
the public in an election after 3.5 years. It has come up empty on 
national unity. The Prime Minister also has the worst string of 
unemployment records since the depression. He is right up there 
with R.B. Bennett.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has nothing new to say to the 1.4 million 
unemployed. He has nothing new to say to unemployed young 
people. He has nothing new to say to the underemployed. He has 
nothing new to say to the one out of four workers afraid of losing 
their jobs. He has nothing new to say to the 75 per cent of 
Canadians who say he has done a bad job on jobs.
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>

	If jobs is the number one priority of the government, why is it 
that the Prime Minister has nothing new or innovative to say on the 
subject at all?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member was in the House when we presented a 
budget that put $350 million into jobs for young people. We have 
given an incentive reduction in the employment insurance 
premium. Employers hiring  new people will not have to pay such 
high premiums. It will help them to hire more people.
<P>
	The Canadian economy has given Canadians the lowest interest 
rates in 40 years. This will create jobs. Canadians had never seen a 
four-year period with such low inflation as we have managed to 
give them. We have increased our trade by 40 per cent in four 
years. This is also creating jobs.
<P>
	We will carry on because the Canadian people know we have to 
stay the course. We will not try to buy the votes of Canadians by 
giving them across the board tax cuts until we have reduced the 
deficit to zero.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when the government came to power it also promised a 
new level of integrity and accountability.
<P>
	Let us look at the record 3.5 years later: political interference in 
the Somalia inquiry, government stonewalling of the inquiry into 
tainted blood, the bungled Airbus project, the bungled Pearson 
airport project, the GST alive and well and bigger than ever before, 
and 73 per cent of Canadians saying that the government has done a 
bad job on keeping its promises.
<P>
	Why does the Prime Minister have nothing new to offer 
Canadians on political accountability? What happened to the red 
book promise to restore integrity to the institutions of government?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I stand very proud with my party on that. During the four 
years we formed government not a single minister was obliged to 
resign because of a scandal.
<P>
	There was a poll in <I>Maclean's</I> the other day which showed that 
four years ago about 15 per cent of Canadians had confidence in 
their national government. In the last poll, 55 per cent said it was 
the best of 20 nations.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> We will see if the rest of it gets a 
standing ovation.
<P>
	However this is only part of the deal, part of a sad story. Earlier 
the government gave the Pearson group $185 million in rent relief 
and $15 million in legal costs. This Liberal bungle has cost 
taxpayers $260 million.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Shame, shame.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Why has the government wasted 
$260 million of taxpayers money? Why?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is well known that the government has tried to settle the 
legal matter which led to the lawsuit. We tried by legislation and by 
negotiation. We tried by litigation. We wanted it settled from 
December 3, 1993.
<P>
	The figures put forward by the hon. member are simply false. I 
might add that when we tried to get that same settlement figure 
through legislation his party refused to vote for it, preferring 
instead to leave the taxpayer on the hook. Nevertheless we will 
leave that aside.
<P>
	The figure is $45 million for the expenses of the consortium and 
$15 million for other expenses that have taken place since and for 
legal fees. That is the cost of settling the lawsuit.
<P>
	With respect to the legal fees the government had to spend, we 
had a $663 million possible liability which they seem to be so 
enthusiastic about encouraging. Obviously we had to spend money 
to prevent that liability.
<P>
	The third point is the $185 million for specifically the 
construction and completion of the north-south runway, for the two 
firehalls at either end of the airport and for the new de-icing 
facility.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the $260 
million liability the minister speaks about is because of their 
bungle. There is no other reason. It was their mistake. The huge

was a good deal, are now in the settlement.

the $185 million in Toronto.
<P>

our airports could benefit from the open skies agreement and

the promoters who wanted to buy terminals 1 and 2 of the Pearson 
airport. Taxpayers will have to spend another $60 million on top of 
the $185 million the minister gave to the airport on March 25.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Transport today say that his government 
erred in the case of Toronto's airport, as it did in the case of 
Montreal's, and that the taxpayers will have to pay more than $245 
million to cover its blunders?

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr.

Pearson airport is $45 million for the legitimate expenses which 
were determined by an outside firm of experts in this area, plus the 
$15 million for legal fees and expenses since the time of the 
original contract. That is the cost of settling.
<P>
	When this government entered power in 1993 we had a choice. 
We looked at the Pearson airport deal and we  determined that it 
was not in the public interest, and it is not today in the public 
interest. We had the choice of simply going along with the previous 
deal which was not in the public interest or terminating it. We knew 
there would be costs to terminating it. We were willing to bear 
those costs and we did. They are $45 million plus $15 million.

Pearson airport scandal.
<P>
	On March 25, the Minister of Transport announced $185 million 
in financial assistance to the airport for projects that were over85 per cent complete. Three weeks later, everything is resolved as 
if by magic, while the dispute had been going on for three and a 
half years, as if the gift of $185 million had nothing to do with the 
$60 million.

	How does the minister explain all these coincidences on the eve 
of an election?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, first, I should point out that the local airport authority, 
ADM in Montreal, received over $100 million for special capital 
expenditures and another $20 million for a special fund. ADM 
received $120 million, and Montreal got $185 million.
<P>
	That is why it was clear that in Toronto they needed more funds 
to pay three things: the north-south runway, the de-icing area and 
the fire station. That is what we paid for with the $185 million.

conservation council like there is in Atlantic Canada. There will 
be a creation of a fisheries renewal advisory board which will

There will be a funding of $15 million for each government over

	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday 
during question period the justice minister denied that we need a 
victims bill of rights. He mocked the request of my colleague from 
Fraser Valley West for greater rights for victims by saying that the 
provinces have already taken steps to do exactly what is being 
asked for in the victims bill of rights, and yet the justice minister 
has admitted that victims of crime need more  rights, as shown by 
his request to the justice committee to study the bill.
<P>
	Why then does he say that these rights are already covered by 
provincial legislation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, yesterday I was not 
mocking victims bills of rights, I was mocking the hon. member for 
Fraser Valley West.
<P>
	Second, the hon. member will know that the justice committee, 
at my request, is examining the entire matter of victims rights in 
this country. I wrote to the committee a year ago. It is examining 
the Statutes of Canada, the administration of justice in the 
provinces, and it is preparing proposals to improve the justice 
system to make it more sensitive to the rights of victims.
<P>
	That is what I have asked the hon. member and his colleagues on 
the justice committee to do.
<P>
<B>(1455 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wonder if 
the justice minister feels that mocking a legitimate question from 
the opposition is becoming, in particular on the eve of an election.
<P>
	Murderer Karla Homolka has the right to a university education. 
Child killer Clifford Olson has the right to apply for early release. 
Criminals are demanding sex change operations, colour televisions 
and computers. And now a murderer in prison in New Brunswick is 
demanding the right to be transported to Nova Scotia every time he 
wants a conjugal visit with his wife who is imprisoned there for her 
part in the murder.
<P>
	The government gives in to these demands while victims stand at 
the door begging. How can the minister deny victims reasonable 
rights while he continues to protect the rights of Clifford Olson and 
while doing nothing to stop rapists like Darren Ursel from walking 
free?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the system at present includes a 
statement of victims rights adopted by the federal government and 
the provinces in 1988. Since 1988 the federal government has 
conducted itself, drafted its legislation, selected its priorities and 
determined its policies in relation to that statement of principles. It 
is in essence a victims bill of rights.
<P>
	However, there is room for improvement in any system, 
including the criminal justice system when it comes to victims. It is 
for that reason that I have asked the justice committee, of which the 
hon. member is a hardworking part, to work on the victims bill of 
rights to look at how it can be improved, how the system can be 
made more sensitive to the interests of victims.
<P>
	I look forward to the report of that committee. This government 
will examine it with care and do the right thing.

<P>
	On several occasions, I have risen in this House to question the

	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday the 
heritage minister talked about the receptions held to salute our 
Olympic athletes. I want to make it clear that the Reform Party and 
all Canadians are proud of those athletes.
<P>
	I am not talking about the Canadian salute to our Olympic 
athletes and their cocktail party. I am talking about the federal 
government caviar cocktail party held for under 100 people at the 
CNN centre in Atlanta on July 22, 1996. It is time the heritage 
minister came clean on this. I know two people who took pictures 
at this event. These people have told us what it was like.
<P>
	While Canadians are working harder and being taxed more, this 
minister is having a caviar cocktail party for $65,000 for under 100 
people. She should give an answer to the Canadian people
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is ironic. I thought that 
in light of the fact that the member and his colleagues have not 
hestitated from associating themselves with any reception he might 
have hung his head in shame.
<P>
	He made a reference yesterday to so-called MP junkets. I took 
the time to do a bit of research. The member who decried that we 
had approximately 20 young wheelchair athletes aged 14 and 15 at 
this reception is the same member who took a trip to Cambridge, 
England, Oslo,  Norway, Tromso, Norway, Stockholm, Sweden,

	Could he tell the House and the people of northern Manitoba,

<P>
	The minister today tabled a 1996 annual report to Parliament on 
ministerial permits. Could the minister inform the House on how 
these numbers compare to those of previous years? What assurance 
could the minister give Canadians that these permits are being used 
responsibly?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last year we issued fewer 
ministerial permits than the year before, fewer than ever before. 
There was a 27 per cent reduction.
<P>
	We are achieving the goal of controlling the immigration 
program more efficiently. Ministerial permits allow people who 
would otherwise not be admissible to Canada to come in under 
specific circumstances or for specific reasons. Each case is looked 
at very seriously.

or not an individual in trust or authority has been convicted of a 
previous offence, including sexual interference and incest.
<P>
	The legislation is introduced following a tragic situation in my 
riding of Guelph-Wellington where a child was molested by an 
individual who had a previous conviction. The child's mother was 
unable to obtain any information regarding the individual. Parents 
must have access to prior records to ensure that this kind of 
situation cannot happen again.
<P>

	These petitioners believe that Bill C-7, the proposed controlled

amalgamating the Narcotics Control Act with parts of the existing

<P>
	The petitioners also believe Bill C-7 to be ambiguous and 
unclear in its wording, leaving room for the health protection 
branch to use it against free access to classic traditional herbal 
remedies. They feel that the wishes of consumers are not being 
considered by either the Minister of Health or the health protection 
branch, and that this bill is being passed arbitrarily without 
consulting the electorate.

	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (for Minister of Transport, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-44, an act for making the system of Canadian 
ports competitive, efficient and commercially oriented, providing 
for the establishing of port authorities and the divesting of certain 
harbours and ports, for the commercialization of the St. Lawrence 
Seaway and ferry services and other matters related to maritime 
trade and transport and amending the Pilotage Act and amending 
and repealing other acts as a consequence, be read the third time 
and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, after two years and much work 
by many people, I have the privilege to speak to third reading of 
Bill C-44, the new Canada marine act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9809"> 9809 </A></B>
<P>
	This is important legislation for Canada's transportation system 
because it gives a new outlook and direction for many of our key 
marine institutions and facilities.
<P>
	The core idea of the legislation is to make it easier for marine 
facilities of all sorts to operate according to business principles. 
That is why ports will have to work within market based decisions 
about when and how new investments will be made. That is why we 
will allow for the seaway to be managed under new commercial 
agreements. That is why we will ensure that pilotage authorities 
will have to achieve full cost recovery in their operations without 
any backstop through the public treasury.
<P>
	The bill also takes important steps to make sure that key plans 
and decisions are taken much closer to the people who are most 
directly affected by the results, who include the users of the 
facilities, the adjacent communities and other interests.
<P>
	That is why the nominations to port boards will have so much 
more local input. That is why ports will have a system of land use 
plans and substantial disclosure responsibilities regarding their 
operations. That is why the divestiture program for public ports is 
moving ahead so smoothly. That is why we have authority for 
Marine Atlantic to divest services where they can be local 
operators.
<P>
	Even for a bill with all of these fine qualities, the standing 
committee was able to bring in a substantial number of 
improvements after listening to a wide range of comments from all 
parties concerned.
<P>
	In his wisdom, the hon. member for Windsor West, our House 
leader, saw an opportunity to maximize the individual member's 
legislative authority here in the House. He moved quickly to 
transfer Bill C-44 to the Standing Committee on Transport so that 
members could engage their energies in the construction of 
legislation and improvements pursuant to testimony and 
consultation sought from and given by a broad and profound range 
of concerned citizens, both private and corporate.
<P>
	Ordinary members from the Reform Party, the Bloc, the New 
Democratic Party and the government constructed Bill C-44. It is a 
members' bill. It is a good bill. I thank the hon. member for 
Windsor West and look forward to seeing more bills moved to 
committee from first reading. He would be proud to see that most 
members' initiatives appear in the bill without alteration, which is 
a testament to the diligence and insight of the committee.
<P>
	The additional amendments made at report stage look like a lot 
of change. In reality, however, most of what we have done has been 
a fine tuning of two aspects of the new arrangements for port 
authorities.
<P>
	At the standing committee it was requested that Transport 
Canada take a closer look at the treatment of subsidiaries under the 
new arrangements for port authorities. This was done and a small 
group of amendments has been included to cover this area.
<P>
	The government also took time to look carefully at what results 
would flow from the largest change introduced by the standing 
committee to give crown agent status to the new port authorities. 
Why was the amendment on agent status so important that all 
committee members supported it? There are several reasons.
<P>
	The ports need to have more certainty that they will be protected 
from provincial and federal taxation.
<P>
	With Bill C-44 we want to provide the right climate and 
conditions to allow the ports to operate more efficiently and, as a 
result, to be more competitive, especially with American ports 
which, as we all know, continue to receive substantial public 
subsidies.
<P>
	Without agent status the ports would have to make either 
arrangements with municipalities for services or, if that is not 
acceptable to the municipalities, they could become subject to full 
taxation. Costly challenges for both ports and municipalities could 
be the result of this ambiguity.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	Crown agent status gives port authorities a clear exemption from 
full property taxation and would enable them to be covered by the 
Municipal Grants Act. As such they will pay grants in lieu of taxes 
to those municipalities at the same levels as other federal facilities 
and installations around the country. This is the more acceptable 
option to both the ports and the municipalities as it provides 
certainty for both parties. For most of the ports that will become 
CPAs this represents a continuation of the status quo.
<P>
	For the most part new obligations from agent status would come 
mainly to the federal government as principal and not to the agent. 
That is why we have amendments that clarify what restraints 
should exist for the agent. Part of this was to have agent status 
apply only to core responsibilities of the ports, not to other more 
peripheral or non-core activities which they might be able to 
undertake.
<P>
	This is how we are able to protect the overall commercialization 
objective. We say in the new amendments that any borrowing by a 
port authority will not be done as a crown agent. That is consistent 
with the provision already in the bill that port debts could not be 
paid by the treasury and nor could loans be guaranteed.
<P>
	Once this idea of a split was in place we also had to say how the 
split would be specified for all to see. Since the bill already 
contained the letters patent method for setting up the new port 
authorities, we only needed to  clarify that this split would be set 
out in the letters patent. To make sure that outsiders would know 
when they are dealing with an agent, the amendments obliged the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9810"> 9810 </A></B>
<P>
port authority to make this declaration in all their non-agent 
dealings with third parties. Even before agent status was added we 
put measures into the bill to protect the crown from liabilities of the 
ports and to ensure that they are accountable.
<P>
	Because of the new relationship created by agent status, we now 
have some additional points to deal with liability issues. Perhaps 
the most important accountability mechanism in the bill stems 
from the fact that the ports will have to raise their financing in the 
private sector. Port development aspirations will be subjected to 
assessments of commercial risk by commercial lenders.
<P>
	The act would forbid the use of appropriations to make certain 
kinds of payments to port authorities or their wholly owned 
subsidiaries. This means they have to be more efficient than they 
are today and to a significant extent the government, the Canadian 
taxpayer, will not be on a hook for their liability.
<P>
	Canada port authorities will have a high degree of transparency 
through rigorous disclosure to the public. Bill C-44 requires each 
port authority to provide public financing reports, public audits, a 
public land use plan, an annual general meeting open to the public 
at which directors and senior officers are available to answer any 
and all questions, complete disclosure of remuneration and 
expenses of board members and details of port operating expenses.
<P>
	Ports are now covered under the Access to Information Act 
which further strengthens their accountability to all stakeholders. 
We have taken measures to ensure that ports must borrow in their 
own names and not in the name of the crown to emphasize to 
lenders that the crown does not stand behind these obligations.
<P>
	In finishing its work before it reported the bill, the standing 
committee asked that an up to date schedule be placed at the end 
before it was put forward for second reading. This too has been 
done with the result that we are now looking at several additional 
ports.
<P>
	I would be remiss to talk only about the future of port authorities 
under the bill. It has important features for public ports, the 
seaway, our pilotage authorities and the ferry services of Marine 
Atlantic Incorporated.
<P>
	I will outline where we are in this bill regarding the seaway. I 
believe the key to the future viability of the seaway lies in 
achieving efficiencies, reducing costs and making the system more 
competitive. If the system has lower costs it can be viable at 
relatively low traffic levels. It is also well placed to attract 
additional traffic.
<P>
	I am firmly of the view that commercialization of the seaway is 
the best way to achieve the efficiencies and cost savings which are 
vital to the future viability of the  seaway system. Part III of the 
Canada Marine Act enables the Minister of Transport to enter into 
agreements with a not for profit corporation to operate and 
maintain all or part of the seaway. Amendments made by the 
standing committee also allow for future operations to be 
transferred to any body that might be established through 
international agreement.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	The St. Lawrence seaway authority is obliged to transfer at the 
direction of the minister any parts of its assets that are required for 
the new arrangement. The existing seaway authority would be 
dissolved at an appropriate date.
<P>
	Any entity which has entered into an agreement with the 
minister to operate the seaway is obliged to have a high degree of 
transparency through annual public meetings and annual public 
financial statements. Special examinations of seaway operations 
and financial results will be carried at least once every five years.
<P>
	The proposed legislation also prohibits unjust discrimination by 
the seaway operator that places any user of the seaway at a 
disadvantage. This ensures fair access to all users with no undue 
preference for those who take a role in the company that runs the 
seaway.
<P>
	On July 15, 1996 the Minister of Transport signed a letter of 
intent with a group representing the major shippers and carriers on 
the seaway. The target is for these users to form a not for profit 
corporation to take on the operations of the seaway. The 
government would retain title to the seaway's fixed assets.
<P>
	The goal of this commercialization is to give the operators 
strong incentives to increase efficiency and reduce costs.
<P>
	We believe that the users group is best placed to take over the 
system, as users are highly motivated by a desire to minimize the 
seaway tolls they pay and to ensure the long term integrity of the 
system. The industries represented, particularly the steel industry 
in my hometown of Hamilton and the marine carriers, need the 
seaway for their long term survival. A deal with the users group 
would place the seaway well on the road the ongoing self 
sufficiency.
<P>
	Let me assure all hon. members that I am confident of the future 
success of the seaway. It has been an essential component of our 
national transportation infrastructure in the past and we will do 
everything in our power to ensure that it remains as a revitalized 
national asset and becomes a more efficient and competitive link 
with our international trading partners.
<P>
	We now have a balanced, well though out piece of legislation, 
one that will move Canada's marine industries confidently into the 
new century. I urge all hon. members to support the amended bill.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to speak today at third reading 
of Bill C-44, which makes the system of Canadian ports 
competitive by rationalizing its administration, and affects a 
number of aspects of the Canadian maritime industry.
<P>
	One might wonder initially why such a bill is necessary. I would 
like to reply with an anecdote. I settled in Gaspé in 1980. When I 
arrived there, I was amazed at the port infrastructure, its natural 
capacity and the fact that it was underutilized.
<P>
	By that point, I was already a staunch sovereignist, but one more 
significant argument in favour of sovereignty was added when one 
after another of the local people explained to us that there had been 
a little bit of favouritism involved when the decision was made to 
give priority to Halifax, and that there had been no real investment 
in this port so it could continue to operate in future and contribute 
fully to the regional economy.
<P>
	In fact, the only time the federal government wanted to make 
proper use of it was during the Second World War. They were only 
too pleased to make use of the port's natural basin to protect the 
Allied fleet from repeatedly being picked off by German 
submarines.
<P>
	During that time, people in Canada became aware, not only in 
Gaspé but everywhere in Quebec and Canada, that one of the 
greatest failures of Canadian federalism is the management of 
Canada's ports. There has been, particularly in the past 30 years, a 
waning interest, a repeated absence of any efficient policy, because 
of a stubborn desire at all stages, at all points in all of these 
reforms, to keep control highly centralized and to avoid any 
decentralization.
<P>
	I think that it is a good thing that the need for new legislation has 
been looked at, the need to establish new ground rules so that the 
system will be better defined and more efficient and make a greater 
contribution to the economic development of both Quebec and 
Canada.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	Perhaps the Quebec sovereignists should take some of the 
blame; the whole area of transportation, which falls under federal 
jurisdiction, has long eluded us. Now we can see that we would 
really need to have full control over this area in order to be able to 
use it in support of the Quebec economy, and north-south 
development in particular.
<P>
	True to our word, we have taken an active part in developing the 
best possible legislation in this Parliament, in spite of the fact that 
we believe the best solution for Quebec is to become sovereign. In 
terms of marine policy, we wanted to ensure as much as possible 
that the errors of the past were cast aside because the federal  
jurisdiction in this area has always led to measures that were far 
from realistic.
<P>
	Our port facilities were also seen as something of only local 
interest in the old days. For example, the river was ignored for 
many years because people had no idea of how important its 
development potential was, since those who owned it, that is to say 
the federal government, were not looking after it much, if at all, 
and the communities where the infrastructures were located did not 
feel responsible for them because they did not own them.
<P>
	On both sides there were responsibilities that needed to be taken 
that were not because the fact that ports are identified as coming 
under federal jurisdiction in the Canadian Constitution no longer 
tallies with what maritime Canada is like today.
<P>
	In addition, there was always the whole issue hint of patronage, 
which is still with us. Everyone in the Rivière-du-Loup area, in my 
riding, remembers all the campaigns where a great deal was made 
of the port of Cacouna. Before every election, the federal 
government would invariably decide to add something or at least 
promise to invest in the port of Cacouna. Sometimes the promise 
was kept in part, sometimes not at all.
<P>
	One of the best examples of this is an excellent project, a $50 
million project, that had been developed toward the end of the 
Conservative government's mandate. In the end, $3 million were 
allocated to widen the harbour entrance, which was one of the 
phases of the project. But two years after the announcement was 
made, and to this day, none of the other phases of the project have 
ever been implemented.
<P>
	In this area as in many others in Canada, the problem is not with 
the plumbing but with the design. But, as long as we are part of 
Canada, we have to try to make the best possible legislation, and to 
make sure existing facilities are an asset, not a liability, for the 
economy.
<P>
	The other important point regarding this legislation is that, in 
Canada, because the transportation sector is a shared jurisdiction, 
there is no integrated approach with the other transportation modes. 
The development of the marine, railway and highway sectors-the 
latter being a provincial jurisdiction-was always somewhat 
unstructured. There was no nationally integrated strategy in the 
transportation sector, and this is particularly obvious in the marine 
sector, as we will see in a moment.
<P>
	There was also a need to do something about the fact that, in the 
past, port facilities in Canada were not subject to any performance 
standards.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I hope the hon. member is listening to my 
comments while she is talking, because it will make it easier for 
me.
<P>
	Do we realize that, until now, the whole Canadian ports system 
was never really subject to any performance  standards? Despite its 
very capable personnel, Transport Canada has no precise idea of 
the revenues and expenditures of each port facility. This says 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9812"> 9812 </A></B>
<P>
something about the number of decisions made in the past that 
were not based on economic reality, on a solid development 
foundation, and we were able to see that when we travelled across 
the country.
<P>
	The problem is this lack of obligation to perform, this somewhat 
old-fashioned tradition of associating ports with patronage. Indeed, 
let us not forget that, to this day-and, as I will mention later, the 
current bill does not really change the situation-the government 
can appoint a new harbour master right after an election; it can 
replace the person who has been holding that position for seven or 
eight years and start all over with a new incumbent. This is not to 
say the new harbour master is not competent, but it creates 
operational problems, as we experienced in Cacouna, for example. 
A very competent person had been appointed under the same 
process, several years earlier. That person knew the port and the 
captains who used it and was able to negotiate with them and with 
the longshoremen so that operations could be optimized.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	Then, overnight, after the election, the Liberal government 
decided to put in somebody else, but it had nothing to do with this 
person's competence. They were perfectly competent. Someone 
else was appointed who is also competent, but who has had to go 
through the whole learning process.
<P>
	So we can see the sort of situation that existed in the marine 
sector, the patronage side. Here as well there were important things 
to change.
<P>
	The bill's approach to rectifying matters is to say that 
management must be rationalized. The best way to rationalize the 
management of Canada's ports is to transfer jurisdiction to the 
provinces. That is obviously the simplest solution, but with the 
Canadian Constitution, simple solutions do not often work.
<P>
	So since the federal government is avoiding trying to change the 
Canadian Constitution because there is no viable amending 
formula that would not cause a major upheaval, it decided to come 
up with a bill that would allow commercialization, that would give 
greater responsibility for port facilities to the communities, without 
changing the responsibility provided for in the Constitution, which 
could, in the long term, still create problems. But an effort has been 
made in the bill to solve matters in this way, and we will look at 
what it says.
<P>
	It is a very big undertaking, because the bill looks at the way in 
which Canada's national ports, such as Halifax, Montreal, Quebec 
City and Sept-Îles, as well as large ports like Trois-Rivières and 
those on the Saguenay, in addition to all regional ports, will be 
dealt with in the future.
<P>
	When we looked into it, we found that 80 per cent of the activity 
in Canadian ports took place in 15 to 20 per cent of the ports. This 
could lead one to conclude that a number of facilities are seriously 
underutilized, but still generating operating costs that we can no 
longer really pay for as a society because we no longer have the 
means.
<P>
	As the parliamentary secretary pointed out, this bill also raises 
the whole issue of the St. Lawrence Seaway. We will come back to 
that later, but there were many questions on what was the best 
choice for the future of the St. Lawrence Seaway, ranging from 
total privatization to the formation of a binational structure 
involving both the U.S. and Canada, with all manner of joint 
formulas thrown in for good measure. And I am not sure that we 
have found the ideal formula; we will look at it in a few minutes.
<P>
	There is also another important element in this bill, the Pilotage 
Act. The study wanted to find out whether piloting in Canada was 
working properly, whether safety was being properly ensured, and 
whether it was competitive. You can see that there are two different 
aspects which are hard to balance out. On the one hand, you have 
the industry requirements; it wants to be competitive, able to offer 
a distribution system on the world market, a maritime circuit that is 
economically advantageous for those shipping by sea. On the other 
hand, there is a seaway, the entire St. Lawrence system, which is 
not easily navigable and has been made safe by the services ofSt. Lawrence pilots for hundreds of years.
<P>
	In Quebec there is a very important tradition, one peculiar to the 
St. Lawrence, that piloting is virtually always done in French. This 
is important. A pilot on a ship needs to be able to communicate 
with other vessels, sometimes recreational and sometimes 
commercial, with all manner of vessels. Generally, the people on 
these vessels speak the language of the country, which means 
French, if along the St. Lawrence.
<P>
	There has been a battle going on for some years now, as attempts 
have been made to restrict the protection of the French language for 
the pilots along the St. Lawrence, while at the same time trying to 
take away some of the advantages that have been earned by these 
pilots through having developed skills to ensure safe navigation of 
the river, in order to save some money.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	But we have to determine what safety depends on. I think that in 
this respect, the work done by the Bloc Quebecois in committee 
saved the day, and I will get back to this later on when we discuss 
the various amendments submitted during consideration in 
committee.
<P>
	A lot of work was done on this bill, as the parliamentary 
secretary pointed out. The Keyes report, a report by the Standing 
Committee on Transport, did an overview of the situation, which 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9813"> 9813 </A></B>
<P>
led to Bill C-44 in its  initial form. At this stage, the ports were very 
independent. There was practically no Canadian system.
<P>
	Today, I understand why the bill was amended. It was for the 
same reasons mentioned by people we met when the committee 
travelled across Canada. In Bill C-44, to show people what it would 
be like, structures like the ADM or Aéroports de Montréal were set 
up; in other words, there was a transfer of full responsibility for an 
economic sector depending on marine transportation, but without 
any government supervision.
<P>
	This would have led to impossible situations in a few years' 
time. Institutions or companies that were responsible for the ports 
might have had objectives widely differing from those of the 
Quebec government or the Canadian government, and this would 
have been quite unacceptable. In fact, people kept telling us this as 
the committee travelled across Canada, and fortunately, their 
comments were heard. Amendments were proposed which 
remedied the situation to some extent.
<P>
	Another aspect of the initial bill was that the future of theSt. Lawrence Seaway was somewhat hazy. What the government 
had decided to do was not necessarily feasible and was in fact 
pretty risky. There was some discussion of this aspect, but I believe 
there has not been enough.
<P>
	I referred to the pilotage situation earlier in my speech, and I 
want to get back to this. What happened in this respect is very 
interesting. Throughout consideration in committee, hardly any 
questions were raised. The bill restored the status quo, which 
satisfied the pilots' associations who saw this as a way to provide 
adequate safety levels on Canada's waterways.
<P>
	In the initial bill, there was no problem on that score. However, 
the committee received a draft amendment-I do not know what 
lobby it came from or whether it was because of the way Canadian 
political parties are financed-that would take away from these 
pilots many of the resources they need to maintain adequate safety 
levels on the St. Lawrence.
<P>
	The language of work on the St. Lawrence again became an 
issue, and some shipowners' associations that wanted to improve 
productivity had submitted a proposal and managed to put it on the 
table, although there had been no prior discussion in committee.
<P>
	I met people on both sides a few weeks before, and the pilots said 
that Bill C-44 was excellent as far as the Pilotage Act was 
concerned. However, that evening when the amendment reached 
the committee from an unknown source, as I said earlier, the pilots 
panicked and asked us to do something. They said something was 
not working and wondered how it was that the government arrived 
at such an amendment, which bore no resemblance whatsoever to 
their submission or to their wishes. They said, for example, that the 
government wanted to impose the method of pilot selection and  
decide which captains could become pilots. This process does not 
work they way they would like, and they would like it changed.
<P>
	When they saw the amendment, the pilots called on the Bloc 
Quebecois. The members of the Reform Party said this morning 
that they thought the Bloc was engaging in systematic obstruction. 
That is not so. The Bloc is not engaging in systematic obstruction. 
It is raising arguments in committee until it can convince people of 
the relevance of its arguments. That is what we tried to do.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	We convinced the Liberal majority, because, when the 
committee report was tabled, we had the Liberals' agreement to 
withdraw this amendment and their changes to the rules of the 
game. I consider this a major victory for safety in Canada's 
shipping industry.
<P>
	The initial bill contained the whole issue of regional ports in 
Quebec, like those in Baie-Comeau, Cacouna, Rimouski and 
Gaspé, and other medium sized ports throughout Canada, which are 
not identified as Canadian port authorities and which serve 
different functions.
<P>
	These include ports with ferry docks and commercial ports. 
Initially, the bill concerned all ports indiscriminately and provided 
for their transfer to regional or provincial authorities, but without 
specific rules or concepts.
<P>
	Through consultation and amendments in committee, we 
managed to establish a distinction between the concept of ferry port 
and that of commercial port. It is important to know that a ferry 
port has little revenue. It is essentially a road link. Cars are 
permitted to board a vessel in order to cross a waterway.
<P>
	However, the income for the dock itself is not so important. 
What counts is the economic benefits. We have shown this to be the 
case in the Rivière-du-Loup region. A study, commissioned by the 
economic development corporations of Rivière-du-Loup and 
Saint-Siméon, showed that the operation of this ferry generated 
$25 million per year in economic spinoffs, including $3.5 million 
or $4 million in tax revenue for each of the governments.
<P>
	This is one argument used to convince the federal authorities that 
any subsidy given at the provincial level, for instance, to keep the 
ferry in operation nine months per year instead of only four or five 
months is money well spent because economic activity boosts 
government revenues. It would therefore not be in the Quebec 
government's interest to do away with this subsidy.
<P>
	As far as the federal government is concerned, the repair costs, 
for the wharf in Rivière-du-Loup for example, may seem to be a 
throwback to the old days when governments handed out money to 
local communities. But that is not at all the case. The truth of  the 
matter is that, if and when it finally agrees to divesting, the federal 
government will actually be helping increase its future tax reve-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9814"> 9814 </A></B>
<P>
nues because, with a decent port infrastructure, the ferry will go on 
bringing in nearly $4 million in tax revenue every year.
<P>
	At this rate, even if the federal government invested $15 million 
or $20 million in a port facility with a 30 year life cycle, within five 
years, this investment would be recovered, which is certainly 
worthwhile.
<P>
	This is another aspect of Bill C-44, which required careful 
consideration and a great deal of work. Our consultations took us 
on a tour that proved to be very instructive, as it made us realize 
how diverse our maritimes structures are in Canada.
<P>
	These consultations came about as a result of the report to which 
I referred earlier, and to which the hon. member for 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans, on behalf of the Bloc 
Quebecois, made a very significant contribution, and the minority 
report which, among other things, sought to protect pilots. In this 
regard, we found, as I said earlier, a wide variety of port facilities in 
the country, and we heard a lot from port authorities. Port 
authorities are entities which are strangely similar to what the 
Canada port authorities will be under the new act, but they enjoy 
more leeway than will be provided in the act.
<P>
	The directors of these port authorities told us: ``Before granting 
private status to large Canadian ports under Bill C-44, take a look 
at how we operate, because we currently enjoy greater autonomy 
than is provided under the act''. We took their arguments into 
account and made sure that the port authority will have a structure 
closer to what it should be, even though we did not agree with all 
the arguments put forward by these stakeholders.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	Before abolishing existing port authorities, the federal 
government should look at all the implications, so as to make the 
best possible decision. There are situations where it would be 
preferable to maintain port authority status, and thus protect the 
economic life of a region, through the best possible economic 
development tool.
<P>
	During these consultations, the national ports made an attempt to 
be recognized as a federal agency. Let us be clear: in its original 
form, Bill C-44 gave a great deal of autonomy to ports, as I 
mentioned earlier, but without providing the guarantee enjoyed by 
a federal agency.
<P>
	Such a remark might seem astonishing coming from a 
sovereignist, but our analysis shows that, if Quebec attains 
sovereignty in two or three years, it will be very important when 
federal statutes become Quebec statues during the transition period 
that our national ports enjoy the status of national ports when they 
turn to outside markets for loans or business. As long as we are part 
of  Canada, I think it important that these ports enjoy this status.
<P>
	This is why, from the beginning, we supported national ports 
seeking a change in their status. The round of consultations also 
made us aware of the situation faced by remote ports.
<P>
	Ports that are unable to keep up with the rules of market 
competition are unable to meet market objectives and 
requirements. We saw this in the far north. We saw it in northern 
Manitoba. I think the federal government should look at the 
possibility of giving this status to ports in the Îles-de-la-Madeleine.
<P>
	The member for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine made 
absolutely no representations in this regard but, as usual, he is 
rather out of touch with the concerns of the people of 
Îles-de-la-Madeleine. Having spent three years trying to deliver on 
a still unfulfilled promise regarding the purchase of a ferry, he has 
not had time to look into the status of the port at Cap-aux-Meules. I 
think the federal government could do something about this error 
during the coming weeks and months, in the list of remote ports, 
and see how this could be accomplished.
<P>
	Other important matters were studied, including intermodality. 
In the transportation sector, where at least two levels of 
government are regularly involved, it has been very difficult to 
establish intermodal systems. Basically, intermodal means that 
what comes off a ship in Cacouna can be put on the train in a piggy 
back, and when the train reaches New York, Toronto or Boston, the 
freight can be shipped the rest of the way by truck.
<P>
	This kind of interaction between transportation modes does not 
work under the Canadian system, where the federal government 
and the provincial government are both anxious to protect their 
jurisdictions and keep their budgets strictly separate.
<P>
	A provincial government can take action with respect to highway 
transportation. In Quebec, since the federal government has 
divested itself of its responsibility for railway transportation, our 
highways are overloaded, due to the fact that the railway network 
has been under-utilized. And consider our waterways. Imagine how 
we could maximize our use of the St. Lawrence River.
<P>
	The advent of free trade has made Quebecers very aware of this, 
and the same applies to Ontarians. Today, we have networks that 
are better integrated. For instance, the port of Montreal is 
connected with Canadian Pacific, the two St. Lawrence-Hudson 
railway lines which connect Montreal with the markets of Detroit 
and Chicago and also provide a connection with New England. 
There is a future in this sort of thing, but we were late off the mark. 
We have some catching up to do. Under the present system, until 
both governments have responsibilities that are distinct, I think it 
will be very difficult to get satisfactory results.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9815"> 9815 </A></B>
<P>
	There is also the whole aspect of policing our ports. In this 
respect, the federal government is acting like a creature of habit. 
It failed to include the provinces in its planning, so that today, 
and particularly in Quebec, there is no attempt to co-ordinate 
police services in the ports to ensure that there is agreement on 
terms of reference and responsibilities. This is one of the aspects 
that remains to be resolved, and which is not dealt with 
satisfactorily in this bill.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	The important work in committee went well. As far as pilotage is 
concerned, we got through the Liberals' box of amendment 
surprises all right. Where it came from nobody knows, but I would 
guess it was from the party's election fund, because of the 
longstanding dispute between the pilots and the shipowners. In 
fact, it was the pilots against the shipowners through the regional 
administrations. One problem has not been solved. It was, however, 
a good defensive fight.
<P>
	However, safety on the St. Lawrence was not questioned. And 
the bill contained no clauses that would have been regretted two, 
three or five years down the road after a major shipping accident as 
can happen on the St. Lawrence. In addition to rowboats, there are 
oil tankers and ore carriers on the river. There is a lot of shipping 
that could have a major effect on the environment, in the event of 
an accident. It would have been a big mistake to amend things too 
quickly, under pressure and at the risk of safety. The pilots who 
spoke to me about it described the situation as it stands. The status 
quo is far more preferable to what was in the amendment.
<P>
	Is there a happy medium? Perhaps. There should be one. We 
should have taken the time before passing the bill at third reading 
to look into the issue more, to resolve the problem and to record it 
correctly in the legislation. Formulas are provided in the bill. That 
means another battle in the coming weeks, months or years, but we 
must not sacrifice safety.
<P>
	The ultimate solution must provide a level of safety that is 
watertight and avoid our regretting in five, ten or twenty years 
passing measures that put the future of the St. Lawrence at risk, 
such as in the case of the future Saguenay-St. Lawrence marine 
park, probably the most popular in the world, which will be 
established under federal and provincial legislation that we hope 
will be passed very soon. Unfortunately, it will be after the 
upcoming election, probably.
<P>
	It would be totally absurd for the Canadian government put 
money into developing the park while, in failing to pass adequate 
safety regulations, ending up contributing to an marine disaster that 
would irretrievably damage the park. In this respect, there have 
accidents worldwide, which speak for themselves and are worthy 
of closer consideration.
<P>
	In committee, the Bloc Quebecois obtained not only that major 
ports be granted federal agency status for the purpose of appointing 
the boards of directors, but also that only individuals who have 
relevant knowledge in the field be appointed. The minister will still 
have some leeway. Perhaps some aspects of the bill should have 
been made tighter, more airtight. It is not totally satisfactory, but it 
is a step in the right direction. There is still a way to go, but we will 
now be able to judge the current minister and his successors on the 
consequences of their actions.
<P>
	Aside from the point about the pilots, the finest victory the Bloc 
Quebecois has won in this struggle in committee was having the 
ports of the Saguenay and Trois-Rivières recognized as Canadian 
port authorities, or CPAs. Had it not been for the pressure brought 
to bear by the hon. member for Trois-Rivières, who incidentally 
nagged me day in and day out to have the port of Trois-Rivières 
included in the bill, it would probably not have been included.
<P>
	If members recall the statements made on air by the Prime 
Minister to a certain radio station in the Mauricie region, he 
himself was not too clear about what a Canadian port authority and 
a local port authority were. But the hon. member for Trois-Rivières 
was, and he made representations. We moved an amendment in this 
respect, which the government approved after hearing our 
supporting arguments.
<P>
	In the case of the port of Saguenay, I remember more dramatic 
events, since it was the late hon. member for Jonquière who made 
representations. I remember meeting the administrator of the port 
of Saguenay, in Quebec City. She showed us very clearly that, even 
if the port of Saguenay is smaller than those in the rest of the 
country that come under the responsibility of Canadian port 
authorities, it still met all the criteria and should therefore get the 
same status.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	So, the fact that two Quebec ports now come under the 
responsibility of Canadian port authorities, which was not the case 
under the original list, is a victory for the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	As regards divesting of regional wharfs, we asked time and again 
that the conditions of such divesting be included in the act, and that 
the $125 million fund provided for these facilities be increased, so 
as to be sure that they can enjoy all the necessary benefits as 
quickly as possible.
<P>
	We also scored a victory since an amendment was moved by a 
member from Newfoundland providing that services will be 
maintained until there is divesting, when a ferry service is provided 
at that facility. Under that amendment, if the province decides to 
maintain a ferry service, for example between Saint-Juste-du-Lac 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9816"> 9816 </A></B>
<P>
and Notre-Dame-du-Lac, in the region of  Témiscouata-located in 
the future riding I hope to represent in the next Parliament-the 
federal government is committed to not ending the service at these 
two facilities, as long as the province or local authority continues to 
provide a ferry service. This significant gain was the result of our 
representations and those of others.
<P>
	Let us look at concrete examples of divesting. In my riding, there 
are at least four cases. There is a ferry wharf in Rivière-du-Loup. 
Earlier, I showed that renovating the port facility is a significant 
and appropriate investment for the federal government. I think this 
should be done in the next few years, at the same time as divesting 
is perhaps being carried out through the Government of Quebec. 
Trois-Pistoles also has a ferry.
<P>
	Until now, it has been possible to patch up the wharf from 
election to election. Fortunately, there are referendums from time 
to time that help matters. It is grass roots politics in action, but 
some local authorities made some good connections and the result 
was that, by chance, they were able to obtain a nice little bonus, 
something like $500,000 before the last referendum campaign. I 
think people were really pleased, because it is prolonging the life of 
the wharf. However, this approach is not necessarily feasible in the 
medium term. A way must be found of ensuring that facilities are 
developed without having to rely on the vagaries of political 
patronage.
<P>
	There are other situations, such as the one at Cacouna. This is a 
port that is economically very attractive. It is making money and 
the community is prepared to take it over. It was mentioned by the 
minister, along with the port at Baie-Comeau, as a facility that the 
community had already expressed an interest in buying. This, by 
the way, is something I am proud of because, from the beginning, I 
passed on the information to all people in the area interested in 
ensuring the development of this port.
<P>
	For many years now, even before my election to office, people 
have been saying that the port of Cacouna should have an 
independent marketing plan so as to be able to compete with other 
ports on the market, and that is how divesting came to be 
considered. If it could be taken over by the community under 
interesting conditions, it would also be possible to have a 
marketing plan that would allow this port to show, among other 
things, the advantage it has in its longshoremen. The longshoremen 
are highly competent and productive, and do not go around seeing 
problems where there are none. Since the beginning of the year, 
there has been a very significant increase in port use, which I find 
very interesting.
<P>
	Personally, what I see as the most significant and most satisfying 
contribution is the Bloc Quebecois amendment adopted yesterday 
at the report stage, aimed at altering the very objective of this bill. 
In the original text, the objective is stated as to ``implement a 
National Marine Policy that provides Canada with the marine  
infrastructure that it needs and that will promote and safeguard 
Canada's competitiveness and trade objectives''.
<P>
	I have had an amendment added, which received majority 
support, which now indicates that competitiveness is not the only 
concern, but that it must also be an effective tool for the 
achievement of local, regional and national social and economic 
objectives. Thus, every time the federal government decides the 
future of a port, if it respects the spirit of its legislation it will have 
to take into account what the economic and social impact of closing 
the facility will be.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	In the coming years, we will judge the government on its 
compliance with this amendment. I am particularly happy that we 
managed to convince the government to accept it so that, even 
without a constitutional amendment I consider necessary, the 
legislation would at least improve the present situation. We will be 
able to assess the effectiveness of the current government in the 
coming years.
<P>
	One problem that was not adequately addressed in the policy is 
its integration into the Quebec economy. The St. Lawrence is not 
seen as the asset it should be. The future of the St. Lawrence 
Seaway is not properly defined.
<P>
	The link between rail transportation and trucking is not 
sufficiently clear. It is an economic tool that has long been and will 
continue to be underutilized without further amendment. Canada's 
marine policy is also an economic tool that has a major impact in 
the regions, whether at Cacouna, Baie-Comeau, Sept-Îles, Gaspé or 
Cap-aux-Meules-all examples I gave initially.
<P>
	Here are the reasons we will oppose this bill. First, in terms of 
management of harbour police, no agreement was reached with the 
provinces. In the problem with pilotage, safety comes first and 
foremost, and the Liberals' amendments must be rejected. 
Follow-up in the future must be ensured. We could today even have 
gone further and come up with a real solution, but at least we took a 
defensive stance protecting the safety of our waterways.
<P>
	In the bill, the issue of the St. Lawrence Seaway is not addressed 
clearly enough. It is not made clear enough whether it will be 
privatized or become a binational corporation.
<P>
	How transparent will the divesting be? Would it not have been 
possible to include in the legislation some rules and procedures to 
ensure the process is free from the vagaries of politics, based on 
clear and specific economic choices and more sensitive to 
Quebec's economic strategy? This would have required 
clarification of the cost recovery issue. For instance, will 
icebreaking costs ruin operations that people have taken over?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9817"> 9817 </A></B>
<P>
	There are also concerns about encountering the same kind of 
difficulties encountered with airports. Nowhere in this bill is a 
vision regarding intermodal transportation expressed, and no tools 
are provided to deal with north-south demands in our trade 
relations with the U.S. I think this developing market have been 
overlooked in the bill. Finally, one last concern: they did not budge 
on the issue of casinos on cruise ships.
<P>
	For all these reasons, while the bill is the result of a very 
meaningful and dynamic consultation process, there is still much 
that remains to be improved on. The government should have 
allowed time to go into more detail and resolve the problems. This 
way, the bill would have been truly satisfactory in addressing the 
needs of Canada's marine infrastructure as an economic tool that 
will have an impact not only tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, 
but also 10, 15 or 20 years down the road. For all these reasons, the 
Bloc Quebecois will vote against the bill at third reading.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, it is my duty to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
follows: the hon. member for Davenport-transportation; the hon. 
member for Sarnia-Lambton-health.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to add the Reform Party's contribution to the debate on Bill 
C-44. It is a wide ranging government bill that has a number of 
purposes: first, to streamline, consolidate and modernize the 
marine regulatory regime; second, to make Canadian ports more 
competitive, efficient and commercially oriented; third, to 
dismantle the bureaucratic and discredited Canada Ports 
Corporation resulting in the establishment of autonomous port 
authorities and the divestiture or closure of certain harbours and 
ports due to inefficiency and/or redundancy; fourth, to dismantle 
the ports police division of Canada Ports Corporation, shifting this 
responsibility to local and regional police forces; fifth, to 
commercialize the St. Lawrence Seaway through a joint venture 
with the U.S. seaway authorities; sixth, to commercialize various 
government ferry services and other infrastructure relating to 
maritime trade and transportation, including numerous Marine 
Atlantic operations; finally, seventh, to amend the federal Pilotage 
Act and amend and repeal other acts as a result in order to improve 
the cost effectiveness, efficiency and self-sufficiency of national 
pilotage services.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	The Reform Party supports the general intent of Bill C-44. We 
believe that the independently run port authority concept strikes a 
good balance between the operation of ports as crown corporations 
or as purely private sector interests.
<P>
	Marine user groups, port managers and chambers of commerce 
in the Pacific, Atlantic and Great Lakes-St. Lawrence regions of 
the country have all voiced their support for our party's stand on 
this issue. Reform is reasonably satisfied with the contents of Bill 
C-44 following the passage of various amendments by the Standing 
Committee on Transport. However, the bill remains imperfect and 
will continue to point out its ongoing shortcomings, as I will here at 
the third reading stage of the bill.
<P>
	During the past summer the Reform's transport critic, the 
member for Kootenay West-Revelstoke, studied Bill C-44 and 
made notes on various concerns. He went on the road to discuss the 
bill with a wide range of marine stakeholders. Virtually every 
group consulted expressed similar or identical concerns, including 
the following.
<P>
	Bill C-44 abolishes the Canada Ports Corporation which of 
course hires the Canada ports police and transfers these policing 
responsibilities over to the municipal police forces. At the request 
of many concerned city councils, Reform proposed an amendment 
allowing municipalities to be compensated for any extraordinary 
policing costs beyond the community norm, with the exact figures 
to be determined by the Canada Transportation Agency, which 
come about as a result of this transfer. The government refused to 
support this amendment.
<P>
	Bill C-44 allows the federal government to levy an annual fee or 
stipend against each port authority as payment for certain services 
provided to the ports by Ottawa. Although Reform does not object 
to the concept of a fee per se, we strongly object to its calculation 
on the basis of ports gross revenues pre-tax, as such a policy could 
drive ports with low operating margins into the red. We believe any 
fees should be levied on net revenues post-tax, after tax, 
conforming to the standard accounting practices which should be 
enforced to ensure that ports cannot hide or wipe out profits that 
actually exist on their books.
<P>
	That reminds me of Gracie Allen, of Burns and Allen. She had a 
way of figuring out taxes and the complicated tax nature of even 
the American system. She said: ``If you end up owing $5,000 to the 
government when you file your return, file it to show that you owe 
$10,000. That means you have a $5,000 overpayment and the 
government owes you $5,000. If you owe the government $5,000 
and it owes you $5,000, you are even and that is your tax return''. I 
see a member opposite trying to figure that out and does it make 
any sense. I was trying to advise people on how to show the 
government that if you owe it $5,000, actually it owes you $5,000 
and therefore you are even and so do not send money. I do not think 
Revenue Canada will like that.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> A Reform calculation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> That is a joke. Did you miss that?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9818"> 9818 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I will do it again. If you owe the government $5,000, 
fill in your return showing you owe it $10,000, then you have an 
overpayment. You tell the government it owes you $5,000, you owe 
the government $5,000 and now you are even.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Simple.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Madam Speaker, back to the matter at hand.
<P>
	Bill C-44 provides ports with federal agency status, allowing 
them to continue paying municipalities grants in lieu of property 
taxes after becoming independent port authorities. The result of 
this is stable taxation for ports that may suffer a difficult 
adjustment period as unsubsidized entities. However, harbour 
commissions which were paying no fees, grants or taxes before the 
passage of Bill C-44 will overnight be forced to pay grants to 
municipalities at the same rate as existing ports.
<P>
	Reform put forward an amendment that would have allowed 
harbour commissions a five-year tax phase-in period as a financial 
buffer similar to that provided to the ports. The government shot 
down this proposal despite the fact that the parliamentary secretary 
is from the Hamilton area.
<P>
	Bill C-44 stipulates that in determining the membership of a port 
authority's board of directors, one director shall be directly 
appointed by concerned municipalities, one by the province and 
one by the federal government, with the balance to be appointed by 
Ottawa in consultation with port users.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	The minister has stated his intention to appoint user 
representatives from a list of candidates provided by those users. 
However, and this is subject to interpretation, but technically Bill 
C-44 does not oblige him to do so.
<P>
	Reform simply wishes to ensure that the minister eliminates the 
possibility of undue patronage by agreeing to place in the bill, on 
paper, in writing what he has already stated before the transport 
committee which is his support for the list concept as advocated by 
user groups.
<P>
	Bill C-44 in its current form does not provide for a dispute 
settlement mechanism for shipper fee charges similar to that 
contained in Bill C-101 or Bill C-14. Reform would like to see such 
a mechanism included in the final version of Bill C-44.
<P>
	I have evaluated all the aspects of this 90-page bill. If there is a 
dispute it will be very difficult for somebody to come up with a 
resolution. Things could be tied up in the courts for a very long 
time.
<P>
	On behalf of our transport critic who is in his constituency today, 
I have agreed to submit some of his personal comments and 
opinions on the bill, which of  course I share as a Reform Party 
member. He tells a little bit of a different story than the 
parliamentary secretary to the transport minister told in his third 
reading intervention. The hon. member indicated that he really 
appreciated how so many people had spent two years and much 
work was done by many people to provide basically what he called 
a member's bill. We all know the dangers of writing laws by 
committee and allowing everybody to have a say on every bill. I am 
concerned that perhaps when there are some disputes it may not be 
as effective as it should be in solving those disputes.
<P>
	Our transport critic believes that Bill C-44 is essentially good 
legislation. It has the general support of all affected groups in the 
transportation industry. When the bill was sent to the Standing 
Committee on Transport it was not with the intention of deciding if 
it was acceptable or should be rejected. The intention was to listen 
to those involved, that is, witnesses from the marine sector. These 
included port authorities, shippers, port tenants, municipal and 
provincial officials and others affected by this legislation.
<P>
	In preparation for these hearings, the Department of Transport 
was to prepare a briefing book which would explain the impact and 
rationale of the legislation. Although the bill was sent to the 
committee before the spring recess in 1996, no briefing manual 
was provided over the entire duration of the summer. On return to 
Parliament that fall our transport critic asked what the delay was 
and when the document would be supplied. We were told that the 
briefing document was completed and had been sent out to all 
members, including the Reform transport critic. Obviously it had 
not. Only after several complaints to the committee was the 
document in question finally delivered.
<P>
	The committee then proceeded with hearings across Canada and 
in Ottawa. As a result of the testimony of witnesses, many 
amendments were offered by all parties who are members of the 
committee. Some were passed, some were withdrawn and some 
were rejected. Among those which were withdrawn were four 
government amendments that were supportable in the opinion of 
our transport critic. They dealt with changes to the Pilotage Act 
which would have permitted lower costs for Canadian operators in 
the St. Lawrence seaway.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois, for purely political purposes, staged a 
filibuster at committee to force the government to withdraw these 
amendments. The government did back down and withdrew four 
amendments which were designed to aid the control of cost of 
shipping in the St. Lawrence. The government members of the 
committee rationalized this as necessary to move the bill along 
quickly and suggested they would be able to reintroduce them at 
report stage.
<P>
	The first part of their rationalization soon disappeared when the 
bill completed clause by clause examination and passed from the 
committee.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9819"> 9819 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	Over four months have gone by without the government bringing 
the bill to the House. What was the rush? Was it nothing more than 
a ploy to allow the Liberals to claim they had attempted to bring 
those amendments in but were unable to do so because of the 
opposition parties?
<P>
	The second part of the government's rationalization also 
disappeared when it did not reintroduce its amendments at report 
stage in the House. In doing so the government was once again 
deceitful in its tactics. Reform was awaiting the submission of 
government report stage amendments to confirm that it was in fact 
reintroducing the four amendments dropped at committee in 
support of Bloc Quebecois tactics. We were told that the 
amendments were printed and that a copy had been sent to us. It 
had not been.
<P>
	We complained and apologies were offered. We were told that a 
copy would be sent immediately. It was not. It was only when the 
Reform transport critic sought out the information from a 
bureaucrat that a copy was finally delivered on the afternoon of 
April 7. Lo and behold there were no amendments from the 
government.
<P>
	As the hour was late and we had expected the government to 
bring Bill C-44 to the House on April 9, we had to scramble to table 
the missing amendments. It was not until the next day that we 
discovered that three of them had been tabled not by the 
government but by a government member acting on his own. It is 
nice to see there is some integrity left in its caucus, even if it only 
one or two members.
<P>
	There were other controversial amendments. These were the 
amendments made by Reform in response to the testimony heard 
before the committee and in an effort to do exactly what the 
committee's intention was supposed to be: make the bill better.
<P>
	One of the amendments involved the policing of the ports. Ports 
operating under the umbrella of the Canadian Ports Authority were 
policed by the Canada Ports Corporation Police. The bill will bring 
an end to the existence of the Canada Ports Corporation and none 
too soon. It was an absolute waste of money. However, with the end 
of the Canada Ports Corporation also came the end of the Canada 
ports police.
<P>
	In typical Liberal fashion the government and government 
members on the committee gave no thought to the ramifications of 
the removal of the ports police. ``Let the municipalities look after 
it'' was their cry in committee.
<P>
	Various cities and municipalities should look after basic 
policing, but the taxpayers of those communities should not be 
stuck with taxes for any additional policing that the ports may 
require.
<P>
	The Reform amendment did not tie the hands of the government. 
It did not place any extraordinary costs on the ports. It had the 
support of most of the interveners who came before the committee.
<P>
	In addition to the testimony heard at committee, the Reform 
transport critic met separately with members of various councils. 
Their position was that if they had to look after policing they were 
prepared to do so as long as they did not have to impose costs on 
the taxpayers of their communities for extraordinary policing 
requirements. That is what the Reform motion was all about.
<P>
	It was a very simple and straightforward amendment but it was 
turned down by the Liberal majority. It would be bad enough if the 
government simply disagreed with the Reform amendment. As it 
turned out it would appear the government agreed but simply did 
not want it on record that it was Reform that recognized and 
corrected this deficiency in the bill.
<P>
	For four months the bill sat with no action while the government 
tried to resolve the problems in other ways. In the end it did but it 
ended up doing exactly what the Reform motion would have done 
without all the costs and delays we have been subjected to by the 
Liberal government.
<P>
	Another amendment that was treated in the same way involved 
the payment of municipal taxes by ports. At the current time ports 
under the Canada Ports Corporation pay full grants in lieu of taxes. 
Ports operating under the Harbour Commissions Act were not 
required to pay local taxes. However many negotiated some form 
of payment for services to local government.
<P>
	The new legislation will establish many of the ports previously 
operating under the Harbour Commissions Act as Canadian port 
authorities. As such they will be required to pay full grants in lieu 
of taxes. The Reform Party has no problem with the payment of 
these taxes but there should be a phasing in period.
<P>
	The Reform amendment provided for a five-year phasing in 
period. Ports which were already paying full grants in lieu of taxes 
would continue to do so. Ports which were not required to pay these 
grants would pay no less than what they have already been paying. 
No city or municipality would have received less than they had 
already been getting.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	At the same time the phasing in period would have allowed time 
for the ports to prepare for the previously unbudgeted impact of 
these payments. The Liberals rejected this sensible amendment out 
of hand.
<P>
	Once again it appears the government actually agreed with 
Reform but did not want to admit that it was Reform that had 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9820"> 9820 </A></B>
<P>
identified and corrected this deficiency in the bill. Through closed 
door negotiations the  government went about trying to do exactly 
what the Reform motion would have achieved so that it could take 
credit for correcting a mistake of its own making. This time it 
failed. As a result many small ports which will become Canadian 
port authorities under the legislation will be placed in financial 
risk. What a way to start a new program.
<P>
	One amendment the government brought in that should be 
commented on is the one to continue the current status of Hamilton 
as a harbour commission. This was done for purely partisan 
political purposes by Liberal members from Hamilton. It is a 
betrayal of the committee's and the government's commitment to 
Hamilton Harbour Commission tenants and shippers. It is simply 
one more example of how the government looks after itself, no 
matter the cost to Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	There is some good in the bill. In fact there is quite a bit of good 
in it. However the objective of the committee, which was to 
examine the bill and with the input of concerned parties make it as 
good as possible, has not been met. The issues were clear. The 
solutions were clear but the Liberal government has failed 
miserably. It has failed not because of marine philosophy but 
because of political gamesmanship. It should not take pride in 
whatever accomplishments the bill might present. It should be 
ashamed of failing to provide what it could have been.
<P>
	I did not sit in on the committee hearings, but our transport critic 
shared his information with me and has asked me to make an 
intervention on his behalf. When people are asked for input to help 
design a bill by consensus and by using the best ideas, why would 
members of the standing committee wish to play partisan games? 
Why ignore the ports police and put them out of work? Why ignore 
a period of adjustment? Often government members say that a 
phase in period is needed yet they did not allow one here.
<P>
	Some of them were common sense amendments and common 
sense suggestions but the government refused to take them. As a 
member of Parliament I sat here last night voting on the 125 
amendments to the bill. Could there not have been an initial draft 
by a cabinet minister and the Department of Transport for which I 
have a lot of respect? The department has done one heck of a good 
job during the 3.5 years of Liberal government. I will give it full 
marks for how it has run things. In this one area it came up with a 
marines port bill. Could there not have been a rough draft rather 
than 125 amendments? We sat here last night voting on 65 different 
votes on the 125 amendments.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I just heard an intervention by a Liberal member. Are 
the Liberals listening while I am making this point? My point is the 
exact opposite. They are not listening. They ignored two or three 
common sense  suggestions which would improve the bill. They 
are playing political partisanship games, hoping to come up with a 
bill and take all the credit for it after asking all stakeholders to 
participate. The parliamentary secretary thanked everyone who 
participated, even members of the opposition.
<P>
	In the legislation I see danger down the road. There is no 
comprehensive dispute settlement mechanism. That is the same 
thing that is wrong with NAFTA. The government seems to shy 
away from making things simple and clear in the future. It wants to 
continue to confuse matters so that people have to hire lawyers to 
settle their problems.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	This is a sign of an incompetent minister who does not take the 
time to review the bill before it is sent off to committee for debate 
where many amendments have to be made to make it better. It is the 
same as what the Minister of Justice did lately by trying to tag on to 
the Reform notion of victims rights. He tried to claim it as his own 
and tried to take credit for it. Lately he has been saying that he has 
made amendments to section 745 to make things better for citizens 
but has failed to address the real problem.
<P>
	The last two justice bills we have debated were just admissions 
of failure. The Minister of Justice should be trained to read every 
clause and go through it clause by clause. When people are trained 
as lawyers they become much better at it than individuals like 
myself who are businessmen. We rely on lawyers to do this for us. 
We rely on them to look at.
<P>
	There was supposed to be an immediate impact statement but in 
comes another bill that defers the impact statement to the year 
2012. It is the same individual and the same department. That is 
incompetence.
<P>
	I am not talking about the quality or the intent of the bill. Its 
intent is good but the quality of work comes under criticism which 
I am trying to do in a constructive fashion. We waste everybody's 
time when we play political partisanship, when we do not listen to 
the people we asked for input, and when we come up with garbage 
that has to be rewritten five different ways.
<P>
	I am not talking about dotting an <I>i</I> or crossing a <I>t</I>. I am talking 
about common sense amendments which should be obvious. If they 
want a bill that states immediate impact statements should be 
allowed, why do they put in an amendment that states they are not 
allowed until the year 2012? What is the message being sent? If 
they make an amendment respecting the ports police that will put 
people out of work, some consideration should be given to them 
and they are ignored. That is not competent work.
<P>
	With all the amendments put forward a better job of debating 
them could have been done in committee. It did  not need to come 
back to the House. I do not think many MPs knew what they were 
voting on in all the votes we took. I sat here and relied on our critic 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9821"> 9821 </A></B>
<P>
or others who had looked into the matter on my behalf to say that it 
fit with our party policy and is something we can support.
<P>
	That is a disservice to the members of the House. We do not have 
the time to listen to stuff like this coming back from committees 
with 65 amendments and try to get our heads around them. We are 
making it harder for MPs to do their job better.
<P>
	The Liberals presented the bill. During debate and in the 
intervention of the parliamentary secretary for the transport 
minister, the member from Hamilton indicated that he liked the 
port authority and the way a crown corporation could be 
co-ordinated with the private sector because, he said, ``taxpayers 
will not be on the hook''. I agree with that intent. I fully endorse 
that objective.
<P>
	Let us look at the Department of Transport. Did it apply the same 
philosophy when it looked at Pearson airport and cancelled the 
contract? That can be called an airport authority. We are moving 
toward airport authorities. There is an airport authority there now. 
We set up a marine port authority. We now have an airport authority 
that will have directors. It will be not for profit. It will reinvest 
money and improve things there.
<P>
	Was the department's decision on Pearson done with the idea 
that taxpayers would not be on the hook? That is what was said at 
first and a lot of taxpayers believed it. In fact a lot of people voted 
for the government because they felt privatization of the airport 
would lead to huge profits for the private sector.
<P>
	I did not have a clue. I would not have known whether or not that 
was true. Somebody seemed to know. The current Prime Minister 
was in opposition then. He must have had some information when 
he said private developers were greedy sons-of-guns that would 
sock it to us and charge us hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Therefore he could not let the deal go through. What happened? It 
was cancelled. They sued for damages, which the government was 
willing to give. Then they sued for profits. They cannot sue for 
profits. How can they tell what the profits are? That was dumb.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	The Department of Transport fought them a bit too much. Then 
what happened? A year went by and we found out when they got to 
the discovery stage and everybody was filing their information that 
the government's defence was that it could not be sued for profits 
because it had looked into the deal and those guys would have lost 
money on it. Which is it? It cancels the deal because they would 
have made too much money and then defends itself by saying they 
would have lost money.
<P>
	Guess what it cost taxpayers. The parliamentary secretary used 
the Marine Port Authority as an  endorsement on how good the bill 
is. Taxpayers were not be on the hook. We might be because of the 
ambiguity in terms of the disputes in the bill. Let us say they are 
not as serious or will not cost as much as the Pearson airport. Who 
knows?
<P>
	Pearson airport cost $60 million off the top for withdrawing the 
lawsuit. Somehow or another somebody got enough money. I 
would like to know how the airport authority will come up with 
$700 million, how that money will be granted and how much of it 
will be a loan from the federal government somewhere down the 
line. We do not know the details. Pearson airport has already cost 
taxpayers about $200 million. Am I right?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Well, $185 million in rent 
concessions and $15 million in legal.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> It has already cost us $185 million in rent 
concessions, over $15 million in legal and the $60 million 
dismissal fee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> That is $260 million.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Yes, That is $260 million. That is a lot of money.
<P>
	The same government has representatives who say that 
taxpayers will not be on the hook. I am here to remind them that 
they were already on the hook and dished out a quarter of a billion 
dollars on Pearson airport.
<P>
	I have to keep on the same vein because Liberal opposition 
members are listening to my intervention and hanging on to every 
word. They want to know how know the Pearson airport has cost 
taxpayers $260 million.
<P>
	Why are they not doing something about it? Why are they not 
apologizing? Why are they not admitting they fumbled it, made a 
mistake? In that event they might do better if there is an election 
call in the next week or two.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports Bill C-44 respecting the Marine Port 
Authority. We will vote in favour of it. I appreciate the opportunity 
to point out some of the flaws that are still inherent in the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Comuzzi (Thunder Bay-Nipigon, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, if the previous speaker from the Reform Party had not 
made the analogy of Gracie and George Burns and how to solve 
income tax problems, I would have listened with interest to all the 
other items he raised like Pearson airport. With that analogy he 
made every other financial and arithmetic calculation suspect. 
Perhaps we should rethink the numbers.
<P>
	I thank my colleagues for allowing my amendments on Bill C-44 
respecting the marine act and how it affects future transportation.
<P>
	The act concerns ports and harbours, pilotage, the seaway and 
the Great Lakes. There is no question that the most critical aspect 
of the legislation is the restructuring of Canadian ports. The 
previous structure of the ports was not efficient and had some 
errors. Above  all else the ports had to be restructured. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9822"> 9822 </A></B>
<P>
legislation adequately addresses that point. I will talk about the 
harbours in a moment.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	We could have done a little better with pilotage. Although we 
addressed some of the issues with respect to pilotage, I do not agree 
with the remarks of the Bloc Quebecois member in the 
transportation committee.
<P>
	It was not an accommodation. It was an interest on the 
government side to make sure fundamental issues with respect to 
marine transportation would pass in this session. I am sure 
pilotage, as it particularly affects the Laurentian Pilotage Authority 
and pilotage on the Great Lakes, will be up for consideration as 
soon as we return to the House.
<P>
	There is a debate on whether the seaway and the Great Lakes 
system should be exclusively with users or exclusively with a 
binational panel. Some of our recommendations concerned a 
combination of both. The Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Seaway 
system is made up of 15 locks that raise and lower ships. We must 
consider the physical mechanics of running locks adequately, 
especially in Canada with our diverse and severe weather 
conditions starting some time in early March and lasting usually 
until December 31. A binational panel could administer the locks 
and bring forward economies of scale that are necessary to keep our 
transportation modes competitive in Canada.
<P>
	I want to discuss the harbour commissions in Canada. 
Unfortunately because of the legislation the harbour commissions 
have become a casualty. The harbour commissions have been a 
success story in the marine transportation history of Canada. All of 
them, from 1964 when the Harbour Commissions Act, the Toronto 
Harbour Commission Act and the Harbour Commissions Act of 
Hamilton were passed, were success stories in Canada.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to thank all commissioners who have ever 
served on any harbour commission in Canada for their wonderful 
work, dedication and volunteerism. They ensured that their harbour 
commissions operated successfully and were to the benefit of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	Harbour commissions will cease to be operative with the passage 
of this bill. The following harbour commissions will become port 
authorities: Fraser River Harbour Commission, the North Fraser 
River Harbour Commission, the Nanaimo Harbour Commission, 
the Oshawa Harbour Commission, the Port Alberni Harbour 
Commission, the Windsor Harbour Commission and the Thunder 
Bay Harbour Commission. I know the members of that commission 
today and its past members, all of whom have done a tremendous 
job.
<P>
	My colleague from Broadview-Greenwood will speak to the 
Toronto Harbour Commission and how the legislation will help that 
commission unravel the log jam  it has found itself in for many 
years. We expect great benefits for the Toronto Harbour 
Commission.
<P>
	As one of my colleagues mentioned, unfortunately the Hamilton 
Harbour Commission chose not to participate in the legislation. 
Hopefully in the future it will see the wisdom of becoming a port in 
Canada with port structure and all its benefits. We encourage that 
commission to move quickly so that all ports will be under one 
administration, one regulatory control, with a common set of goals.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	It is fundamental that most of us in the House are nation 
builders. We should be building a strong Canada. We should be 
building a unified Canada. We should be building an indivisible 
Canada. We do so through the legislation we debate in the House on 
a daily basis.
<P>
	Sometimes it is important for all members to set aside our 
parochial interests to look at Canada as a whole. In this instance I 
hope all people involved in marine transportation would consider 
the importance of having one unified regulated system so that we 
can build the best marine transportation ever.
<P>
	The goal of the transport ministry and the transport committee is 
to ensure that transportation costs are efficient and cost effective. If 
we achieve that goal the agricultural community, farmers and those 
who manufacture goods, have the ability to deliver products to 
customers in the United States, England or hopefully the emerging 
South American countries. By doing so they become more 
competitive than they were in past. That is good for all Canadians.
<P>
	I yield the rest of my time to my colleague from 
Broadview-Greenwood.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened to the hon. member's well thought out speech. 
Could he inform us on what has happened with the Laurentian 
Pilotage Authority? Is it being looked at under the bill or has it 
been scrapped?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Comuzzi:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. According to the act, in September of this year there will 
be a complete review of all pilotage authorities in Canada.
<P>
	To go one step further, I hope we have the opportunity in that 
review to bring the technology and the expertise we have gained in 
the Canadian marine transportation industry into the 21st century; 
to use global positioning if it is necessary; and to use the new 
innovations that are so helpful.
<P>
	We must consider global positioning, whether pilotage is 
necessary and whether pilots and captains can navigate ships 
without the aid of pilotage. We must consider everything to lessen 
the cost of the transportation of our goods in Canada.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I acknowledged the work of my colleague from Thunder 
Bay-Nipigon not just in the last four years of government but over 
the last nine years we have served together in the Parliament of 
Canada.
<P>
	He has worked passionately, diligently and carefully. He has 
listened to everybody who has come to him from coast to coast, 
from every region of the country. We are on the eve of an election 
and we never know. The people have to decide whether or not we 
come back. However I will always look back on the last nine years 
with my colleague from Thunder Bay-Nipigon as a positive 
constructive experience.
<P>
	I want to build on a very important theme the member for 
Thunder Bay-Nipigon touched upon, the whole notion that the 
Chamber is about building Canada. It is about building a national 
infrastructure. It is about building national standards. It is about 
advantaged regions in the country looking out for disadvantaged 
regions.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	That was what inspired me to work in this community. Some 18 
years ago I had the privilege and the pleasure of working on the 
staff of the Right Hon. Pierre Elliott Trudeau. To this day I admire 
his vision and his passion for ensuring that we look at Canada from 
coast to coast. Those regions that have must look out for those that 
have not. We must ensure that this Chamber never forgets that we 
are here for that reason. Even though the member represents 
Thunder Bay-Nipigon and I represent downtown Toronto, we 
have to care about every part of the country. That is our 
responsibility in this Chamber.
<P>
	We are here today to celebrate the commitment of the 
Government of Canada in ensuring that its presence in the port of 
Toronto is enshrined.
<P>
	I want to thank the Minister of Transport and the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Transport for listening to the Toronto 
caucus and the Toronto community and ensuring that Toronto had a 
port authority designation.
<P>
	There is a bit of an emotional tie to this legislation in Toronto 
because the very first act encapsulating the port of Toronto was 
signed by Charles Parmalae. Today a press release was issued by 
the current chairman of the Toronto harbour commissioners: ``This 
legislation reflects the Government of Canada's faith in the future 
of Toronto's port and Toronto's city centre airport operations as key 
business infrastructure for economic renewal of the Toronto area''.
<P>
	Charles Parmalae is the great-grandson of the Charles Parmalae 
who signed the original foundation legislation in the House many 
years ago. I salute the leadership of Charles Parmalae and his team 
member from the Toronto board of trade who has done so much 
over the  last few years to ensure that the range of interests was 
covered. He and others are now saying it is time for us to head into 
the 21st century with a renewed thrust, with a renewed 
invigoration.
<P>
	It is important before we enter this era of renewal, placing 
special emphasis on job creation, to acknowledge some of the 
things the Toronto Harbour Commission has done. I would like to 
mention three specific things which have happened over the last 
while.
<P>
	The Toronto Harbour Commission has expanded waterfront 
lands by more than 2,000 acres by dredging and land reclamation. 
This includes 644 acres of the eastern port lands, 600 acres of the 
Toronto islands, nearly 200 acres of western Beaches and other 
reclaimed land along the shoreline between the Humber River and 
the foot of Bathurst Street. It includes 150 acres for the 
metropolitan Toronto and region conservation authority at 
Ashbridges Bay, Bluffer's Park and elsewhere in the eastern 
Beaches, and the 430 acres at the Leslie Street spit, the Tommy 
Thompson Park.
<P>
	There are close to 15,000 people who live on the Toronto 
Harbour Commission lands. There is employment on these lands. 
There are recreational facilities on these lands, and on it goes.
<P>
	We salute the Toronto Harbour Commission. We hope with this 
new legislation, which continues to ensure that the city of Toronto 
has a board member, that the province of Ontario and the users are 
all present. They are the people who create jobs. This port will be 
run in a business like manner. This port will be transparent.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	A few hours ago in Toronto a certain member of council said: 
``This is a Government of Canada land grab that is greater than 
anything in Canadian history. It is bigger than when the white man 
came from eastern Europe and took over Canada''. That statement 
is false. These lands are Government of Canada lands. It is not 
selling these lands. It is the Government of Canada presence being 
reinvigorated in the city of Toronto. It is not the Government of 
Canada on the eve of an election selling lands, terminals and other 
things. It is the reverse of that. It is the Government of Canada 
saying it is there to be a full partner in the economic renewal of the 
city of Toronto.
<P>
	There are some people who would ask what capacity does the 
Toronto port authority have in the area of port responsibility. I 
think it is very important for people to realize that currently there 
are four overseas shipping lines calling at the port. The port is also 
linked to both CN and CP. There are actually many other ports in 
the marine act which do not have that capacity. The port is directly 
linked to two major freeways. The port handles bulk, break bulk 
and project cargo, and the port has the best heavy lift capacity of all 
the Great Lakes.
<P>
	We are here today to celebrate a commitment that the 
government and the Prime Minister made almost four years ago. In 
his first visit to Toronto after we won the election the Prime 
Minister 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9824"> 9824 </A></B>
<P>
said Toronto will be given support on economic renewal, support 
and attention the likes of which it has never seen.
<P>
	Here we are on the eve of an election. We are saying in 
symbolism, and local employers have said, it is a fabulous thing for 
economic renewal. Many members beyond the local job creators 
and people who understand the notion of tourism infrastructure are 
saying it is great that the Government of Canada has taken an active 
role in setting up this port in a totally transparent way.
<P>
	Again I want to say that this was done with the great 
co-operation of the Toronto Harbour Commission, the officials of 
the Department of Transport and the parliamentary secretary. As a 
measure of hope to get that economic engine of Toronto going 
again at full throttle, we think it is a great step in that direction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Zed:</B> Mr. Speaker, if the House would indulge me I have two 
very small matters to bring forward.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
with great pride and pleasure that I rise at third reading to address 
Bill C-44, which deals with the implementation of the Canadian 
marine policy, and which is called an act for making the system of 
Canadian ports competitive, efficient and commercially oriented, 
providing for the establishing of port authorities and the divesting 
of certain harbours and ports.
<P>
	It is as the member representing the riding of Trois-Rivières that 
I am proud to take the floor today. As you know, Trois-Rivières is 
not only a port city, but also a maritime location where, for two 
years now, the Festival de Trois-Rivières has been expanding so as 
to better reflect that reality. I am also proud to salute Commodore 
Phil Goyette for his excellent work-in co-operation with the 
SDAC of the Trois-Rivières centre town-in staging a wonderful 
event that keeps growing every year.
<P>
	I would also like to congratulate the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup for his excellent work on this 
issue. My colleague moved many amendments designed to 
improve the bill and better protect the public interest. I thank him 
particularly because of his zeal, vigilance and hard work, and also 
his ability to listen.
<P>
	As the member for Trois-Rivières, I would like to thank him, 
because when I say ``ability to listen'' it is because he listened to 
the representations I constantly made to him, as he himself was 
saying earlier, on behalf of the community of Trois-Rivières. I 
represented the views of that city which, having made up its mind 
on this issue, wanted very much to see the port of Trois-Rivières 
granted the status of Canadian port authority, as Quebec City, 
Montreal and Sept-Îles had been by the first bill. Saguenay and 
Trois-Rivières having been granted this status following 
representations by the Bloc Quebecois, in particular the member 
for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, the community of 
Trois-Rivières owes him a big thank you.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9825"> 9825 </A></B>
<P>
	Yes, there was a consensus on this issue in Trois-Rivières, but 
it did not come about easily. It is perhaps a good idea, on the eve 
of an election, to give a brief historical overview to refresh 
people's memories.
<P>
	There was the scheming of the member for Saint-Maurice, the 
present Prime Minister, who was a party to the whole thing, in 
league with a tiny group of four, five or six Liberals who had their 
eye on the port at Trois-Rivières, and whose great distinction was 
to be known to be Liberals. Coincidentally as well, they had the 
backing of the Prime Minister, which he blurted out at some point, 
in their vague wish to eventually take over the port at 
Trois-Rivières.
<P>
	Fortunately, the community apparently reacted, and the 
necessary representations were made. We were heard in fact by the 
government on February 12, 1997, after the member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup moved Motion No. 127, which 
reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-44, in the Schedule, be amended by adding in alphabetical order the 
following: ``Trois-Rivières Port Authority''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	This was, therefore, a victory by the community which had 
brought the necessary pressures to bear on the federal government, 
and I am proud to have played a role in this local victory.
<P>
	In the same vein, where there is the possibility of action that may 
or may not be desirable, sometimes prompted by motives that may 
or may not be praiseworthy themselves, I have concerns about the 
minister's discretionary power over the board of directors of the 
Trois-Rivières port authority. I have philosophical concerns, 
because we all have first hand knowledge of what the Liberals are 
like. You know them, too. We know that the Liberals have their 
own way of looking at the federal government, as their property. 
This is a view that is very much peculiar to the Liberals. We have 
had an example of this just recently, late last week in fact. A 
delegation of Liberals was literally besieging the Canadian 
Parliament for partisan activities on the eve of the announcement 
of an election campaign.
<P>
	Imagine a similar thing happening in Quebec, with the members 
of the Parti Quebecois holding meetings within the Quebec 
legislature. That would make the headlines everywhere, in all of 
the newspapers and all of the broadcast media as well, decrying the 
attitude of the leaders of the Parti Quebecois government, if ever 
such a thing were to happen. Yet we have just seen it here, a few 
days ago. And again when the returning officers for the next 
electoral campaign were recently appointed. This causes us to 
fear-knowing as we do the Liberals and their style, their glibness, 
their intellectual laziness-the possible, perhaps too systematic 
appointment of people whose greatest attribute, rather than their 
ability, is their membership in the Liberal Party of Canada.
<P>
	Further to the introduction of this bill, I would like to draw your 
attention to the ill-defined mandates given out to manage one thing 
or another. This is a situation in which the government is divesting 
itself of assets, including harbours and small ports, and Canada's 
marine policy, as far as Quebec is concerned, involves theSt. Lawrence and the Ottawa River.
<P>
	My attention has been drawn to the fact that the small docks and 
the ports along the Saint-Maurice River in my region are not 
covered. No one knows who to approach, who has jurisdiction. Is it 
the Department of Transport or Fisheries and Oceans? It is not 
easy. I have made the appropriate representations to the 
Department of Transport, which accorded me considerable time, 
confiding that it was an administrative mishmash. If they have a 
hard time figuring things out in the minister's office, think about 
the ordinary citizen and the mayor, often a community volunteer, 
working part time.
<P>
	This leads me to speak of the introduction into our beautiful 
Quebec of the Canadian coast guard, which now has control over 
the St. Lawrence Seaway and which wants to charge its users. It 
will soon be involved in the management of lakes and rivers as it 
may issue permits for pedal boat and rowboat owners.
<P>
	Nothing says that the Canadian Coast Guard, whose mandate it is 
to work from coast to coast, will not be the one interfering with the 
operation of the largest seaway in the world, a complex inland 
seaway. The task of marine pilots is a complex one, and I want to 
commend the work done by the St. Lawrence River pilots' 
association, whose members saw their jobs threatened by 
government pressure.
<P>
	Here again, we must thank the Bloc Quebecois, and our 
colleague from Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, who made sure 
that common sense prevails, given the safety risks involved, the 
fact that the river is used by huge oil tankers and ore-carrying 
ships, and the difficulty of manoeuvring on the St. Lawrence River, 
with a narrow and sometimes shallow channel.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	I think this was an irresponsible attempt on the part of the 
government. I do hope the St. Lawrence River pilots' association 
will continue to prevail and survive, to ensure the protection of the 
public and the riparian community. Although technology can be 
very useful, it must never replace humans, as was the intention in 
this case.
<P>
	I would have liked to say more. I thought I would have more 
time. That is unfortunate, because coast guard activities is a very 
important issue. Just yesterday, I was attending a meeting of the 
Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans. The committee just 
tabled a disgraceful report with obvious methodology problems. 
The committee had a very narrow mandate, and no effort was made 
to try and take a close look at the concerns  expressed and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9826"> 9826 </A></B>
<P>
allegations made by users of the St. Lawrence, even though they 
are quite reasonable.
<P>
	I am thinking in particular of the SODES and Mr. Gaudreault, 
who gave an excellent presentation yesterday, showing the very 
serious threat facing Quebec's economy if the Government of 
Canada does not turn around and make an effort to get to the 
bottom of this and see the light.
<P>
	In closing, since a criticism of this recent report shows that, 
under the new policy, the Quebec Cartier Mining company may 
have to shut down its operations two and a half years earlier, I think 
further consideration is required.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
as you know I am the Atlantic issues critic for our caucus. This 
means that I bring forward issues that are of particular interest and 
importance to Atlantic Canada. This will go on for a month or so 
until we elect members for Reform from Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	Bill C-44 impacts on Atlantic Canadian interests. It impacts on a 
wonderful new opportunity for the port of Halifax to develop into a 
post-Panamax port.
<P>
	The post-Panamax opportunity has come about because ships are 
getting so big that they can no longer get through the Panama canal. 
Ships with goods from all over the world need a port on the eastern 
seaboard large enough to land these goods for distribution across 
North America and into South America. A port needs to be 
developed to allow these huge ships to offload the containers for 
trans-shipment across Canada and the United States.
<P>
	This is a wonderful opportunity for the port of Halifax because it 
has a lot of natural advantages that the big ports in the U.S., in 
particular New York and Boston, do not have. A lot of land is 
available. This port does not have to be dredged to accommodate 
these huge ships, as Boston and New York would.
<P>
	The potential advantage to the Atlantic provinces is enormous. 
The potential income from this kind of economic activity, shipping 
activity, trade activity is huge. Reports have estimated it would be 
about $2 billion per year. This is not small change for a province 
like Nova Scotia.
<P>
	However, this bill would make it difficult, if not impossible, for 
the port of Halifax, the businesses and the province to take 
advantage of this opportunity for three reasons. The port would be 
unable to raise the capital necessary to go ahead with this 
development. To develop the port properly, to have the facilities to 
offload these huge ships and to trans-ship the containers and the 
goods would take about $.5 billion.
<P>
	This cannot be done with the strictures being put on the port and 
the port authority by this bill. The port  would not be able to borrow 
money. It could perhaps borrow money on cash flow which would 
amount to about $40 million to $50 million maximum. Investors 
could not be given equity shares in the enterprise. Here is a 
wonderful opportunity and the bill puts a regime into place which 
absolutely forecloses that opportunity from ever being given to the 
Atlantic provinces. I have met with a number of people interested 
in the matter of developing the port of Halifax. They are very 
concerned.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	Unfortunately my time has been shortened due to some 
arrangements in the House today. I would like to go on record as 
saying that as far as the port of Halifax is concerned, the people of 
Nova Scotia, Atlantic Canada and the whole of Canada, have some 
real concerns that this bill limits important economic opportunities. 
I would urge the government to look at this matter very carefully 
before something is put in place that stifles development in a very 
critical part of our country, namely, the Atlantic provinces.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADAWATEREXPORTPROHIBITIONACT">CANADA WATER EXPORT PROHIBITION ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP)</B> moved that Bill C-232, an 
act to prohibit the export of water by interbasin transfers, be read 
the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I would like to indicate my appreciation to 
the hon. member for Regina-Lumsden  for seconding Bill C-232. 
I appreciate this has been an issue of major concern of his for many 
years. We have worked on this initiative together for the last three 
years and we do hope that time will permit passage of this 
legislation in the House as well as the other place.
<P>
	I also want to acknowledge my colleague from Peace River who 
also indicated an interest in seconding the legislation. I want to say 
how much I appreciate his support on this initiative, and also that 
he has been steadfast in his support over the last number of years on 
this very important issue.
<P>
	I want to indicate what was behind the initiative to introduce the 
bill. In my previous life I was a professional geographer and today I 
am also a governor of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society. I 
have studied the issue of water transfers and water sales for nigh on 
to 35 years. My interest and concern today is as much as it was at 
the time the infamous North American water and power alliance 
proposal, often referred to as NAWAPA, was receiving a great deal 
of public attention.
<P>
	This was a major project initiated by the Ralph M. Parsons' 
Engineering Company of California to divert all the rivers of 
northwestern Canada, including parts of Alaska, into the Rocky 
Mountain trench and other river basins for eventual sale to the 
American southwest and northern Mexico.
<P>
	That issue, interesting enough, has not gone away. I noted with 
some interest that Mr. Dale, who at one time was the United States 
ambassador to Canada, two years ago was providing interviews to 
<I>Western Report</I> magazine about the renewed interest by southern 
California in revitalizing the concept of the NAWAPA plan to 
divert large amounts of water from Canada to the greater 
Sacramento basin which consequently would be a great business 
proposal.
<P>
	This has many of us very concerned. I was concerned in a 
professional way as a geographer and in my capacity as member of 
Parliament for Kamloops by a recent initiative taken by 
entrepreneurs in western Canada and the western United states to 
divert50 per cent of the flow of the North Thompson River during the 
freshet period for eventual sale in the Los Angeles and San Diego 
areas. The preliminary drawings had been put together. It certainly 
was economically, environmentally and engineeringly feasible in 
the traditional approach of evaluating projects. It was receiving a 
great deal of attention until people of the North Thompson River 
realized what was up and decided to take some steps against 
diverting one of the major tributaries of the Fraser River for 
eventual sale in the Los Angeles and San Diego areas.
<P>
	I have a personal involvement as the member of Parliament 
representing that area. I also think it fair to say we have seen a 
number of initiatives in the last while, beginning with the free trade 
agreement with the United States and ending with the North 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9830"> 9830 </A></B>
<P>
American Free Trade  Agreement and more recently with the 
multilateral agreement on investment.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	These three agreements would facilitate the sale of fresh water 
from Canada to the United States and Mexico. In particular, the 
free trade agreement and the North America Free Trade Agreement 
have identified water as a good or commodity. Once water is 
identified as a good or commodity, it comes under the purview of 
the North America Free Trade Agreement which makes it virtually 
impossible for even a national government, let alone a provincial or 
any kind of local government, to take any serious steps to stop the 
eventual sale of that product or that good into the United States or 
into Mexico.
<P>
	I suspect that people might wonder if that is the case. I suppose 
we should see these trade agreements and more recently the 
multilateral agreement on investment in some context.
<P>
	Canada is one of the few countries in the world with no water 
policy stated in any formal way. There is no legislation that would 
indicate water policy. This is appalling considering that Canada is 
the second largest country geographically in the world. A 
tremendous amount of the world's fresh water exists within our 
national boundaries. Yet we have no water policy.
<P>
	In the absence of water policy, the free trade agreement with the 
United States, NAFTA, and now eventually if we sign this the 
multilateral agreement on investment will take priority in terms of 
the rules and regulations that will govern the eventual sale of water 
to the United States and northern Mexico.
<P>
	I want to reiterate that the North America Free Trade Agreement 
includes water as a good under the terms of the agreement for 
essentially the same reason, as I stated, than does the free trade 
agreement with the United States. The purpose of the free trade 
agreement as set forth in article 102 is to eliminate barriers to trade 
in goods and services between the territories of the parties, to 
facilitate conditions of fair competition within the free trade area, 
to liberalize significantly conditions for investment within the free 
trade area, to establish effective procedures for the joint 
administration of this agreement and a resolution of disputes and to 
lay the foundation for further bilateral or multilateral co-operation 
to expand and enhance the benefits of this agreement.
<P>
	I want to go on to quote from article 102 under NAFTA. It sets 
forth the objectives which include to eliminate barriers to trade in 
and facilitate the cross-border movement of goods and services 
between the territories of the parties, to establish substantially 
investment opportunities in the territories of the parties, and to 
establish a framework for further trilateral,  regional and 
multilateral co-operation to expand and enhance the benefits of this 
agreement.
<P>
	When we consider that the point of these two trade agreements to 
which we are a signatory is to eliminate barriers in trade for goods, 
is water a good under these trade agreements? Article 201.1 of the 
FTA states that goods of a party mean the domestic products as 
these are understood in the general agreement on tariffs and trade.
<P>
	Similarly, goods of a party are defined in article 201 of NAFTA 
as products, as these are understood by the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade. This means that any good covered by a GATT 
trade heading is subject to the provisions of the agreements 
themselves unless explicitly excluded in their respective text.
<P>
	Raw logs were exempt, cultural industries were exempt, some 
beer was exempt and some fish products were exempt. What was 
noticeably absent from the exempt list was water.
<P>
	Therefore to understand the basis for inclusion of water in the 
trade agreements one must first look to the relevant sections of the 
harmonized commodity coding system of GATT. I know most 
members are familiar with this coding system, and 22.01 states that 
waters, including natural or artificial mineral waters and aerated 
waters not containing added sugar or other sweetening matters, are 
included.
<P>
	To provide further clarification in case there is any confusion at 
all, the GATT harmonized commodity description and coding 
system explanatory notes were adopted by the GATT signatories in 
1986. The explanatory note for heading 22.01 which represents the 
only GATT sanctioned elaboration of the text is as follows: ``This 
heading covers ordinary natural water of all kinds other than sea 
water. Such water remains in this heading whether or not it is 
clarified or purified''.
<P>
	I could go on in some detail but I think this is sufficient to 
indicate that however we look at this, however we interpret it, 
water is a good, and goods are part of the North American Free 
Trade Agreement.
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	I panic when I consider what our country is now involved in, the 
multilateral agreement on investment. My guess is that 99.99 per 
cent of Canadians do not know what I am speaking about at this 
point because the negotiations for the multilateral agreement on 
investment have been taking place in secret, behind closed doors. 
They are high level negotiations that no one has been informed 
about. Provincial governments have not been alerted to this. Most 
members of Parliament and senators have not been alerted to the 
fact that the negotiations are taking place let alone any of the items 
being discussed.
<P>
	The MAI's definition of investment is very broad. In the MAI 
investment means ``every kind of asset owned  or controlled by an 
investor''. It extends to ``rights under contracts'' and ``rights 
conferred pursuant to law or contract such as concessions, licences, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9831"> 9831 </A></B>
<P>
authorizations and permits''. By implication the definition even 
extends to real estate or other property, tangible or intangible, 
acquired in the expectation of or used for the purpose of economic 
benefit or other business purposes. It seems quite clear that this 
definition of investment would open the door to international 
investors mounting direct challenges against governments for 
water exports.
<P>
	Some people sometimes define water as a special commodity, a 
special good or a special product, that it is technically owned by all 
the people, that the government owns those water resources or 
products until they are sold or licensed off and so on. I do not think 
we can take much comfort in this. When we consider that 
government is the owner, often no one takes serious claim of that 
ownership. I point out the gas and oil industry, how that too 
belonged to the people and how it has been essentially sold off to 
the highest bidder wherever and whenever it is found. This is to say 
nothing about my own province where the timber resources 
theoretically belonged to the people but have now been allocated to 
the last branch to one of the major forest companies for its 
exclusive use.
<P>
	We are now being confronted with a most serious issue. The only 
product in Canada the United States does not have access to right 
now is water. Until recently there was some indication that parts of 
our cultural industry were protected from American inclusion. In 
the last number of days the Minister for International Trade has 
made it clear that will be impossible to protect in the future. Even 
culture, the one industry that was named in the free trade 
agreements to receive some protection, is now being abandoned 
and put on the sacred altar of the free market. We are now down to 
one item, water.
<P>
	We have to ask ourselves why the Government of Canada is 
reluctant to introduce a clear water policy for Canada and why the 
House of Commons, through the government initiative, is not 
prepared to introduce legislation to prohibit the interbasin transfer 
of water for export.
<P>
	Two jurisdictions have taken steps. British Columbia has 
recently taken some steps to prohibit the interbasin transfer of 
water for export and the province of Ontario under previous 
administration introduced strong legislation to prohibit the 
interbasin transfer of water for export sales. Saskatchewan has 
done this too. When we consider that some provincial governments 
have taken strong steps, why is the federal government silent on 
this issue? Why does it refuse to take any initiative at all? Why 
does it refuse to even discuss it? Why does it refuse to even have 
the most simplistic water policy concerning the importance of 
water in the second largest country in the world? These are 
questions that must be asked.
<P>
	As we speak there are all sorts of people who are quite anxious to 
sell our water to the Americans. Americans are anxious but many
<P>
Canadians are too. I refer first to the American Society of Civil 
Engineers which recently published a handbook that points out all 
the benefits of diverting water from Canada to the United States, of 
selling Canadian water to the United States. It points out that we 
already have 54 interbasin transfer systems within Canada. This is 
nothing new to our country. The export of course is.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	Even if the federal government were to pass legislation, even if 
provincial governments were to pass legislation, we must us 
acknowledge that as a result of international law, trade agreements 
take priority over national, state or regional legislation.
<P>
	We can imagine if the state of Montana passed legislation that 
went against the general trust of the North American Free Trade 
Agreement. It would be laughed right out of the international court. 
So too would provincial, national or state governments.
<P>
	At the moment we are locked in. If we agree to eventually sign 
the multilateral agreement on investment, we will lock those 
decisions in for a 20-year period. For 20 years a decision under that 
agreement cannot be reversed once a trade or business initiative is 
taken.
<P>
	We have serious problems. I reluctantly say that in my own 
province the Fraser Institute is an enthusiastic booster, a 
cheerleader for the whole idea of selling Canadian water to 
whomever. Whether it is the United States or Mexico it is anxious 
to see water designated as a commodity. Recently one of its 
publications articulated its position very clearly. Not only are 
Americans anxious to purchase Canadian water. Some Canadians 
are very anxious to sell it.
<P>
	We do not have to look very far. The person who negotiated the 
trade agreement with the United States, NAFTA, was Simon 
Reisman. He was one of the main proponents of the interbasin 
transfers of water to the United States. The thesis topic of 
Manitoba's Gary Filmon when he was studying at the University of 
Manitoba was an investigation of the diversion of northern 
Manitoba waters into Lake Manitoba. The major objective of the 
study was an assessment of the possible future scope of water 
developed in western Canada and the feasibility of water exports to 
the United States.
<P>
	Not only are entrepreneurs and industrial and business leaders 
often anxious to sell Canadian water to others, particularly the 
United States and Mexico, but some of our political leaders are on 
record as feeling similarly.
<P>
	The lack of any initiative by the government, let alone the 
previous government which we assume would have sold us out to 
the United States, raises suspect whether  the government is tacitly 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9832"> 9832 </A></B>
<P>
approving the notion of selling Canadian fresh water to United 
States and Mexico.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> The Prime Minister and President Clinton 
were golfing and talking about giving away water.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> They were talking during their golf game about 
various matters. I could go on at some length but I want to hear 
what my colleagues have to say about this important initiative.
<P>
	Maybe Canadians are wondering how significant the issue is. 
When someone goes into a store to buy a litre of water or a litre of 
oil, often the litre of water is actually more expensive than the litre 
of oil. We know to what extent the United States will go to ensure 
its secure oil supplies. We can all agree that water is even much 
more valuable than oil. We can imagine the extent to which 
Americans will go to eventually have access to our fresh water.
<P>
	It is important that we take whatever steps we can as a country to 
indicate that Canadian water is not for sale. Canadian water is the 
lifeblood of our country and is not to be treated in the same spirit as 
we treat cod, copper or timber.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Godfrey (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Cooperation, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is good 
reason to applaud the initiative of the hon. member for Kamloops 
in introducing the bill. The government supports the objective of 
sustaining Canada's water resources and Bill C-232 proposes one 
way in which we could do it.
<P>
	I am concerned, however, that the prohibition of water export by 
interbasin transfers may be too narrow an approach to a complex 
issue. Access to adequate clean water supplies is critical to our 
health, to our quality of life and to Canada's competitive position. 
Much of our economy and jobs are tied directly or indirectly to our 
supplies in water from farming, forestry and industrial 
development to tourism and recreational sectors.
<P>
	Growth in these areas will depend on sustaining the benefits of 
adequate and clean water resources.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	To put it another way, water is an essential part of all 
ecosystems, from the functions and life support provided by lakes 
and streams to the role of the global hydrological cycle in 
sustaining water in all its forms.
<P>
	Our drainage systems do not conform to political boundaries but 
continue to unite different parts of our country through travel and 
commerce and through co-operative efforts to conserve and protect 
these waterways and their ecosystems.
<P>
	The Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River connect most of 
eastern Canada, as the north and south Saskatchewan Rivers link 
the prairie provinces; the Fraser, most of British Columbia; and the 
Mackenzie River and its tributaries, much of the north.
<P>
	Current initiatives such as the Great Lakes, Fraser River andSt. Lawrence action plans are excellent examples of all levels of 
government working together and with industry and 
non-government organizations to address health and sustainable 
development within these aquatic ecosystems.
<P>
	It is essential that our decisions reflect a comprehensive 
approach to sustaining water resources. On the question of water 
export, we must ask ourselves at what point water removal may 
result in damage to an ecosystem. It is clear that interbasin 
transfers have the potential to cause the most significant social, 
economic and environmental impacts.
<P>
	What about other means of withdrawal of water for export 
purposes such as the use of supertankers taking water from coastal 
lakes and streams, the mining of groundwater reserves or the 
cumulative impacts of a series of small scale withdrawals from the 
same source?
<P>
	Without doubt Bill C-232 is consistent with the federal water 
policy which explicitly opposes water export by interbasin transfer.
<P>
	I have to take issue with the hon. member in his interpretation of 
the NAFTA when it talks about water as a good and refers to it as 
bottled beverages. It does not refer to the large scale exports of 
water to which he alluded.
<P>
	Interest in water export has shifted away from proposals for the 
construction of megaprojects, despite the obvious vested interest of 
civil engineers, which would result in large scale interbasin 
transfers of water, the focus of Bill C-232. Large scale exports 
through massive engineering work such as the Grand Canal 
proposal are not considered viable under current market conditions. 
The costs associated with the delivery of water would greatly 
exceed the prices that users would be willing to pay for water. That 
is not to say that future water shortages could not result in prices 
that might meet the costs of such export proposals.
<P>
	The current focus of water export proposals, however, is by 
tankership using water from coastal lakes and streams or by tanker 
trucks or pipelines carrying water from surface to groundwater 
sources.
<P>
	Not only have the economics of water export clearly changed in 
terms of capital investment needs but our understanding of the 
scope and extent of potential environmental, social and long term 
economic impacts. Water is possibly the most basic and unifying 
element in ecosystems.
<P>
	As I have already stated, water export must be viewed from an 
ecosystem approach. Concerns relating to all forms of water export 
which were not considered in the 1960s now must be factored in. 
These include the effects of climate change for which recent 
predictions suggest losses of water availability of about 20 per cent 
for some of the settled regions of the country; the potential biotic  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9833"> 9833 </A></B>
<P>
transfer and contamination resulting from the discharges of ballast 
supertankers withdrawing water from coastal streams and lakes; 
the fragility of our ecosystems, particularly northern ecosystems, 
to disturbance; the concerns of First Nations whose ways of life are 
intimately tied to the cycles of abundance of water; the 
displacement of communities or depletion of water resources 
available to downstream communities; and the loss of recreational 
and commercial benefits.
<P>
	The measures we propose to address the water export issue must 
reflect both the current and future focus of export proposals and the 
broad environmental, social and long term economic impact of 
such proposals. Bill C-32 fails to do.
<P>
	This leads to a second concern. We should take action to address 
the broad range of concerns facing fresh water in a comprehensive 
way rather than limit ourselves to the one concern of water export. 
The need for such an approach is based on the growing recognition 
of the importance of water, the diverse and complex jurisdictional 
responsibilities associated with sustainably managing water, and 
the pressures on governments to continue to manage these 
responsibilities effectively in the current climate of financial 
restraint.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	All Canadians have stewardship responsibilities for water. It is 
important that we consult with them in developing a 
comprehensive approach to water export and to the many other 
freshwater issues currently facing us.
<P>
	Over the past 10 years the government has consulted Canadians 
on a wide variety of water issues, most recently through a series of 
workshops held across Canada to identify water priorities and 
directions for the next century. Contrary to the suggestion of the 
hon. member we are not silent. We are taking action. We are 
currently conducting a review of our programs and legislation 
relating to sustaining Canada's water resources. It is through this 
review that a comprehensive approach to water can be developed, 
including legislative measures to address water export.
<P>
	I will conclude by reiterating that, first, it is imperative we 
address the full range of water export options to ensure the 
sustainability of Canada's water resources and the continued health 
of our ecosystems. We must adopt measures whether in legislation 
or by other means which provide a clear approach to resolving the 
issue and which reflect the concerns of all Canadians.
<P>
	Second, we must not limit our actions to the single issue of water 
export in addressing the challenges facing fresh water. Taking a 
piecemeal approach to the broad range of fresh water issues reflects 
the ways of the past. We need an integrated and comprehensive 
solution to sustaining environmental, social and economic health, 
which depend on water.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great interest that I rise today to speak to the bill introduced by my 
colleague in the New Democratic Party, an act to prohibit the 
export of water by interbasin transfers.
<P>
	Our colleague was undoubtedly motivated to introduce this bill 
because of the fear that one morning he would see Canadian water 
basins emptying into American ones. We would see these basins 
drained or greatly reduced without being able to do anything about 
it. In light of the present water shortages and climatic fluctuations 
caused by greenhouse gases, this fear seems entirely legitimate to 
me and certainly justifies our giving this whole issue serious 
consideration.
<P>
	We must ask ourselves whether our water resources are in fact 
threatened in the short, medium and long term. It is clear to me that 
water will be an increasingly precious resource in the future and 
that people, industries and countries will therefore want to lay 
claim to it by any means possible.
<P>
	In the era of free trade and globalization of markets, it should 
come as no surprise that fresh water is becoming a rare, not to say 
very rare, commodity. We in Quebec and in Canada are lucky 
enough to have large quantities of this precious commodity and 
could therefore export it.
<P>
	The main question we must ask ourselves is this: Can we keep 
this resource, which is so abundant in this country, for ourselves 
while other people on the same continent as us are suffering 
shortages with very serious consequences? Can we not share this 
resource intelligently for the benefit of everyone?
<P>
	Moreover, can we leave this resource unprotected, at the mercy 
of anyone who wants to appropriate it, which may have a disastrous 
impact on the resource?
<P>
	The bill standing in the name of the hon. member for Kamloops 
is intended to deal with interbasin transfers, which means transfers 
of huge quantities of water. According to the hon. member, it is up 
to Canada to protect this natural resource, since NAFTA contains 
no measures to protect or prohibit the export of this resource. 
According to the hon. member, we need legislation to prohibit 
massive exports by interbasin transfers.
<P>
	I agree there are a number of situations that must not be allowed 
to arise. For instance, the harnessing or diversion of rivers without 
a licence or without authorization from the appropriate authorities. 
We must of course prohibit anything that would have harmful 
consequences for our resource, but is a total ban really necessary?
<P>
	Since the beginning of this century we have considerably 
modified our river systems. By using various technologies we have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9834"> 9834 </A></B>
<P>
substantially altered the natural  course of our lakes, rivers and 
streams. Immense reservoirs like James Bay in Quebec, built to 
produce electricity, and the reservoirs created for the pulp and 
paper industry are good examples of the impact we have had on our 
waterways.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	Today, few waterways are without a dam, a dike or at least some 
control mechanism. It is clear that all these changes have had are 
on a vast territory. Gradually, these changes will have 
consequences on a huge scale. I think we should consider the 
impact these changes have had and recognize our responsibility.
<P>
	We must find out whether these artificial changes in our systems 
have not had a harmful impact outside Canada. And if so, should 
we not try to remedy the situation using intelligent strategies that 
respect the resource?
<P>
	In fact, in addition to these artificial changes, we have actually 
changed quality of the water. Throughout the world we have been 
remiss in the way we treated surface water by polluting it. The 
consequences are reflected in the exorbitant costs of making water 
safe to drink, and, even worse, in the dwindling supply of fresh, 
potable water.
<P>
	In fact, surface water that is potable without being treated is 
practically non existent. It is found exclusively below ground at 
varying depths, and we are now pumping this water in huge 
quantities to sell it as bottled water. This is another phenomenon 
which disturbs me and which we will have to look at seriously 
without delay.
<P>
	The picture is pretty clear: in Canada we have a lot of water that 
we use exclusively for our own benefit. In recent years, we have 
contained and dammed it by various means. Should we today open 
the gates to the south, to the United States for instance, which sees 
us as a huge body of water that it may endlessly dip into? Our 
neighbour to the south feels that we are wasting water because we 
are not using the huge reserves in the north. But when it comes to 
waste, we certainly do not have anything to learn from our 
neighbours south of the border.
<P>
	Another aspect of the bill introduced by my colleague from the 
New Democratic Party to which we should give our attention is 
once again the whole issue of jurisdiction. Even though the federal 
government has jurisdiction over international trade, is it desirable 
for it to legislate the export of water? Imagine the situation where 
Quebec decides to export water from its large reservoirs to the 
United States, without any significant impact on Quebec's system. 
Should the federal government block this export if it has no 
negative impact? The federal government again?
<P>
	The federal government is certainly no guarantee that the 
environment will be protected these days. Its disengagement is 
obvious and very disturbing. I wonder  therefore whether we can 
trust it when it comes to the management of water and the related 
analyses and evaluations.
<P>
	Whether it be for personal consumption, irrigation or other 
purposes, I do not think we should systematically prohibit 
interbasin transfers. Of course we should conserve, protect and 
clean up our resource, but we can also share it.
<P>
	I think there should be a broad public debate of this issue. I also 
think we must continue to keep water a public resource. It would be 
a much greater threat to water as a resource to leave it to the private 
sector. The prospect of making a large profit quickly could empty 
all of Canada's basins. The public nature of the resource therefore 
constitutes a good guarantee, a sort of safeguard against possible 
exploitation.
<P>
	I think we should also look into this issue of export with an eye 
to all the possibilities for agreements with future foreign markets 
that would respect the resource itself and that would be based on 
complete and transparent impact studies. We must also develop 
policies with the long term in mind, based on sustainable 
management of the resource.
<P>
	I cannot support the bill at this stage in the debate. However, I 
am considering it and I continue to weigh all the factors. This is a 
major issue that deserves an open-minded approach and greater 
study.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the issue of fresh water export has troubled Canadians for 
at least three decades. There are new dimensions in the 1990s, 
however, which were not part of the debate in the 1960s.
<P>
	Public concern has been heightened, for example, by aboriginal 
resistance to export proposals threatening their traditional areas 
and by recent predictions that global warming could result in losses 
of water availability of about 20 per cent for some of the settled 
regions of the country.
<P>
	At the same time, we should be aware that there is, as of this 
date, no significant export of water resources from Canada, only a 
little trade in beverages and some small exchanges of treated 
supplies between neighbouring border communities. No lakes or 
rivers in Canada have been diverted out of their natural courses to 
flow south of the border. No supertankers have departed Canadian 
shores under contract to deliver bulk water supplies to overseas 
destinations. That is the reality of our present situation.
<P>
	There have been, and there will continue to be, of course, 
proposals for water export which range from the use of pipelines 
and tanker trucks to draw on groundwater reserves, to marine 
transport from coastal  streams, to the more grandiose schemes 
involving large scale diversions of rivers. All of these proposals 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9835"> 9835 </A></B>
<P>
have the potential to affect the social, environmental and economic 
benefits Canadians derive from their water resources.
<P>
	For this reason it is of paramount importance that the issue of 
water export be considered in its entirety, that we do not develop 
solutions to one problem at a time at the expense of a more 
comprehensive approach to this whole issue.
<P>
	Over the last 30 years, concern about exports of Canada's water 
resources has risen primarily as a result of proposals to divert 
massive amounts of water to the United States to deal with water 
shortages or to allow for increased agricultural, industrial and 
urban development in areas in the United States with limited 
supplies. Concern has also focused on the possibility that once 
these taps are turned on, it would be very difficult to turn them off.
<P>
	Several of these megaprojects are worth mentioning. One of the 
best known is the North American water and power alliance project 
of the 1960s. It involved the diversion of water from Alaska, 
northwestern Canada and watersheds surrounding Hudson Bay and 
James Bay to the dry, arid areas of the western United States, the 
prairie provinces and northern Mexico.
<P>
	Another megaproject was the grand recycling and northern 
development grand canal project which would have transferred 
James Bay into a freshwater lake by building a dike at its northern 
end and impounding the rivers that empty into the bay. The flows 
of rivers would have been reversed to deliver water to the Great 
Lakes and from there to other destinations in North America.
<P>
	These megaprojects, while having the potential to create jobs 
and investment in Canada in the short term, would not benefit 
Canadian society in the long term.
<P>
	With 9 per cent of the world's renewable fresh water resources, it 
is easy for us to assume that Canada has an abundance of water and 
can support limited export of its water resources. This perception is 
not well founded. The idea that if we do not use all the water, it is 
somehow wasted fails to recognize that there is no surplus of water 
in an ecosystem. All the water serves a purpose in sustaining the 
dynamics and functions of that ecosystem.
<P>
	Thus, although Canada would seem to possess substantial water 
resources there are regions in Canada in which scarcities exist or 
will exist. These areas include the river basins of the Okanagan, 
Milk, South Saskatchewan and the Red-Assiniboine Rivers, as well 
as nearly all of the smaller river basins of southern Ontario.
<P>
	Within this context it is worth considering whether we would be 
better served by addressing all means of water export and not 
limiting discussion to interbasin transfers. Bill C-232 also 
mentions a need for policy, research and consultations among 
federal, provincial and territorial  governments on the subject of 
interbasin water transfers within Canada. It provides no guidance, 
however, in this area.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	That is unfortunate because Canadians have a great deal of 
experience with interbasin transfer projects. In fact, the volume of 
water transferred across drainage basin boundaries in Canada is 
several times greater than in any other country in the world. 
Virtually all of the larger existing interbasin diversion projects 
support hydroelectric power generation with smaller volumes used 
for irrigation, municipal supply and flood control.
<P>
	Members of the House will be interested to know that the largest 
of these projects was constructed in the 1970s and 1980s. Since 
then construction and expansion of such megaprojects have been 
shelved in all regions of the country: the Kemano Alcan project in 
British Columbia; the Nelson River program in Manitoba, 
expansion of the James Bay hydro project in Quebec.
<P>
	Energy demands have fallen and it is less costly to promote 
efficiencies on the part of the users of energy and water, rather than 
to continue to develop the new supplies.
<P>
	The federal water policy addresses Canada's experience with 
interbasin transfer projects, but advocating caution in considering 
their needs, and by endorsing other less destructive alternatives 
such as demand management and water conservation.
<P>
	There are no plans under consideration to proceed with any 
further interbasin transfers at this time anywhere in this country. 
That tells us two things of importance.
<P>
	First, not only do Canadians oppose the large scale diversion of 
our lakes and rivers across the international boundary, they have 
learned from experience that interbasin diversions carry a high 
price for their own regional economies and environments.
<P>
	Second, it would be shortsighted to pursue this issue in isolation 
of the larger context which considers changing public values, 
competing in complementary water use relationships and 
governmental priorities.
<P>
	Federal programs and legislation related to the sustainability of 
Canada's water resources are currently being reviewed and the 
issues of export and interbasin transfers should be addressed in that 
larger context.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in the debate on the bill introduced by my 
colleague from Kamloops. I know he has a very deep concern on 
this issue of water exports.
<P>
	I share that concern, although I believe we are adequately 
protected. However, it is not as crystal clear as it could be. 
Therefore, it is important that we take whatever steps necessary to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9836"> 9836 </A></B>
<P>
make sure that Canada does  not get into a situation where it is 
required to export water by any means such as interbasin transfer.
<P>
	Water is a very important resource and will be even more 
important in the future. In my riding of Peace River we have a lot 
of oil and gas development. Oil and gas companies have 
consistently tried to use potable ground water for flooding their oil 
zones when salt water is available at a not much larger cost. I 
believe we should continue to resist this misuse of potable water 
because it is going to be a very serious problem in the future.
<P>
	I support the bill introduced by the member for Kamloops and I 
will state my reasons for supporting it.
<P>
	Reform policy dating back to 1993, prior to the last election and 
prior to the passage of NAFTA, makes a specific statement on 
water. It states that the exclusive and unrestricted control of water 
in all its forms should be maintained by and for Canada and that 
both free trade agreements should be amended to reflect this.
<P>
	I admit it is a little late to be talking about amending NAFTA. 
Furthermore, there have been assurances from all sides that water 
in lakes, streams and basins can in no way be considered a 
commodity. Therefore, water in its raw format is not covered by 
NAFTA. Consequently, there is nothing in NAFTA that could force 
us to transfer water to the United States. Prior to signing the 
NAFTA the three governments issued a joint statement to this 
effect. It stated that the governments of Canada, the United States 
and Mexico in order to correct false interpretations issued a joint 
public statement such as the parties in the North American Free 
Trade Agreement.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	The NAFTA creates no rights to the natural water resources of 
any party to the agreement. Unless water in any form has entered 
into commerce and become a good or product, it is not covered in 
the provisions of the trade agreement under the NAFTA.
<P>
	Nothing in the NAFTA would oblige the NAFTA partners to 
exploit water for commercial use or to begin to export water in any 
form. Water in its natural state in rivers, lakes, reservoirs, aquifers, 
water basins and the like is not a good or product. It is not traded 
and therefore is not and never has been subject to any terms of the 
agreement.
<P>
	Just the fact that we are having to clarify it makes people wonder 
whether it was missed in the free trade agreement. I restate that we 
want to make sure we tie it down and not allow any possibility of it 
happening.
<P>
	From this statement it would seem we are safe as long as water 
does not enter into commerce, but I do have that concern. Canada 
already has a policy of prohibiting interbasin water transfers, but 
policy is not law. New governments can bring in new policies. Why 
not take he advice of the member for Kamloops and back this 
policy with legislation? I agree that we should do it.
<P>
	Back in 1988 similar legislation was introduced but it died on the 
Order Paper and was never resurrected. Off and on over the past 
decades the United States has faced significant water problems. 
Despite occasional droughts Americans have an extremely high 
water consumption rate per capita. This is partly due to irrigation 
practices of the agriculture industry and the fact that Americans 
persist in growing water intensive crops.
<P>
	To deal with this recurring problem various American and 
Canadian interests dreamed up massive water diversion proposals 
in the mid-fifties and early sixties. There was the North American 
Water and Power Alliance, PRIME and the Grand Canal scheme. 
They used different methods like tunnels, canals, pipelines and 
dams to divert water from B.C., Alberta and Quebec south of the 
border. That was their dream.
<P>
	Although the public uproar against such projects pretty much 
killed them, occasionally there is still talk about scaled down 
versions. Why have Canadians become so concerned? The fact is 
that Canadians have less clean fresh water than one would think. 
Many of southern lakes and rivers are polluted with industrial 
waste and sewage, and most of our rivers of course flow north away 
from our major centres. We cannot really afford to squander the 
fresh water that remains. Commercial interests that want to use 
fresh groundwater have put it under great pressure in some areas of 
the country. Water will be a very important issue in the future and 
we need to maintain it.
<P>
	A further problem has to do with the environment. Sending our 
water south can have massive ecological repercussions. Interbasin 
transfers can introduce parasites and other organisms into new 
environments where they can have devastating effects. A recent 
example is the introduction of zebra mussels into the Great Lakes.
<P>
	There could also be detrimental effects on fish and bird species 
where fresh water flows are introduced into estuaries affecting the 
salinity of the water. Massive water diversions can change 
climactic conditions and introduce mercury and other contaminants 
into the food change.
<P>
	In conclusion, the House should support the bill. The Reform 
Party has always insisted that Canada maintain control of its 
natural water. It would have been preferable to include water rights 
under the NAFTA. We failed to do that. They should be included in 
legislation. We should have a policy that restricts interbasin 
transfer that might make water exports possible. We support our 
colleague from Kamloops.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member for Kamloops deserves to be complimented for bringing 
the bill before us. It allows us to discuss the question of water 
policy.
<P>
	Under a Liberal government in 1983 a study was commissioned 
on water which resulted in the Pearse report entitled ``Currents of 
Change'', an inquiry on  federal water policy which saw the light of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9837"> 9837 </A></B>
<P>
day in 1986. Chapter 12 of the report contained a thorough analysis 
of water exports as one of the many components of water policy.
<P>
<B>(1850)</B>
<P>
	The Pearse report has been languishing since then. Its main 
recommendations are waiting either to be implemented in their 
original form or modified. In this sense Bill C-232 is extremely 
helpful because it reminds us that the whole question of water 
needs to be visited urgently.
<P>
	The bill relates to the export of water. I concur with the main 
thrust of the private member's bill. However I cannot find, as he 
does, any reference in the NAFTA that would commit the 
Government of Canada to export water. My recollection is that 
there is only a reference to mineral water, as the parliamentary 
secretary indicated in his intervention. Nevertheless, if the member 
for Kamloops has a section of the NAFTA that specifically implies 
Canada's commitment to export water, I would be grateful if he 
were to bring it to our attention.
<P>
	We are talking about the role of the International Joint 
Commission which needs to be revisited to determine whether it is 
timely and effective and, if not, whether it has to be recast in a new 
role.
<P>
	We are also talking about whether our water research facilities, 
particularly with respect to fresh water, are adequate; whether we 
are using water in Canada in an efficient manner; whether the 
quality of water at the municipal level is adequate; and whether 
there are ways of improving it.
<P>
	As the member for Laurentides indicated, we need to look at the 
trends in groundwater. If the trends are downward, as she and some 
hydrologists indicated, we need to look at the predictions for the 
long term so we can ensure the use of water is sustainable and 
future generations, the grandchildren of our grandchildren, will 
have access to groundwater in the same manner as we do despite 
the predicted increase in population.
<P>
	The member for Kamloops said there was tacit approval for the 
sale of water to U.S. and Mexico. He seems to be stretching it a bit 
beyond belief. I do not see any evidence of that. The strong point of 
the bill is that it draws our attention to the fact that whenever there 
is an interbasin transfer of water there is an impact on the 
ecosystem. There is an impact on plants, animals and even 
sometimes on the micro climate.
<P>
	Therefore interbasin transfers should be a thing of the past and 
ought never to be considered again, if at all possible, as was the 
case with the not lamented disappearance of the Grand Canal 
proposal. That proposal received under the Conservative regime of 
1984 to 1994 a grant to facilitate its fulfilment. It was one of the 
greatest misuses of public money I can remember.
<P>
	I welcomed the parliamentary secretary indicating that a review 
of water policy was currently taking place. That was the best kept 
secret in town. Nevertheless it is a good one We welcome that fact. 
We all look forward to the phase when the review will become 
open, which will then allow parliamentarians, the public, interested 
parties and so on to participate.
<P>
<B>(1855)</B>
<P>
	In discussing the management of water and how humans relate to 
it, one cannot help but make a brief reference to dam construction 
as the member for Thunder Bay did so eloquently in his 
intervention. We all hope the construction of dams remains a thing 
of the past. It has had its phase but we must learn to operate and 
function in relation to water within the means made available to us 
without interfering and damaging nature in the way we have done 
so far.
<P>
	In this respect I can only thing of the horrendous damage to the 
native economy that has been caused by the construction of the 
Great Whale Dam in northern Quebec and the proposal which 
fortunately was suspended thereafter because of strong opposition 
to it.
<P>
	The times of megaprojects are over. At least I hope they are over 
and we can manage our requirements for water in a more 
thoughtful and careful manner, being aware of the ecological 
impact.
<P>
	We need to examine the pricing, quality and management of 
water; the international questions including the question of water 
export; and the role of the institutions we have established over 
time to manage better the waters we share with our neighbours.
<P>
	In conclusion, I cannot stress too strongly the necessity of the 
Pearse report finally being made the object of a thorough review 
and a policy being announced that will implement the 
recommendations contained therein.
<P>
	I would ask that the member for Oakville-Milton be allowed to 
speak for 10 minutes.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member for Davenport has proposed 
that there be unanimous consent to permit the member to speak for 
10 minutes. Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville-Milton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to oppose the private member's bill put forward by the member 
for Kamloops. It seems appropriate that a bill to oppose water 
export has been introduced in the House by the member from 
British Columbia. No other province has figured as prominently 
over the past three decades in proposals to export fresh water from 
this country. He is justifiably concerned about this state of affairs, 
which I would like to review briefly.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9838"> 9838 </A></B>
<P>
	In the 1960s the most publicized of all the mega schemes to 
redistribute continental water resources was the North American 
Water and Power Alliance,  sometimes called NAWAPA, designed 
by the Ralph Parsons engineering firm of Los Angeles. It was 
premised on the capture of headwaters of the Yukon, Skeena, 
Peace, Columbia and Fraser Rivers and their storage in the huge 
Rocky Mountain trench of British Columbia before diversion 
elsewhere.
<P>
<B>(1900)</B>
<P>
	Geologists questioned the capacity of the trench to bear the 
weight of such a massive reservoir without increasing earthquake 
and slide hazards. In a mountainous province where habitable 
lowland is at a premium, planners were reluctant to take the risks 
that such a mega scheme implied. Agricultural acreage, wildlife 
habitat and communities as large as Prince George could be 
flooded out. West-east rail and road links between B.C. and the rest 
of Canada could be disrupted by this creation of such a huge 
reservoir. At the time, British Columbians were already 
experiencing enough valley floods in projects serving the 
Columbia River treaty and Peace River power projects and so the 
NAWAPA scheme was rejected.
<P>
	In the mid-1980s, however, the provincial government in 
Victoria decided to entertain another form of fresh water export, 
inviting applications for marine transport from streams in its 
coastal region. When drought struck, American southwest 
communities like Santa Barbara looked north for supplemental 
supplies and B.C. entrepreneurs were quick to respond with 
supertanker proposals. Just as the first contract was about to be 
signed 1991, however, the province was forced by public 
controversy to declare a moratorium on this development. 
Problems included aboriginal land claims and a proliferation of 
applications by various proponents to draw fresh water from the 
same source region. As well there were concerns about navigation 
hazards and fisheries protection. This moratorium was replaced in 
1995 by provincial legislation banning bulk water export of any 
kind.
<P>
	This 1995 legislation effectively scuttled another interbasin 
transfer scheme. Multinational Water and Power Incorporated 
planned to divert 1 million acre-feet of flow from the North 
Thompson River to the Columbia River where it would flow across 
the international boundary and then be sent by pipeline to the 
Shasta reservoir in California. This was the proposal which 
motivated the hon. member for Kamloops to rally his constituency 
and neighbouring communities in opposition and to table well over 
100,000 signatures in this House toward that end. Had the proposal 
not fallen flat among British Columbians, it might well have had a 
difficult time anyway passing existing federal hurdles, namely the 
approvals required under the International River Improvements 
Act and the Navigable Waters Protection Act and the Fisheries Act.
<P>
	Meanwhile smaller exports of water have proceeded in several 
forms. Treated water from greater Vancouver  regional district 
pipelines serves the community of Point Roberts in Washington. 
Ground water supplies in the northern Okanagan Valley are trucked 
in bulk to bottling plants south of the border. And of course bottled 
water is exported. These represent negligible volumes at present 
compared with available resources.
<P>
	There is no conflict between the B.C. legislation and the federal 
water policy which was tabled in this House in 1987. The policy 
opposes large scale water export, as by diversion of lakes or rivers, 
but allows for consideration of small scale exports under provincial 
licensing, providing that federal interests such as navigation, 
fisheries, aboriginal rights and external trade and treaties are taken 
into account.
<P>
	The Government of Canada therefore supports B.C.'s decision to 
prohibit the large scale or bulk export of fresh water from the 
provinces. The province's legislative initiative will encourage a 
growing water bottling industry and at the same time protect its 
salmon fishery and other public values.
<P>
	As the hon. member for Kamloops suggested, the last chapter of 
the water export story has not been written. Further proposals will 
appear in response to international crisis or opportunities. If British 
Columbia has passed legislation specifically to address the water 
export issue to its own satisfaction, the federal government and 
other provinces have not taken the same path.
<P>
	The issue and its many dimensions continue to evolve. It is more 
than likely that the British Columbia approach, which simply 
prohibits bulk water export, will not be the solution chosen by all 
other jurisdictions in Canada. Newfoundland, for example, has 
decided to take advantage of the latitude allowed by the federal 
water policy to explore small scale trade opportunities from 
supertanker exports.
<P>
<B>(1905)</B>
<P>
	Ontario realizes that protection of its Great Lakes advantages 
depends less on unilateral declarations against exports than on 
forming a common bond with neighbouring state governments in 
this international drainage system.
<P>
	It is clear that the hon. member's bill is too narrow to resolve the 
longstanding water export issue. It addresses one prominent threat 
to Canada's water heritage, proposals for the diversion of lakes and 
rivers to flow to the United States. But it ignores other means by 
which water can be exported and it does not offer a framework of 
national applicability suitable for adoption by the Government of 
Canada.
<P>
	I suggest that it is not necessary to rush Bill C-232 into law in 
order to save Canada's water resources from being lost to foreign 
markets. There is enough time for the federal government to 
consult with provinces and public interests about a more 
comprehensive approach that  would apply across the country, one 
which is sensitive to the various water resources of our various 
provinces

	<B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill C-84, an act to amend the 
Citizenship Act and the Immigration Act, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee.
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in this House to 
support what I feel to be an important and necessary piece of 
legislation.
<P>
	Recently, it became apparent that we needed to strengthen the 
provisions of the <I>Citizenship</I> and <I>Immigration Acts</I>. The Federal 
Court identified this problem and brought it to the attention of the 
Government. Now we intend to fix it. That is what good 
government is all about: continually seeking to improve the 
institutions that serve the public and the legislation that governs 
society.
<P>
	The issue addressed by Bill C-84 is a technical one which 
potentially affects only a very small number of people. 
Nevertheless, it is vital that we address it now, as it concerns two 
things which are of supreme importance to the people of Canada: 
national security and our citizenship.
<P>
	It is clear to me that Canadians of all backgrounds and all parts 
of the country value their citizenship. This is a distinction which is 
very precious. Being a Canadian means belonging to a very special 
home. It means holding a passport which is respected and honoured 
around the world. And it means sharing a colourful national history 
and a beautiful and iverse country.
<P>
	Being a Canadian citizen is a special right which we share. Every 
year, many immigrants come to this country with the hope of one 
day becoming Canadians themselves. We are happy to share our 
citizenship with those who want it and work hard to deserve it.
<P>
	But there is always a small number of people who do not deserve 
this distinction. There are a few individuals whose actions threaten 
to tarnish and diminish the value of our citizenship. And there are 
those who would use Canadian citizenship as a shield for their 
subversive  activity. Why should we allow them to become 
citizens, or even permanent residents? No, we should not. I am sure 
we are all in agreement about that.
<P>
	But the reality of the situation is that we might have no choice in 
certain circumstances.
<P>
<B>(1910)</B>
<P>
	I know that this sounds surprising. But given the problem in the 
law the courts have identified, there are situations in which we 
might not be able to prevent men and women who are security risks 
from becoming permanent residents or citizens.
<P>
	Citizenship would be granted under the existing legislation 
despite the best judgment of the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, the Government and the people of Canada.
<P>
	That is why I am standing before you today, and why I feel that 
the House must support this Bill. Our citizenship is precious, and 
we must strive to protect it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	One of the primary roles of the Canadian Security Intelligence 
Service is to protect the national security of Canada. This is an 
important organization which serves this country very well. But in 
a democratic and free country like ours it is important to have 
checks and balances in place to ensure that our law enforcement 
agencies conduct themselves in a just and fair manner. We impose 
safeguards to protect the rights and freedoms of all our citizens.
<P>
	One important safeguard is the Security Intelligence Review 
Committee. It monitors CSIS activities on behalf of Parliament and 
the public. Over the years its members have performed their 
functions professionally and admirably. Routine security checks 
are an important part of the approval process in the granting of both 
citizenship and permanent resident status. There are provisions in 
both the Citizenship Act and Immigration Act to deny citizenship 
and permanent resident status if in the opinion of both the Minister 
of Citizenship and Immigration and the Solicitor General of 
Canada there are reasonable grounds to believe that an applicant is 
linked to organized crime, poses a security threat or was a senior 
member of a government that engaged in terrorism, flagrant human 
rights violations, war crimes or crimes against humanity.
<P>
	In such instances they may make a report to the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee and ask for a review of the case. 
An individual can be declared a threat only if the committee agrees. 
This system works well. It achieves a fair balance between the 
rights of the individuals concerned and the need to protect the 
Canadian public from potential harm.
<P>
	There are occasions when the committee may be unable to 
execute its duties. There are exceptional cases  where members of 
the committee may find themselves in conflict of interest situations 
or somehow open to a perception of bias. Under the current system 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9840"> 9840 </A></B>
<P>
there are no provisions to deal with this eventuality. The result can 
be very disturbing.
<P>
	If, for instance, the committee is unable to render a decision in a 
citizenship case because of the perception of bias the minister 
would have no choice but to grant citizenship to a person who could 
compromise our country's national security. This is clearly 
unacceptable.
<P>
	The purpose of Bill C-84 is to deal with this potential situation. 
While the cases we are discussing are rare, we cannot simply 
ignore them. When we are talking about security issues we must be 
vigilant and act decisively. We want to put in place an alternative 
solution that would serve to replace the Security Intelligence 
Review Committee when that body believes itself to be incapable 
of performing its duties.
<P>
	The bill proposes to give the governor in council the power to 
appoint a retired judge to perform the review committee's duties 
when this occurs. This judge will have the same powers and 
obligations that are accorded to the review committee.
<P>
<B>(1915)</B>
<P>
	It is that simple. We need to have a mechanism in place to deal 
with relatively rare but potentially very serious situations. This will 
not affect the existing criteria for refusing people entry into 
Canada. This legislation will not diminish the powers of the CSIS 
or the review committee in any way.
<P>
	What we are proposing to do today is simply correct potential 
procedural irregularities. It is a small step, but an important one.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have found a problem and are taking steps to fix it. This bill 
is an efficient and necessary measure. I am told that opposition 
parties will be introducing amendments to improve the bill. We 
will be pleased to support improvements in the interest of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak today on Bill C-84, an act to amend the Citizenship Act 
and the Immigration Act.
<P>
	This bill was introduced on February 20 by the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, and will be passed today, with our 
consent, on second and third reading. The minister has just 
expressed her thanks to the official opposition for its co-operation. 
You have already seen in the past four years that the Bloc 
Quebecois is a responsible party.
<P>
	We are a sovereignist party, and Quebecers have entrusted us 
with the role of official opposition. We have fulfilled our mandate 
with a great deal of ability and a serious attitude, which is why 
today we are co-operating  in the passage of this bill, which we feel 
is an important one. We also agree to this bill being fast tracked.
<P>
	The amendments to the legislation mainly address the possibility 
for a retired judge appointed by the Governor in Council to replace, 
and therefore perform the duties of, the security intelligence review 
committee, or SIRC, when the latter is of the opinion that it cannot 
fulfil its duties, because of apparent lack of impartiality, conflict of 
interest, or any other reason deemed necessary.
<P>
	The government has just told us that these legislative changes 
are intended to ensure the security of the country. Should a 
situation arise in which an individual constitutes a threat to the 
security of Canada, SIRC carries out an investigation in accordance 
with section 19 of the Citizenship Act. The committee then reports 
to the Governor in Council, who decides whether citizenship is to 
be granted or not. In the case of an application for permanent 
residence, the process is the same, except that the decision comes 
from the Federal Court.
<P>
	Bill C-84 is presented as an alternative solution, when SIRC 
cannot perform its duties, for instance by reason of lack of 
impartiality. Under Bill C-84, the governor in council may appoint 
a retired judge for a term of three to five years to perform the duties 
of the review committee set out in the Citizenship Act and the 
Immigration Act.
<P>
	The bill can be retroactive. It includes transitional provisions 
aimed at recognition of a legal decision rendered with respect to the 
jurisdiction of SIRC before the coming into force of the bill. The 
decision must, however, be definitive and without appeal.
<P>
	According to section 19 of the Citizenship Act, the Minister may 
make a report to the Review Committee, when of the opinion that a 
person should not be granted citizenship, administered the oath of 
citizenship, or issued a certificate of renunciation.
<P>
<B>(1920)</B>
<P>
	In such cases there must be reasonable grounds to believe that 
the person concerned will engage in activity that constitutes a 
threat to the security of Canada or that is part of a pattern of 
criminal activity planned and organized by a number of persons 
acting in concert in furtherance of the commission of any offence 
that may be punishable under any Act of Parliament by way of 
indictment.
<P>
	The minister shall, within ten days after a report is made by 
CSIS, send a notice informing the person concerned of the report. 
The review committee shall investigate the grounds on which the 
report is based. The review committee shall, as soon as practicable 
after a report is made to it, send to the person with respect to whom 
the report is made a statement summarizing such information 
available to it. The review committee shall, on completion of an 
investigation, make a report to the minister and provide the 
complainant with the conclusion of the report.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9841"> 9841 </A></B>
<P>
	Bill C-84 follows on the heels of the Zundel case. Zundel, a 
German citizen, applied for Canadian citizenship in 1993. On the 
basis of information obtained by CSIS, the Minister of Citizenship 
and Immigration sent a report to the Security Intelligence Review 
Committee stating there were reasonable grounds to believe that 
Zundel constituted a threat to the security of Canada.
<P>
	Zundel was advised that the SIRC had been ordered to 
investigate him. If the report was confirmed, his application for 
citizenship might be turned down, which was the case. Zundel is a 
person with extreme rightwing views who denies the existence of 
the Holocaust. He is a member of so-called hate organizations and 
is therefore a threat to the security of Canada. These conclusions 
can be found in a report on the Heritage Front. And as you know, 
that particular case attracted the attention of the media.
<P>
	Zundel therefore asked the Federal Court to prohibit the SIRC 
from conducting an investigation on the grounds of a reasonable 
apprehension of bias.
<P>
	Zundel's counsel then filed an application for judicial review on 
the grounds of this apprehension of bias on the part of the SIRC. 
The federal court judge issued an order prohibiting the SIRC from 
continuing its investigation, on the grounds of bias. The federal 
court therefore upheld the appeal by Zundel's counsel. 
Furthermore, the judge suggested how the legislation could be 
amended to deal with such situations.
<P>
	So far, the minister was not in a position to reject Ernst Zundel's 
application for citizenship. He might be forced to grant him his 
citizenship, even if this individual might be a threat to national 
security.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois agrees with the bill but obtained the consent 
of the government party for moving two amendments. The first one 
concerns the appointment of a retired judge and reads as follows: 
``After consultation by the Prime Minister of Canada with the 
Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons and the leader 
in the House of Commons, of each party having at least twelve 
members in that House, the Governor in Council may''.
<P>
	With this amendment we want to avoid any hint of patronage 
with respect to appointments made by this government, as has 
happened in the case of commissioners appointed to the IRRB.
<P>
	We also agree with the amendment moved by the Reform Party.
<P>
	The second amendment by the Bloc Quebecois reads as follows: 
``The person appointed under subsection 39.1(1) must, not later 
than September 30 in each fiscal year, submit to the Solicitor 
General of Canada a report of the activities of the person during the 
preceding fiscal year and the Solicitor General of Canada must 
cause the report to be laid before each House of Parliament on any  
of the first fifteen days on which that House is sitting after the day 
the Solicitor General of Canada receives it.''
<P>
<B>(1925)</B>
<P>
	I agree with the points made earlier by the minister. This 
individual denies the existence of the Holocaust in which more 
than six million Jews were exterminated by the Nazis during the 
second world war. I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to 
the Jewish community for its exceptional contribution to Canada 
and Quebec. I visited the Museum of the Holocaust recently in 
Washington, and I again realized of why we must not let this 
happen again today.
<P>
	For all these reasons, I support Bill C-84.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on Bill C-84. Although 
the bill is very simple and straightforward, it concerns the 
Citizenship Act and the Immigration Act.
<P>
	The bill would allow a retired judge to review cases where SIRC 
is deemed incapable of fulfilling its responsibilities. While the bill 
is very straightforward its history is not. Before landed immigrants 
obtain Canadian citizenship their backgrounds are reviewed. Some 
individuals applying for a Canadian citizenship have involved 
themselves in activities that can be deemed to be a threat to the 
security of Canada. Therefore, there is a process in place to prevent 
these individuals from becoming Canadian citizens, as there should 
be.
<P>
	Sections 19 and 20 of the Citizenship Act define the procedure 
that is to be followed. These procedures are: If the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration is of the opinion that there are 
reasonable grounds to believe that the applicant for Canadian 
citizenship will engage in activities that will constitute a threat to 
the security of Canada, the minister may make a report to this 
effect to the Security Intelligence Review Committee or SIRC as it 
is more commonly known. Within 10 days of making this report to 
SIRC, the minister shall notify the applicant of the report. SIRC is 
then required to conduct an investigation. The applicant is sent a 
statement of circumstances that sets out the grounds that give rise 
to the minister's report.
<P>
	Following its investigation, SIRC then reports the results to the 
governor in council. The governor in council may then make a 
declaration that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the 
applicant will engage in activity that constitutes a threat to the 
security of Canada.
<P>
	Such a declaration precludes the applicant from being granted 
Canadian citizenship but only for a two-year period. The applicant 
can then make another application. What constitutes a threat to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="9842"> 9842 </A></B>
<P>
security of Canada and  how SIRC conducts its investigation is all 
laid out in the Canadian Security Intelligence Services Act.
<P>
	Section 48(2) of the CSIS act states that during the course of the 
SIRC investigation, the applicant, the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration and CSIS may all present evidence and make 
representation either personally or by counsel.
<P>
	I would like to refer to the Zündel case. This case which has 
inspired C-34 concerns the application of Ernst Zündel. Mr. Zündel 
has obtained enough notoriety that I do not believe that it is 
essential to repeat his claims to infamy.
<P>
	Suffice it to say that Mr. Zündel immigrated to Canada on 
September 2, 1958. On October 24, 1993 he applied for Canadian 
citizenship. On August 5, 1995 he was notified by the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration at that time that the minister had 
made a report to SIRC pursuant to subsection 19(2) of the 
Citizenship Act. The letter informed Mr. Zündel that there were 
reasonable grounds to believe that he would engage in activity that 
constitutes a threat to the security of Canada. The letter also stated 
that the minister made his determination based on information and 
advice provided by CSIS.
<P>
	On August 31, 1995 the executive director of SIRC, Maurice 
Archdeacon wrote to Mr. Zündel advising him that SIRC had 
received the minister's report concerning his application for 
citizenship. The letter also advised that SIRC would send Mr. 
Zündel a summary of information available to SIRC to permit him 
to be as fully informed as possible of the circumstances giving rise 
to the minister's report.
<P>
	On October 30, 1995 SIRC sent a letter to Mr. Zündel advising 
him that a review committee was conducting an investigation and 
included a statement of circumstances that gave rise to the 
minister's report. The letter advised that the activities which CSIS 
believed he would engage in were those described in paragraph 
2(c) of the CSIS act which defines threat to the security of Canada 
to mean ``activities within or relating to Canada directed toward or 
in support of the threat or use of acts of serious violence against 
persons or property for the purpose of achieving a political 
objective within Canada or a foreign state''.
<P>
	On November 22, 1995 counsel for SIRC and others met with 
Mr. Zündel and his lawyer to explain the investigative process and 
answer any questions.
<P>
<B>(1930 )</B>
<P>
	In a letter dated December 11, 1995 Mr. Archdeacon wrote to 
Mr. Zundel's counsel to advise him that SIRC was prepared to 
proceed with the hearing part of the investigation. A number of 
adjournments postponed the hearing phase of SIRC's investigation, 
but then in a letter of February 26, 1996 Mr. Zundel's counsel 
requested another adjournment so he could file an application for  
judicial review on the grounds of a reasonable apprehension of bias 
on the part of SIRC.
<P>
	The basis of Mr. Zundel's allegation of bias was a report written 
by SIRC entitled ``The Heritage Front Affair''. In a letter dated 
February 28 Mr. Archdeacon refused the request. On March 21 a 
motion was brought before the Federal Court of Canada seeking a 
stay of proceedings concerning the SIRC hearing that was 
scheduled for March 25 and an order for an expedited hearing ofMr. Zundel's application for judicial review.
<P>
	Madam Justice McGillis refused to grant the stay of proceedings 
but she granted the motion for an expedited hearing. On June 10 
and 11 the application for judicial review was heard before Justice 
Heald of the federal court in Ottawa.
<P>
	After dealing with a number of procedural motions the court got 
down to the narrow issue of the case to decide if SIRC should be 
prohibited from carrying out the proceedings mandated by section 
19 of the Citizenship Act. First the court had to determine what test 
for bias was applicable to the case while acknowledging that all 
administrative boards owe a duty of fairness to those whose 
interests they must determine. The courts have recognized that the 
duty of fairness varies depending on the nature and function of the 
particular board.
<P>
	For example, a board that performs policy formation should not 
be susceptible to a charge of bias just because it expresses opinions 
prior to its hearings. On the other hand, administrative boards that 
are primarily adjudicative in their functions are expected to comply 
with the standard applicable to the courts. In arguments before the 
courts counsel for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
argued that SIRC's role is closer to a policy formation board, while 
Mr. Zundel's counsel argued that it was primarily adjudicative and 
therefore attracted the higher standard of impartiality mandated by 
the informed bystander test.
<P>
	In determining where on this broad spectrum SIRC's function 
fell, the judge reviewed SIRC's mandate under section 19 of the 
Citizenship Act, which in the words of SIRC's executive director 
was to conduct an investigation to determine whether there were 
reasonable grounds to believe that Zundel would engage in 
activities that constituted a threat to the security of Canada.
<P>
	The judge noted that while the applicant, the minister and CSIS 
could make representation, SIRC's investigation would be 
conducted in private. Once SIRC completed its investigation it 
would make a report to the governor in council. It is the governor in 
council that upon SIRC's report decides whether or not to declare 
there are reasonable grounds to believe that Mr, Zundel would 
engage in activity considered a threat to the security of Canada.
<P>
	The court pointed out that while it is not disputed it was the role 
of the governor in council and not SIRC to  make the final decision, 
<P>

<B><A NAME="9843"> 9843 </A></B>
<P>
SIRC's role could not be understated. It is SIRC that conducts the 
hearing at which it assesses the witnesses and weighs their 
evidence. It is SIRC that receives the submissions of the interested 
parties. It is SIRC that takes all the available information and 
issues the report.
<P>
	Since Mr. Zundel could not make representation before the 
governor in council, the only opportunity for him to challenge the 
allegations against him was in front of SIRC. The court determined 
that while SIRC was not the ultimate decision maker as to whether 
there were reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. Zundel would 
engage in activity that constituted a threat to the security of 
Canada, SIRC played a vital and paramount role in that 
determination.
<P>
	In the judge's view the function of SIRC at least in relation to 
section 19 of the Citizenship Act came closer to the adjudicative 
end of the function. Thus it attracted the standard of impartiality 
that was required by the informed bystander test. Once the federal 
court came to this conclusion it was then faced with the process of 
applying the informed bystander test for bias to the Zundel case.
<P>
	Mr. Zundel claimed that the view of SIRC in the Heritage Front 
report gave rise to reasonable apprehension of bias against him. 
While the court ruled that the accuracy of the content of the 
Heritage Front report was irrelevant to the issues, it was important 
to note that SIRC offered the report and made the statements 
contained therein. In other words the court did not have to decide 
whether SIRC's findings in the Heritage Front report were valid. 
What was important to this case was the fact that SIRC made those 
findings.
<P>
	Having been involved for over 19 months in the study of the 
Heritage Front report, it was very evident to me that SIRC had 
made statements about Mr. Zundel which were very biased in their 
nature. The court quickly found that the statements of SIRC in the 
Heritage Front report were extremely similar to those used by the 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration in another incident. It is 
not terribly surprising because CSIS is a source of information both 
for the Department of Citizenship and Immigration and SIRC. It 
was evident that the conclusions in the evidence given by SIRC 
from the information received from CSIS led to the bias in the 
report that was reported.
<P>
<B>(1935)</B>
<P>
	The Reform Party believes some individuals have landed 
immigrant status in Canada who should be denied Canadian 
citizenship. Bill C-84 is an attempt by the government to undo the 
difficulties created by the Security Intelligence Review Committee 
overstating in the report and being too political in its discussions 
and deliberations. It has placed the government in the position 
where it has to protect Canadians and Canadian citizenship by 
tightening the rules and regulations to  allow a retired judge to take 
the job that SIRC should have been able to do on its own.
