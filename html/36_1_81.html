Scrutiny of Regulations presented on Tuesday, March 10, 1998 be

</I></B></P><P align=left>Pursuant to its permanent order of reference, section 19 of the 
Statutory Instruments Act, the joint committee draws the 
attention of the Houses to sections 56 and 57 of the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police regulations, 1988. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1010"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In early 1997 it was drawn to the attention of the joint 
committee that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police continues to 
apply section 57 of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
Regulations, 1988, notwithstanding that similar, though somewhat 
less all encompassing, restrictions on participation in political 
activities by other public servants was struck down by the 
Supreme Court of Canada in Osborne <I>v</I> Canada as contravening 
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The force was requested to advise the committee whether it 
considers section 57 to be constitutionally valid, 
notwithstanding the Osborne decision.  In the event that it did, 
it was to provide a detailed statement of reasons in support of 
that position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The designated instruments officer for the RCMP initially 
explained that in view of the fact that the constitutionality of 
section 57 has been challenged before the Quebec Superior Court, 
“it would be inadvisable for the RCMP to bring this matter 
before committee at this point because it is sub judice”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For reasons I will explain shortly, the committee did not accept 
this as a satisfactory reply and reiterated its request for a 
detailed statement of reasons in support of the constitutional 
validity of section 57 of the regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a letter dated March 12, 1997 the committee was informed that 
“the Attorney General of Canada is of the position that section 
57 of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Regulations, 1988, is not 
contrary to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and that 
the 1991 decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Osborne v 
Canada (Treasury Board) does not apply to the said section”, and 
that “The attorney general is prepared to make these same 
arguments and defend section 57 in an action before the Superior 
Court of Quebec”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the reference to arguments, it is clear that the RCMP 
has chosen to simply refer to conclusions reached by the Attorney 
General of Canada and no reasons have been put forward in support 
of these conclusions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of this, your committee wrote to the Solicitor General 
of Canada asking him to provide the joint committee with a 
statement identifying the governmental objectives served by 
section 57 and explaining why a nearly absolute ban on all 
political activities is necessary to achieve these objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general was also advised that the committee might 
possibly object to the constitutional validity of section 56 of 
the regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By letter dated April 9, 1997 the solicitor general explained 
that it is the government's view that the Osborne decision does 
not apply to the RCMP because it involved a challenge to 
subsections 33(1)(a) and (b) of the Public Service Employment Act 
which prohibited public servants hired under that act from 
engaging in work for or against a federal or provincial candidate 
or party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, sections 56 and 57 of the RCMP regulations 
deal with RCMP members who are engaged pursuant to the RCMP Act 
for the purposes of law enforcement and who, as a consequence of 
their duties, have broad powers of discretion which have an 
impact on the general population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is not whether the Osborne decision applies as such 
to members of the RCMP but whether sections 56 and 57 contravene 
the charter of rights and freedoms.  The factual distinctions 
mentioned by the minister are obvious.  It should be equally 
clear, however, that the reasoning of the supreme court in the 
Osborne decision is relevant to a determination of whether or not 
sections 56 and 57 of the regulations contravene the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 33 of the Public Service Employment Act and sections 56 
and 57 of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Regulations, 1988, 
are both intended to promote a similar governmental objective: 
political neutrality of the persons to whom they are directed so 
as to maintain public confidence in public institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his reply, the minister also stated that initiative 
RCMP/93-9-L, which has been included in the federal regulatory 
plan every year since 1993, is intended to indicate that the RCMP 
is studying the best means possible to maintain the needed 
political neutrality of the force, that political neutrality 
being the objective of sections 56 and 57. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The force is examining whether there are alternatives to the 
current scheme of sections 56 and 57 which could permit more 
flexibility while continuing to safeguard the political 
neutrality of the force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This statement is apparently meant to suggest that the relevant 
regulatory initiative should not be construed as an admission 
that the restrictions set out in sections 56 and 57 go beyond 
what is necessary to ensure that there is no political 
partisanship in the performance of police functions and duties 
and that this initiative is no more than a study or an 
examination of possible alternatives.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard the committee notes that a federal regulatory 
plan is an annual listing of the government's anticipated 
regulatory activity for the coming year and that initiative 
RCMP/93-9-L clearly states that the RCMP regulations 1998 will be 
amended to reflect the extent and the conditions under which 
members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police will be permitted to 
engage in political activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering the nature of the federal regulatory plans and the 
language used to describe initiative RCMP/93-9-L, it appears to 
the committee that this initiative states a clear intention to 
amend the existing regulations rather than merely an intent to 
undertake a general study of possible alternatives. As such, this 
initiative must reflect an official finding that the current 
level of restrictions is not necessary in order to secure the 
objective of political neutrality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee observes that it also drew the attention 
of the solicitor general to the fact that the legislation 
governing police forces in other jurisdictions either does not 
contain any expressed restrictions on police activities or, if 
it does, such restrictions are far less severe than those found 
in sections 56 and 57.  The committee asked the solicitor general 
to explain why sections 56 and 57 should be regarded as essential 
to the preservation of the political neutrality of a federal 
police force when lesser restrictions are considered sufficient 
to preserve the political neutrality of provincial police forces 
such as the Ontario Provincial Police or the Sûreté du Québec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As already mentioned, it appears that an action has been 
initiated in the superior court for the district of Montreal in 
which the constitutional validity of section 57 being is 
challenged. This led the RCMP to suggest that the question of the 
constitutional validity of section 57 should not be dealt with by 
the committee.  The committee does not believe that the fact that 
an action challenging the validity is before the courts does or 
should preclude Parliament from considering the same question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament and the courts both have a responsibility to ensure 
the constitutionality of legislation.  Indeed, since it is a 
fountain head of all legislation, it may be thought that the 
responsibility of Parliament in this regard is pre-eminent.  If 
legislation is unconstitutional Parliament may in some instances 
provide a more timely and cost efficient forum for resolution of 
the matter than the courts.  In any event, Parliament exercises a 
jurisdiction that is completely distinct from that of the courts 
and the joint committee does not accept that it should refrain 
from exercising its statutory mandate on behalf of Parliament 
because the validity of a particular regulation is also being 
considered by the court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The joint committee has examined the question of whether 
sections 56 and 57 of the regulations conform to the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms and concludes that these sections 
should be revoked on the ground that they do not conform to the 
charter.  In addition, the committee objects to these provisions 
on the grounds that they amount to the exercise of a substantive 
legislative power that is properly the subject of direct 
parliamentary enactment and that they trespass unduly on rights 
and liberties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee wishes to make it clear that some restrictions on 
political activities of members of the RCMP are unquestionably 
necessary to maintain public confidence in fair and impartial 
enforcement of laws by the force.  It may even be the case that 
the existing restrictions are constitutionally appropriate at 
certain levels of the RCMP or as they apply to officers occupying 
certain positions.  On the other hand, the member's committee 
simply cannot do otherwise than conclude that the existing 
restrictions, involving as they do a near complete ban on 
participation in political activities, go beyond what is required 
in most cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having considered the relevant case law, the joint committee has 
formed the opinion that sections 56 and 57 are inconsistent with 
the freedom of expression guaranteed by the Canadian Charter of 
Rights and Freedoms and that the restrictions imposed by these 
sections cannot demonstrably be justified in a free and 
democratic society.  In addition, these sections may infringe on 
the freedom of association guaranteed by section 2(d), and the 
right to be qualified as a candidate guaranteed by section 3 of 
the charter.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 2(d) of the charter guarantees freedom of association. 
Is this freedom contravened by section 56 of the regulations 
which prohibits any public display of political partisanship or 
by section 57, prohibition against working for or on behalf of a 
political party?  Freedom of association has been defined as 
including the freedom to establish, belong to and maintain an 
association.  In the Osborne decision, the supreme court observed 
that a prohibition against federal public servants working for or 
against any candidate or political party or standing as 
candidates appeared to constitute an infringement of section 
2(d). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation in the present instance is similar.  While it has 
been concluded that section 56 and 57 violate section 2(b) of the 
charter, there is also a strong case to be made that the 
provisions of the regulations in question infringe the freedom of 
association guaranteed by section 2(d). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The importance of governmental objectives that are served by 
sections 56 and 57 of the regulations cannot be denied.  As the 
solicitor general wrote, political neutrality, which is the 
objective of the sections, is to ensure there is no political 
partisanship or perception of political partisanship in the 
performance of police duties and functions or law enforcement 
more generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Osborne case the supreme court had little difficulty in 
concluding that restrictions imposed on the political activities 
of public servants were clearly intended to further an important 
governmental objective, namely the preservation of neutrality of 
the public service.  The same reasoning unquestionably applies in 
the case of sections 56 and 57. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee cannot but conclude that the prohibitions imposed 
by sections 56 and 57 of the regulations go beyond what is 
necessary to achieve the legitimate governmental objectives 
identified earlier.  The provisions in question preclude a very 
wide range of political activities by members of the RCMP.  For 
example, section 56 provides that a member shall not wear or 
display the emblem or insignia of any political party or display 
political partisanship in any other manner.  This would, in 
effect, preclude a member from displaying a lawn sign in front of 
the member's home in support of a candidate in a municipal 
election, for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 57(1)(a) prohibits a member of the force from engaging 
in any work for, on behalf or against any person seeking election 
to the governing body of a municipality.  Thus a member could not 
be seen to support a candidate in a municipal election who was 
campaigning for or against a particular local issue such as the 
widening of a bridge or the expansion of a shopping mall.  Even 
an activity as innocuous and removed from the public eye as 
stuffing envelopes with campaign literature is prohibited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his letter of April 9, 1997, the solicitor general took pains 
to point out that he had not yet approved changes to sections 56 
and 57 and that he had not submitted any such changes for the 
consideration of the governor in council.  If the solicitor 
general had already approved changes to these sections and 
submitted them to the governor in council, there would be no need 
for the committee to recommend the revocation of sections 56 and 
57.  In that sense the minister is stating the obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of the nature of the joint committee's objections to 
sections 56 and 57 of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
Regulations, 1988, in particular its belief that it is 
inappropriate for restrictions on freedoms and association as 
serious as those found in sections 56 and 57, to be enacted by 
way of regulation, the committee initially took the position that 
the disallowance of these sections by the House of Commons was 
the most suitable course of action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shortly before the committee was scheduled to consider a draft 
report containing a disallowance resolution, the solicitor 
general requested to appear before the joint committee.  This 
appearance took place on April 24, 1997, almost a year ago.  In 
the course of his testimony the minister reiterated that his 
position remained that sections 56 and 57 of the regulations are 
constitutional and do not infringe the charter of rights and 
freedoms: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the regulations strictly from a constitutional 
standpoint, they do meet the test and should not be revoked on 
the grounds that they are unconstitutional.  If you are concerned 
that the regulations are overly restrictive compared to those of 
the Sûreté du Québec or the OPP, I assure you that we are working 
to bring them in line with the regulations of other police 
forces.  However, we are not acting because the regulations are 
unconstitutional.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the assurance that the current provisions would be 
revoked, the committee decided not to proceed with the 
disallowance of sections 56 and 57 of the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police Regulations Act.  Although a proposed revision was to be 
presented to the solicitor general in the fall, this did not occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The delay has led the committee to decide that this matter 
should be drawn to the attention of the Houses by means of this 
report.  In particular, the committee wishes to highlight its 
recommendation that any limits on the constitutionally protected 
rights and freedoms ought to be decided by Parliament itself and 
not by a delegate in exercise of subordinate law making powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time the immediate concern of the committee remains 
the continued existence of sections 56 and 57 of the regulations 
and should these provisions continue in existence much longer the 
committee is going to consider the possibility of invoking the 
disallowance procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee wishes to make it very clear that is not impugning 
the legitimacy of the objectives of section 56 and 57 and it is 
not the role of the joint committee to define precisely which 
restrictions may be placed on the political activities of members 
of the RCMP so as to preserve the neutrality of the force while 
infringing the rights of members as little as is reasonably 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is, however, the responsibility of the committee in cases 
where such measures are enacted in subordinate legislation to 
advise the Houses whether the means chosen to achieve certain 
objectives are proper and lawful.  In this connection we would 
draw attention to the House that the RCMP has had amendments to 
the impugned provisions under consideration for at least five 
years and it is presumably in a position to propose to Parliament 
through the responsible minister a new, less all encompassing 
regime in an expeditious manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee recommends that sections 56 and 57 of the Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police Regulations, 1988 be revoked without 
further delay, which in practical terms conveyed to the solicitor 
general by letter means by April 4, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the government to act by April 4, thereby avoiding the 
embarrassment and inconvenience which could occur when the 
committee recommends disallowance to the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the

member has raised a very important topic and he has made some 
very interesting arguments.  He knows and his party knows that 
the House of Commons does not launch into a debate on an 
important topic like this without consultation between the 
parties.  The reason for that is quite simple.  The member has 
obviously conducted a great deal of research and has developed 
his arguments extremely well.  To appear in the House at a 
particular time unexpectedly to present an argument like this is 
unfair to his topic and to the other parties which have not had 
the time to prepare their arguments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It concerns me greatly that the member would do a disservice to 
such an important topic by raising it in this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I move:

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to make it very 
clear that this is an initiative of the Standing Committee on 
Scrutiny of Regulations which is a joint committee of the House 
of Commons and the Senate. Its members consider the legality of 
regulations.  It is not partisan in any manner.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A report was filed in the House at least two weeks ago.  I gave 
notice of intention to raise this concurrence motion, I would 
say, seven to ten days ago.  It has been on the order paper since 
that date. 
<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am a member of the Standing Joint Committee on the 
Scrutiny of Regulations and have been a member of that committee 
since 1989 without pause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I came here this morning thinking that we would be discussing 
Bill C-28.  I want to make a couple of comments and then ask the 
member a question, because I know the member is also a member of 
the committee along with me and with others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything he says is what the joint committee said in its 
report to the House of Commons.  The joint committee made these 
comments unanimously, as far as I recall, both from 
representatives of all parties on that committee and senators 
representing both parties in the other place.  That report draws 
to the attention of the House exactly what the hon. member 
brought to the attention of the House in his speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My problem is very similar to what the parliamentary secretary 
just said.  This is an important topic because it deals with the 
primacy of parliament.  It deals with the ability of parliament, 
when called upon to do so, to disallow regulations that have been 
put forward by various departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because this is a power the committee very rarely recommends 
that parliament exercise, it is important that all members are 
apprised of upcoming debate so that they can prepare and consider 
the issue carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In view of a unanimous report of a joint committee, it is 
important that members of Parliament take their positions 
advisedly after having read the report carefully, after having 
considered all points of view, whatever they may be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What troubles me is that the joint committee has already agreed 
that we would wait until next Thursday before taking any further 
action, in the hope that the solicitor general's department would 
deal with the regulations prior to April 4.  It is already on the 
agenda for April 4, at which time our committee would make a 
final decision as to whether or not to recommend disallowance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the hon. member is simple.  Why would he bring 
this matter forth now as opposed to waiting until after the 
committee had dealt with it on April 4, the last day the 
committee was prepared to permit the solicitor general to delay? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
pointing out that I was careful to reiterate only the material 
approved by the joint standing committee in its report and not to 
inject any type of personal or partisan material into my 
comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As pointed out by the member, this is such an important matter 
that it needed to be drawn to the attention of the House. 
Unfortunately most of the reports presented in this place are 
presented but nobody ever takes the time to read them to 
understand the serious nature of the contents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I felt it was my duty to make sure that a substantial part of 
the report was read into the record today so that members present 
would be able to understand why the committee is treating this 
matter with such serious consideration.  I personally would not 
have had an opportunity to move this concurrence motion next 
week.  This was my final opportunity to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it helps the people who find themselves in a restricted 
position because of sections 56 and 57 and if it helps the 
solicitor general to go ahead and make a prompt decision on this 
matter, I would say a lot has been achieved by reading this into 
the record this morning.

No. 46 will be answered today. 
.[Text] 
<Question No. 46—<B>Mr. Mark Assad:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the Canadian International Development Agency's 
microcredit programs, (<I>a</I>) do these distribute their more than 
$1.7 million among the world's poorest families (<I>b</I>) if so, how 
was this figure calculated (<I>c</I>) how is this figure broken down 
by country and by financial middleman (<I>d</I>) how is it determined 
that the families who benefit are among the poorest and (<I>e</I>) how 
much did the government spend on microcredit in 1996-97 and 
1997-98? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister for International Cooperation and 
Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> The Government of 
Canada recognizes the importance of microcredit as a mechanism to 
help people, and especially very poor women, find a pathway out 
of poverty and to achieve dignity and self-sufficiency. CIDA has 
long been active in microenterprise/microfinance, ME/MF, 
development, and early on, supported institutions which are now 
regarded as leaders and innovators in the field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Microcredit Summit held in Washington D.C. in February 1997 
pledged participants to reach 100 million of the poorest families 
with credit by 2005. The hon. member mentions $1.7 million spent 
by CIDA in microcredit programs. We believe that this figure may 
have been taken from an article in <I>La Presse</I> by the hon. 
Minister for International Cooperation and Minister responsible 
for Francophonie in October 1997. The article actually refers to 
1.7 million people, a calculation of the number of people CIDA as 
a bilateral donor would be expected to reach in the Microcredit 
Summit's campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, CIDA already would surpass this objective. But more 
importantly, as the minister's article also pointed out, the 
spirit of the summit lies not in detailed accounting, but in 
ensuring that we work together to create the structure, systems 
and viable institutions that can provide the services that are 
needed by people struggling to get out of poverty. CIDA, through 
membership in the Microcredit Summit, the Consultative Group to 
Assist the Poorest CGAP, and other networks, is actively engaged in 
improving the quality of its microfinance programming and its 
collaboration with partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do, however, acknowledge that we have shortcomings in our 
information on the amounts and breakdown of our support in this 
field. CIDA is not alone in lacking precise information. The 
microfinance industry is young, and the donor community is still 
in the process of agreeing on common definitions on what we are 
measuring. It is important to emphasize that donors' support is 
not always just directed at microcredit. For example, CIDA 
supports savings co-operatives. We also support policy change to 
create an institutional and regulatory environment that allows 
microfinance institutions to work effectively, and that allows 
businesses of all sizes to prosper. We support integrated 
programs in which credit is just one part. Our experience tells 
us that microcredit can be an even more powerful tool if 
complementary policies and systems are in place: adequate health 
care, good basic education, roads and infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CIDA supports about 100 projects addressing microfinance/microenterprises 
in developing countries in Africa, Asia and the Americas. Our 
support for microfinance has three principal routes: bilateral 
projects, partnerships with non-governmental organizations NGOs, 
and contributions to multilateral organizations. As part of our 
institutional action plan, we will be developing an inventory of 
projects for each bilateral branch. These will be made available 
to all interested parties when completed. We are working closely 
with CGAP, a microfinance facility based at the World Bank on 
standard definitions, in order to ensure that donors' reporting 
is reliable and comparable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the longer term, the information renewal process currently 
under way in the agency will help us to get more timely and 
detailed pictures of the agency's activities in this and other 
areas. We recognize that our efforts to strengthen the overall 
quality of programming in microfinance requires that we have 
better information, where our resources are being spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CIDA also has been active in learning how to reach the poorest 
of the poor, understand their needs, and recognize and respect 
cultural, ethnic and religious diversity when designing and 
delivering services. While there are frequent claims that 
microfinance reaches the poorest, the evidence available goes 
both ways. Indeed, there are practitioners who believe that in 
some contexts, the poor may benefit from microfinance, but the 
poorest would be better off if they did not take on the debt 
represented by microcredit, and instead were reached by other 
interventions. Canada is chairing the CGAP Working Group on 
Poverty Yardsticks and Measurement Tools, which is seeking to 
refine our methods for having microfinance reach the poorest of 
the poor. Achieving this is a major challenge for the industry as 
a whole. Even if we can do so, it will not be the answer to all 
our problems. The roots of poverty are far too entrenched and 
complex to be overcome by any single development technique or 
strategy. The poor need access to many other things, and we need 
to recognize which interventions can be most catalytic for 
poverty reduction in given circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the issues raised in this question there is 
another vital point that must be added: While the amount of 
resources going to microcredit is important, the issue of 
quantity must not obscure the more important concerns surrounding 
quality. This more than any other point is the key shortcoming 
to just using numbers to represent achievements in programming. 
On this, there are two further issues that need to be mentioned: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) Absorptive capacity. Many microfinance practitioners feel 
that there is limited ability of microfinance institutions in the 
developing world to absorb significant quantities of new finance. 
Therefore, while the Microcredit Summit is to be commended for 
bringing attention to microcredit to a wider audience, it must be 
emphasized that we need to be cautious about pressuring our 
partners to expand their activities. We see that one key 
strategic role for CIDA in the field of microfinance is to 
strengthen viable institutions which already exist, helping them 
on the road to further success. Our second role is to fund 
innovative activities in the hopes that the lessons learned will 
contribute to advancing the frontiers of this field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) Best practices and industry standards. The microfinance 
industry has been focusing a great deal of attention in 
developing guidelines for both sustainability and outreach of 
microfinance institutions. CGAP, mentioned earlier, is a key 
mechanism for donor collaboration on best practices. Canada has 
played an active role on CGAP, whose primary goals are to 
strengthen the quality of programming in microfinance and to 
improve donor coordination. Most donors, including the World 
Bank, still need further efforts to bring their microfinance 
portfolios up to these standards. CIDA is actively pursuing this 
quality issue in our own programming.

and, second, to safeguard and strengthen a compassionate society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1994 we have followed a consistent and solid plan centred 
on a balanced approach.  In fact it is paying off today.  With

</I></B></P><P align=left>Health and education are issues that affect every Canadian in 
every region.  They reflect key national values.  It is proper 
that as our federal financial situation improves, our government 
has given first place to investing in these vital activities.  It 
is this type of investment that all Canadians can appreciate. 
This is the sort of support for federal-provincial partnership 
all Canadians should endorse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most significant part of today's legislation clearly is the 
measure to increase the cash floor of funding to the provinces 
under the Canada health and social transfer.  Bill C-28 increases 
this guaranteed amount of federal cash funding for health care, 
post-secondary education and social assistance and services.  It 
increases it from $11 billion to $12.5 billion a year through to 
the year 2002-03.  It starts applying this higher cash floor one 
year earlier than originally slated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This means that the provinces will receive an extra $7 billion 
in cold hard cash over six years.  This is cash the provinces did 
not budget for.  It is new money that the provinces can now 
include in their budgets and in their disbursements at the 
provincial level.  That is by far the largest new spending 
commitment we have made since first coming to office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to remember that the cash portion of the CHST is 
only part of the total value of our federal support for provinces 
in the areas of health, education and social assistance. When tax 
points are included, the total funding to provinces provided 
under the CHST will exceed $25 billion.  That will grow to over 
$28 billion in the years ahead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the CHST measure represents by far the most financially 
substantive measure in this legislation. There are also other 
parts of this wide ranging bill that should be highlighted again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A key theme of both our 1997 and 1998 budgets has been the 
critical importance to Canada's future and the future of 
Canadians themselves of enhancing skills and knowledge.  Bill 
C-28 represents an important step in our journey to success in a 
new millennium.  It follows through on our 1997 budget pledge to 
help and encourage Canadians to save for post-secondary education 
of their children. Under this legislation we are increasing the 
amount that Canadians can invest in a registered education 
savings plan from $2,000 to $4,000 a year for each student 
beneficiary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well Bill C-28 will allow someone who has contributed to an 
RESP but who then sees the intended student not go on to 
post-secondary education to transfer that income from the plan 
into an RRSP.  This will reduce the risk and the disincentive 
previously facing parents.  The problem was that the benefits of 
their RESP investment could be completely forfeited if their 
child chose not to pursue higher education.  With Bill C-28 that 
investment in an RESP will continue to provide real value for 
families even if the child does not go on to post-secondary 
learning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to remind the House that this legislation also 
takes important steps to encourage and support charitable giving 
by Canadians.  In a global economy marked by rapid change and 
sometimes disturbing dislocation, Canada's charitable sector is a 
critical partner in meeting the needs of Canadians, especially 
the disadvantaged and those at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government recognized the importance of giving charities the 
tools they need to accomplish their important work.  This 
commitment reflects not only a social obligation but also 
economic common sense.  Even though tax assistance for charitable 
giving entails a cost for governments, it is plainly a much lower 
cost than providing full support directly through public funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In each of the last three budgets the federal government has 
made it easier for Canadians to contribute to charities. 
These measures have been especially useful in encouraging 
donations from modest income donors for example by making a 
higher level of tax credit available for lower levels of giving. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1050"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT10"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT10"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1050

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our 1997 budget proposed and this legislation will enact further 
measures to help all charities attract donations from modest 
income donors, notably by levelling the playing field between the 
crown and other kinds of charities. Bill C-28 increases the 
amount of donations for which charitable credit can generally be 
claimed to 75% of net income from the previous 50% mark.  This 
75% limit will apply equally to all charities, eliminating the 
previous advantage enjoyed by donations to the crown and crown 
foundations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to increasing gifts from modest income Canadians, it 
is important, as the charitable sector itself has made clear, to 
encourage larger gifts of capital from individuals and 
corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since Canada already has generous provisions for donations in 
cash, the most promising way to encourage new giving is to 
provide more generous treatment for gifts of appreciated capital 
property.  This point is driven home by the fact that the U.S. 
tax system features significantly more generous incentives for 
gifts of capital assets than our own existing system.  The result 
appears to be a much higher level of giving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, this legislation also reduces the income inclusion 
rate on capital gains arising from certain donations, such as 
stock shares and bonds, from 75% to 37.5%.  This was an area 
where the existing law in Canada was much less generous than in 
the U.S.  Now with Bill C-28, Canadian charities will enjoy an 
equal footing with those in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both of these measures, those concerning the RESPs and 
charitable giving, touch on the tax system.  There are certainly 
further elements of this legislation that also address tax 
matters with the general goal of improving clarity and fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said at second reading, one of the foundations of a 
well-functioning economy is an effective, fair and transparent 
tax system, a system which allows companies and individuals to 
focus on the work of building and growing their companies or 
their personal endeavours through real value added, not through 
manipulation of the tax rules. This is why C-28 includes a range 
of technical tax measures which include the following. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation includes rules relating to transfer pricing, 
rules that will ensure when goods are transferred between 
elements of a single multinational corporation the pricing 
involved is based on the principle of arm's length dealing.  In 
other words, companies will not be able to avoid or manipulate 
taxes by setting a transfer price that is artificial or 
arbitrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also rules that restrict the transferability of 
business losses between affiliated persons, rules that apply when 
a corporation becomes or ceases to be exempt from income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation takes further action that stops bankrupt 
individuals from claiming a double deduction of personal tax 
credits, like the GST credit, in the year of bankruptcy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, this legislation includes a measure that ensures there 
will be no tax penalty for Canadians receiving disability 
benefits should the insurance company paying those benefits 
become insolvent, and an employer takes on the responsibility for 
those benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should again remind the House that these technical provisions 
of C-28 regarding taxation were certainly made public a long time 
ago through draft legislation and ways and means motions.  As a 
result, they have been closely scrutinized by private sector 
experts.  In fact some of the provisions respond directly to 
requests and suggestions from the private sector.  That is why I 
am confident these sections of Bill C-28 carry the support and 
acceptance of the sectors involved and deserve the same support 
from this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, let me just briefly return to the subject of the 
Canada health and social transfer, the part of this legislation 
that touches most broadly on the public interest.  It has been 
argued during the debate that Canada's provinces supposedly 
contributed an unfair share to the federal deficit reduction. 
The enrichment to the CHST has been described as only restoring 
some of the funds we had taken away to begin with. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1055"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT11"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT11"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1055
<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be clear.  Reductions were made in transfers to provinces 
under the CHST when it took effect for 1996-97 but the action was 
not unfair and it was very necessary.  The fact is that as we 
launched our deficit reduction strategy, a contribution from 
virtually all areas of federal spending was the only way to get 
Canada's financial house in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No objective observer can question what had to be done.  The 
hard truth is provincial transfers represent about 20% of all our 
federal program spending.  That is $1 out of every $5.  There was 
simply no way we could meet our deficit without those reductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had not taken the tough action that we did, February's 
budget could easily have forced us to deliver further cuts in 
public spending rather than the historic announcement of balanced 
books.  Because we did what had to be done when it had to be 
done, we have been able to help achieve the federal fiscal 
success that is beginning to pay real dividends, dividends of 
solid benefit to each province and all Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deficit cutting exercise was transparent.  It was done in 
consultation with Canadians and provincial governments.  We gave 
the provinces a full year's notice of our plans so they too had 
time to adjust their own priorities and programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is clear.  Through the hard work and shared 
commitment of a vast majority of Canadians, we have eliminated 
the deficit for the first time in more than a quarter century. We 
have put ourselves in a position where we can renew responsible 
realistic investments in key social areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are making those investments with a clear and considered 
philosophy. That philosophy is that it is only proper that our 
hard earned fiscal dividend goes to where it does the most good, 
helping the most Canadians.  Surely the Canada health and social 
transfer honours that criteria. Just as surely Bill C-28 deserves 
the support of each and every hon. member of this House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK50"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to address Bill C-28, a bill which Reformers stand 
in opposition to.  I will lay out a number of the reasons that we 
oppose this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill talks about taxes without talking about tax relief. In 
a country that has some of the highest taxes in the world, we 
need to have a bill that lowers our taxes.  This bill talks about 
taxes without talking about tax simplification.  As we approach 
the tax deadline, people preparing their taxes will come to 
understand how badly we need tax simplification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation leaves untouched clause 241, a clause we 
believe puts the finance minister in a conflict of interest 
position.  We will say more about that later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation imposes a new round of taxes on municipalities 
and therefore ultimately on consumers themselves.  We oppose it 
for that reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation does nothing to prepare us for the impact of 
the Asian tsunami that will soon occur as a result of the 
meltdown in Asian markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are concerned about this because it maintains the $6 billion 
in cuts to the Canada health and social transfer after the 
government specifically promised it would not cut transfers to 
the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill does nothing to lighten the load of ordinary Canadians 
who do so much to move the country forward yet get precious 
little in the form of any kind of award or acknowledgement from 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the various and sundry reasons we oppose this 
legislation.  I will speak to them in more detail shortly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw attention to the language that has come from the 
government over the past several days since the budget 
presentation, in particular how government members speak about 
some of the things that are occurring in Canada.  I hope we can 
uncover what is really going on. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1100"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT12"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT12"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1100
<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They speak of the Canada Health and Social Transfer, but we find 
out that they did not cut as much as they said they were going to 
cut.  They said they were going to cut $7.5 billion.  Now they 
are only cutting $6 billion.  They call that an increase.  When 
they only slow down the growth of the rise in taxes in this 
country they call that tax relief.  When they do not add to our 
already staggering high debt they call that debt reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to uncover and expose this because if these 
things are repeated often enough people may be deceived into 
believing that the country is moving forward in a meaningful way. 
We do not want to leave that false impression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, in the leaders' debate, the current Prime Minister 
promised the leader of the Reform Party that he would not cut 
transfers to the provinces, but he did.  He eviscerated health 
care and higher education in this country, cutting transfers by 
what amounts to about $6 billion.  It is the largest cut to 
health care in the history of the country.  I would argue that 
this government shut down more hospital beds than any provincial 
government in this country, probably more than all the provincial 
governments combined.  We need to draw attention to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friends across the way talk about the tax relief of $7 
billion that was introduced in the budget.  What they do not talk 
about are the huge increases in taxes that more than offset that 
$7 billion.  A taxpayer earning about $50,000 would be in the top 
10% in this country.  The top 10% of taxpayers pay almost 50% of 
the taxes.  People who earn $50,000 or more are in the top 10%. 
Accordingly, the taxpayer will save about $219 in 1999 because of 
the government's phase out of the 3% surtax.  However, the same 
taxpayer will pay an extra $330 in CPP premiums in 2000, for a 
net increase of $111.  That person's taxes will go up by $111. 
Let us not be deceived.  My friends across the way can talk all 
they want about tax relief, but it simply is not so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jeff Rubin, the chief economist for Wood Gundy said that “for 
all the Budget's gestures at tax cuts, Canadians' tax bill next 
year will be some $6 billion higher as a result of the cumulative 
impact of the last five Liberal budgets”.  Yet the minister 
continues to boast about reduced taxes.  It is outrageous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I will touch on the issue of debt reduction.  We have 
heard members of the House talk about the government's plan for 
debt reduction.  We oppose this on two separate grounds.  They 
say that the debt to GDP ratio will go down even if not one cent 
is put toward the debt.  In fact that is true, but what does debt 
to GDP ratio mean to an ordinary taxpaying Canadian?  It means 
virtually nothing.  The average family today pays $6,000 in taxes 
just to pay the interest on the debt.  Allowing the debt to 
diminish as a percentage of the size of the economy will not 
impact that at all.  They will still pay $6,000 a year in taxes 
just to pay the interest on the debt, so that does no good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My opponents across the way will say they have a contingency 
fund of $3 billion which they will use to pay down the debt.  Let 
us assume for a moment that the government does use the 
contingency fund to pay down the debt.  We have a debt in this 
country of $583.2 billion.  It would take 200 years to pay down 
the debt at that rate and that is only if they do use the 
contingency fund for that.  We have already seen in this year's 
budget that they blew the contingency fund on new spending. 
Therefore there is no guarantee that we will ever see that 
contingency fund used for something as important as paying down 
the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it important to pay down the debt? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1105"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT13"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT13"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1105

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will simply point out, first of all, that we pay in this 
country about $45 billion a year in interest payments toward 
servicing the debt.  That is by far the largest cheque that the 
finance minister writes every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, a big chunk of that $45 billion in interest 
payments goes to bankers from around the world.  It does not even 
stay in this country.  It goes to foreign debt holders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That cannot be good.  We oppose that.  We want to see more of 
that money remain in the country.  Let us start to pay down the 
debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think even more important right now is that when we have a 
debt which is this high we are extraordinarily vulnerable to not 
just international shocks, but also domestic ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day I had an analyst in my office from Wall Street. He 
came to Canada specifically because he goes to countries around 
the world to check out the financial situation and then he sells 
the information to people who invest, to brokerage houses and 
that sort of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This man informed me that he was extraordinarily concerned about 
Canada's current situation.  He pointed out that with a debt of 
$583 billion, with a current account deficit which will soon 
become a big deficit, and with a dollar that is very, very 
vulnerable, Canada is in a precarious position, especially with 
the pending Asian tsunami about to hit.  Those were his words 
“the Asian tsunami”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He left me with a document and I want to quote it.  This is the 
forecast that he is giving to his clients.  It reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week there was a batch of economic news from around the 
world highlighting that the Asian flu is impacting.  Because they 
are much closer to the core Pac Rim turmoil, we are watching 
Japanese and Australian news particularly closely for early clues 
as to what will eventually show up here, admittedly with less 
force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>1.  Due to the Asian crisis, Mitsubishi Motors tripled its 
forecasted loss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>2.  Due to collapsing exports to Asia, Australian business 
confidence plunged to a 2 year low. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>3.  Due to the Asian crisis, Mexico's pricing power is under 
pressure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>4.  Due to the Asian crisis, U.S. small business confidence has 
declined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>5.  Italy's exports have declined at a 21% annual rate over the 
past three months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>6.  China's production has declined at a 16% annual rate over 
the past three months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>7.  U.S. pricing power declined further— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on and, rather obviously, this country, as well as the 
world, is really not out of the woods.  When we have a debt that 
is second only to that of Italy in terms of its size, we are 
very, very vulnerable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We witnessed, when the Asian crisis first hit, a flight to 
quality.  Where did all the money go that was seeking a safe 
haven from the turmoil in the world?  It did not come to Canada. 
It went to the United States.  There is a very good reason for 
that.  The U.S. debt compared to GDP is about 40% less than ours 
and they are not as concerned about the situation in the U.S. 
That is a very good reason why Canada should start the process of 
paying down the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned at the outset there are a number of reasons why 
Reformers oppose Bill C-28. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk for a moment about something my friends in the 
Bloc are very interested in, an issue which they have pushed a 
lot, and that is, clause 241. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 241 essentially is a clause in this legislation, which 
was initially sponsored by the finance minister, that would allow 
changes in the structure of shipping companies that hold assets 
offshore, which potentially could allow somebody like the finance 
minister who owns assets offshore, to benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe this was done unintentionally.  I do not, for a 
moment, believe that the finance minister or finance department 
officials were trying to pull a fast one.  However, I believe 
that it raises questions and it should be addressed more 
seriously than the government has addressed it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even more important from my standpoint is that we have a finance 
minister who has been driven to shelter much of his income 
offshore because of the high level of taxes in this country. 
That is what is germane in this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not begrudge it for a moment.  I know my friends in the NDP 
were concerned about this matter the other day, but we would 
point out that it is perfectly legal, that everything the 
minister is doing is within the bounds of the law.  It is not a 
problem that way. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1110"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT14"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT14"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1110
<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we do think it sends a pretty important message about 
the kind of trouble this country is in when we have the finance 
minister of the country who has to shelter assets offshore 
because taxes in Canada are too high and, as I pointed out a 
minute ago, are going higher, the government's recent tax relief 
package notwithstanding.  It simply did not come anywhere near to 
making up for all the tax increases that the government has 
brought in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are in a situation where people who have money to invest 
are sheltering income offshore.  I think that really raises some 
important questions.  We need to ask ourselves why we have 
arrived at a point in this country where people who live in this 
country have to take their assets offshore to shield the interest 
income from the high taxes we have in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not just end with the finance minister.  As I pointed 
out to colleagues, we have a number of members in this House who 
have had family members flee the country as economic refugees 
because they not only cannot find jobs here but, even if they do 
find a job here, the taxes are so much higher than in a similar 
job in another country.  Many of us have seen friends go to the 
United States where it has taxes that are about one-third less 
than what we have in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again point to the Nesbitt Burns report which showed that we 
have all kinds of professionals coming into this country, but for 
as many professionals that we have coming in we probably have 
three or four times as many leaving, in part because of the high 
taxes.  I would say it is almost completely because of the high 
taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe high taxes impact the ability not only of people to be 
able to afford a lifestyle that they would like to have, but also 
high taxes leave less opportunity and less jobs.  Often people 
graduate from school and then end up having to leave Canada to go 
to another country where they can find work.  Therefore, we have 
all kinds of professionals fleeing Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any of us who are from a small town can testify personally to 
how many doctors we have seen leave the country to go to the 
United States in particular.  We see now in the Nesbitt Burns 
report that nurses are mentioned.  It also deals with teachers. I 
think that is a new trend.  I do not recall teachers having to 
leave the country before to find jobs and take advantage of the 
tax regime that the United States has.  However, this seems to be 
the new trend that is happening now according to the Nesbitt 
Burns report.  We also see it with engineers and computer 
scientists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not long ago I was talking to somebody who sits on the board of 
Waterloo University.  They spoke to me very frankly about the 
newspaper article concerning one-third of the graduating class at 
Waterloo University being sopped up by Microsoft and going off to 
Seattle because that was where the opportunity was.  This is a 
serious problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe the government has done anything in Bill C-28 
or in any other legislation to seriously address what has become 
an extraordinarily serious problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to talk about some of the smaller but very important 
provisions of Bill C-28.  One thing that galls me is that the 
government is proposing to introduce new taxes on municipally 
owned subsidiaries, particularly utilities.  We will have one 
level of government taxing another level of government, something 
that by tradition we do not do in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately, I point out to my friends across the way who trumpet 
their new found belief in tax relief, this is going to be a tax 
on ordinary consumers.  If people are barely making it today in 
their homes, wherever they live in the country, and they do not 
have anywhere to cut back, but all of a sudden they face an 
increase in their utility costs because this government is now 
going to start taxing those utilities, they have nowhere to take 
it from.  If they have to pay for their natural gas or 
electricity it means it can only come out of the food budget.  If 
someone is on a fixed income that is the only place it can come 
from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friends across the way, who have made a career and a history 
in this country of talking about their deep compassion for 
people, in effect are going to be punishing those people who are 
most vulnerable amongst us by imposing these new taxes on 
municipal utilities. 
There is a history behind this too.  I point out that in the 1995 
budget the government removed the PUITTA, the Public Utility 
Income Tax Transfer Act. It essentially provided a rebate to 
private utilities so they would be on a level playing field with 
public utilities.  The government removed it. It cost the 
Government of Alberta approximately $250 million, impacting 
Alberta the most.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Now to level the playing field in a perverse way, I guess, it 
has decided to start taxing publicly owned utilities.  That is 
ridiculous.  Why not just leave it the way it was?  The only 
reason for it obviously is to get more money out of taxpayer 
pockets.  It is another sneaky backdoor tax increase. I object to 
it.  I think it is wrong and I think this government has 
overstepped its bounds.  It has stepped into territory that 
previously has been almost sacred.  It has started to tax another 
level of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk for a moment about the reference in Bill C-28 to 
the government's alleged increase in transfers to the provinces. 
I will do that by referring first of all to a quote from the 1993 
election campaign.  It was actually the leaders debate and it 
occurred when the leader of the Reform Party asked the current 
Prime Minister a question: “What specifically is your commitment 
to the level of federal transfer payments for health care?  Would 
you keep them at the current level?”  The Prime Minister 
answered: “I said yesterday in replying to Mr. Bouchard that I 
promise they will not go down and I hope we will be able to 
increase them”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only did the Liberals not increase them, not only did they 
not maintain them, they cut them by initially $7.5 billion.  That 
is an absolute blatant breaking of a promise in the 1993 election 
campaign.  A scant two years later they were cutting the heart 
out of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friends argue that in Bill C-28 we are actually increasing 
transfers to the provinces for health care.  That is not so.  All 
they are doing is not cutting as much as they said they would. 
They are still breaking the promise of the 1993 election campaign 
by $6 billion. What has been the consequence of that?  For the 
first time I think in the history of the country we have seen 
Canadians' confidence shaken in their health care system like it 
has never been shaken before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen protests on the lawns of provincial legislatures. 
We have seen people threatening to strike, doctors leaving, 
nurses leaving.  We have seen waiting lists skyrocket. Dr. Judith 
Kazimirski, past president of the Canadian Medical Association, 
appeared before the finance committee, where I sit as a member, 
and told us about how waiting lists had become longer and longer 
for things like prostrate cancer and breast cancer. When you are 
sitting on a waiting list awaiting surgery for prostrate cancer 
and breast cancer, I can guarantee you those illnesses do not 
stop doing what they do, ravaging the bodies of their victims, 
simply because the government cannot find a way to get them 
surgery or get them treatment.  They continue to do their damage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has blatantly broken its promise and it should 
pay a price for that.  Please, I say to colleagues around the 
House and to people who are watching on television, do not accept 
for a moment that this government somehow cares about health 
care.  It is the architect of the great slashing that has gone 
on.  It is the Dr. Kavorkian of health care in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not accept for a moment what is asserted by colleagues 
across the way that Bill C-28 comes anywhere close to repairing 
the damage it has done to health care in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude simply by urging colleagues to consider that 
there are many priorities Canadians have today.  We are a country 
that has massive levels of debt, second only to Italy in the 
world for the debt we carry.  It is somewhere close to 100% if we 
include the levels of debt that the provinces have accumulated, 
100% of GDP.  It is a staggering amount of money.  As a result of 
that we have economic uncertainty.  We have countries not wanting 
to invest here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend from Peace River, the international trade critic for 
the Reform Party, pointed out the other day that Canada, for the 
first time ever, has had more money invested outside of the 
country than people have been investing in Canada. 
Canada is no longer the shining example, the great place to 
invest that it once was.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We point out that taxes in this country are just too high.  They 
are staggering.  Often in this place we have read letters into 
the record laying out the human tragedy of high taxes from people 
who cannot find any place from which to take money to pay the tax 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember reading a letter from a lady in Quesnel, Margaret 
Snell.  Her son wanted to play baseball and have swimming 
lessons. She could not find the money because CPP tax hikes were 
coming along.  This is a social tragedy.  I urge my friends to 
remember that while the government is bringing in legislation 
like this there are huge issues that need to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point to the staggering levels of unemployment.  I point to 
the dramatic jump in unemployment in British Columbia, a province 
which was first in growth not very long ago and has now fallen to 
10th.  While friends across in the Liberal Party were patting 
themselves on the back at the Liberal convention on the weekend 
talking about the wonderful job they have done with the economy 
they forgot about British Columbia which is suffering 
unbelievably these days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somehow, even though several cabinet ministers are from British 
Columbia, British Columbia is completely ignored and the very 
legitimate concerns of the people of British Columbia never do 
get addressed by the government even though members in the Reform 
Party raise them over and over again.  We raised the issue of the 
fishery, for instance.  It is just never dealt with.  We see 
Americans vacuuming the sea.  Again, the government does not deal 
with it.  When it could be dealing with issues like that we see 
legislation like this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of reasons why we oppose this legislation.  I 
encourage members around the House to search their hearts and ask 
themselves if there is not a better approach to dealing with the 
problems of the country, an approach that would secure 
opportunity for Canadians by lowering taxes, by paying down debt, 
by providing essential services for people through government 
without building up a big government again.  We do not need that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage friends to consider the message I have given today. 
I speak on behalf of many Canadians. I urge them to consider it 
and in doing so I hope they will be convinced they should not 
support Bill C-28.

<P><A NAME="LINK51"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to address Bill C-28 at third reading. This is a 464-page 
omnibus bill which includes various measures to implement the 
recent budget tabled by the Minister of Finance, along with some 
tax changes that were announced a few years ago, but died on the 
<I>Order Paper</I> before the federal election. This is why these 
provisions are included in the omnibus bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 23, the Minister of Finance had Bill C-28, of which 
he is the sponsor, introduced in the House of Commons. In 
addition to various amendments to our tax legislation, including 
the Income Tax Act as it applies to corporations and individuals, 
and to certain measures relating to the minister's recent budget, 
the bill includes about 14 lines, two small paragraphs, hidden 
somewhere in these 464 pages, that deal exclusively with 
international shipping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we all know, and as government members have told us again and 
again, the Minister of Finance is also a shipowner. He owns a 
fleet of ships abroad, and he is active in the international 
shipping sector. The minister owns a shipping holding company. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1125"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT17"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT17"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1125

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>His holding corporation owns shares in companies that are 
actively involved in international shipping and that are based in 
Bermuda, Liberia and Barbados, among other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These 14 lines in Bill C-28—which, again, is 464 pages long—are 
found in clause 241—formerly section 250 of the Income Tax Act 
and dealing with the tax provisions applying to international 
shipping companies—and seek to expand the scope of these 
provisions to corporations that are related to shipping holding 
companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clause provides that, subject to certain conditions and 
structures, these international shipping companies will get 
preferential treatment from Revenue Canada. 
They will be sheltered from paying any taxes on profits, and now 
from any taxes on dividends received by the holding companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at these 14 lines, the first thing that comes to 
mind—I repeat this for the benefit of those listening—is how can a 
finance minister, who is also a shipowner in the international 
shipping sector, sponsor a bill that could affect his personal 
interests?  That is the first question that springs to mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is he allowed to do that?  Did the Minister of Finance act within 
his authority, in compliance with the government's code of 
ethics, introduced by the Prime Minister himself and passed in 
June 1994? 
Did he act within his authority in introducing a bill, clause 
241 of which proposes tax changes that could be advantageous for 
his offshore shipping companies in Bermuda, Liberia and Barbados? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Answering the first question—because there will be a second—could 
hardly be easier:  we will take a copy of the document called 
“Conflict of Interest and Post-Employment Code for Public Office 
Holders”.  We will look at the provisions concerning the 
principles that should guide ministers, senior officials, and 
chairs of commissions and public and parapublic corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will take them one by one and try to see whether, in this 
case, the case of a bill containing these 14 lines, two little 
paragraphs about international shipping tucked away in a 464-page 
bill, the Minister of Finance did the right thing in sponsoring 
this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On page 2 of the ministerial code of ethics, we read the 
following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every public office holder shall conform to the following 
principles: 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is followed by various headings.  The first one is “Ethical 
Standards”. The passage in question reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(1) Public office holders shall act with honesty and uphold the 
highest ethical standards so that public confidence and trust in 
the integrity, objectivity and impartiality of government are 
conserved and enhanced. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like, if I may, to take a look at this first principle, 
which is very important.  How, from the point of view of the 
government's integrity, objectivity and impartiality, are we to 
interpret the fact that, although we have been asking the 
government for a month and a half now to strike a special 
committee to look at the scope of clause 241 and the process 
whereby it was included in Bill C-28, the government has not 
explained the finance minister's apparent conflict of interest? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the government refuse to reveal all each time we 
requested it to? At first, we were alone, but then we received 
the support of the Progressive Conservative Party, the Reform 
Party and the NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With it systematically refusing to shed any light on this matter, 
how can we consider the government honest, objective and 
impartial with nothing to hide?  It is already walking all over 
the first principle of the code of ethics. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1130"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT18"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT18"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1130
<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second principle involves public scrutiny.  It provides that 
“Public office holders”—in this case the Minister of Finance—have 
an obligation to perform their official duties and arrange their 
private affairs in a manner that will bear the closest public 
scrutiny, an obligation that is not fully discharged by simply 
acting within the law”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the minister sponsoring a bill that could apply to his 
private companies, how can we be expected to consider his action 
so far beyond reproach as to bear the closest public scrutiny 
when we know that this concerns only international shipping 
companies? 
It does not concern engineering firms, for example.  It does not 
apply to oil exploration companies and it does not apply to just 
any economic sector.  It applies only to the international 
shipping sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only that, but clause 241 applies particularly to the 
holdings of shipping companies operating abroad.  The Minister 
of Finance has a holding of shipping companies operating abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This second principle of the code of ethics talks of “bearing the 
closest public scrutiny”.  This does not.  The government's claim 
that this clause is not a tax amendment made to measure for the 
Minister of Finance does not bear the closest public scrutiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third basic principle in the code of ethics concerns private 
interests. 
It states as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public office holders shall not have private interests, other 
than those permitted pursuant to this Code, that would be 
affected particularly or significantly by government actions in 
which they participate. 
</UL>
<Those in which he participates as Minister of Finance, 
therefore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An examination of clause 241 of the bill sponsored by the 
Minister of Finance indicates that this principle of the 
conflict of interest code is being ridden roughshod over.  The 
Minister of Finance is a legislator and therefore has definite 
influence over legislation concerning international shipping, the 
area in which he is involved.   He can influence government 
activities for the benefit of his shipping companies, and this is 
what he has done with clause 241 of Bill C-28. 
Clause 241 will impact upon the financial performance of his 
companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This principle, adopted in June 1994 as part of the government's 
conflict of interest guidelines, has already gone by the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final principle is public interest. It states the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On appointment to office, and thereafter, public office holders 
shall arrange their private affairs in a manner that will prevent 
real, potential or apparent conflicts of interest from 
arising—the conflict shall be resolved in favour of the public 
interest. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only do we believe that there is, at the very least, an 
apparent conflict of interest, which is serious according to the 
code, because it speaks not only of real or potential conflict 
of interest, but also of apparent conflict of interest.  We are 
not the only ones to believe there is, at the very least, an 
apparent conflict of interest. 
Even the person responsible for ethics, Mr. Wilson, the 
governmental ethics adviser, ministerial even, one might say 
because, in our opinion, his evaluations are somewhat biased—he 
is paid by the people he has to defend—has appeared before the 
finance committee, has even prepared and submitted a report, and 
admits there could be an apparent conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has said that, had he been consulted as ethics adviser, the 
bill would have been introduced differently than it was by the 
Minister of Finance.  The Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime 
Minister, the Minister of Finance, all the government members, 
have told us “Go consult Mr. Wilson, and he will tell you there 
is no problem”.  Yet even Mr. Wilson says “There was, at the very 
least, an apparent conflict of interest.  The process was flawed 
and things ought not to have been done that way”.  This has 
happened more than once, moreover. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister boasted that he had seen nothing two years 
ago. 
Sometimes the Prime Minister is really funny.  He sometimes has 
a really funny way of reasoning.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two years ago, a bill was introduced, which contained a 
provision similar to clause 241, but it eventually died on the 
<I>Order Paper</I> when the election was called. We did not notice it at 
the time, probably because nobody felt like reading through the 
464 pages of an omnibus bill, but the second time around, we did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister bragged about it on two separate occasions. 
First, he said there was no ambiguity because the bill was 
introduced by the Minister of Finance himself. Not only did he 
sponsor it, he introduced it. And, again the other day, the Prime 
Minister said they had done the same thing two years ago and “the 
opposition did not even notice it”. Great philosophy, great moral 
and political ethics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, coming back to the ethics counsellor, in his evidence before 
the Standing Committee on Finance, Mr. Wilson told us there was 
indeed an apparent conflict of interest. What happens when four 
out of the five principles supposed to govern the Conflict of 
Interest and Post-Employment Code for Public Office Holders are 
trampled on as I have just demonstrated? One must refer to page 
16 of the code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does it say on page 16? It states that “Where a public 
office holder does not comply with Part II, the office holder is 
subject to such appropriate measures as may be determined by the 
Prime Minister, including, where applicable, discharge or 
termination of appointment”. None of this has ever happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not asking for the minister's resignation, at least not 
yet. But we are running out of patience. It is really hard to 
hold back. 
The government's refusal to shed light on these very important 
questions and the Prime Minister's hypocritical suggestion in the 
House that we should seek an answer from the Standing Committee 
on Finance, where we are being gagged, are starting to get to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking the government to shed light on this matter. We 
have just demonstrated, by quoting directly from the code of 
conduct without any interpretation, that four out of five 
principles have been trampled by the finance minister's 
sponsoring of Bill C-28 and that clause 241 might give an unfair 
advantage to the shipping companies he owns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Howard Wilson has recognized, at least once in writing, that 
there was a problem, an apparent conflict of interest. He may not 
have said it again, but as we have seen in the past, he is more 
of an elastic counsellor than an ethics counsellor. 
He gives a very broad and very flexible interpretation of the 
code of ethics when his boss, the Prime Minister, asks him to 
save the neck of one of his ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are precedents.  We found a few.  There are precedents 
where a public office holder, a finance minister or other public 
office holder, was forced to resign over a lesser matter than 
this, over situations that were less obvious and less worrisome 
from a conflict of interest point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1985, a case was raised by the Prime Minister, then the member 
for Shawinigan, who was then in opposition.  He asked the Prime 
Minister of the day, Mr. Mulroney, for the head of the Minister 
of Finance, Michael Wilson, who he said was in conflict of 
interest, one of his brothers-in-law having been awarded a 
$240,000 contract, something that was ultimately never proved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He cited the example of an Ontario finance minister who, in the 
1980s, had resigned immediately after revelations that he had 
allegedly relaxed the normal rules in granting a permit for a 
company owned by his family.  And the minister had never seen 
this permit.  He had never had anything to do with granting this 
permit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, as this finance minister, Darcy McKeough, had 
recognized, a finance minister's performance is subject to 
criteria of very high integrity—not just integrity, but very high 
integrity—because of the nature of his duties.  He had therefore 
preferred to hand in his resignation immediately to avoid any 
further doubts about his government's and his own integrity. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1140"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT20"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT20"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1140

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will describe the case again. It was something very simple and 
not serious in itself. A company owned by an Ontario Minister of 
Finance was issued a permit.  The minister had never seen the 
file, nor was he the one to sign the permit.  The Minister, not 
wishing to place anyone in his government in an awkward 
position, and not wishing any doubt to be cast on his integrity, 
immediately resigned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a more recent case, this time in defence. 
Everyone will recall that the Minister of Defence was obliged to 
step down in March 1996, not because he was a bad 
minister—although at the time we felt he was and we were calling 
for his head—but because he had written to the Immigration and 
Refugee Board— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Hearing the truth gets them riled up over 
there, but I will continue to tell the truth.  I am too attached 
to my principles.  It is their own business on the other side if 
they want to say any old thing, but I am going to tell the truth, 
whether they like it or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, the former Minister of Defence wrote the chair of the 
Immigration and Refugee Board to get an immigration case 
fast-tracked. 
The case involved a Canadian citizen who was very ill and wanted 
her husband to be allowed to come here to look after her. 
Because of that, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a humanitarian cause, the Minister of Defence of the time 
wrote in his capacity as an MP to the chair of the Immigration 
and Refugee Board in order to get the case of the unfortunate 
sick lady who wanted her husband here to take care of her speeded 
up. Because this action by an MP, especially by a government MP, 
that is trying to influence the decision of a quasi-judicial 
board, is unacceptable from an ethical standpoint, the Minister 
of Defence of the time resigned. And this was over a humanitarian 
case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we see all that and then we see the scope of the action 
taken by the Minister of Finance in creating for himself clause 
241, which favours his offshore shipping companies, which 
favours his shipping holding companies and protects them from all 
claims by Revenue Canada, we say to ourselves “How come there is 
a double standard?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that, when the Prime Minister was in opposition, he 
cited a case that was far less serious than this one, and now 
there are no more problems?  How could he accept the resignation 
of his Minister of National Defence in 1996 for having behaved in 
a humanitarian case contrary to the code of ethics?  He would not 
consider any other course of action than to accept the 
resignation of the minister of defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the Prime Minister now, in the more serious case before 
us, considering it reasonable for a Minister of Finance to table 
a bill with 14 lines hidden in 464 pages that could give an 
advantage to his shipping companies and that do favour offshore 
shipping companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There seems to be a bit of a problem.  In fact it is a big 
problem when the government refuses to come clean and orders the 
chair of the Standing Committee on Finance to reject all 
requests for witnesses, specialists and ethics counsellors, other 
than the one paid by the government, who, in passing, is more of 
an elastic counsellor than an ethics counsellor, in our opinion. 
The problem is twofold and that becomes serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second issue arose throughout all this, which was refuted, but 
not argued, by the Minister of Finance when he sputtered out the 
first day the Bloc Quebecois mentioned this rather interesting 
discovery about the provisions of clause 241.  They objected 
that “The Minister of Finance's shipping companies will not 
benefit from the new provisions”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, three versions were given.  In the first, the Minister 
of Finance said his companies would not be affected because they 
were Canadian.  We wondered why he used that argument and 
why—with the code of ethics, he had no business discussing this 
bill or sponsoring it either, and then he goes before the cameras 
and says that he will analyze it. 
Already, the minister was violating the government's code of 
ethics. He was saying that it was a Canadian corporation, that we 
were totally mistaken, etc.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The vice-president of Canada Steamship Lines—the shipping company 
owned by the Minister of Finance—said “Maybe they apply to us, 
but we will not use these provisions. We do not intend to use 
these new clauses”. The mere fact they were saying they did not 
intend to use the provisions implied that they had the right to 
use them and that these provisions could apply to the Minister of 
Finance's shipping corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within a day, there was a reversal, a new version was different. 
And that was just the next day. 
First, the Minister of Finance said “These provisions do not 
apply to us, you do not get it at all”. Then the vice-president of 
Canada Steamship Lines said “We do not intend to use these 
provisions”, thus implying that the minister's companies could do 
so and that those provisions did indeed apply to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third version was given to us by Len Farber. It was in reply 
to the second question which was “Could the minister benefit from 
the provisions that he is getting passed in the House, yes or 
no?” Len Farber appeared before the Standing Committee on 
Finance. At the finance minister's invitation, I met with Mr. 
Farber in my office the day after our revelations. Far from 
convincing us, Mr. Farber gave us more reasons to believe that 
there was indeed a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met with Mr. Farber in my office, and then he appeared at a 
finance committee meeting, which was a public meeting, a few 
days later. We asked him questions, we showed him a corporate 
organization chart and we told him “Look, we have companies with 
offices in Montreal, for example, with subsidiaries in various 
places that are actively involved in international shipping, that 
also have holdings, that own shares in shipping corporations 
directly involved in international shipping. Could the provisions 
of clause 241 of Bill C-28 apply to such corporations?” Mr. Farber 
did not say yes right away. He is a friend of the Minister of 
Finance and he is his principal adviser. It was the minister 
himself who had told us “Go talk to Farber, he will tell you what 
is going on. You do not understand anything”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We realized that we understood everything. That was a good start. 
In the end, to the questions asked by the Bloc Quebecois, Mr. 
Farber simply responded that, yes, it could apply to businesses 
like those owned by the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the outset, it was illogical to have an arrangement like 
clause 241 to attract foreign shipowners operating abroad in 
international shipping to open up offices in Canada, to offer 
them tax benefits, to provide them with tax savings, while our 
own Canadian companies operating elsewhere in competition with 
these foreign companies coming to set up operations in Canada 
cannot take advantage of the same arrangements.  This is not 
logical. 
It takes a really twisted logic to tell us that these clauses 
did not apply to foreign companies operating in international 
shipping, but only to foreign companies which we wanted to 
attract into Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there are tax advantages to attract foreign shipbuilders, 
there must also be tax advantages to keep our shipbuilders here 
in Canada.  Logic must come before anything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we questioned Mr. Farber, logic won out. He indicated to us 
that, yes indeed, it would be possible, it would be necessary  to 
look at the structure of Canadian businesses, where the decisions 
are made and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other part of the response came to us two days later.  We 
were not expecting additional arguments for our thesis from the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance, the hon. 
member for Stoney Creek. 
I will quote the hon. member for Stoney Creek if I may. He might 
gain something from listening to me this morning.  With some of 
his revelations, he is adding to our arguments rather than 
defending his minister.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 23, two days ago, the member for Stoney Creek said as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Around 1990 some foreign shippers, especially in Asia, wanted to 
open offices in Canada that would create jobs and economic 
activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These foreign shippers were concerned that the 1920s tax rule—we 
are talking about a tax saving for these companies—was not clear 
enough. To benefit from the rule a foreign shipper had to be a 
non-resident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Asian companies were concerned that if they opened Canadian 
offices they would fall under this definition and be found to be 
resident in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The clarifying rule was enacted in 1991. It gives foreign 
shipping companies the assurances that they are not resident in 
Canada provided their principal business is international 
shipping and that is where substantially all their revenue comes 
from. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is talking about the old 1991 provision.  What clause 241 does 
is not just exempt international shipping companies from taxes, 
but it also exempts international shipping companies holding 
shares in offshore shipping companies from paying taxes on 
dividends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If everything the parliamentary secretary told us on March 23 is 
true, why would it not be true in the case of Canada Steamship 
Lines and Passage Holdings, the blind trust for the Minister of 
Finance's companies? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are told that, in 1994, the Minister of Finance put all his 
assets in a blind trust. 
The company now managing these assets is Canada Trust, based in 
Montreal.  Canada Trust—as for any offshore shipping company that 
has just opened offices here—contributes to the economy, creates 
jobs, and so on.  Canada Trust manages shipping and holding 
companies owned by the Minister of Finance, including Canada 
Steamship Lines here in Canada and offshore holding companies in 
Liberia, Bermuda, Barbados, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What difference is there between the example given by the member 
for Stoney Creek, parliamentary secretary to the finance 
minister, and the situation of the finance minister's companies? 
There is none.  Both have an office in Canada, operate in 
international shipping, have offshore holding companies, and 
enjoy tax exemptions.  Now, their holding companies are going to 
enjoy exactly the same advantages because of clause 241. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary gave us a description of foreign 
businesses to attract here.  The foreign businesses wanting to 
start up initially in Vancouver, for example, are exactly the 
same and have the same structure as the businesses and holdings 
of the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a problem with these provisions, with the process 
surrounding the introduction of the bill and with clause 241. 
There is definitely the appearance of a conflict of interest and 
I would even go so far as to say there is a real conflict of 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The attitude of the government adds to our doubts about its 
integrity and that of the Minister of Finance.  The recent 
responses by the Prime Minister are very demagogic in this 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked him a question a couple of weeks ago about his intention 
to respond to the four opposition parties and requested he 
establish a special committee of inquiry on the Minister of 
Finance, on clause 241, on the appearance of a conflict of 
interest and on the entire process leading to the introduction of 
a bill.  He answered saying, and I quote to be sure I have it 
right: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member attends sittings of the Standing Committee on 
Finance. I suggest he uses that venue to ask whatever questions 
he may have. 
</UL>
<And by the hon. member, he meant me, the member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can ask questions, but anyone with a modicum of intelligence 
needs someone to ask question to, someone to answer them.  We can 
ask all the questions we like, but if there is no one to answer 
them we look rather stupid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what is happening in the finance committee.  The bill was 
introduced on February 23.  A few days later, as the 
representative of the Bloc, I personally tabled four motions 
with the finance committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first motion called for the government ethics counsellor to 
appear before the Standing Committee on Finance.  The Liberal 
majority supported this motion as did the opposition parties. 
But when I asked that the Minister of Finance appear before the 
Standing Committee on Finance to provide explanations, it did not 
work. The Liberal majority systematically refused and voted 
against my motion. I got the support of the Progressive 
Conservative Party, the Reform Party and the New Democratic 
Party, but I did not get the support of the Liberal majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result was the same when I tabled my third motion, asking 
that the committee invite members of the board of Canada 
Steamship Lines, which has been wholly owned by the Minister of 
Finance since 1988. The Liberal majority voted against the 
motion. Liberal members were under so much pressure from the 
Prime Minister's office that if they could have voted three times 
against the motion, they would have done so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I tabled the other motion, in which I asked that the 
directors of Passage Holdings Inc.—that is the directors of 
Canada Trust—appear before the Standing Committee on Finance, 
even behind closed doors, it was the same thing. The Liberal 
majority said “No way, we do not want to have witnesses shed 
light on this bill”. But I did get the support of the three 
opposition parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to test the democratic sense of the Liberal majority 
and their desire to shed light on such an apparent conflict of 
interest, I even tabled a general motion asking that the Standing 
Committee on Finance invite any witness who could shed light on 
Bill C-28 and on clause 241. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was not asking for specific individuals, but for any witness. 
It could have been a senior official from Revenue Canada, from 
the Department of Finance, or someone from outside the public 
service. 
We voted against it. I had the support of the three other 
opposition parties, but the government members decided no 
witnesses would be heard in an attempt to shed light on Bill C-28 
and clause 241. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Prime Minister stands up in the House and says “The 
hon. member sometimes attends sittings of the Standing Committee 
on Finance. I suggest he uses that venue to ask whatever 
questions he may have”, he is laughing at us. He is laughing at 
the people. The fact of the matter is that he does not want 
witnesses to be called. He does not want to get to the bottom of 
this apparent or real conflict of interest involving his finance 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has the nerve to stand up in the House and tell us to go and 
ask any question we may have to the finance committee. But they 
do not want us to call any witnesses to answer our questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not all. We—and by “we” I mean the Bloc Quebecois, the 
Progressive Conservative Party, the Reform Party and the New 
Democratic Party—have sent the chair of the finance committee a 
joint letter asking that a special committee be struck. This 
letter was sent more than a month ago, with certified copies to 
the Prime Minister, the Minister of Finance, the Deputy Prime 
Minister and everyone who is anyone in government. We are still 
waiting for an answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A week and a half ago, I sent another letter to the Prime 
Minister, a letter directly addressed to him, asking that, as 
suggested by him on February 19, a special committee or a 
subcommittee of the finance committee be put in charge of 
shedding light on this matter of conflict or apparent conflict of 
interest involving the Minister of Finance, and that all the 
witnesses who could help clarify the matter be called. I am still 
waiting for an answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To me, it is pure hypocrisy to take such an approach, to object 
to our getting to the bottom of what I consider to be a very 
serious matter, which puts into question the finance minister's 
integrity and that of the Prime Minister as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many aspects remain to be clarified in this whole matter. All 
sorts of contradictory statements were made after the Bloc 
Quebecois revealed the existence of a certain 14-line provision of 
Bill C-28 concerning international shipping companies, including 
the one owned by the Minister of Finance. Many conflicting 
statements were made by various people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has also been much confusion in the reactions of government 
representatives.  One thing is certain, and that is that we are 
not satisfied with the answers we have been given as to the 
process, content and real impact of clause 241 because they are 
completely illogical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance and the government have friends all over 
the place, and the government awards contracts to companies of 
tax experts.  Has anyone heard a tax expert from outside the 
government—not Len Farber, the finance minister's hatchet man, 
but an outside expert—say that there is no real or potential 
problem with clause 241, which amends section 250 of the Income 
Tax Act regarding international shipping? 
Has anyone heard a single tax expert express such an opinion 
since this saga first started? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been talking about it since February 23.  Not a single 
tax expert has dared to put his credibility on the line publicly 
and say that the Minister of Finance was not in apparent or 
outright conflict of interest and that the structure of his 
companies was not such as to provide him with undue advantages 
or tax savings related to clause 241.  Not one.  This creates 
even more doubts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was waiting to raise this point, but when the Prime Minister 
himself or the Deputy Prime Minister jump to the defence of the 
Minister of Finance, a well known member of the government, on a 
particular matter, it seems to me we might have expected a tax 
expert somewhere, a friend of the Liberal Party, to come forward 
and state publicly that there is no problem.  Why has this not 
happened? 
Because there is indeed a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And it is not the only problem.  This bill does not just apply to 
international shipping.  The Minister of Finance has managed to 
alienate many people in other sectors of activity who would like 
to be in the same boat as he is, but who are unable to take 
advantage of the tax savings available to him for his own 
companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, I would like to move the following 
amendment at third reading, seconded by my colleague, the member 
for Châteauguay.  I move: 
<A NAME="LINK52">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That 
the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the 
word “That” and substituting the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Bill C-28, Income Tax Amendments Act 1997, 
be not now read a third time 
but be referred back to the Standing Committee on Finance 
for the purpose of reconsidering Clause 241.” 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Prime Minister asks his members to vote against this 
amendment, he will be contradicting himself, because he told us 
in the House that the Standing Committee on Finance would be able 
to shed light on the issue and answer our questions.  That is 
what he told us.  His handling of this amendment will tell us 
what kind of Prime Minister he is and whether he is as full of 
integrity as he claims to be. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am very happy to have the opportunity today to speak on behalf of 
the NDP on third reading of Bill C-28.  I will first comment on 
the format of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am the NDP member on the human resources development 
committee. 
I recall that at one of the first meetings of the committee, a 
government representative attended and told us about the various 
provisions available on websites and government publications that 
were designed to make government more understandable to people. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1205"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT25"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT25"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1205

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly as a new member of the House trying to wade through 
various bills and motions and understand the complexity of the 
issues before us, I certainly concurred with the government 
representative.  I saw it as a positive step that the various 
government departments were interested and intent on trying to 
make government more understandable to ordinary Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then along comes Bill C-28.  Looking at the volume of this bill, 
more than 400 pages to be precise, there is no question that this 
bill and how it has been drafted takes us in exactly the opposite 
direction to what the government states is its goal in terms of 
making legislation more understandable to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In actual fact, Bill C-28 is very technical legislation.  It 
deals with income tax measures from the February 1997 budget and 
many technical amendments to a whole variety of acts, including 
the Income Tax Act as originally outlined in Bill C-69. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This needs to be said before we get into the substance of the 
bill.  It has already been debated by some members that because 
of the format in which this bill came forward, its complexity and 
the technicalities it contains, it is ridiculous to expect that 
Parliament would deal with such a complex bill. I would suggest 
that the language in the bill and the way it is presented would 
be incomprehensible even to the most highly paid tax experts. 
They would certainly have difficulty in deciphering this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is simply anti-democratic because of its format and its 
language, but most important because of its content. It is wrong 
for a government to present legislation that is steeped in such 
isolating language and expect not only parliamentarians but 
ordinary Canadians to understand and to be informed about what 
the government is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to make that comment at the beginning because as a new 
member of the House it is something I am interested in.  It was 
curious to me that we have been told efforts are being made to 
make the language more understandable but this bill certainly 
takes us in a different direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to focus some of my comments on Bill C-28 in terms 
of what it proposes or purports to do in increasing the Canada 
health and social transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-28 we are told that the Canada health and social 
transfer will be “increased” from $11 billion to $12.5 billion. 
This is not something new. In fact we heard the announcement not 
only by government members during the federal election campaign 
in May 1997 but also in the budget which came before the House 
for the next fiscal year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very interesting that we are told repeatedly that 
Canadians can expect to see an increase in the Canada health and 
social transfer. The government is putting forward the message in 
that way, that it is an increase. The reality is that this is not 
an increase at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is simply the government making a decision because of 
enormous public pressure from opposition parties, from provincial 
governments and most of all from Canadians who have told the 
government that they are suffering from the impact of massive 
cutbacks in the Canada health and social transfer. What has the 
government decided to do?  Rather than provide an increase, it 
simply is not continuing with another round of cuts that it had 
previously announced. That in reality is what the so-called 
increase to the Canada health and social transfer is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is regrettable there are not any government members present 
in the House today to hear that because this is something which 
sorely touches every Canadian.  We can look at the polls. 
Concerns have been expressed about the cutbacks in health care, 
in social services, in social assistance and in education. 
It is a very critical point to look at the main mechanism by 
which the federal government uses revenues from Canadian 
taxpayers and transfers them to provinces to build and create 
social programs in our country.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the NDP find it shocking and outrageous that the 
government would put forward this bill and include in it a 
supposed increase in the Canada health and social transfer when 
in actual fact it is not an increase at all. Indeed cash 
transfers to the provinces for health care, education and social 
assistance have not increased by one penny. That is the reality 
of what has happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to continue on this point and refer to some 
material that has been prepared by the National Anti-Poverty 
Organization, NAPO.  This group has done extensive research to 
assess and analyse the impact of the devastating cuts in the 
Canada health and social transfer, particularly on low income 
Canadians. This is very important, valuable work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On one side of the House we hear from government members that we 
should not worry about what is going on, that in fact they are 
there to defend the interests of poor Canadians, that they are 
there to defend the interests of poor children.  I can say that 
this organization, an independent anti-poverty advocacy 
organization, comes to a very different conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The organization released a report entitled “Government 
Expenditure Cuts to Health Care and Post-Secondary Education: 
Impacts on Low Income Canadians”.  That report documents that 
cuts in government funding of social programs have not only led 
to increasing inequality in money income, but rapidly growing 
inequities in access to both health care and post-secondary 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is pointed out in the report that federal cash transfers to 
the provinces under the Canada health and social transfer for 
health care, post-secondary education and social assistance were 
cut.  Here again is where we hear the real story.  Not an 
increase as the government is telling us, but a cut from $18.2 
billion to $12.5 billion over the past two fiscal years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is very interesting about the report is it goes on to 
analyse what this means in real per capita terms, that is taking 
into account the effects of population growth and inflation.  If 
we look at it from that point of view, then the federal cash 
transfers for social programs fell by more than 40% between 1993 
and 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Initially this came about as a result of the freeze on spending 
under the Canada assistance plan and the established programs 
financing. Of course since 1996 that cut of more than 40% has 
come about because of the deep cuts that have been made to the 
Canada health and social transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what has actually happened in this country.  It is not 
what government members have told us and certainly is not what is 
contained in Bill C-28. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that we consider the real impact and 
consequences of these cuts.  It has meant in Canada that there is 
growing inequality and there is increasing poverty. Since 1989 
the tragic situation in Canada is that 538,000 more children now 
live in poverty.  To read those statistics does not give a real 
sense of the tragedy involved in terms of young Canadians, poor 
Canadians and poor families. These people historically have 
relied upon federal programs, on the co-operation between federal 
and provincial governments on transfer payments, for example for 
social welfare.  These things traditionally have had great 
meaning and value particularly for poor and low income Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that we are witnessing the deep cuts in the Canada health 
and social transfer, we can see that poverty in this country has 
actually grown.  Indeed the number of low income persons in 1996 
was 40% higher than it was in 1989. 
In 1996 is when the Canada health and social transfer began to kick 
in. These are real statistics and something that cannot be denied 
by the government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other consequence that is very evident to local communities 
is high unemployment that has resulted from the massive cutbacks 
by the federal government.  Again, this bill before us today, 
Bill C-28, will do absolutely nothing to reverse that, nor will 
the recent federal budget that came before this House.  The 
reality is there is very high continuing unemployment in Canada 
that is simply a national tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those of us in the NDP believe that it is the first priority of 
the federal government to attack and deal with this issue of high 
unemployment and to bring in real programs and targets to reduce 
unemployment. We have heard a lot from the finance minister about 
his targets to cut the deficit.  But where have the targets been 
to reduce unemployment?  Where have the targets been to reduce 
poverty in this country?  They simply do not exist.  I think that 
is a crying shame and the government should be ashamed of its 
record on that score. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Vancouver East, probably the lowest income urban 
community in Canada, which includes the downtown east side, the 
impact of these policies and the impact of the measures that are 
contained in Bill C-28 is very visible already.  In looking 
through this bill I had to ask myself is there anything in this 
bill that would improve the lives of people in my riding, in 
particular unemployed people and single parents who are 
struggling below the poverty line, who cannot find access to 
child care, who cannot find adequate housing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having looked at Bill C-28 and trying to make sense even of what 
it contains because the language is so difficult to deal with I 
and others in my party have come to the conclusion that there is 
nothing in this bill that will improve the lives of ordinary 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will it improve housing or are there any tax measures that will 
improve the situation for low income Canadians to find affordable 
housing which is a very basic human need, the provision and 
security of shelter?  There is nothing that will deal with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will this bill improve access to health care?  Regrettably the 
answer to that question as well is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently in my riding I organized a number of round table 
discussions with young people.  Some of them were street people. 
Some of them were service providers working with young people who 
are unemployed and having difficulty finding work or having 
difficulty accessing post-secondary education.  These round table 
discussions were very informative for me as the local member 
because they really brought home to me the stark reality that is 
faced by young people in this country.  What these young people 
said to me is they know they have a very bleak and dismal future 
and the prospect for them to find long term secure employment 
that is not part time, that is not low wage, was increasingly 
diminishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at the impact of this bill on my local riding and 
when I hear from my constituents, in particular young people who 
are unemployed, they tell me they are very fearful about their 
lack of access to post-secondary education. That is even in a 
province like British Columbia where we have been very fortunate 
to have a provincial government that has shown leadership and has 
frozen tuition fees three years in a row in order to ensure that 
there is some measure of accessibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>B.C. has led the way in that regard, but even so it is very 
difficult for young poor Canadians to get into a university, a 
community college or a technical school simply because the 
tuition fees are so incredibly high.  We have to ask ourselves 
why are those tuition fees so high.  It is because of $2.1 
billion which has been cut from education in the Canada health 
and social transfer that will not be reversed in this bill before 
us today, despite the claims from the federal government that it 
is increasing the Canada health and social transfer.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents who are trying to get into community college, 
university or technical school know what the reality is trying to 
go through the door, trying to get into those schools and 
realizing that tuition fees are too high.  Even if they are 
successful in going through the entrance, what are they then 
faced with?  The next barrier is a massive student debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average student debt a few years ago was around $13,000. 
Today the average student debtload is $25,000.  Why is that?  We 
can relate it directly back to the federal government which has 
shirked its responsibility to provide adequate funding for 
post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last month we have heard a lot about the millennium fund 
and how this will answer all our problems and needs.  As the 
millennium fund begins to unfold and as students, young people 
and Canadians begin to understand what the millennium fund is all 
about people will realize it will not even come close to 
compensating for the massive cuts we have faced in post-secondary 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government chose to do was rather than increasing its 
support to public post-secondary education that could have been 
contained in Bill C-28, it provided a scholarship grant program 
through a private foundation that only begins in the year 2000. 
Students will still be facing very high tuition fees because 
universities and colleges are forced to raise tuition fees to 
compensate for the decreasing funds from the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact of the bill, the lack of funding and the cutbacks in 
the Canada health and social transfer are not just felt in my 
riding, they are felt right across the country. Even here in 
Ottawa there was a very interesting situation yesterday where 
students at Carleton University organized a vote on several key 
questions involving post-secondary education because they are so 
concerned with what is going on in their own educational 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To refer to the material they have distributed to students in 
that facility, they said that recent decisions by the provincial 
government give the board of governors and the management of 
Carleton University the power to raise tuition fees for 
undergraduate students up to 20% over the next two years and to 
deregulate tuition fees for graduate students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The students say about the putting out of this material that 
they need to ask themselves who sets tuition rates and how.  Ask 
the federal government which jettisoned national standards by 
ending direct funding for education in 1996 and it will say it is 
the provinces' responsibility.  Ask provincial governments whose 
main response to decreased federal government was to make it 
easier for universities to raise tuition fees and they will refer 
you to the universities.  Ask Carleton management and it blames 
both governments for cutting education funding.  Who is telling 
the truth? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a sense the responsibility for tuition fees has become 
offloaded to everybody and nobody.  That is what students at 
Carleton University are facing as they put forward the questions 
in a vote that was held on the campus yesterday.  The questions 
they posed to students at that facility are as follows.  “Do you 
think the board of governors and the university management should 
freeze tuition for the next two academic years, 1998-99 and 
1999-2000 at current levels, yes or no?  Do you think Carleton 
should honour its obligations to tenured faculty and students 
when making decisions about closing programs, yes or no?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The full results have not yet come out but I know from speaking 
to members at the university that they have had a very high vote 
and they expect a very high, resounding yes in answer to these 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, this bill contains nothing of real measure to help 
Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, further to the 
remarks by my colleague from British Columbia, I note she has 
acknowledged that the millennium scholarships, among other 
things, will not, as she puts it, really serve the students in 
her province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in Quebec have noted the same thing.  We are saying that 
education needs are not necessarily the ones targeted by the 
federal government and we think the Province of Quebec is in a 
better position to know what the real needs are, to establish 
its own priorities and to invest where the needs are the 
greatest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my colleague from British Columbia if she 
does not think that education would be better served if it were 
administered provincially, if the Province of British Columbia 
had this money as compensation and could distribute it for 
educational purposes, invest it where it considered such 
investment a priority and where it would best serve students in 
need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does she consider the provinces are in a better position than the 
government to assess educational priorities?  I would like her 
opinion on the matter. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Madam Speaker, I agree with the member 
that the role of provincial governments in establishing 
educational priorities is critical and is a prime responsibility 
of the provincial governments whether in Quebec or British 
Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I and my party think it is very important for the 
federal government to be involved in establishing a national 
standard around accessibility for post-secondary education.  We 
also believe that the federal government must provide adequate 
funding for post-secondary education, which I am sure the member 
would agree with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government should sit down at the table with 
provincial governments to ensure those funds are directed to 
support public facilities and support students in need through a 
national grants program.  That is what we stand for and what we 
believe in.  We believe the students in Quebec would benefit from 
that as well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, once again the member opposite 
fails to mention the importance of the value of tax points for 
the provinces as part of the overall federal transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have done in Bill C-28 is increased the cash floor now 
that our fiscal situation has allowed us to do that.  I would 
hope that she would be applauding the government for actually 
increasing the amount of money in the cash floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I would ask the hon. member is whether the 
constituents of Vancouver East would benefit from the increase in 
the cash floor to the provinces.  If the member is suggesting 
they will not and this money is being transferred to the province 
of British Columbia, then she is further suggesting that the 
government should go directly to Canadians, Vancouverites, the 
constituents of Vancouver East.  Will not the improvement in the 
tax system for donations, which is part of Bill C-28, help those 
charitable organizations that are in her constituencies? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes in this tax system will allow for a more generous 
treatment of donations and a better write-off for donors to 
charitable organizations, which I am sure plays a very large role 
in the constituency of Vancouver East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also discussed the millennium fund, as did the member 
for Joliette.  The millennium fund is part of Bill C-36.  I would 
only hope we would talk about the context of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I also want to remind the hon. member that it has 
always been a joint jurisdiction.  I agree with the member for 
Vancouver East that the federal government needs to play a role 
in access to higher education.  At least on that point we agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also ask the hon. member if she can respond to some of these 
quotations like the following:  “We are trying to get a balanced 
approach which involves debt management, the enhancement of 
programs and, when we can do it, tax reductions.  We need to look 
at selective tax reductions in order to promote jobs and economic 
development.  When we cut those taxes is when we can afford to 
cut those taxes.  As long as I am premier, our fiscal integrity 
will never be compromised”.  These are not my words or the words 
of any member of this government.  These are the words of NDP 
Premier Roy Romanow. 
Would the hon. member comment?  I do not understand whether she 
is in complete disagreement with what the NDP Premier of 
Saskatchewan is saying.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Madam Speaker, I would be delighted to 
respond to the member's comments though I doubt I can respond to 
all of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to show me the increase in the cash 
floor.  Unfortunately the member was not present when I made my 
comments.  I went to great lengths to point out that there was 
actually no increase in the Canada health and social transfer. 
Not one new dime is going to the provinces.  Would the member 
dispute that?  Is that not the case?  The government is not going 
ahead with a previous cutback.  No new money is going to the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the bill and its provisions for donations it is very 
nice that big corporations can get a bigger write-off for making 
donations.  We need to ask ourselves why we are now in a 
situation where organizations and community programs are forced 
to rely on a very Victorian notion of charity from big 
corporations so that they can get a tax break to help some poor 
person in my riding in the downtown east side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not call that equality.  That is more inequality from the 
government.  It is another benefit to big business under the 
guise of making donations to help low income Canadians.  If the 
government were truly concerned about those people it would 
ensure a real increase in the cash floor of the Canada health and 
social transfer. 
<P><A NAME="LINK56"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
thank my hon. colleague for her comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned how the government had not put one 
additional cent back into the payments.  The government cuts off 
one's leg and plans on cutting off the other one next year but 
then decides not to cut it off.  This is supposed to make people 
feel good, that they are doing well and getting something back. 
If we want to make it obvious for the government, maybe it should 
look at it in that sense.  To a lot of people that is what we are 
talking about.  We are talking about their lives and their 
personal well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says that it is doing things for education. There 
are RESPs where money can be invested.  However I see the bottom 
line in my riding.  For example, students employed by Inco, the 
major employer in the community, receive $1,500 in educational 
assistance from the employer if they have to continue their 
education outside the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past the students would claim the $1,500 as income or in 
some way, shape or form through the income tax process.  In most 
cases students are not doing very.  The government does not make 
a lot of money in tax dollars from students, so it decided that 
parents must claim the $1,500 of income instead of the students. 
It is trying to make a buck and bleed dry ordinary Canadians 
instead of addressing the real problem, the need for a total 
reform of the tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member have any comments about that?  Does it identify 
what she has been saying? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for her comments.  The analogy that she used to describe the 
cutbacks in the Canada health and social transfer was very vivid 
and aptly described the situation before us as opposed to how the 
government tries to manage a shell game about the Canada health 
and social transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The example provided about the change in tax laws reminded me of 
what the government did with bankruptcy laws.  It changed the 
laws to make it more difficult for students to declare 
bankruptcy.  Both examples serve to show that on the one hand the 
government is saying it is helping students but on the other hand 
it is actually making it more difficult.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise in the House today to speak to Bill 
C-28 which offers a wide range of tax related measures, most of 
which have been discussed at great length in the House by myself 
and other members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill demonstrates the Liberal philosophy to governing our 
country: government by knee jerk reaction, crisis management and 
economic tinkering.  Liberal governments do not plan to fail but 
quite frequently they fail to plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Effective economic policy needs to be consistent and the 
vagaries of politics cannot interfere with the economic direction 
of the country.  In the Liberal war of politics versus economics 
politics always wins.  Unfortunately Canadians frequently lose. 
That goes back to 1974 with wage and price controls, the 18 cents 
per gallon tax, the budget of Joe Clark and the Liberals' flip 
flop on that, their flip flop on the Pearson airport deal, 
helicopters, GST and free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I am pleased that at least they have maintained the 
policies of the previous government to the extent that those 
policies have been largely responsible for the government's 
ability to reduce the deficit.  The types of policies I am 
speaking of are free trade, GST, deregulation of financial 
services, transportation and energy.  Those were the policies of 
the previous Conservative government which provided the 
government with an opportunity to make some choices for the 
future of Canadians.  I say with great confidence that not a 
member on the government side of the House today would disagree 
that their previous policies are clearly failing ordinary 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Bill C-28 the finance minister tinkered with several areas to 
provide minimal targeted tax relief.  He complicated a tax code 
which is already far too complex.  Canadians should not need tax 
accountants or even tax lawyers to deal with their governments. 
Even the Americans are moving toward streamlining their tax 
measures when the Canadian tax code is far more complicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The targeted education tax measures in terms of basic direction 
and intent are very strong.  We suggested as part of our 
prebudget position that the government move toward providing 
better incentives for investments in RESPs and providing more 
flexibility for Canadians to invest in their futures and the 
education of their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this type of stop gap, one off, cobbled approach to 
education will not be effective without a holistic approach to 
economic public policy.  Public policy should be designed to 
provide opportunities for young Canadians in Canada not only to 
obtain an education but also after their education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recent government budget announcement relative to RESP 
changes follows on the heels of the proposed changes in the bill. 
If we look at tomorrow's edition of <I>Investor's Digest</I> we 
see an article by Brenda Robertson which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My problem with the RESPs is that they're already too complicated 
for investors.  The new grants—will probably create more 
confusion. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This case in point is from the mouth of a tax accountant who 
probably prefers a complex tax code at some level.  She is saying 
that it is actually getting too complicated for the ordinary 
Canadian to benefit from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the PC plan for growth we call for government to allow 
Canadians to have more flexibility with their RESP contributions 
and transfers from their RRSPs, but only as part of a holistic 
policy toward economic growth, one that combines tax relief, 
lower income taxes, lower payroll taxes, greater opportunities 
for jobs and growth in Canada that would keep young people here 
where they belong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what the government's policies have done to 
higher education in Canada.  We can start with Nova Scotia, the 
cradle of higher education in Canada, and the immediate situation 
of the faculty strike at Dalhousie University.  Dalhousie is my 
alma mater.  Its students felt that their concerns were being 
overlooked in the recent election by the two levels of 
government, both the provincial Liberals and the federal 
Liberals.  The Dalhousie students union spent $40,000 to buy 
television advertising to make sure Nova Scotia voters were 
reminded of the education crisis which was looming because of 
federal cuts to health and social transfers to the provinces.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The student debt load has grown in recent years by 280%.  The 
debt load at the completion of a four year degree now averages 
$25,000.  In 1993 only eight students in the maritime provinces 
had debts exceeding $30,000 after their four year programs.  In 
1997 there were over 900.  The number increased from 8 to 900 in 
that short period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is student debt load ballooning out of control?  It is 
partially because of the cuts to transfers but also because of 
the general unemployment situation.  Tuition has only increased 
by 110% but student debt has increased by 280%.  The 
disproportionate growth in student debt is due to the general 
unemployment situation.  Students are competing with graduates 
for jobs that were previously within the exclusive domain of 
students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ludicrous to address the issue of student debt load 
without addressing the issue of general unemployment.  That is 
why we need to address the issues of reducing taxes, growing the 
economy and providing an economy that creates jobs and provides a 
better opportunity for young people to work, provide for 
themselves and supplement their incomes while going to 
university. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Acadia University is in my riding.  Its students just went 
through a near crisis because of a strike that loomed for several 
months.  Uncertainty was created.  Many of those students who 
were having difficulties came to my office to seek advice.  They 
were not finished their degrees.  They were faced with a faculty 
strike and already had $30,000 in student debts.  What a great 
way to start their careers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chain of events since 1993 on both the federal scene and the 
provincial scene in Nova Scotia has been unfortunate for the 
Liberal Party of Canada and its cousins in Nova Scotia.  For the 
first time in Nova Scotia's history a governing party has failed 
to win its successive second term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legacy of Russell MacLellan, who called the federal budget 
an excellent budget for Canadians and for Nova Scotians, is that 
the Liberal Party lost 20 seats.  The Liberals went from 39 to 19 
seats in Nova Scotia.  Russell MacLellan is kicking himself today 
for not speaking up when he was in Ottawa and for not speaking up 
in previous budget debates when the government was adamant that 
health care and education would be cut to the bone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>National leadership is required at all levels to ensure young 
Canadians receive the best education in the world to get the best 
jobs in the world.  Leadership is not about federal or provincial 
jurisdiction.  It is about federal and provincial co-operation. 
The struggle to raise the living standards of a nation is 
inextricably linked to the quality of its education system in a 
knowledge based society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we need a strong education policy we also need to address 
tax policy.  We need tax relief to keep our best and brightest in 
Canada and to stop the brain drain that is sapping the lifeblood 
from Canada's future.  Sherry Cooper from Nesbitt Burns stated 
that the government's changes or lack thereof to education and 
tax policy will turn Canada's brain drain into a brain train to 
the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once our students leave school the economic outlook for them in 
Canada is very bleak.  Canada continues to have a youth 
unemployment rate of over 17%.  Highly educated and motivated 
Canadians are being forced to leave the country in search of 
work.  As an Atlantic Canadian, I have seen the brain drain issue 
for a number of years.  For over 30 years families have watched 
their young people leaving Atlantic Canada and going to central 
Canada to seek opportunity.  Unfortunately it is now an issue 
with which all of Canada is familiar.  Across Canada young people 
are leaving and families are watching their children leave Canada 
to go to the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every year 80% of Waterloo computer science graduates go to the 
U.S.  The combination of higher income and lower taxes in the 
U.S. is too seductive to walk away from. Canadians need bold 
action from the Minister of Finance to reverse this exodus.  Yet 
the Liberal policy is to maintain high payroll taxes and the 
highest income taxes in the G-7.  These policies run counter to 
the most basic of free market logic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-28 epitomizes this Liberal philosophy. 
Instead of making substantive changes to initiate growth in the 
economy the minister has nickelled and dimed the Canadian people 
by offering targeted tax cuts in politically palatable areas.  If 
the PC Party plan for growth were implemented we would see the 
basic personal exemption increased to $10,000.  That would take 
two million low income Canadians off the tax roles.  Instead the 
Canadian government offered Canadians a stop gap solution, an 
increase of $500.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the tax relief for a Canadian making $10,000 per year in 
this budget works out to $80 per year.  That is an insult.  There 
is no member on the government side of the House here with me 
today who would disagree that it is an insult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that $80 per year amounts to one cup of coffee per 
week at Tim Horton's, one cup of coffee per month at Starbucks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unacceptable, frankly, that this government has balanced 
the budget on the backs of ordinary Canadians and now refuses to 
provide any benefits back to the ordinary Canadian taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My Liberal colleagues told this House about the marvellous tax 
relief and what they have provided for Canadians, and clearly 
that is not the case.  In fact, again, I urge members to pick up 
a copy of tomorrow's <I>Investor's Digest</I>.  In terms of tax 
relief it states, “What's going to happen when we head into the 
next recession with nine per cent unemployment, crippling taxes, 
massive debt and a weak dollar?  Presumably, having spent the 
fiscal dividend on education the Finance Minister will have 
little recourse but to run renewed deficits as income slows”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, this government is making the wrong choices.  It fails to 
deliver the opportunity to average Canadians to make their own 
choices as to what to do with their fiscal dividend.  This 
government may have moved into the black, but Canadians are still 
running in the red.  Personal debt is at an all time high in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-28 makes 15 small and favourable changes, arguably, to 
the tax code for selective groups, but again this is not sound 
economic policy.  It further complicates the tax code.  Certainly 
we would prefer to see some tax breaks for some Canadians as 
opposed to no tax breaks at all.  But what about really 
addressing the issue of the egregiously complicated and not user 
friendly Canadian tax code and making it easier for average 
Canadians to deal with their own government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have not experienced a real after tax pay increase 
since the early 1980s.  Personal disposable income has dropped by 
6% since 1991.  In Canada the Liberals have maintained high 
payroll taxes and they continue to believe that we can create a 
growth economy with a high tax economy.  It is not possible and 
we are going to continue seeing a gap in the standard of living 
between Canadians and Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at Bill C-28 and the revisions to the CHST, the 
Canada health and social transfer, the CHST helps the provinces 
pay for health, education and welfare.  In the Atlantic provinces 
where the local tax base is not as strong as it may be in some 
parts of the country to pick up the slack when these cuts are 
particularly draconian, the effects of changes and cuts to the 
CHST are dramatic and the impact is devastating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government talks about having established a cash floor for 
the CHST funding.  The fact is that the cash floor is established 
on a national level.  The fact is that seven of the ten provinces 
will continue to receive less money every year for the next four 
years, including provinces like Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government talks about cash floors it should realize 
that health and education spending in many provinces is not a 
matter of having a floor.  It is subterranean.  It is not up to 
the national standards and the Liberal answer is to cut further 
the cash transfers to the provinces in those areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our platform would call for a provincially reached cash floor 
level that would truly establish the long term stability of 
social investment in each province of Canada.  We need a plan 
that ensures equity and equality of opportunity for all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Minister of Finance would like Canadians to believe him 
when he says in a press release that “Governing is about 
choices, priorities and values.  Our choice is clear.  Health 
care is a priority for this government”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on the Liberal convention of last weekend and the outcry 
of Liberal delegates from across Canada for this government to 
start investing more in health care and to start dealing more 
with the health care crisis of this country, obviously health 
care may be a priority for the Liberal Party at a grassroots 
level but it is not a priority of this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said a few minutes ago that there was not one government 
member on this side of the House who would disagree with me when 
I say that the government's policies are clearly missing the 
mark.  There may be one now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to offer our positions and our beliefs which 
represent our unwaivering belief in the free enterprise system. 
The free enterprise system is the best system to provide all 
Canadians the opportunity to succeed and prosper in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also believe that the free enterprise system is only going to 
be successful and sustainable if all Canadians have access to the 
levers of the free enterprise system and to the levers of growth 
to bootstrap themselves and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a government that is prepared to commit to sound 
strategic social investment in areas that will include the 
competitiveness of Canadians in a global environment as we enter 
the 21st century, as well as a government that will couple this 
investment with tax reduction and provide Canadians the types of 
opportunities they need and deserve right here in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians need a plan for growth.  That is what the PC party is 
offering Canadians.  It is not offering a stopgap, one-off 
approach to economic policy but a holistic economic policy that 
will provide Canadians with a plan that will work and will put 
more Canadians back to work.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member said something 
along the lines that the government spent the fiscal dividend on 
education, that the economy is going to decline, that it will go 
into a downturn and then we will be back into deficit financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure the hon. member was here when the budget was put 
forward.  The finance minister said that we would balance the 
books this year, next year and the year after that for the first 
time in a very, very long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, if we look back to 1993 we have not missed a target. 
We have always bettered the target.  I am not sure whether the 
hon. member really has his facts right.  He should probably 
clarify that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other point, the hon. member talked about the transfers 
and the importance of transfers to the provinces.  I agree with 
him that transfers are important to the provinces.  However, I 
also want to remind the hon. member that during the 1997 election 
his party was promoting the fact that we should eliminate all 
cash transfers and just deal with tax points; in effect, 
eliminate the federal role in transfers to the provinces 
completely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that is something members of the Bloc Quebecois would 
agree with, but I am not sure it is something that the hon. 
member wants to stand to defend, that being the elimination of 
the federal presence in transfer payments to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member, when he speaks about transfers, whether 
he would pay some attention to the tax points portion of the 
transfers and the fact that equalization payments to the 
provinces in Atlantic Canada were not in any way affected.  Those 
provinces require assistance and this government did in fact make 
those changes in consultation with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member whether he is prepared to stand to defend 
the fact that his party wants to eliminate the federal presence 
in transfers to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question.  When he quoted me, in fact, I was quoting 
Brenda Robertson who writes for <I>Investor's Digest</I>.  I urge 
the member to pick up a copy.  It comes out tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri:</B>  Do you agree with her? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Yes, I do agree with her when she says 
that what is going to happen when we head into the next recession 
with 9% unemployment, crippling taxes, a massive debt and a weak 
dollar is that we are going to have to spend and, after having 
spent the fiscal dividend, we will have little recourse but to 
run renewed deficits as income slows.  That is a basic argument 
of mathematics.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member and his government are actually content with 
spending money without providing any meaningful tax relief to 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us hear what Sherry Cooper of Nesbitt Burns says.  She says 
we are pouring all this money into education and scholarships and 
then the better and brighter will go straight to the U.S. where 
taxes are massively lower. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This member stands behind a millennium scholarship fund which 
does not kick in for two years.  This fund will cost $2.5 billion 
and will help only 7% of students seeking higher education.  It 
is appalling that he would be proud of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1984 when a Conservative government was elected the deficit 
as a percentage of GDP was 9%.  We reduced that to 4% by 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His government maintained our policies, including free trade and 
the GST.  We deregulated the national energy program, which I 
hope my colleagues in the Reform Party have some appreciation 
for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Two years too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  An hon. member opposite said it was two 
years too late.  It was a heck of a lot faster than the previous 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We deregulated financial services, energy and transportation. 
Those policies helped this government.  They helped lay the 
groundwork for this government to continue to eliminate the 
deficit.  In fact, we could say that this Liberal government is a 
government of sound and original ideas.  Unfortunately its 
original ideas are not sound and its sound ideas are never 
original. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talks about the CHST transfers and the fact that 
our party espoused a tax point solution to this issue.  How can 
the member say that transferring greater authority to the 
provinces to determine the future of their health and social 
spending is a bad thing when he is part of a government that has 
reduced health and social spending by 35% over four years?  How 
can he say that the federal government can be trusted with that 
responsibility when there are a lot of provincial governments out 
there which are fearful of further draconian cuts in the future 
from a federal government that is as heavy-handed as this one has 
been? 
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, can this member explain to Canadians 
why his government, in the nine years that it was in power, did 
not get rid of the deficit when the economy was in a growth 
situation and would have allowed it to reduce the deficit?  Can 
he explain to Canadians why the Conservative Government between 
1984 and 1993 allowed the deficit to reach $42 billion and 
allowed the national debt to more than double? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Madam Speaker, obviously the hon. 
member was not so disenchanted in 1988 with the Conservative 
government's policies that it prevented her from running as a 
candidate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously she felt quite comfortable in the Conservative Party's 
policies between— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Madam Speaker, as a point of order, I 
should advise the House and Canadians that I did run in 1988 as a 
Reformer because I was terribly distressed with what the Tories 
were doing as a government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Madam Speaker, I seem to have struck a 
chord. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, the economic policies and the mess the government 
of Brian Mulroney inherited dictated that we had to reduce by 15% 
per year program spending growth.  We reduced it to zero by the 
time we left office.  Beyond that we were able to not only reduce 
program spending, which was out of control at that time, but we 
were also able to reduce the deficit as a percentage of GDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were also able to implement policies which have been 
absolutely essential in reducing the deficit, including the GST, 
which is a consumption tax that is a heck of a lot better than 
the manufacturers' sales tax which it replaced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we implemented the free trade agreement.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We were the party that supported free trade before the members

types of difficult innovative policy decisions which have

<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I just had one comment on the member's speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The European model puts a lot more emphasis on trades people. 
When people are educated in that way it tends to lead to the 
quicker creation of jobs.  These people finish their courses 
within six months to two years as opposed to university classes 
which take two to six years.  This gives them a chance to get 
something on their resume.  They can always go back for further 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member see that type of program working for Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for a very good question.  There is a tremendous amount of 
duplication of efforts between provincial and federal governments 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the education system and training in Canada, we 
see that part of the problem is that there are so many programs 
which are not tied together that we do need a more cohesive 
approach to training, education and more research into 
apprenticeship programs.  I think there is a significant amount 
of potential, especially in the areas of tying education to the 
jobs of tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe governments have to look ahead to see where the 
employment trends are going and then federal and provincial 
governments should be compelled to work together to ensure, 
either through apprenticeship programs or through a better 
secondary and post-secondary education system, that our young 
people are provided with the skills and tools they need to 
survive and prosper here in Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Calgary 
West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we debate this bill and some of the amendments this 
afternoon, I cannot shake the belief that the governments that 
introduce these massive omnibus bills can only have one of two 
motives in mind.  The first motive, I would think, is that they 
are probably in a desperate hurry or, second, that they have 
something to hide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the first case scenario.  Is this Liberal 
administration in any sort of a hurry?  I cannot see why.  The 
Prime Minister has spent this past weekend shortcutting democracy 
by laying claim to future mandates with his millennium 
scholarship fund and prebooking dollars for future programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with his lack of vision, I cannot see any reason why he 
would see a difference between 1968 or 1998 let alone the next 
millennium where he has already committed such a large chunk of 
our money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe we can find a sense of urgency in the office of the prime 
minister in waiting, formerly known as the finance minister.  He 
is so eager to put his stamp on the economy that he has created 
this 464 page rubber stamp to enshrine Liberal tax policy in a 
never-never land of complexity, manipulation and government 
interference and intrusion into other government jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Liberal government is asking Canadian taxpayers to think 
happy thoughts and fly straight on and never think of their 
income as their own, never believe one can make personal choices 
without first filtering the money through massive bureaucratic 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, since this has been a feature of Liberal tax policy for 
the last three decades, we cannot see why anybody would be in a 
hurry.  What can I conclude?  This government has something to 
hide.  What does it have to hide?  We are told that this 
government is so open and transparent that it is now telling us 
what it is going to do with our tax dollars years from now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somehow taxpayers who are looking at another four years of 
diminishing net incomes and the next generations faced with 
paying off this massive debt we have accumulated, almost $600 
billion, big government debt cannot find as much cause for 
celebration as members opposite would like us to believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of what the Liberals are trying to hide is the fact that 
they have completely ignored the wishes of the Canadian people, 
all those people who came to the finance committee last fall 
making presentations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time of the year when millions of people are tied up 
trying to figure out their complex tax forms, this government 
offers nothing to simplify that process.  On the finance 
committee we heard those witnesses last fall testifying that 
payroll tax cuts were essential to promote further prosperity and 
spin the economy in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister offers us 10 cents off the EI premium while 
jacking CPP premiums through the roof.  What is he up to with 
those excess premiums?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it turns out they look real good when placed on the asset 
side of the ledger.  They go to pay down the deficit, not to 
provide the training or the employment benefits this country 
so badly needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It turns out that the public pension surpluses also serve to 
make the government look good.  No one on the government side 
wants all this to be as open to the public as they claim they do. 
Perhaps it is not that the Liberals have something to hide but 
something they want to protect.  From what this bill contains I 
would have to conclude that they want to protect their ability to 
intrude in and control every aspect of Canadian economics and 
governance.  Taxing municipalities that are only trying to pay 
for the downloading of services that was begun by the present 
finance minister is ridiculous.  Where do the Liberals believe 
these profits are going?  We should be encouraging cities and 
towns to be more flexible, not less flexible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the perceived conflict of interest by the finance 
minister on clause 241, much has already been said.  I want to 
offer my support to my colleagues on this side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not support Motion No. 3 because it simply adds to the 
bureaucracy of administration and it does so in the area of the 
provincial jurisdiction.  What we are looking for is simplicity 
in the tax code and a vision from this government that recognizes 
that money left in the hands of those who produce it is much more 
effective than all the tinkering with an outdated tax code that 
only gets more incomprehensible and complex to those of us who 
are forced to use it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
challenge the member here to tell Canadian taxpayers, because he 
has talked about tax increase after tax increase, how many tax 
increases this Liberal government has introduced since it became 
government?  That is the challenge I lay to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz:</B>  Madam Speaker, it is a very in-depth 
question and I am not sure anyone has a complete handle as to all 
the insidious tax bites that we have seen throughout the country. 
I believe the number is somewhere around 37. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most people have no concept of where that tax bite is getting 
them other than when they look in their wallets at the end of the 
month.  The month drags out to 30 or 31 days and their wallets 
are only good for about 20 or 21 days.  We are seeing that 
shortfall in revenue, disposable income, taxes that show the 
average family of four paying out $21,000 for income tax and only 
having $17,000 of its incoming going to food, shelter and 
clothing.  It is creating a generation of have nots in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of that, these are the same people who are being asked to 
finance the increase in CPP.  They are the same people who are 
being asked to finance the paying down of the debt that we have 
seen accumulate over the past 30 years. It is quite a challenge 
to most people out there to make both ends meet and still come up 
to the tax levels that have been created for them in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As other speakers have indicated, it creates tremendous brain 
drains.  We see people educated here who cannot afford to work 
here leave the country.  That is revenue that is lost to this 
country for generations to come.  It is a shame.  We have to stem 
that tide.  We look to this government to give us the leadership 
and the direction to slow that tide down, turn it around and get 
those people staying at home working where they should. 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member talked about 
laying claim to future governments. Then he criticizes the 
government with the millennium scholarship fund.  I would offer 
to the member the explanation that what this government is doing 
is not laying claim, we are paying for programs rather than 
shifting the burden to future governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are being criticized by the Reform Party for actually paying 
for something that has been announced and is quite transparent. 
He knows where the $2.5 billion is going.  He keeps standing up 
in this House and telling people.  That is fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question about the comment he made about taxing 
municipalities.  If he votes against Bill C-28 and wants to 
eliminate that provision he is referring to, has he talked to 
corporations and told them that the Reform Party is in favour of 
allowing municipalities to compete tax free with private 
corporations?  Is that what the Reform Party is in favour of?  If 
he votes against Bill C-28 and that provision is removed that is 
what he would be allowing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the parliamentary 
secretary for his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is quite an in-depth study that needs to be done in all areas 
of the country.  He asked me to say that municipalities would be 
in direct contradiction to private corporations in that they are 
tax free.  The one program that pops to mind is the 
infrastructure program which hit municipalities using their own 
resources against private corporations in order to qualify for 
the infrastructure money.  Towns and villages were doing their 
own sewer and water to make that program go further and not go to 
private contractors.  There are several instances of that in my 
riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about corporations being in competition with 
government.  Canada Post is a prime example.  People in my riding 
are forced by law to charge three times the rate that Canada Post 
charges for the same service.  That is a direct contradiction to 
what the member is trying to get across. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member brings up the millennium scholarship, an intrusion 
into provincial jurisdictions.  The members for the Bloc made 
that very clear.  I hear that from home as well.  We are booking 
money out for future generations to pay for.  It does not kick in 
soon enough.  It does not cover enough people.  The 
representations on the finance committee from students from the 
Canadian Association of Students said they want that needs base. 
Let us have the money working for us today, not further down the 
road.  It does not go far enough fast enough. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
would like to boil this down for the taxpayers watching at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is Bill C-28.  See how thick it is.  That is what the 
Liberals call a neutral tax or something that is a tax 
simplification or tax relief.  That is what they call tax relief. 
It is a telephone book.  A telephone book means that taxes are 
becoming more complex.  It is not as though we were not complex 
already.  Walter Robinson of the Canadian Taxpayers' Federation 
sent a survey to all the members in the House of Commons and 
asked whether MPs do their own taxes.  A large portion of MPs do 
not actually do their own taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are the people who pass the laws in this country.  We are the 
ones who create taxes or change taxes. A Reform government would 
provide tax relief. Nonetheless, many of us as law makers do not 
do our own taxes because they have become so complex.  Tax 
accountants and tax lawyers making their living doing taxes 
advocate that taxes should be made simpler and less complex. 
They as well as the taxpayers are crying out for help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see something as large as a telephone book. Members across the 
way in the Liberal government are the architects of the slash and 
burn in health care and the architects of tax increases. They 
tell us this is a good change to the taxes. Shame on them.  How 
can they continue to justify Bill C-28 and its myriad of tax 
changes and tax increases as something that is good for the 
country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no tax relief here.  During the last election I do not 
believe the Liberals advocated increasing taxes when going door 
to door.  Yet they have increased taxes twice since the last 
election and 36 times during the 35th Parliament.  I bet any 
money that at any door they went to not a single taxpayer begged 
to have their taxes raised. Yet the Liberals have so willingly 
fulfilled that task and filled their pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Disposable incomes have continued to decline since 1987.  I know 
that the Tory across the way likes to quote from 1991 onward, but 
the fact is that real disposable incomes have continued to 
decline since 1987.  Taxpayers need a break.  They can only go so 
long.  They can only suffer much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no tax simplification by introducing something that 
looks like a telephone book. 
Nobody can pull the wool over my eyes and those of the taxpayers 
by telling us that there is tax simplification going on here. 
Indeed this bill is adding more regulation on top of regulation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Number three, there are new taxes on municipal utilities.  One 
government is taxing another level of government.  It is bad 
enough when the government taxes the citizenry, the businesses, 
the employees and employers, but when it starts taxing other 
levels of government, indeed the desperation is thick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number four, this bill returns nothing to the health and social 
transfer.  There were promises made by the Liberals in the last 
two elections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the election for the 35th Parliament in 1993 the Liberals 
said “Make us the government and we will guarantee the funding 
for health care and education and guarantee the health and social 
transfers”.  What actually happened?  The Liberals cut $6 
billion out of the health and social transfers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has that meant?  That has meant that the federal government 
is responsible for the hospital closures in this country. That is 
what it means.  It is the federal Liberals passing the buck on to 
their provincial counterparts which is closing hospitals across 
this land.  Their broken promises in 1993 and their broken 
promises in 1997 are closing hospital beds in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have cut the heart out of health care and they have 
the audacity to stand in the House and have their minister say 
that they are the friends of health care, when indeed waiting 
lists have grown longer and doctors and nurses are leaving this 
country.  The Liberals are the architects of the slash and burn 
policies in health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals say one thing in the election but then deliver a 
far harsher stroke when it comes to their cuts in these areas. 
They download on the provinces.  Shame on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax bill in this country is going to go up by $6 billion 
this year.  That is not tax relief.  That is more money coming 
from the pockets and the wallets of the taxpayers and going into 
the government coffers.  It is a tax increase. Six billion 
dollars more are being taken from taxpayers this year than last 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does it mean in terms of this whole debt situation?  We 
have all heard about these huge numbers in the debt but I am 
going to boil it down.  Six thousand dollars out of the average 
taxpayer's salary goes to paying just the interest on the debt. 
That is $6,000 that could be allocated to a whole host of other 
things.  The average taxpaying family is spending $6,000 just to 
pay the interest on the debt which this government and its past 
incarnations helped to create. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the contingency funds the government talks about? It 
would take 200 years to pay down the national debt by using these 
$3 billion contingency funds.  The real travesty is that the 
Liberals are not even moving along that track because the 
contingency funds are being used to fund new program spending. 
That is exactly what they are doing.  That amounts to a $45 
billion payment we have to make every year just to pay the 
interest on the debt. As I said, that $45 billion translates into 
$6,000 for every family in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been attacking the government.  I have been attacking the 
Liberals for what they have done on taxes, but I am going to 
speak to the poor suffering some of the Liberals have undergone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak of the poor finance minister.  Yes, he is a millionaire. 
Yes, he is involved and owns through various arm's length 
relationships the Canada Steamship Lines.  The poor finance 
minister has had to take his money and shelter it.  He has had to 
put his assets offshore because taxes are too high in this 
country and he does not want his companies to pay tax in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you know what?  I feel for him. The hearts and the minds of 
this country's taxpayers bleed for our finance minister because 
while he recognizes that taxes are too high and while he does not 
want his own companies paying those high taxes, he has raised 
taxes on the rest of Canadians 38 times since the government has 
been in power and since he has been finance minister.  Yet he 
shelters his own money offshore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel for him because he has to fly Bahamian flags and not 
those of his native Canada.  I feel for him because he likes the 
Netherlands Antilles with a 15% withholding tax as opposed to a 
25% withholding tax. 
It works very conveniently into his trusts and his arm's length 
relationships.  Shame on him.  He should be paying tax in this 
country.  If he is raising taxes on Canadians, he should have the 
decency to pay taxes in this country while Canadians suffer those 
bills. I feel for the finance minister.

government has brought in since it has been in power.  It went 
ahead and changed the tax treatment of securities.  It taxed 
dividends. It taxed insurance companies.  It accelerated capital 
cost allowances.  It increased excise taxes on gasoline and 
tobacco.  It restricted the tax assistance of RRSPs and reduced 
the RRSP withdrawal age to 69.  It increased EI premiums.  CPP 
premiums will go from 5.2% to 5.4% to 5.6% to 6.0% to 6.4% during 
the government's term.  Shame on the Liberal government for all 
its tax increases and the complications.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I listened and I am almost stunned at what I heard.  The member 
went through a litany of points.  It makes me wonder how 
Canadians feel when they hear information which is conflicting 
with fact.  How do they feel when they know that information 
given in the House of Commons is just wrong?  Do they wonder 
whether or not the member is somehow trying to make a point by 
hoping somebody would not understand that there are reasons for 
things and that representations are somehow relevant? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about personal income taxes and made some 
comments about how people do not do their own tax returns.  This 
year taxpayers can actually file their income tax returns over 
the telephone with a touchtone phone.  It takes less than 10 
minutes because the vast majority of taxpayers have very 
straightforward tax returns and they can get quick returns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member went on to say that the Income Tax Act is the size of 
a telephone book.  The member has implied somehow that the Income 
Tax Act which individuals have to deal with is as thick as a 
telephone book and they have to know everything that is in it. 
What the member did not say is that the Income Tax Act of Canada 
includes corporate income taxes which is the vast majority of the 
tax act. It also includes interpretation bulletins, information 
circulars and regulations which guide the Income Tax Act when 
people are interested in what is in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member implied that the tax relationship with the 
Netherlands Antilles somehow had something to do with the current 
finance minister, that he was somehow getting around something. 
That is to suggest there is something wrong.  We have tax 
treaties with countries around the world.  We have those treaties 
so we can promote bilateral trade and cultural exchange.  Those 
are good for Canadians because 40% of our GDP is export oriented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has given information which is incorrect.  He has 
given information which is not in keeping with the facts. I 
really am very sorry that Canadians have to bear some of this 
stuff, even when it gets down to that somehow the terrible 
government has restricted RRSPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current RRSP limit for Canadian taxpayers is $13,500 per 
year.  A person has to make $75,000 a year to be able to reach 
that maximum.  That means 5% of Canadians cannot put in more 
because they have more income.  He is talking about less than 5% 
of the income earners of Canada. 
The member is somehow suggesting to all Canadians that this is 
unfair.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is that the member has put a bunch of information on

apology for the incorrect information which was suggested as the 
truth by the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders:</B>  Madam Speaker, words spoken like only a 
tax and spend Liberal could speak them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that in 1996 the average family paid $21,242 in 
taxes and spent $17,415 on food, shelter and clothing combined. 
According to the Fraser Institute the average family paid $27,000 
in 1997.  Under this Liberal regime, the gap continues to widen 
between what people pay in taxes and what they spend on food, 
clothing and shelter. That is a fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Liberal bragging about how electronic filing is saving the 
government money in terms of getting people's taxpayer dollars to 
them more quickly and easily is like someone plucking feathers 
out of a goose and saying he can get the feathers out of the 
goose with the least amount of squawking.  He can take money with 
the fewest complaints.  How dare he?  And he is defending the 
complexity of the tax code?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, we are now 
at the final stage of Bill C-28, a bill that has been widely 
talked about this past month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this bill is just hours from being passed, the persistent 
doubt the people of Quebec and Canada have concerning clause 
241, which would place the current Minister of Finance in an 
apparent conflict of interest situation, has still not been 
dissipated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of the dozens of questions asked by the Bloc Quebecois 
and the other opposition parties, the Prime Minister and his 
Deputy Prime Minister have been passing the buck to each other in 
this House, systematically refusing to provide answers to the 
opposition, which wants this matter clarified once and for all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, all the efforts made to have the Standing Committee on 
Finance hear witnesses on this issue have been vain, except for 
the Prime Minister's ethics counsellor, who appeared before the 
committee to say that there was an apparent conflict of interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this respect, while the Liberals are doing their very best to 
protect their finance minister's image, I will take a moment 
today to quote exactly what the ethics counsellor said in his 
testimony before the finance committee; incidentally, he was one 
of the very few witnesses allowed to testify before the 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will share with you what we have heard Harold Wilson himself 
say. On the subject of whether the Minister of Finance may 
receive information on his holdings placed in trust, he stated 
that all ministers “may receive is periodic information on the 
overall value but not the composition of their holdings, as well 
as data sufficient for the purposes of filing their taxes”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He stated further “A blind trust agreement was not appropriate, 
however, in Mr. Martin's situation, since his holdings are not 
publicly traded. In this type of situation, my office requires 
the establishment and disclosure of a blind management agreement. 
This places in the hands of the supervisors or trustees the 
assets held by Mr. Martin in Passage Holdings. Mr. Martin is 
obviously completely aware of the nature of his private 
interests”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No wonder the Minister of Finance is tempted to hide in Bill C-28 
a clause which would benefit his little ships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Wilson also argued that certain provisions of Bill C-28 were 
in fact dealt with by the secretary of state so that his boss, 
the finance minister, would not be put in an awkward position. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1330"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Wilson was clear on this. He said “It is the secretary of 
state who made all the decisions. Therefore, there was no real 
conflict of interest. Still, Mr. Martin sponsored the bill and 
some members were of the opinion that this in itself is an 
apparent conflict of interest”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Wilson added “If I had been informed ahead of time, before 
the bill was introduced, discussions would have taken place on 
how to best proceed to introduce the bill on behalf of the 
Minister of Finance, who is responsible for all tax legislation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister continue to 
deny these facts. Why? 
As we know, the Liberals were told to keep their mouths shut on 
this issue. It is clear. The gag order given by the Prime 
Minister to his caucus has been complied with ever since the 
whole thing came up in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since February 5, when the Bloc Quebecois showed what is really 
behind Bill C-28, the opposition has had to deal with a gag order 
co-ordinated by the Prime Minister's office. Why do the Prime 
Minister and his government stubbornly refuse to give answers to 
the opposition on this issue? Why? Because they are embarrassed. 
They are trying to hide the truth regarding this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that the ethics counsellor clearly said in his 
testimony that the bill had not been drafted in according with 
the rules and that, if this had to be done again, some specific 
measures would have to be taken to avoid a repeat of this 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Wilson is the Prime Minister's ethics counsellor. He is not 
an independent counsellor, he is paid by the Prime Minister. A 
historic precedent took place when representatives of the four 
opposition parties held a joint press conference to ask the 
government to get to the bottom of the issue. Again, the Prime 
Minister said no. He did not want to comply with the opposition's 
request. The Liberals stubbornly refuse to shed light on this 
very suspicious matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Early in the week, in order to solve this impasse, which is 
totally the doing of the Prime Minister, the Bloc Quebecois 
proposed a reasonable solution: to take clause 241 out of the 
bill.  Again, the Liberals said no. When the vote was taken last 
evening in this very House, the Minister of Finance, the Prime 
Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister were all conspicuously 
absent. Pure coincidence? No, rather part of the Prime Minister's 
day-to-day plan to continue to protect the image of the Minister of 
Finance in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few minutes ago, my colleague from Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot 
introduced another amendment to refer Bill C-28 back to the 
Standing Committee on Finance.  That would enable us to question 
witnesses so as to clarify the situation for once and for all. 
I therefore wish to state that I fully endorse the amendment 
proposed by my colleague for Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, which in my 
opinion reflects the numerous opposition interventions over the 
past month or more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, it is in the same vein as the proposal made in this 
House by the Prime Minister.  When he was being questioned about 
Bill C-28, he said: “If you are not satisfied with the answers, 
use the Standing Committee on Finance to ask all the questions 
you want to ask”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are calling for today.  We are asking the Prime 
Minister to move the debate back to the Standing Committee on 
Finance.  We will see then who is right.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to add that, if the Prime Minister and his government 
refuse this new request from our party as well, they will have 
to face negative public opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hardly need point out that the position of Minister of Finance 
in a Parliament like ours is a vital one, and its incumbent 
cannot draw even a hint of suspicion.  He must have the full 
confidence of the public, particularly since we are well aware 
that this particular finance minister aspires to be Prime 
Minister some day.  He would have no problem following in the 
footsteps of our present Prime Minister, mind you, since the PM 
contradicts himself continually in his statements in this House, 
except in the case of Bill C-28. 
That is another matter.  He is protecting his Minister of 
Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has an opportunity to rebuild his 
credibility in the matter.  He must accede to our latest 
request, otherwise we will continue our research.  And so long as 
we have not obtained what we are after on behalf of the people, 
we will keep digging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to raise other important points in this bill, 
including the points concerning transfer payments to the 
provinces.  This government is stubbornly maintaining its 
planned cuts to the provinces.  What the Prime Minister is trying 
to get us to swallow is twisted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the Prime Minister is saying simply that the planned 
cuts of approximately $48 billion have been reduced to $42 
billion. 
That means that the provinces and the people will have to face 
$30 billion in cuts, $12 billion of which will be in Quebec 
alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The additional billion and a half dollars announced by the Prime 
Minister and his Minister of Finance represents nothing more than 
a purely vote getting move.  Who is going to pay the social costs 
of the budget policies of the present Liberal government?  The 
sick, the unemployed and society's most disadvantaged.  These are 
the people who are the true artisans of the balanced budget 
delivered last month by the Minister of Finance, not the Prime 
Minister or the Minister of Finance.  The people are doing the 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new social injustice is unacceptable, and the Bloc Quebecois 
will vote against Bill C-28.  We already know the Liberal 
reaction: the opposition will vote against a budget that gives 
more than planned to the provinces.  We are familiar with it, the 
demagoguery of the current Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that this government refuses to admit to its 
responsibility for the state of health care services.  When a 
government like the Liberal one cannot even acknowledge a poor 
choice in its latest budget, when we see the federal Liberals 
encouraging the government to debate a matter of provincial 
jurisdiction, we begin to understand why this government and its 
disastrous Prime Minister are trying to hide the truth in the 
Minister of Finance's apparent conflict of interest in Bill C-28. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, if the Prime Minister really wants to show his good 
faith in this matter, he should return Bill C-28 to the Standing 
Committee on Finance, enabling this Parliament and the people to 
see the situation in its entirety.

</I></B></P><P align=left>To go further, the member stated there was some doubt as to 
whether the Minister of Finance acted properly.  In fact the 
minister quite rightly did not act at all.  All decisions and 
discussions were held by the secretary of state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois keeps moving on this issue.  It started by 
hurling accusations that the FAPI rules were in jeopardy.  Then 
the Bloc members said that the clause would benefit the minister. 
Now the assertion is that there is an apparent conflict of 
interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact the answer given to the members of the Bloc, the members 
of this House, was that there is no apparent conflict of 
interest.  There is no conflict of interest. The Minister of 
Finance will not in any way benefit from this bill.  It has 
been said over and over again but those members continue on this 
track.  Those who make this charge knowing full well that it is 
false demean this institution and demean public life. Pure and 
simple they are engaging in the most cynical kind of politics. 
It is something Canadians will not stand for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope the hon. member has the courage, if he feels so 
strongly about this, to go outside and make those accusations.

politics.

read on February 17, 1998. 
If the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance is so 
certain that the minister is not in conflict of interest, why, 
when we asked the Standing Committee on Finance to hear witnesses 
on this state of affairs, was our request to hear from the ethics 
counsellor, Howard Wilson, the only one granted, but all our 
other requests turned down? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why we in the Bloc Quebecois and the opposition parties 
are once again raising the issue, because we feel that the word

serious problems of the health care system, unemployment and the

where small businesses are finding it very difficult to operate

closure on a very important debate before us and the Canadian 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most critical, the most controversial aspect of Bill C-28 is 
the section that applies to health care financing and 
specifically amends the financing arrangements for health care 
under the Canada health and social transfer.  We are dealing 
with, as we have done on many occasions, a government that is 
prepared to delve into illusory politics, to act like the great 
pretender and to imply that it is doing some great service for 
health care when all along it is a misrepresentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard time and time again from the government that it is 
investing new money in health care.  That is a galling statement 
when we consider the fact that we are not dealing with any new 
moneys for health care.  We are dealing simply with a cancelled 
cut and the legislation before us verifies the fact that is all 
the government is prepared to do at a time when health care is in 
crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is also an opportunity to talk about our visions for health 
care.  We are all asking what is the vision of the Liberal 
government when it comes to medicare.  We have not heard any plan 
from the government.  We are still waiting to see when the 
millennium health care budget will happen.  We are still waiting 
to get details from the government on how it will deal with the 
health care crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time we are dealing with a very serious situation, 
pronouncements from the Reform Party about the kind of health 
care system it would like to see.  That in itself should speak to 
the Liberal government and remind it of the urgency.  I certainly 
hope the Liberal government is vehemently opposed to the kind of 
proposal being advanced by the Reform Party.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members of the vision of the Reform Party on health 
care.  Within the past two weeks the member for North Vancouver 
suggested to the House that we needed more competition in our 
health care system.  He said that he received better health care 
in Florida than he has received under socialized medicine in 
Canada.  We have not heard such regressive, reactionary comments 
in the last 30 years.  All of a sudden they are appearing at a 
time when we need leadership and not reactionary statements like 
that one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca told us over the past few 
days about his vision and Reform's vision for health care. On 
behalf of the Reform Party he advanced a parallel system of 
health care: one for the rich and one for the poor.  That is the 
antithesis of everything that has shaped the country including 
the medicare we have today.  It is absolute Americanization and 
privatization of our health care system, the absolute opposite of 
what Canadians want to see from this place and from their 
government.  That is why this debate is so critical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With one voice we need to tell the government to preserve 
medicare.  Canadians want medicare preserved.  That means a 
genuine reinvestment to make up for the tremendous amount of 
money that has been chopped out of this system over the last 
number of years, in particular during the time the federal 
Liberal government has been in power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will put the chronology of events on record to point out the 
seriousness of the situation.  We need not forget that the whole 
erosion of medicare began under the Mulroney Conservative 
government with several pieces of legislation that changed a 
funding formula that made sense and that ensured federal cash 
transfers to the provinces would grow as the economy and the 
population grew.  The Mulroney government changed that formula 
over several years to ensure that growth in health care transfer 
payments would end.  We realized at that point that under that 
formula cash transfer payments to the provinces would dwindle to 
zero in short order if that were allowed to continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Who stopped it?  We did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  The question is who stopped it. 
The Liberals would like to pretend they stopped it.  I will put 
the facts on the record.  The Liberals came into office in 1993 
with the promise to address this critical situation, to restore 
funds for health care and to restore confidence in medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did they do in 1995?  They introduced the Canada health and 
social transfer, the most regressive social policy in the 
country.  In one fell swoop they took $6.8 billion out of 
programs for health, education and social assistance.  They 
eliminated the requirement that provinces live up to expenditures 
in those specific areas.  They completely abdicated 
responsibility in terms of ensuring a viable health care system, 
quality public education and any semblance of a Canada assistance 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In taking that huge chunk out of transfer payments to the 
provinces, the Liberal government put medicare on very weak 
ground.  As a result of the failure to maintain its commitment, 
to keep its promise to Canadians, we are dealing with the health 
care crisis we have today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have gone from the days when funding for health care was done 
on a 50:50 basis to where today the federal government at the 
very best is responsible for 20%.  We have gone from 50:50 to 
80:20.  That is even stretching it.  If we look only at the cash 
portion of the transfer payment the federal contribution is down 
to 10% or 13%.  With that kind of loss in federal support, with 
that kind of abdication of responsibility, with a total lack of 
federal leadership, we have a very serious situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have a government that is prepared to pretend its 
cancelled cut will save the day, but it fails to tell Canadians 
that it is still a $6.8 billion cut.  We have a government that 
does not have the wherewithal to enforce the principles of the 
Canada Health Act.

said “Let whatever happens happen.  We are not responsible”. 
That is contrary to the traditions of the country.  It is 
contrary to the vision of the pioneers of medicare.  It is 
contrary to the intentions of the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind the Liberal government and the Reform members that 
Canadians have a very clear idea of what they want in terms of 
health care.  They want a single payer, universally accessible, 
publicly administered health care system.  They do not want the 
two tier health system being proposed by the Reform. They do not 
want the federal government to abdicate from its responsibility. 
They want a partnership, which is all we are talking about in our 
opposition to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We presented an amendment to the bill that would have allowed 
the government at least to show some good faith and report back 
to parliament about the adequacy of cash transfers to the health 
care system to enforce the principles of the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the government accept that amendment?  Did the Reform Party 
accept that amendment?  No.  They would not even agree to a 
simple official process for accounting back to parliament and to 
the Canadian people.  Where is their support for medicare?  Where 
is their vision for the country?  It was a small gesture to be 
made and they could not even go that far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know there are difficulties surrounding this issue on the 
Liberal benches.  We know that there is clearly a battle going on 
between the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Health.  We 
know there is a battle going on between the Minister of Health 
and the Minister of Industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why else would we end up with the most unusual situation of the 
Minister of Health going on national radio and saying what he 
said?  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But on that point, let me say that, you know, in Ottawa now, as 
you mentioned at the top, we just balanced the budget.  We're 
entering sort of a new and unprecedented area where we're going 
to have a debate like we haven't had in memory about what to do 
with the surplus.  And people are going to be arguing, for 
example, that the surplus should be used for tax cuts; others 
will argue that it should be for other programming.  Health is 
going to be contending with other priorities for the available 
dollars.  So if, as you said, Canadians support increased 
investment in health care, then I think that we should make it 
clear that those who want to see surpluses go to health should 
let their voices be heard. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not seen anything this unusual in the whole time that I 
have been in politics.  It is absolutely incredible to have a 
minister of health stand publicly, dissociate himself with the 
government policies of the day and ask for Canadians to support 
him in his efforts to advocate for health care.  I think that 
says it all and why we need—

1.3 billion people in the developing countries, or one-third of

</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of these statistics, and in order to eradicate poverty, 
the Canadian Council for International Cooperation, in 
conjunction with some 100 organizations working in this area, 
has launched a campaign under the theme “In common”.  The goal of 
the campaign is to enhance the political and public desire to 
eradicate poverty in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the Minister of International Co-operation take some

Instead of cutting funding for international aid, as was done in

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, the bill 
transforming the present old age pension into the seniors 
benefit will bring about a drop in available income for most 
retired persons and a loss of ground for women.  What is more, 
40% of workers have only public pension plans when they retire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The AFEAS has been stoutly defending women seniors so as to 
ensure them of a decent retirement and to enable them to retain 
what they have acquired after many a long struggle.  The public 
pension plans are essential if the majority of women are to 
enjoy a decent retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The AFEAS is calling for the principle of individuality to be 
respected, for there to be a universal basic benefit and tax 
measures to enhance available income for the least well-off and 
to provide a tax break for the middle class, which has been 
crushed by the present government's taxation policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The AFEAS is therefore calling upon the Minister of Finance to 
reflect its recommendations in this new bill.

cut some of the transfer payments, the value of tax points went 
up by $700 million, there was an increase in equalization 
payments, and the drop in interest rates produced big savings for 
the Province of Quebec.

The government says to the provinces “We have no money.  We are 
therefore cutting $430 million from your payments”.  It then 
turns around and tells the public “We could care less about the 
problems our cuts are causing in the health sector.  We prefer 
to create millennium scholarships.  They are much more visible”.

this hon. member that a private contract between companies is not 
a tax of the Government of Canada.  He tends to suggest that we 
in the government should take over private relationships, smother 
the system that we have in place and of course substitute our 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I will tell him is that we have in place a regionalized

volumes that are carried and the different requirements for the

insurance policy.  To get the insurance one has to buy in.

yesterday the Minister of Finance said that if the auditor 
general would like to have access to the millennium fund books it 
would be arranged.  Yet the Budget Implementation Act does not 
give the auditor general any right of access to the books of the 
foundation.  In fact the legislation calls for the millennium 
fund to have its own auditor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on the minister's commitment yesterday, will he amend the

a foundation that will be independent and at arm's length from

will be deposited before parliament.  They will be open to public 
scrutiny including the scrutiny of the auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that we cannot have it both ways.  Either we have a 
foundation which is independent and at arm's length from 
government or we have one that is run like government is with all 
the regulations, et cetera.  That is not what we have chosen to 
do.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>STANDING COMMITTEE ON PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I know very well 
that the committees are the masters of their rules, but this 
freedom in Parliament does not permit committees to circumvent 
the rules of the House and all precedents, all past forms of 
parliamentary usage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what I wish to bring to your attention for a ruling from 
the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I attended the deliberations of the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs, which is examining the cases of 
members who spoke against the Chair before a ruling was made in 
the flag matter.  The committee chair, without any sort of a 
motion, and in contravention of Standing Order 116 and Standing 
Order 1, decided to limit the appearances of witnesses to 20 
minutes—5 minutes for a statement by the witness and 15 minutes 
for questions. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1505"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was no motion before the committee at that time.  That is 
the first thing that happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the allotted time, unilaterally decreed by the Chair, 
picked up later by the government party in a motion, is 15 
minutes.  Before deciding to set a time for a mandate as 
exceptional and specific in nature as this, where the statements 
of persons who have, according to some “offended” or 
“pressured” 
the Chair, it seems to me that it would have to be the judgment 
of a good parliamentarian to establish a sufficiently long period 
of time for questions and discussion. 
All parties were accorded a total of 15 minutes for questions, 
which means that our party will have about 5 minutes to question 
the witness who will appear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only precedent we have from the previous Parliament is the 
Jacob case, where one of our MPs appeared before the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs to respond to 
accusations made by another MP.  I have checked this out. In the 
Jacob case, the committee, quite by chance, in its great wisdom 
and with the support of the Bloc moreover, agreed that Mr. Jacob, 
the former member for Charlesbourg, would have five to six hours 
to answer questions from House members. We felt this would be 
sufficient to clarify his behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee worked on the case for three months. During that 
period, it questioned a large number of people regarding the 
issue, and our former Bloc Quebecois colleague spent five to six 
hours answering respectfully the questions asked by his fellow 
parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, how could we justify, based on any precedent, limiting 
the questioning to 15 minutes in the case of the Liberal and 
Reform Party members who are before the committee to be judged? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I am asking you whether the committee chairman 
grossly overstepped his mandate by deciding on his own, without 
any motion, that these members would appear for 20 minutes. I am 
asking you whether the committee had the right, given what is at 
stake, to overlook in such cavalier fashion the existing 
precedent, and to go from an appearance of five hours in the case 
of a Bloc Quebecois member, to five minutes in the case of a 
Liberal or Reform Party member. 
I am asking you whether the committee, in acting like this, 
respects the spirit of the mandate it was given by us, which is 
to review the very serious matter of a member whose comments may 
have offended, threatened or pressured the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With five minutes for questioning, is our party—which condemned 
the situation and wants to get to the bottom of the matter—in a 
position to even begin the work that it was asked to do by the 
House? I call upon your judgment and your sense of fairness in 
comparing the treatment of a Bloc Quebecois member, who answered 
the questions of his peers for five to six hours, and the 
treatment of the Liberal and Reform Party members, who will spend 
five minutes answering questions from the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is not any less serious. On the contrary, these are 
people who may have threatened the Chair. 
Had we accepted the decision made, which unquestionably defies 
any logic, it would have meant that, in the future, anyone in 
this House—including me—could have threatened the Chair and 
made statements such as “If the Speaker does not rule this way, 
the Bloc Quebecois will do this or that”.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result of all this is that one would have five, six or 
perhaps ten minutes to answer questions from the other parties 
and yet be able to evade questions or to stall for time, knowing 
that the ordeal will be over after ten minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not right. For the sake of justice and considering the 
mandate given by the House to the committee, for the sake of 
parliamentary intelligence and given the only existing precedent 
in the recent past, I am asking you, Mr. Speaker, to make a 
ruling, to review the issue and tell us whether Bloc Quebecois 
members are being unreasonable by demanding that these members 
spend more than five minutes before the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Considering that the former member for Charlesbourg, Mr. Jacob, 
spent five or six hours, is it too much to ask that 30, 35 or 
even 60 minutes be provided for questioning the members involved 
in this matter? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, I call upon your good judgment. I am asking you, 
Mr. Speaker, to look at the issue with all the wisdom that 
parliamentary law gives you under such circumstances.

Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
the chair of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs.  I think it might be useful if I described the process 
the committee is undertaking because the inquiry is still 
ongoing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We received the reference by motion from the House of Commons. 
As soon as possible thereafter we convened a meeting where we 
heard and were able to question an expert on general matters 
concerning privilege and contempt in the House of Commons.  Based 
on that meeting our steering committee met and decided that first 
of all we should invite in our colleagues who were cited in the 
article which was part of the reference to us from the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We decided at that meeting that they would be invited to a 
meeting today, that they would be asked to make a statement of up 
to five minutes and that would be followed by a question and 
answer period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the meeting today there was a discussion on the nature of the 
questioning.  It has been agreed the members would appear one at 
a time.  There was a general agreement in the committee that for 
the first round we would confine the questioning and the 
statement to a total of about 20 minutes.  It was made clear at 
the beginning and the end of each witness presentation that he 
might be invited back either later in today's meeting or at 
future meetings of the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intent of this approximate time period the committee 
provided and for which there was a formal agreement which the 
record will show was not to cut off questioning.  The intent was 
to show fairness and equality to each of our colleagues who would 
be appearing before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was made clear that this was not some sort of gag, gag order 
that is. The purpose of it was so that each member as the 
hearings unfolded would be faced at first with the same period of 
time for questioning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the matter of the motion and the unilateralness of the 
decisions as chair, I believe I was following the clearly 
expressed wishes of the committee.  The 20 minutes was not a time 
limit in the sense of questions.  Questions can be put at later 
hearings, no doubt.  It was intended to show fairness to the 
members concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This plan was developed properly through the steering committee 
at which all members were represented.  As in other meetings, as 
chair I have two purposes.  The first is to show fairness to our 
colleagues.  I think that is very important.  The second is to 
deal with the reference that the House of Commons has given to us 
and keep to that discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker will find that the record will show all parties had 
equal time.  All members where they asked to speak had equal time 
within the limits set by the committee. 
I stress the guiding principle of our meeting was fairness 
to our witnesses.

Thereafter, once we have considered the evidence we have 
received, we may well call members back or proceed in some other 
fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an ongoing set of hearings.  There was absolutely no 
intent to limit questioning of one party compared with the 
questioning by another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I do not want to get into a debate on this 
because I think that what we are trying to deal with here in the 
House is a matter that should be dealt with in the committee. It 
is up to the committee to decide if its president was within 
parliamentary practices.  In any case, it has been the 
longstanding practice of the House not to intervene until we have 
a report from the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would prefer that this matter be dealt with in committee. 
From what I am getting from the interventions so far there may 
have been an idea that there was to be a limit of time.  I am 
just repeating what I seem to have heard here.  If that is the 
case, perhaps it can be worked out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to get into a debate but I am prepared to listen

the masters of their own destiny and I think that is the way this 
place has always run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of things you may want to know about what 
happened today in committee. Eventually the members of the Bloc 
Quebecois stormed out of the meeting and things ran much smoother 
after that.  But before that you should know that there was an 
agreement among the parties, an informal agreement as has been 
mentioned.  I thought it was all agreed to. As usually happens in 
a committee where members take turns going from the government 
side back and forth and so on, I stood up on my first 
intervention and said we may want to have these witnesses back if 
we are not satisfied with the conclusions we reached today and so 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois House leader came in about three-quarters of 
the way through the meeting, not having taken part in the earlier 
discussions whatsoever. He decided he did not like the rules of 
the game and decided he wanted to change them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee then moved to formalize and sustain the ruling of 
the chair.  There was a motion, do we sustain the ruling of the 
chair. That motion passed easily, of course. The Bloc stormed out 
and so on.

matter.  I was also on the committee looking into the Jean-Marc 
Jacob question.  I can tell you the committee works in black and 
white. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to repeat the remarks of the House leader of the 
Bloc Quebecois.  I think he put his case very responsibly and 
fairly.  I would like to add, however, that you have made a 
prima facie ruling.   The matter appeared serious enough to 
warrant being referred to committee, so the members of the 
committee could consider it seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard from an expert, Joseph Maingot.  He stated before 
the committee that the matter raised by the referral to committee 
was very important and that the context needed to be analyzed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>You are a reasonable man, Mr. Speaker, a man of parliamentary 
experience.  You will understand that we parliamentarians cannot 
do responsible and consistent work if we are cut off by the 
chair, if he fails to recognize us or if he intervenes in the 
question we have asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If points of order are continually raised on all sorts of things, 
because the members of the Bloc Quebecois raise a matter that 
does not suit the Liberal or Reform Party witness, you will 
understand that we cannot do our parliamentary duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, as you will understand, when someone comes to 
testify before the committee, we cannot limit ourselves to 20 
minutes to question the witness and we cannot say “It does not 
matter, they will be back”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to get to the bottom of things and show the 
member contradicted his own words, because Mr. Maingot the 
government expert said to consider the context the statement was 
made in, we cannot limit ourselves to a single newspaper article 
from March 8.  All that has to be checked, which cannot be done 
in 20 minutes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, when this crisis 
was raised in the House, we felt as a party that it must not be 
treated lightly.  After several days of watching what you have 
had to go through, we felt it was important that a motion be 
proposed in the House to refer a case as serious as this to the 
committee on procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that, generally, the chair of the committee is a 
reasonable man.  The important point to be raised is that they 
want to restrict us to very specific statements.  I believe we 
must take advantage of this debate to try to broaden the scope 
and to draw conclusions from these actions.  The Reform Party and 
the government party both tend to want to treat this reference to 
the committee as something superficial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we must take advantage of this opportunity to draw 
constructive conclusions for the benefit of our country's 
future.  Certain behaviour must be stopped.  We know that there 
have been provocations for the past 25 years throughout the 
country, and this has contributed to a growing discontent that 
threatens to break this country apart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conclusions must be drawn from these events.  I therefore wanted 
to speak this morning in order to ask some of the witnesses 
whether they considered attitudes like theirs—flags in the 
House—and statements like those they made to be of such a nature 
as to bring Canadians closer together. Unfortunately, the Chair 
rose, interrupting me, and stated that this was not part of the 
reference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If something positive is to come out of these events, all of our 
colleagues responsible for these actions and words should realize 
what they have done.  This is serious, as we have been saying for 
the past 25 years. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I have heard the interventions of four or 
five members on this point of order.  My view is that when we set 
up a committee of this House, it is set up by the House to carry 
out the orders of the House.  My predecessors have ruled time and 
time again that unless there is a report before the House, the 
Chair does not intervene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is a misunderstanding of some kind, it should be worked 
out in the committee with the committee members. I hope it can be 
worked out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will leave this point of order where it is.  I suggest that 
whatever points of order are brought up here in terms of extra 
time or whatever is needed can be brought up in the committee. 
They should be dealt with there.  I will leave this right here, 
right now.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>INCOME TAX AMENDMENTS ACT, 1997

<A NAME="LINK222">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-28, an 
act to amend the Income Tax Act, the Income Tax Application 
Rules, the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, the Canada Pension 
Plan, the Children's Special Allowances Act, the Companies' 
Creditors Arrangement Act, the Cultural Property Export and

amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to continue addressing very serious matters 
relating to Bill C-28, particularly the implications that this 
bill has for the future of our health care system in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important for all of us in this House to send a clear 
message to Canadians that we are working and using all our 
energies and all our resources to preserve medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated earlier, this bill, with its pretence of 
reinvesting new money into health care, does a great disservice 
to Canadians and to our beloved national program, medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill creates a pretence of allocating new money to medicare 
while in fact it does nothing but maintain the present floor of 
cash transfer payments for health care.  It was $12.5 billion 
before this bill and it is $12.5 billion now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This creates very serious ramifications for health care. It 
means that this government has not shown any commitment to start 
to reinvest in health care now that it has a surplus, to deal 
responsibly with the health care crisis we are facing in every 
single part of this country and to show true co-operative spirit 
in dealing with the provinces around this very serious issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not only a question about the false pretence of 
reinvesting in health care.  This debate is also about the fact 
that actual dollars for health care on a per capita basis 
continue to drop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a situation very much parallel to the dilemma, to the 
problems, to the situation caused by the former Conservative 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is meaningless to suggest that we have a floor, a bottom that 
will always be there and will not fall below that floor, if our 
population grows, if the needs of our population grow and if the 
economy grows. If all those factors are taken into account, in 
reality cash transfer payments to the provinces will continue to 
fall on a per capita basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That puts more and more pressure on our health care system, more 
of a squeeze on the provinces and more difficulties for all of us 
to work together toward ensuring medicare is preserved and we are 
able to enforce the principles of the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is in effect a misrepresentation of the facts.  It 
neither puts new money into health care nor ensures that we will 
continue to allow health care dollars to meet the needs of the 
population as they grow, as they become more intense and more 
serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does that mean?  It opens the door even further to 
privatization and Americanization of our system.  We often hear 
from the Liberal government that it is totally opposed to a two 
tier system of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bad news is we are already there in many ways because of the 
underfunding by the federal government, because of the lack of 
national leadership, because this government refuses to work 
co-operatively with the provincial governments to meaningfully 
reform our health care system from the current institutional, 
illness based models to a community based, preventive, holistic 
wellness model of health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me cite the serious situation we are already in and why we 
are so concerned about the Reform Party policies to actually move 
even further more quickly to a parallel system of health care? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The facts are as follows.  The ratio of public-private health 
costs in Canada has changed significantly over the past 20 years 
with public expenditures shrinking and private spending 
increasing both through group or individual health insurance 
plans and direct out of pocket payments. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1530"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT66"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT66"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1530
<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1975 the spending ratio was 76.4% public and 23.6% private. 
By 1986 it was 73.3% public and 26.7% private.  By 1995 it was 
68% public and 32% private.  By the year 2000 the ratio is 
projected to be 60% public and 40% private. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me raise another important fact.  The cumulative loss to the 
provinces of federal revenue for health care between 1985-86 and 
1995-96 was $30 billion.  Imagine what it would be if we rolled 
into that the dollars taken out of the health care system by this 
federal government since 1995.  The federal share of total health 
care spending has actually shrunk from 30.8% in 1985 to over 25% 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to the claims of many, especially those critics of 
medicare, that Canada's health care system is among the most 
expensive in the world, it should be noted, and this fact is 
often distorted and misrepresented, that Canada actually ranked 
16th among 24 OECD countries in 1994 in terms of public financing 
as a percentage of overall health expenditures.  However, we know 
the situation has actually deteriorated since that time. Canada 
has fallen further and further behind other countries in terms of 
leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The great pride we once held because we had such a model to 
offer the world has been dashed.  Our hopes for holding on to 
medicare and showing it to be a shining light for all the world 
has been dashed because of the failure of federal leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to all those present that the solution is not an 
agenda of negligence as we see from the federal Liberals.  It is 
not an agenda of privatization and Americanization as we have 
seen from the Reform Party.  What is required is a commitment to 
medicare, a commitment to the five principles of the Canada 
Health Act and a determination to begin to reinvest dollars taken 
out of the health care system into a single payer, universally 
accessible, publicly administered health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have indicated loudly and clearly that if there was 
going to be a surplus, which did happen, that the first priority 
for them was to have money reinvested in health care and money 
reinvested in the cash transfer payments to the provinces. As I 
have said in previous debates, that shows an amazing 
understanding and sophistication among Canadians about how this 
complicated system around health care works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our job in this place is to respond to that belief, to that set 
of values and to show leadership.  This bill does not do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An amendment was proposed that would have at least made it 
possible to have a better system to monitor funding for health 
care, to involve Canadians and to involve members of Parliament 
in monitoring the system and in providing a medicare watchdog, a 
medicare alert system for this country.  That amendment was 
defeated.  It was with great regret that we were not able to at 
least accomplish that tiny step forward through this Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals spoke loudly and clearly to their own government. 
They clearly stated in resolution after resolution that the 
present system of health care is underfunded. They begged the 
government to make increased funding for a modern and sustainable 
health care system its highest priority. They presented a 
resolution that was identical to our amendment to Bill C-28 in 
demanding that the federal government develop a process to 
continuously measure and ensure the quality of health care in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals sent this message to the government.  Canadians 
have said with one voice that this is their priority.  All 
provincial governments have said that the first matter of 
business for this government should be to begin restoring 
transfer payments so that it can ensure quality, publicly 
administered, universal programs in areas of vital importance to 
Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have been let down.  The spirit of co-operation has 
been hurt deeply by this government's actions.  It has not been 
enhanced nor helped by the proposals of the Reform Party.  I 
would urge all members to rethink their positions and to support 
our efforts to convince the federal government that reinvestment 
makes sense. It is feasible.  It is the only way we can guarantee 
medicare continues as a model for all the world to see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a question about moving to a more cost effective health 
care system.  We know it is through leadership and co-operation 
both federally and provincially that we can actually start to 
shift our expensive institutional based health care system to one 
that is community based, that provides home care, that addresses 
continuing care needs and that ensures a balanced drug pricing 
policy.  All of that will lead to a much more cost effective 
policy in the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by saying this is a question about our values. It is 
about the faith we have in human life and about ensuring that the 
best health care is available for everyone. That is a matter of 
being a member of a civil society.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
congratulate the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre on 
expressing her concerns in the area of health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She is from Manitoba, and I realize her comments must be based 
on the cuts that had to be made in her province as a result of 
the federal government cutting transfer payments. I know it had a 
major impact in her region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before putting my question to her, I would like to remind the 
House that, in Quebec, cuts in transfer payments for health 
forced the Quebec government to cut back radically, to 
rationalize and move toward ambulatory care, which caused major 
problems to regional health boards and health institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People do not always understand why that is. In Quebec, it is 
obvious to people that managing hospitals and CLSCs is the 
responsibility of the provincial government, and that of health 
minister Rochon in particular. People tend to criticize him. But 
Minister Rochon is really doing his best with what is left after 
transfer payments to the provinces have been cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member, who looked into this, to be 
more specific about the situation in her province, Manitoba. All 
the provinces are affected. 
Yesterday, I saw reports on RDI concerning the Atlantic 
provinces. Clearly, federal cuts have had an adverse effect on 
the management of health institutions in every province in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I would like her to focus on the impact in her 
province, on what she has noticed, and to give us some figures if 
she can. I realize she is not a member of the Manitoba government 
but I am convinced she could give us a good idea so that the 
Quebeckers who are listening can see that the true reason for the 
provincial cuts is the cuts imposed by this insensitive federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member 
from the Bloc Quebecois for his question. This is a very 
important question and I will answer it in English because of the 
complexity of the issue. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is right in addressing this whole question of 
provincial government responsibility vis-à-vis the federal 
government in this area.  The problem we have seen over the last 
while is that the federal government has been able to get away 
with blaming the provinces for all of the crises and all of the 
problems we face in our health care system.  The federal 
government has been abdicating responsibility for the 
developments at that level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the federal government that has taken such a big bite out 
of the funding for health care.  It has put every provincial 
government in a very difficult position. 
In most cases provincial governments are working very hard to try 
to make up for the sudden loss of federal dollars.  They are 
shifting their health care systems almost overnight to make up 
for the dollars lost and to prevent a huge burden on their health 
care systems.

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some provincial governments, and I think specifically of 
Manitoba, seem to be interested in playing the same game as the 
federal government. One example is that the Manitoba Conservative 
government in its last budget promised to put $100 million into 
health care. It turned out that this again was smoke and mirrors. 
In actual fact it was $1.4 million, in real dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many times there is almost a collusion between the federal 
government and some provincial governments for offloading, for 
privatizing, for getting out of the field of health care and 
letting the markets dictate how consumers will be covered under 
health care.  This is something which would happen if the Reform 
Party policies were actually implemented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main concern we have is that the federal government has been 
able to throw up its hands and say “it is not our problem”, 
when it has cut so much money out of the system. Our job today 
through this bill and through every measure at our fingertips is 
to ensure that the federal government is held responsible for the 
actions it has taken, and to require a return to federal 
leadership, a reinvestment of funds and a true co-operative 
spirit in dealing with the health care crisis in the country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I cannot let the hon. member go without making some 
comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She is an NDP member.  She lambasted the Reform Party throughout 
her speech.  There is nobody in this House, not a person who does 
not want to save our publicly funded health care system, even the 
NDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to draw attention to her close colleagues with whom she 
works, the British Columbia New Democratic Party.  The B.C. NDP 
has engaged in what I would call the economic and social program 
destruction syndrome.  The B.C. NDP has foisted it upon British 
Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that province, they who profess, like the hon. member does, 
to uphold the Canada Health Act, willfully acknowledge, aid and 
abet certain people, if they have the money, to queue jump within 
the publicly funded health care system. They allow Workers' 
Compensation Board patients to queue jump within the publicly 
funded health care system.  If someone gets sick on WCB, more 
money is paid and the person goes to the head of the line.  If 
the person is not, too bad, they go to the end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP government, her colleagues, has given British Columbia 
the worst economic performance in the last two years in this 
country.  This is a direct result of NDP economics, voodoo 
economics, destructive economics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where does the hon. member propose to get the money to pay for 
the health care needs which she described we have to come up 
with?  Contrary to her NDP doctrine, money does not grow on 
trees. Where is the money going to come from?  Who will pay for 
it?  Do we have to raise taxes? Money does not grow on trees. 
Where will the member find the money to pay for the health care 
needs we want, given that we have the situation of a balanced 
budget and no extra resources? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, some of the 
comments by the hon. member do not warrant a response but I will 
certainly attempt to answer the broad question he is posing 
today. In effect it is a question that should be turned back to 
that member and all members of the Reform Party.  That party 
wants to talk out of both sides of its mouth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will recall that the Reform Party, notwithstanding the 
remarks of the member for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca and the member 
for Winnipeg North, has called for a reinvestment in health care 
to the tune of $4 billion. That is fairly consistent with the 
kind of recommendation we have been making in this party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that about $4 billion has been cut out of the system for 
health care since 1995. We have suggested that the government 
begin to reinstate that money.  We have not said that it be done 
overnight.  We know we have a surplus situation. It is possible, 
if health care is a number one priority, for the government to 
actually put money back into health care, into the cash transfer 
payment system.

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party made that a major recommendation in the last 
election and in response to the budget.  It is clearly on record. 
The difficulty for us is that on the one hand it talks about 
putting $4 billion back into health transfer payments but then it 
wants to take $4 billion out of equalization, so they will cancel 
each other out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More problematic for us is trying to rationalize the commitment 
of the Reform Party with the more recent statements of the member 
who has just spoken to actually set up a parallel, private, two 
tier Americanized system in this country.  We totally reject that 
approach.  We believe we have the wealth and a commitment from 
the people of this country.  We have a history and a tradition 
that allows us to make health care our number one priority and we 
will actually be able to reinvest money in health care because of 
the balanced budget. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is indeed a pleasure today to speak to Bill C-28, an 
act to amend the Income Tax Act, the Customs Act, the CPP, the 
Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act—the works.  It is 
quite a comprehensive bill, as other members have mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill nibbles around the edges.  There was a great 
opportunity within this bill to provide Canadians with the 
economic ability to be as good as they can be, to save our social 
programs and to ensure that the Canadian economy, the health and 
welfare and the standard of living of Canadians could be much 
better than they are today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our high unemployment rate has been referred to many times in 
this House.  It is the highest unemployment rate among the G-7 
nations.  There is no reason for this.  If we look south of the 
border, the United States has a 4.8% unemployment rate.  We have 
the situation where large numbers of our skilled 
people—economists, nurses, physicians and artists—have left 
Canada and gone to the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From Wall Street to Los Angeles, from Hollywood to Atlanta, 
Canadians have gone to the United States and have dramatically 
improved the health, welfare and economy of Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to keep our trained and skilled people in Canada.  As my 
colleagues in the Reform Party have mentioned, there are ways of 
doing this.  We do not need to reinvent the wheel.  We just need 
to look at other countries such as the United States which has 
managed to drop its tax rate, which has resulted in an 
extraordinarily low unemployment rate and an economy that is 
booming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the measures that have been employed in the 
United Kingdom and New Zealand to ensure that people have the 
best opportunities.  I will get into these opportunities in a 
little more specific way in a moment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I first want to deal with one specific area.  The member from 
the NDP, who spoke at length, castigated us for our views on 
health care.  We have a situation in this country that is causing 
a lot of pain and suffering.  The health care issue is being 
bantered around like a football between politicians for political 
gain, and all the while sick patients, who cannot defend 
themselves, are being sacrificed on the altar of political 
expediency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a sensible debate on the issue of health care.  Making 
utterly false statements, such as somebody wanting an American 
style health care system, is absolute nonsense.  These kinds of 
comments polarize and poison the debate so the Canadian people do 
not have an opportunity to hear the intelligent arguments of both 
sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is that we have limited resources, an aging 
population and more expensive technologies.  Because of this 
governments have been forced to ration.  What is happening right 
now is that the poor are being compromised.  The rich always have 
a choice.  They can go down to the United States, where they 
spend over $1 billion a year to obtain their health care needs. 
One of my colleagues in this party did that and it saved his 
life, contrary to what the NDP member said. 
It is a tragedy that any Canadian has to go south of the border 
to get the essential health care services they require to save 
their life.  We cannot keep sticking our heads in the sand.

</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we solve this problem of limited resources and an 
increasing demand?  Do we continue to uphold the myth that we are 
upholding a Canada Health Act which was a good act when it was 
devised in the 1960s, or do we face the facts and realize that 
the Canada Health Act is being violated in virtually every one of 
its five tenets? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I gave the example in British Columbia that if a person is 
injured and comes under the workers' compensation board the 
Government of British Columbia will ensure that person gets to 
the top of the line over somebody who does not come under the 
WCB.  That is absolutely unfair.  On the other hand, that 
government says it believes in a Canada Health Act and a system 
that is equal and single tiered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it accessible health care for an elderly person who is in 
severe pain to wait 16 months to get a new hip?  Is it accessible 
health care for somebody who needs coronary artery bypass 
grafting to wait six months?  Is it fair for someone who needs a 
20 minute operation on their wrist to wait nine months for that 
operation?  Whichever way you slice it that is not accessible 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are numerous examples in health care in this country today 
which demonstrate that we have a multi-tiered health care system. 
No one in this House, and particularly the Reform Party, wants a 
health care system that is like an American style health care 
system where under certain circumstances people need to sell 
their house.  The purpose of having a separate, privately funded, 
tiered system where only private moneys are exchanged and not a 
dime of public money is used is to ensure that some people in the 
public system who choose to will get some of their services in a 
private setting which is separate and completely different from 
the public system.  That is unlike what happened in the United 
Kingdom and unlike what happens in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that system some people who are rich will get their services 
from the private sector.  Then there will be more money on a per 
capita basis for the public sector.  Therefore the people who do 
not have the wherewithal would have better access and better 
health care than what they have today.  The only purpose in 
proposing this is to ensure that people who are on our publicly 
funded system will have better access.  Is it unequal?  Yes, it 
is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue two things.  We have an unequal system now, but is 
it not better to have an unequal system that provides better 
access for all Canadians than the declining system that we have 
today which compromises the poor and not the rich?  If a 
separate, completely independent and privately funded health care 
system is available, the rich will subsidize the poor.  In this 
way resources can go toward the health care system without 
raising taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith:</B>  Right now we are subsidizing the 
Americans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Exactly.  Right now we are subsidizing 
the Americans by spending over $1 billion down south.  Why do we 
not have private services in private settings and get American 
patients to come to Canada?  They would only have to pay 
two-thirds of the price for their treatment.  They would create 
employment for health care professionals across the board, from 
our techs to our nurses, physicians, cleaning personnel, 
accountants and all the people who are involved in the health 
care system.  This is not only doable, it is pragmatic.  Above 
all, it would save our publicly funded health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our system is very distinct and different from the system in the 
United States.  We unequivocally state that we do not want and 
would fight against that system to ensure Canadians get health 
care services when they are medically needed and to ensure those 
services are not dependent on the amount of money in their 
pockets.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to get away from the silly, senseless, absurd, 
poisonous, vile rhetoric that the NDP has been putting forward 
and have a sensible, constructive debate for the Canadians out 
there who are on waiting lists and suffering.  We have to ensure 
that all Canadians, particularly those who cannot afford it, get 
health care when they medically need it.  We must not leave them 
waiting, and in some cases dying, as is happening now in 
emergency rooms across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Prince George Regional Hospital, where I work from time 
to time, it takes 14 months to get an orthopaedic consultation. 
It takes another six months to a year to get the service.  It is 
not because the surgeons do not want to work, it is because the 
hospital does not have enough money to open up more hospital beds 
and more operating rooms, so surgeons cannot operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine being a physician whose patients come in saying “I have 
torn the ligaments in my knee.  I need a new hip.  I cannot use 
my hand”, and having to reply “I am sorry.  As we speak my 
waiting list just increased from 12 to 14 months because the 
hospital cannot open up the operating rooms, cannot open up beds 
and does not have the nurses to take care of you”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a big myth that Canada has the best health care system in 
the world.  It is bunk.  But we could have the best health care 
system in the world.  We need to have a sensible debate.  We need 
to put all of the minds in this room together.  We need to get 
the best ideas from the public.  We need to look at what has been 
done well around the world.  We need to reject what has been done 
poorly and make the best system in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not take what the Americans have done.  We should not 
emulate the system in the United Kingdom.  We should not emulate 
the system in European countries.  What we should do is take the 
best from all of those countries and make the best health care 
system to ensure that those people who need it will get it.  I 
will end on that particular point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the economy there are numerous things the 
government could do for labour market renewal.  The right to work 
legislation that has been employed in certain countries has 
increased the amount of money in people's pockets by over $2,000. 
It has dramatically increased the amount of companies fleeing to 
areas that have right to work legislation.  The government could 
work with its provincial counterparts to ensure this happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could also remove the egregious surtaxes that 
crush the living daylights out of our private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could take the opportunity to streamline the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could take the opportunity to work with the 
provinces to build national standards in education so that a 
child who moves from Newfoundland to British Columbia or from 
Ontario to Prince Edward Island will be able to integrate into 
that system and get the best education possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could work with industry and the provinces to 
ensure that the educational system knows what the needs of the 
private sector will be in the future.  There is an enormous gap 
in certain areas that could provide high paying, interesting jobs 
for Canadians, but they are not filled because the education 
system has not been able to provide the skilled people necessary 
for those jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Medicine Hat and others have repeatedly 
mentioned the need for lower taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the era of Brian Mulroney one thing that was done well 
was that his government briefly lowered taxes.  What happened? 
The economy was stimulated and government revenues increased. 
What did it do?  It started to tax wildly.  Government revenues 
went down and the economy had a clamp put on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and certain 
European countries have lowered their tax rates and removed 
surtaxes.  They have ensured that people have more money in their 
pockets by streamlining their tax systems.  They have removed the 
egregious rules and regulations that put a clamp on the private 
sector. 
Those were removed, their economy improved, the social and 
economic situation of their people improved and their governments 
had more money to pay for social programs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are references to making amendments to the old age 
security system and the CPP in the bill.  Instead of taking the 
Reform suggestion of ensuring people have a super RRSP and enjoy 
a greater rate of return, the government has stayed with the 
status quo and tried to buttress a system which economists who 
originally devised it said would fail.  This system is like a 
pyramid scheme and will be an abysmal failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CPP system today ensures that Canadians have about the 
lowest rate of return they can have.  It does not ensure that 
young people will have that pension when they retire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not a legacy any government wants to have.  That is not 
a legacy we can be proud of.  Why do we continually try to uphold 
sacred cows that compromise the very health and welfare of 
Canadians?  Why do we not take these sacred cows, these social 
programs which in their very essence are good for Canada, and 
ensure that they are sustainable, that Canadians get the best 
rate of return, and that Canadians have the best social programs 
available to them within the context, confines and economic 
restrictions in our country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP put forth a budgetary plan during the last election 
campaign that ensured a $40 billion deficit.  Money does not grow 
on trees.  We have to face facts.  We have to do what we can do 
within the context of our economic situation today.  Instead of 
nibbling around the edges, the government could have taken 
constructive suggestions from around the world on taxes, rules 
and regulations, educational systems and social program renewal 
and truly built a better future for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Except for trying to ensure that the government will look good 
in the eyes of Canadians, I do not understand why it continually 
tries to support sacred cows which compromise Canadians instead 
of help them.  There are solutions out there.  We must have the 
courage to have a sensible, intelligent, constructive debate in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have spoken at length about other things.  Today my colleague 
raised the issue of the Delgamuukw case in British Columbia, the 
aboriginal treaty situation.  If there is one social group in the 
country that suffers more than any other, it is the aboriginal 
community.  Again, governments have again used it as a sacred 
cow: it is okay to keep paying billions of dollars into the 
system, closing our eyes and saying that we have done our duty 
while aboriginal people in the trenches are suffering from the 
highest rates of abuse, violence and social degradation suffered 
by any group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an abrogation of the responsibility of any government to 
merely pay money without accountability.  Under certain 
circumstances and in some areas those moneys are not going where 
they should be going.  The best we can do for aboriginal people 
in Canada is to work with them to ensure their culture and their 
language will become viable and integrated parts of Canada.  They 
should have the power and ability to stand on their own two feet 
and provide for themselves, their families and their children. We 
must ensure they have the ability to teach us about their 
fascinating culture and legacy that are as integral parts of the 
country as we can imagine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead an institutionalized welfare state has been created 
which has ripped the heart and soul out of aboriginal 
communities.  Some have managed to dig themselves out.  They have 
become self-financing, self-sustaining and self-respecting.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the saddest legacies that we have given is that we have 
abrogated our responsibility in the House by ensuring that the 
institutionalized welfare state we have foisted upon aboriginal 
people continues.  We have to work with them to ensure that they 
have the tools to stand on their own two feet, provide for 
themselves and ensure that their language and culture continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, Bill C-28 had a lot of opportunity but sadly it was 
opportunity lost.  The government failed to seize the day and it 
failed to do what it could have done to truly make the country as 
good as it could be.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Reform Party likes to talk about tax relief for ordinary 
Canadians.  However, when we take a careful look at their 
proposals we see that the Reform Party actually wants to give 
much bigger tax breaks to the very wealthy than to the average 
taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, its election campaign proposal to have the taxes 
owing on capital gains would give the stockbrokers working out of 
Bay Street and earning $250,000 a tax break of over $85,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member agree with his party's platform that it is a 
priority to give someone earning $250,000 a tax refund of 
$85,000?  Is he not afraid that as his party tries to win seats 
in Toronto it will be catering to Bay Street rather than paying 
attention to the grassroots in its own communities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, contrary to the New 
Democratic Party, we listen to our grassroots.  We are not the 
party that has a top down structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know where the hon. member is getting his figures from, 
but I would generously call them a flight of fancy.  We as a 
party have repeatedly put forth constructive, economic solutions 
to get a balanced budget and to produce a surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reasons are simple.  If we spend more than what we take in, 
like the NDP party said during the last election, we create an 
increased debt and increased interest payments and chew away at 
the ability to pay for social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party must understand this important rule. If 
we are fiscally irresponsible we are also financially 
irresponsible.  We in the Reform Party live within our means.  We 
created a plan that I am happy the government and the finance 
minister have adopted to produce a balanced budget.  In so doing, 
we manage to ensure that there is even more money within the pie 
that can be spent on programs such as health and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the New Democratic Party member will come over, see the 
light and try to help us ensure the government continues to have 
a balanced budget and a surplus budget.  We could work together 
to ensure that there is enough money to provide health, 
education, pensions and other social programs to those Canadians 
who are most dependent on them and to ensure they will not be 
suffering.

surely health.  We cannot have two systems, one for the rich and

the entire health system.  Some people find this hard, and it is, 
but it had to be done.  Even the former minister, Marc-Yvan Côté, 
congratulated Mr. Rochon on his courage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that it is wonderful to invest in health.  Cuts have to be 
made somewhere, as the money obviously does not come out of thin 
air.  If anything has to be cut, let it be the Senate, the

transfers to the provinces.  This has caused terrible harm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very often, people wonder why Mr. Rochon took a particular course

He did so because the federal government cut billions of 
dollars, leaving very little with which to manage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to ask my colleague a question.  Can he tell us, in 
concrete terms, how the two systems he is proposing, a private

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B> Mr. Speaker, many Quebeckers go to Ontario for 
medical treatment. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason for this is that the health care system in Quebec is 
falling apart in a dramatic, tragic and sad fashion.  I feel very 
sorry for the people of Quebec and their health care system.  No 
one in that system from the health care professionals to the 
people and I am sure the politicians want that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The big myth that politicians and intellectuals like to push for 
political gain is that we have a single tier health care system. 
That is an utter and complete myth.  I would like to use the 
<I>l</I> word but I will not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Premier Bourassa of Quebec went to the United States to get 
health care for a malignant melanoma, a terribly malignant 
cancer.  What a tragedy.  If the health care system is so great 
why did Mr. Bourassa leave the province of Quebec to get his 
health care in the United States?  At least he had an option. 
Most people in Chicoutimi and la ville de Quebec do not have this 
option.  Neither do people in the rest of the country. They 
cannot afford it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no single tier; there are multiple tiers in this 
country.  There is an obstruction to getting essential health 
care services when they are needed because the government has to 
ration those services for the poor who do not have enough money 
to pay for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is how it would work.  If we had a separate private system 
where only private services are received, where only private 
moneys are put in, where there is no overlap or mixing of the 
private or the public system, we would be able to get more 
resources into health care without raising taxes.  By relieving 
pressure on the public system and having some people going to 
this private system for some of their services because those 
people would access both, we would ensure that there is more 
money on a per capita basis for the public system.  Therefore 
people would get their health care services when they need them, 
particularly those who are impoverished and those who cannot go 
to the United States for health care. That is the beauty of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not an abolishment of the Canada Health Act.  It is a new 
made in Canada health act that will ensure all Canadians get 
health care services when they medically need them.  That is the 
bottom line in health care.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to address Bill C-28, sponsored by the Minister of Finance. Its 
short title is “Income Tax Amendments Act, 1997”. It was 
important to have a short title for this bill, because the full 
title of the French version is 23 lines long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the bill itself, it is a document of 464 pages written in 
an obscure jargon that only tax experts or accountants can 
understand. I strongly suspect that, like me, a large number of 
members of this House did not manage to clearly understand the 
measures included in this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am extremely concerned that legislators like us, most of whom 
have a good education, cannot understand the documents on which 
they have to vote. 
The Canadian Income Tax Act has so many thousands of pages that, 
by comparison, telephone books look like flyers. Moreover, these 
thousands of pages are written in a language that is just as 
obscure as that of Bill C-28. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle of tax equality now only exists in theory, because 
it is impossible for ordinary citizens to understand the act. The 
individuals and corporations that can afford to hire 
administrators, lawyers and tax experts are the only ones who can 
benefit from the multitude of clauses that provide tax breaks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a reason why the Minister of Finance is presenting us 
with an omnibus bill that includes so many complex tax changes. 
The minister is quietly trying to make us pass provisions that 
will benefit the shipping companies he owns. 
He is even trying to cloud the issue.

an international shipping company with subsidiaries in Great

passed at it stands.

conflict of interest, which violates the government's code of 
conduct. 
That is why we demand an explanation and a serious investigation 
of this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the code clearly states that, on appointment to office, 
and thereafter, public office holders must arrange their private 
affairs in a manner that will prevent real, potential or apparent 
conflicts of interest from arising. The code has obviously not 
been adhered to, and we believe the Minister of Finance is at 
fault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's own ethics counsellor, Howard Wilson, who works 
for the Prime Minister, finds this matter fishy. In his 
testimony before the finance committee on February 1998, he 
stated, and I quote “Mr. Martin sponsored this bill and questions 
have been raised by some members that this constitutes an 
apparent conflict of interest. 
Had I been informed in advance, before this bill was tabled, 
there would have been a discussion on how best to handle the 
tabling of the bill under the name of the Minister of Finance, 
who is responsible for all tax legislation. However, this prior 
consideration of our options did not take place as it should 
have”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Wilson also suggests that the Minister of Finance was 
unaware of the contents of Bill C-28 before the Bloc Quebecois 
raised these issues in the House a few weeks ago. Could the 
minister responsible for the Income Tax Act so easily have 
shirked his responsibilities in connection with a bill he was 
sponsoring? And how does the public view a Minister of Finance 
who did not know what was in his own legislation? Is ministerial 
accountability not a fundamental principle of our parliamentary 
system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For several weeks, the government has been denying that the 
Minister of Finance's companies can take advantage of this 
measure but Department of Finance officials, as well as the 
government's ethics advisor, have admitted that Canada Steamship 
Lines could do so in future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Howard Wilson, the government's ethics advisor, stated that same 
day, February 5, 1998, on the CBC that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The company— 
</UL>
<that is to say, Canada Steamship Lines 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—has clearly indicated to me that it has no intention whatsoever 
of making use of this clause. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the company has told the ethics advisor that it has 
no intention of making use of this clause clearly implies that it 
could do so if it wished.  The fact that it does not intend to do 
so at present does not mean that it would not have the right or 
the desire to do so later on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had confirmation of this from the Standing Committee on 
Finance this past February 10, when Len Farber, the Director 
General of the Department of Finance's Tax Legislation Division, 
stated as follows: 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“If the subsidiary or the parent of that company chooses to 
repatriate the management of that company to Canada and operates 
that subsidiary out of Canada, yes, these provisions could be 
available to that company”. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, if a company like that of the Minister of Finance or 
its subsidiaries were to reorganize its administration, it could 
take advantage of the tax benefits in Bill C-28. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some important questions remain unanswered, and the parties in 
opposition are unanimous in calling for the creation of a 
finance subcommittee to investigate this matter thoroughly.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois finance critic, the member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, with the support of the other opposition 
parties, moved five motions before the Standing Committee on 
Finance, so that various witnesses who could shed some light on 
this issue for us could appear before the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These motions asked that people from Mr. Martin's company, 
representatives from the blind trust managing Mr. Martin's 
company, the Minister of Finance himself, and Howard Wilson, the 
government's ethics counsellor, be called as witnesses.  The 
most important of these motions sought permission to call any 
other witness that might help the committee get to the bottom of 
clause 241 of Bill C-28. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Four of the five motions were rejected by the Liberal majority on 
the committee, and the only witness authorized to appear was Mr. 
Wilson, the government's ethics counsellor, an employee of the 
Prime Minister who is paid by Parliament and who reports only to 
the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far, by turning down our requests, the Liberal government has 
prevented us from doing our work as parliamentarians.  The 
government's stubborn refusal to clarify this issue is doing 
nothing to lift the cloud of suspicion hanging over the 
minister, quite the opposite in fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this murky affair, there even seem to have been contradictions 
between the versions given by the managers and the owner of 
Canada Steamship Lines, the Minister of Finance.  On February 5, 
1998, the company's vice-president, Pierre Préfontaine, said on 
Radio-Canada, and I quote “They [the company's foreign 
subsidiaries] are managed offshore. 
They are not subject to Canadian tax law”. On February 6, 1998, 
on page A5 of <I>Le Devoir</I>, the Minister of Finance, Paul Martin, 
said, and I quote “My interests will not benefit from this 
legislation.  My interests are Canadian companies.  They cannot 
benefit”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the mystery deepens.  The vice-president says he is running 
foreign companies, and the Minister of Finance says he has 
Canadian companies.  So, are the finance minister's companies 
Canadian or are they foreign?  Will they, or will they not, be in 
a position to benefit from the tax advantages flowing from Bill 
C-28? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the public needs to be told about Bill C-28 is that the 
Liberal government's Minister of Finance is getting ready to 
pass a bill that he himself sponsored and from which he could 
very likely, one day anyway, benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind you that in their 1993 red book the Liberals promised to 
restore parliamentary integrity.  They wrote, and I quote “There 
is considerable dissatisfaction with government and a steady 
erosion of confidence in the people and institutions of the 
public 
sector.  This erosion of confidence seems to have many causes: 
some have to do with the behaviour of certain elected 
politicians, others with an arrogant style of political 
leadership”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government cannot today allow its Minister of Finance 
to fail to meet the high standards of integrity required of 
people holding public office.  It is deplorable to think the 
Minister of Finance is failing to honour the spirit and the 
letter of the government's code of ethics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc will continue to demand that the government 
respect the people and honour its commitment to restore 
government integrity. 
This is why the Bloc Quebecois is calling for the removal of 
clause 241 from Bill C-28 until all aspects of this matter have 
been brought to light.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I listened to the hon. member 
ramble on and on about clause 241. I just want to put some facts 
on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the amendment Bill C-28 puts forward is an amendment and 
a minor modification of a policy that has been in place since the 
1920s.  The Bloc asked, essentially when this all started, who 
asked for this amendment.  The response it got and the correct 
response is IMC Vancouver asked for this amendment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who benefits?  It treats all foreign shippers alike whether they 
hold their ships directly or through a wholly owned subsidiary. 
How much will this amendment cost Canadian taxpayers? The 
amendment will cost nothing.  It applies to foreign companies 
operating in international traffic.  They are not and never have 
been taxable in Canada.  When she talks about the cost to the 
Canadian treasury, it is nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite all the answers, the Bloc persists with these baseless 
allegations.  It is pure politics.  I hope the hon. member will 
at some point decide in her mind that it has gone far enough.  It 
is completely baseless.  Bloc members keep shifting the goal post 
whenever they get an answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They talk about what Mr. Wilson said in committee.  I was 
present at that committee.  Mr. Wilson said quite clearly that 
there was no conflict of interest, no appearance of conflict of 
interest.  Len Farber from the department, using her words, said 
that the minister could actually reorganize his company in order 
to take advantage of this.  If only the hon. member had the 
capacity to understand what it means to organize and reorganize a 
company.  He would basically have to shut down his entire company 
and reorganize it all over again. It is highly unlikely and not 
the intent of anyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of approach is one that I am sure hon. members in this 
House do not agree with, do not endorse, and certainly Canadians 
will have the final say.  I would encourage the hon. member to 
please, if she would like to debate the bill and the contents of 
the bill, stay away from the baseless politics that she is 
encouraging us to engage in today in this House.  I would be 
quite thankful.  I am sure her constituents would like to see us 
get on with the issues at hand. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will not comment on all the 
remarks my colleague made.  Nevertheless, we agree with the fact 
that there is a marine policy, but it is lost in 464 pages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Minister of Finance has absolutely nothing to hide, he has 
only to let the matter be examined as the opposition parties have 
unanimously requested.  When opposition questions are not 
answered, there is something to hide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague opposite says he was at the committee meeting and 
Mr. Wilson did not say what was claimed.  I was not present, but 
I read the minutes of the meeting. 
If the minutes do not contain the remarks of Mr. Wilson, someone 
who is a member of the committee should read the minutes and 
have them corrected if the secretaries or the clerks have made a 
mistake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not being a committee member, I am obliged to use the tools at 
hand.  The remarks I quoted by Mr. Wilson are in quotes and come 
directly from the minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, if they want to proceed with a real marine policy, they 
should introduce legislation, and we would willingly consider 
it.  We want it.  Canada needs it, but we do not want a grab-bag 
bill, a hodgepodge that will enable the minister to hide things, 
when it is out of the question. 
He should respond to the opposition's request.  A subcommittee 
should be set up and the matter examined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Quebec and Canada are entitled to know if the 
Government of Canada is as honest as it claims to be day in and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have listened to 
the response by the hon. member for Rimouski—Mitis, and find it 
very apt.  I would like to give her the opportunity to add to 
it, because I know she is very concerned about a true 
shipbuilding policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is shipbuilding in my riding of Lévis and this therefore 
concerns me a great deal as well.  I know there are other 
shipyards, for example at Les Méchins in the Gaspé. The hon. 
member is right. The government tried to get clause 241 by us in 
a huge bill that deals with just about everything.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will always remember how, in 1993, when I was a first-time 
candidate for the Bloc Quebecois, the Liberals running in the 
Quebec City region—even the Prime Minister's present executive 
assistant— committed to holding a summit on the future of 
shipbuilding within a year of the election. Here we are five 
years later and still it has not materialized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Shipbuilders Association of Canada had made some 
representations, followed by some suggestions.  The premiers 
followed up on this at St. Andrews last fall.  Mr. McKenna, the 
New Brunswick premier at that time, chaired the conference and 
brought the matter up. 
At the recent Liberal convention, some young Liberals proposed a 
resolution on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, everyone is calling for it, but no, they are trying to get a 
little clause 241 by us, one which the secretary of state says 
will change nothing and will not mean another penny.  Very nice. 
Bills and clauses of bills that provide no one with anything. 
Are we going to swallow that story? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member for Rimouski—Mitis be so kind as to tell me 
whether we, the Bloc Quebecois, really want a shipbuilding policy 
in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, if the Liberal government 
were really aware of the situation and well informed, it would 
know that we urgently need a marine policy in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 70% or 80% of the ships in the world need repairing or 
rebuilding because they are too old.  We need a marine policy to 
create jobs throughout eastern Canada, in western Canada, in 
Ontario, and even in Quebec.  It is vital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague was referring to the suggestion by Ms. Verreault, 
who has a growing shipyard in Les Méchins and who met each of 
the premiers involved in shipyards to try to convince them of 
this need. She managed to convince them all. There is only one 
obstacle in Canada, the president of Canada Steamship Lines. 
What he is after is reductions in taxes so he can have his ships 
built outside Canada, because that arrangement suits him better.

would like to commend the hon. member for her remarks on the 
shipbuilding policy because we too in Atlantic Canada feel there 
is a strong need for a national shipbuilding policy, something 
that will enable all workers who are out of work in the maritimes 
to get busy, be productive in the shipbuilding industry and not 
have to compete with foreign shipbuilders and compete with the 
United States which has its workers protected by legislation.  We 
feel there is a need for the government to take a lead in the 
shipbuilding industry and to put people in Atlantic Canada and 
right across this country back to work.

from the west would say the same thing.  They need shipyards in 
the West too.  We need a government that will show leadership and

need, among other things, good shipyards with the right

</I></B></P><P align=left>The tremendous complexity of the Income Tax Act has been one of 
the Reform Party's concerns from square one.  It is very thick 
and because of the counterbalancing references within the act, 
the administrators of the act in Revenue Canada will frequently 
change their minds after people have filed their returns.  This 
can be a retroactive process.  The process is so complex that 
many ordinary Canadian citizens have to patronize H&R Block or 
other tax preparers to the tune of between $50 and $150 just for 
the simplest income tax returns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mention that at the outset because if we can put people on the 
moon, we should be able to create a tax system that will not 
interfere with people's lives and that will not interfere with 
the way people make money.  To this point in the history of 
Canada, neither the Liberals nor the Conservatives have been able 
to create that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frequently when people like me are in the process of speech 
preparation, we go to clippings.  We extract small portions from 
newspaper clippings.  Every now and then we run into an article 
that is so descriptive that it would be better to simply read it 
into the record.  That is what I will do.  This article by Tony 
Atherton was printed in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> this past week. 
It is entitled “Tax on federal fund could cramp style of TV 
producers”: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>TV producers who rejoiced last month when the federal government 
renewed a $100 million a year programming fund now are worried 
that some of that money might be clawed back through a new tax 
measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A clause buried in the avalanche of housekeeping documents that 
accompanied the budget this month could leave producers 
scrambling to make up hundreds of thousands of dollars in program 
financing on the verge of a new production season. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be at least 10 days before the departments of revenue 
and finance can clarify whether TV shows which receive money from 
one arm of the government-sponsored Canada Television and Cable 
Production Fund (CTCPF) are subject to a new measure which would 
reduce the federal and provincial tax credits, says fund 
president Gary Toth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Speed is of the essence, and both revenue and finance are very 
sensitive to that,” Toth said.  The CTCPF will begin accepting 
funding applications from producers in mid-April, and by then 
producers will need to know whether the change will affect their 
program budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>[The Liberal MP for Parkdale—High Park] says the potential 
effect of the new tax clause was identified by the TV industry 
shortly after the budget papers were tabled.  The new initiative 
reduces tax credits available to taxpayers who receive not only 
direct government subsidies, but also indirect subsidies.  The 
concern is that the money distributed by the production fund as a 
way of topping up a broadcaster's licence fee for a TV program 
could be viewed as an indirect subsidy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If so, says Toth, producers could see their production tax 
credits erode by as much as four per cent of overall production 
budget. That would amount to a shortfall of several hundred 
thousand dollars on a major prime-time series. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“We want to make sure that was not the intention of that 
section,” says [the member for Parkdale—High Park], a member of 
the parliamentary heritage committee. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I complete reading sections from this article, I will say 
it is so typical of the way things happen with the Liberals.  The 
heritage minister comes forward with the topping up of the cable 
production fund while the finance minister and his ministry are 
doing things that would potentially take money back from that 
cable production fund. 
It shows that the right hand does not know what the left hand is 
doing.  More important, for ordinary Canadians, for the people in 
coffee shops who will have tax bills and complete their returns 
for April 30, this is yet another example of how unnecessarily 
complex the tax regulations in Canada are.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Returning to the issue of tax status, the uncertainty about tax 
status is one of the concerns that has been dogging the $200 
million a year production fund since the heritage minister 
announced in February that the government would continue 
contributing its half of the pot through to the year 2001.  The 
other half of the fund's resources would come from the cable 
industry and Telefilm Canada.  New subjective guidelines for the 
fund aimed at encouraging more distinctively Canadian programming 
were introduced this month to the dismay of some producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where we get to the very substantive difference between 
the Reform Party and the Liberal Party.  The Liberals will do 
their social engineering through their tax law.  For example, 
they reduced the option of choice for parents as to who will stay 
home, if anyone will be staying home, to look after children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals with their tax policy simply eliminate that choice. 
They force people to make decisions on the basis of taxes that 
are having effects on families that are outside the control of 
families.  That is wrong.  Taxation policy should not be aimed at 
social engineering.  Clearly that is what the Liberals are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this case we are looking at what I call cultural engineering, 
the attempt of the heritage minister to manufacture Canadianism 
through whatever means she is doing and then running into direct 
conflict with the taxman, with Revenue Canada.  The Liberals have 
a bad enough history in social engineering.  I hate to see what 
they are doing in the area of cultural engineering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the changes may mean.  The changes mean that only 
programs to which the industry refers as super Canadian shows, 
programs with little or no foreign investment, distinctively 
Canadian themes and creative personnel, can expect to get as much 
money from the fund as they did last year.  Some programs deemed 
not sufficiently Canadian will not be able to apply for it at 
all, for instance a drama or children's program based on a game 
or toy that is ineligible for funding unless the toy or game was 
created and developed by a Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That stipulation has Vancouver's innovative computer animation 
company Mainframe Entertainment in a lather.  Its Saturday 
morning cartoon <I>Beasties</I>, developed and produced in Canada 
but based on a toy developed by U.S. toy manufacturer Hasbro, was 
set to begin shooting a third $8 million 13-episode season this 
spring.  New guidelines rendered the series ineligible for 
funding and about $2 billion short of its budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Producer Linda Schuyler, president of the Canadian Film and 
Television Producers Association, says that while the changes 
will hurt some producers this year, especially those in 
animation, they are reasonable.  She says that their cartoon 
series associated with a brand name U.S. toy is arguably more 
likely to recoup its cost on international sales and should have 
less need for the fund.  In terms of the general philosophy of 
the fund, she really stands behind it.  If they have to make the 
fund's modest amount of money go a long way, to take a 
pro-Canadian stance is absolutely correct, she says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is exactly the kind of cultural micro engineering I am 
talking about.  When we end up in clear conflict with the social 
and cultural micro engineering of the Canadian heritage minister, 
we run into direct conflict with what she is doing under the fund 
in attempting to micro manage the creative side of Canadian 
companies and artists, our Canadian creative community. 
She is attempting to micro manage and push them in particular 
directions only to find that there is a conflict under the 
provisions contained in Bill C-28.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no conflict between two parties.  There is no conflict 
between the opposition and the government.  This being Canada, 
when the government is a majority government and in power it has 
the right to propose legislation.  With all the closure and 
stifling of debate in this place, it not only has the right to 
propose but it takes upon itself the right to dispose of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a government that has total control over its own 
affairs.  Yet, how ridiculous, how ludicrous it is that we end up 
with the heritage minister and her proposal for her Canadian 
television production fund in direct conflict with the finance 
minister and his provisions.  It is nonsensical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing I have learned in the time I have been in Ottawa is 
that usually if I have a simple answer it is because I did not 
understand the question.  In other words, often we do not realize 
the complexity of issues until we first get into them.  Surely 
the heritage minister and the heritage ministry with its 
thousands of employees must have been able to understand or be 
aware of what was happening in the finance department. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is really scandalous is that Canadian production companies 
are now put at the disadvantage at the very start of their 
production period of not knowing what their bottom line will be. 
Why?  It is because the heritage minister does not talk to the 
finance minister, or at least their departments certainly do not 
talk to each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come back to the key issue.  We can talk about the very 
laughable situation of two departments getting all muddled up. We 
can talk about the fact that the companies that are dependent on 
this are now in a big quandary as to what they will do as they go 
into their production year.  That is not laughable to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The core issue is why in the world we have the complexities of 
the delivery of programs that are put forward consistently by 
this government and governments before it.  Why can they not 
apply their creative talent, their genius that creates all sorts 
of ways of grabbing more and more money out of our wallets, to 
simplifying the tax system so that everyone in Canada will have 
an opportunity to understand the tax form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One tax form which I think was applicable to the Liberals was a 
very simple two line form.  It said to list the amount of money 
earned this year and the next line was to send it to Ottawa. That 
is really the direction these people seem to be going in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendments add to the layering, the complexity and 
the confusion we all have in Canada over taxation.  That in 
itself stifles us as creators of wealth and as earners of income. 
It stifles our ability to buy running shoes for our children.  It 
stifles our ability to have enough money to pay our mortgage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The overlaying of rules and regulations within the tax 
department to which this bill adds is one of the major causes of 
frustration for people involved in small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give members an idea of the complexity of the tax system, I 
will talk about a situation I had in my constituency a few years 
ago. 
A number of my constituents who own ranches were in a position a 
few years ago with a downturn in cattle prices to be able to sell 
trees off their ranches that could be turned into lumber.  The 
reason those two things happened to dovetail together was the 
rather boneheaded policies of the NDP in British Columbia 
relative to tree harvesting licences and all the rest of it.  The 
mills were facing a real shortage of wood.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ranch owners went to their accountants.  Let us note that 
they did not all go to the same accountant.  Some went to CAs and 
some went to CGAs; it was all over the map.  Some of the public 
accountants contacted the Penticton taxation office and asked for 
advice.  “How should the income from these trees be treated by 
these ranchers?”  The answer was that it was a capital gain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps, Mr. Speaker, with your being a businessman you would 
know the terminology better than I do.  It was based on the fact 
that it was a capital gain as opposed to income from the ranch. 
That was the way they filed their taxes, independent of each 
other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of my constituents are people in their sunset years.  They 
are 70 and 80 year old people who are trying to hang on to their 
piece of property.  They did not know at the time that Revenue 
Canada would come back and retroactively say that it had lost too 
much money and was going to reassess them not on capital income 
but on a form of income to their ranches.  It made a difference 
in many cases of $15000, $30,000 and even $70,000 of taxes owing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents are honest, law-abiding, taxpaying Canadian 
citizens.  Because of the overlaying of the complexity which 
currently exists within tax law, Revenue Canada retroactively 
taxed these people.  In many cases they were faced with the harsh 
reality they just might be taxed off their land in spite of the 
fact that they complied with all of the rules of Revenue Canada 
at the time they paid their taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This cannot stand.  This must be changed.  I am having meetings 
with the revenue minister over this issue because it is not fair, 
right or moral to tax people retroactively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cite in my capacity as heritage critic this example of the 
confusion that exists within our tax laws between the heritage 
department and the Minister of Finance which must be cleaned up 
immediately.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of the 
hon. member across the way with respect to the film tax credits 
and the situation he described. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to point out to the hon. member that there is an 
underlying principle that says one cannot do indirectly what one 
can not do directly.  Therefore, if one cannot do something 
directly, one should not be able to get around it some way and do 
it indirectly.  That is an underlying principle with which I am 
sure the hon. member would agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the cable television and cable production fund, 
I had the opportunity to meet with representatives from this 
group.  They have submitted information for the department to 
look at so that any of the moneys they would receive from the 
fund would be treated as licence top up fees rather than 
subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened is that the finance department has agreed to 
take this information under consideration and provide 
transitional support for this group so that any principal 
photography commenced before August 31, 1998 would not be 
affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really appreciate the fact that the hon. member brought this 
matter to the attention of the House because it is a very 
important issue.  I want to reassure him that the government is 
very much committed to the production and entertainment industry. 
It certainly affects his province specifically.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I also appreciate the 
comments of my Liberal colleague but it does not really do away 
with the point of my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point of my speech is that tax law in Canada is so 
overlayered, overburdened and unfair.  We have a heritage 
minister who does not know what is going on with the finance 
minister and vice versa.  It does not really do away with that 
point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do respect the fact that the finance department is taking this 
under advisement.  However if I were a business person in the 
film and television production business, I would take only small 
comfort.  I would want to know what my bottom line was going to 
be.  Would I potentially be treated in exactly the same way that 
the ranchers in Kootenay—Columbia have been treated where 
something is going to be done retroactively? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must straighten up the tax law.  We must simplify the tax 
law.  I do not see any action or direction to simplify the tax 
law by the Liberal government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to rise this afternoon to 
address Bill C-28, the income tax amendments act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation relates to income tax measures 
announced in the February 1997 budget and other income tax and 
related measures. Many of the proposed provisions are technical 
in nature and pertain to the numerous tax code amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a housekeeping bill which amends at least 18 different 
pieces of legislation.  Some hon. colleagues on both sides of the 
House have referred to all of those pieces of legislation which 
the bill amends.  In that sense it is an all-encompassing bill. I 
am sure it is hard for the people at home viewing this debate to 
relate to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To use the term of the hon. Liberal member across the way, we 
need to look at the underlying principle.  The underlying 
principle, to assist people who are watching to have a better 
understanding of the debate, is taxes.  There is nothing that 
raises the ire of the Canadian citizen more than the issue of 
taxes.  Having recently gone through an election campaign and all 
of us in this place having participated in all-candidates forums 
leading up to the June 2 election we are well aware of how 
important this issue is to Canadians from coast to coast to 
coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Never before in the history of our nation have Canadians been so 
concerned about this single issue of taxation.  That is why it is 
very appropriate that members are given the opportunity to speak 
on the issue today and to lay out as clearly as possible what 
they hear in their ridings and the views of their constituents. 
After all that is fundamentally why we are in this place.  We try 
to represent the views of our constituents and participate in 
open debate debate on these issues to bring forward different 
points of view and hopefully end up with legislation that is in 
the best interests of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  If they would listen to the voice of 
reason. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  That is right.  If the government would 
listen to the voice of reason from all sides of the House, even 
in some cases from the government's own backbenchers when they 
are trying to represent the interests of their constituents. 
Perhaps then the government and the cabinet would put forward 
better legislation from the various departments which would have 
genuine grassroots support across the nation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the interesting issues I heard loud and clear during the 
last election campaign, in consultation with constituents and in 
letters, e-mails and faxes that come to all of us as members of 
Parliament, which really angered the general public is the whole 
issue of payroll taxes.  When we talk about taxes we cannot just 
talk about income tax in isolation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The GST is another tax which has angered many people ever since 
the Mulroney government brought it in a number of years ago.  We 
have debated as to whether there was a commitment made by the 
Liberal government in the 35th Parliament to actually end that 
tax, to abolish, scrap, get rid of the GST.  We have had that 
debate.  Very clearly the average Canadian understood that there 
was a commitment.  Yet the GST is still in place even though we 
have now achieved a balanced budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are desperately seeking genuine tax relief and they 
are told once again by the government to wait a little longer and 
perhaps they will have some tax relief. Once again we see broken 
commitments, broken promises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the Canada pension plan and the huge increase Canadians 
are facing. There will be a 73% increase over the next five years 
in their Canada pension plan premiums. We see this government 
stand up and brag about what we feel and the average Canadian 
feels are relatively minor cuts to the EI, the employment 
insurance premiums.  The Liberals say it will create more jobs 
and it is their way of offering some genuine tax relief to 
overtaxed Canadians. That is going to be more than made up for by 
the increase in the Canada pension plan premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is not fooling anyone.  In travelling throughout 
the riding of Prince George—Peace River and in talking to my 
colleagues as they continuously consult with their constituents 
on this and other issues, I can say that average Canadians are 
not fooled by this.  The wool has not been pulled over their eyes 
on the issue of taxation. They know full well what they can 
expect in the future, which is more of the same. Canadians are 
fed up with being taxed to the extent that they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a huge social cost to the whole issue of the debt and 
taxes which by and large this government for whatever reason is 
missing.  It is missing the social cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party and the Liberal Government of Canada 
constantly hold themselves up as the defenders of the 
downtrodden.  They have tried to perpetuate this Liberal image 
that they are there for the poor, they are there for the 
handicapped, they are always there defending the rights of the 
less fortunate in society. In actual fact the exact opposite is 
true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is this government's overspending that has threatened the 
very fabric of the nation.  There is a huge social cost. Even as 
we speak today we really do not understand all the ramifications 
of this policy of continually raising taxes and until this year 
continually increasing the national debt and the interest we pay 
out every year on that debt.  There is the inability of this 
government to make a firm commitment in this year's budget to put 
forward a concerted plan on how to deal with the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard the finance minister and the Prime Minister make 
statements about the $3 billion contingency fund which as I 
pointed out a number of years ago during the last Parliament in 
communications with my constituents is simply a slush fund. It is 
a $3 billion fund set aside for the use of the finance minister. 
If the interest rate rises unexpectedly or something goes wrong, 
or there is an act of God and commitments have to be made, the 
finance minister has this $3 billion set aside. 
During the budget debate the government quite generously said 
that if it does not need the $3 billion, it is going to put it 
toward the debt.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Most Canadians are capable of doing the arithmetic.  This 
country is almost $600 billion in debt.  When I talk about 
billions of dollars, I always try to bring it back to what most 
of us can understand.  A billion is such a huge number. We throw 
it around all the time in this place, a billion dollars here, a 
billion dollars there, a $3 billion contingency fund.  What does 
it mean?  For us to really understand that, we have to remember 
that a billion dollars is a thousand million dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am getting up in age.  I am certainly well aware of that today 
after the hockey game last night. The MPs played against the 
pages and we were really reminded about how old we are getting. I 
can remember when $1 million was a lot of money and it does not 
seem like that long ago.  When we talk about a debt of almost 
$600 billion, that is six-hundred thousand million dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine winning a lottery.  The 649 wins are now around $10 
million.  At one time $1 million generally was the first prize 
and it seemed like a lot of money.  To me $1 million still seems 
like a lot of money.  We used to think about becoming a 
millionaire.  Imagine.  Our debt is the equivalent of 600,000 
Canadians, and there are not anywhere near that of course, 
winning $1 million.  Then they could pay off our debt.  That puts 
in context the size of the debt, the burden we are soon to hand 
over to the younger generation, to our children and our 
grandchildren. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government talks about using the $3 billion contingency 
fund, it is laughable.  As I said, just about anybody can do the 
arithmetic.  If the government is serious about that, at that 
rate it is going to take almost 200 years to pay down the debt. I 
do not call that much of a plan to attack the huge burden of the 
national debt.  It is a grave disservice and an insult to the 
upcoming generation that is saddled with the highest taxes, as we 
are, in the G-7 on personal income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My eldest child is in her second year at university.  My two 
younger children are growing up quite rapidly.  I am trying to 
imagine them looking at the situation in this country and what 
hope there is for a future for them and for all the thousands of 
other young people.  It is an embarrassment quite frankly for our 
generation.  We should think about that.  We should be ashamed of 
the mess our generation has made of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the country that was handed to us by our fathers who 
came through the second world war and into the 1950s and 1960s. 
The opportunities I had when I graduated high school in 1970, 
almost 30 years ago.  The world was at our feet.  We had all 
sorts of opportunities.  There were very reasonable levels of 
taxation for the services that were available.  There were all 
sorts of job opportunities.  Anybody who really wanted to get 
ahead certainly had the opportunity to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the future does not look that great for young Canadians. 
My hat is off to them that they are as optimistic as they are. 
Talking with the young pages here, their optimism and enthusiasm 
about the future is incredible when you see the obstacles that we 
as a generation and governments have placed in their path for the 
future.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to tell a story about my riding of Prince George—Peace River. 
This story relates to the high burden of taxation not only at the 
federal level but also at the provincial level.  Part of the 
riding of Prince George—Peace River is the B.C. Peace River area 
which geographically is east of the Rocky Mountains.  It is cut off 
physically from the remainder of British Columbia.  It is kind of 
an anomaly.  I do not know who was responsible. A lot of people 
think we are from Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ironically, there has been a recent initiative, largely because 
of taxation levels, that the people of the B.C. Peace would like 
to join Alberta for some obvious reasons.  It really highlights 
this whole issue.  People can only be taxed to a certain level, 
then we are going to have some open rebellion in one form or 
another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A dear friend of mine in my riding, Short Tomkins, a good 
Reformer but also a duly elected regional district director, had 
put forward a motion to circulate a petition to try to generate a 
referendum for the people of the B.C. Peace to secede from 
British Columbia and join Alberta.  That northeast corner of the 
province generates billions of dollars in taxes for the federal 
government and the provincial government.  Yet in many regards it 
is a forgotten corner of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is virtually ignored.  We hardly have a decent road to drive 
down in the Peace River district despite the fact that all the 
oil and gas industry in the entire province of British Columbia 
is in the B.C. Peace.  There is a large forestry sector there, 
pulp mills, sawmills.  We have two very large hydroelectric dams 
that provide power to the rest of British Columbia.  We have 
natural gas with the gas pipelines providing the heat for the 
lower mainland of British Columbia.  We have two large coal mines 
at the town of Tumbler Ridge providing coal for export.  It is 
a very resource rich region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet what we see in that area is that the infrastructure is 
failing because the taxes are being drained out of the area to 
Ottawa and Victoria and very little is ever put back.  We forget 
about that.  It is treated like a colony in the old days where we 
just take and take and never put anything back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very indicative of a lot of the problems inherent in 
Canada today.  This huge taxation is what is causing a lot of our 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked early about the social costs.  I am reminded that as we 
address the issue of crime in the country today we often think of 
it in isolation.  We try to think of what the problem is.  What 
are the root causes of criminal activity and some of these 
horrendous crimes we hear about?  Today we are all aware of the 
recent tragedy down in the States where school children were shot 
and murdered by two other young people, an 11-year old and a 
13-year old. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the issues of crime, instead of looking at them 
in isolation, I have often remarked that one of the reasons I 
believe we see an increase in violent crime is we have a 
breakdown of the family structure in this country.  One of the 
reasons we have that breakdown in the family structure is 
directly attributable to the insatiable appetites of governments 
at all levels for taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is more and more families, regardless of whether one 
of the parents would like to stay at home to raise the children 
in the home, find they cannot.  If they are going to provide any 
semblance of a decent standard of living, with our high taxation, 
both parents must go outside the home to work.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There are exceptions.  I am encouraged by the increase in at 
home businesses.  Many parents, in particular women, are 
developing their own niche markets for certain products so they 
can work from home and try to balance the responsibilities of 
parenting and providing a higher standard of living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is the high taxation policy of this and preceding 
governments is failing the Canadian people.  It is contributing 
to the horrendous social cost for all of Canadian society.  We do 
not fully understand the price we are paying and the price future 
generations will be paying for the high tax policy of this and 
other governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before we go to 
questions and comments, I am sure the hon. member for Prince 
George—Peace River was too polite to mention that the MPs did 
whip the pages six to five with the heroic goaltending of Mr. 
Clouthier, the son of one of our members. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my colleague talked about payroll taxes.  He mentioned 
that one of the largest payroll taxes is the 73% increase over 
the next four years in the Canada pension plan contributions.  Do 
the young people in his riding he has talked with about this 
increase know that in spite of the fact that they will pay 10% of 
their earnings into the Canada pension plan for their whole 
lifetimes they will receive less than a 2% return on their 
lifetime investments?  If they are, are they prepared to continue 
supporting a program that makes them pay a lot for a little? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for 
her comments.  They are appropriate as we are discussing the 
budget and tax issues.  The hon. member is right on the mark with 
her comment.  The intergenerational transfer of the burden of 
maintaining the Canada pension plan is one of the most horrendous 
things we are dealing with in this Parliament in relation to 
payroll taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election campaign and since we have become the 
official opposition the Reform Party has laid out very specific 
alternatives.  These alternatives are continually gaining more 
and more support, in particular from young people.  The hon. 
member is quite correct.  The word is leaking out among young 
people that they will no longer be fooled by the Liberal 
government that tries to say we will protect you. We are going to 
wrap you in this cloak of security, we are going to look after 
you in your old age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member says, in reality they will be getting somewhere in 
the neighbourhood of a fifth out of the program.  That is 
supposing the program can be sustained without future increases, 
which is not all that clear despite the assurances of the finance 
minister and others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is young people are becoming more knowledgeable of 
these issues.  They are coming to understand there has to be a 
better way than constantly increasing the premiums of the Canada 
pension plan and forcing them to bear the heaviest load of 
maintaining that program.  They are coming to understand that 
they will have to bear the load of the horrendously high levels 
of taxation because of past mistakes of successive governments 
with government overspending that has taken place in the past.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member agrees with her colleague from 
Calgary—Nose Hill who said the system is unfunded, there is 
nothing there so we have to decide how we are going to pay.  We 
need to look at things such as increasing the age at which 
benefits are payable.  We need to look at some of this unfunded 
liability coming out of general tax revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member agrees with his colleague who is out 
there promoting the fact that we should be increasing taxes, 
personal income taxes and corporate income taxes, increase taxes 
in order to deal with this particular issue.  This government 
decided to consult with Canadians and provinces and we came up 
with a program to sustain the CPP.  It is a staged increase in 
premiums to ensure Canadians have the sustainability of the plan.

to face ridiculous allegations like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member knows full well that this party, the official 
opposition, has been constant in our demand to reduce taxation. 
For him to suggest in any way, shape or form that we are 
suggesting Canadians are prepared or that we are prepared to 
advocate an increase in taxes in any form is absolutely 
ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think what my hon. colleague from Calgary—Nose Hill, our 
critic on those issues, was referring to was that there would be 
perhaps some support from the Canadian people for allocating some 
of the surplus, as we move past the balanced budget, toward 
bringing down the roughly $485 billion unfunded liability that is 
currently in the Canada pension plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not saying we have to raise taxes.  What we are saying is 
that we should spend our money more wisely.  We have been 
advocating this ever since Reformers in substantial numbers came 
to this place following the 1993 election.  We have been saying 
we have to set some clear priorities. Instead of spending $1.1 
billion annually on regional development programs, which in many 
cases are just payoffs to political friends, we have to allocate 
our limited resources in a very prudent manner.  We do not see 
that from this government.  We saw that very case leading up to 
this budget.  All of a sudden magically this government says it 
has $2.5 billion to spend on a millennium fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where did that money come from?  We have through our constant 
questioning during question period been able to get the Prime 
Minister to admit that the auditor general is right, that the 
$2.5 billion would have been a surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In reality we as a nation collectively could have made a 
decision as to what the best way was to spend that $2.5 billion. 
In defence of the government perhaps the official opposition 
would have been wrong. The wisdom of the Canadian people would 
have been to take 100,000 students out of 1.7 million 
post-secondary students and develop a fund for them, a millennium 
fund for scholarships for them.  I do not think it would have. 
Perhaps they would have said that $2.5 billion should have gone 
to paying down some of the Canada pension plan unfunded 
liability.  I think that is the type of thing my hon. colleague 
is suggesting.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CHILD BENEFIT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK242">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 5 consideration of the motion 
and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is with pleasure that I rise to speak 
to Motion No. 198, which is a motion to amend the child benefit. 
I am pleased to have the opportunity to join any debate where I 
can denounce the Liberal government for its high tax policies and 
increased use of stealth taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are debating here, another stealth tax that this 
Liberal government is using to fill its tax coffers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A person needs to review the history of the child benefit to 
fully comprehend what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1985 Tory finance minister Michael Wilson set out to reduce 
the children's tax exemption and to increase the refundable child 
tax credit for lower income families.  In the 1985 budget he 
introduced a 3% threshold for full indexing.  The benefit would 
only increase if inflation exceeded 3% in any given year.  That 
was not a concern in the 1980s, as the lowest rate of inflation 
in that decade was in 1985 when it was 3.9%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1988 the children's tax exemption was replaced by a 
non-refundable credit.  In 1991 Canada was in the midst of a 
recession.  By 1992 the inflation rate had dropped below 3%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, the last year of the Tory government, the three major 
child benefit programs were replaced, which were the family 
allowance, the non-refundable child tax credit and the refundable 
child tax credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That government replaced them with a single income tested child 
tax benefit that is similar to the old refundable child tax 
credit.  It meant that the maximum benefit would go to families 
with a net income under $25,921. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the threshold effect.  Since inflation has 
not topped 3% since 1991 that means that neither the amount 
families receive for the child benefit nor the income tax level 
at which people can collect the maximum benefit have been 
adjusted for inflation, yet inflation has risen by a cumulative 
amount of 10% since 1991.  That means that the real value of the 
child benefit has been reduced by 10%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The non-indexing of the threshold level to receive benefits 
means that many families whose income has just kept up with 
inflation are now receiving lower benefits. 
This is the true legacy of this government:  stealth tax.

<A HREF="#LINKT90"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By not allowing full indexing, this government saves money by 
allowing the real value of the benefit it pays out to decline. 
By not indexing the income threshold, it means that more families 
are collecting lower benefits and paying more taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the only place this government is using stealth tax 
technology.  I mentioned it the other day when I was talking 
about bracket creep.  I would like to make a comparison using 
that.  Bracket creep occurs when an individual's pay rises to the 
point where they enter a higher tax bracket.  While salaries have 
inched up over the past six years, the tax brackets have not. 
Like the child benefit payments and income thresholds, tax 
brackets are only adjusted when the consumer price index rises by 
3% or more in any given year.  Thus, individuals whose salaries 
have just kept up with inflation often find themselves in a 
higher tax bracket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It looks like we have developed a pattern here.  However, what 
is even worse than allowing this to happen is the fact that this 
Liberal government is doing it deliberately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his budget speech the finance minister made it clear that 
this is a deliberate move and that he intends to continue with 
this practice.  He stated “Upon coming into office, the 
government and the Bank of Canada agreed to hold inflation inside 
a range of 1% to 3% to the end of 1998.  That policy has worked. 
That is why we are announcing today that we will extend the 
current agreement with the Bank of Canada for a further three 
years”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thus, this government has made it perfectly clear that it 
intends to keep gouging the Canadian taxpayer in this fashion. 
Where is this government's commitment to child poverty? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would appear that the Liberals only believe in fully indexing 
pensions when it comes to their own gold plated MP pensions and 
those of their political cronies in the Senate.  They think that 
someone like former Senator Andrew Thompson, who showed up for 
work only 12 times in the past 8 years, deserves full indexing of 
his pension.  They think it is fine for someone like Thompson, 
who received $600,000 in taxpayers' money over the last eight 
years, or $50,000 for every time he appeared in the Senate, to 
receive an indexed pension.  They have no problems that a man who 
rarely ever showed up for work should now be receiving $48,000 a 
year in a fully indexed pension.  That is almost twice what the 
average Canadian wage earner receives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals eagerly support full indexing for Andrew Thompson, 
but when it comes to single mothers or low income families they 
are against full indexing.  Members on the government side of 
this House should be ashamed of themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings us to the motion currently before the House, M-198, 
and the attached amendment.  The original motion read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should review 
the level at which the child benefit is indexed. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, I think the Liberals have already reviewed the 
level at which the child benefit is indexed and they like it just 
fine.  Full indexing would cost this government millions of 
dollars in tax revenue and that could lead them to actually 
having to make cuts.  They might even have to lay off a few of 
the political hacks they have appointed to patronage positions or 
they might have to take away the full indexing of Andrew 
Thompson's Senate pension. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amended version of the motion reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should review 
the possibility of fully indexing the child benefit. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure this government has reviewed the possibility of fully 
indexing the child benefit.  If I were a betting person, I would 
say that the possibilities of the government agreeing to it are 
slim or none. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member for Shefford for her motion and her 
efforts to make the child benefit fairer. 
I assure her of my support and hopefully the support of my 
colleagues.  But unless a few government members find their 
consciences and live up to their commitment to battle child 
poverty I do not see this government rushing to create a fair tax 
system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak to Motion M-198, moved by my colleague, the 
Progressive Conservative member for Shefford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should review 
the level at which the child benefit is indexed. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member for Shefford for giving us an opportunity to 
discuss the important problem of child poverty and to ask the 
government to devote more resources to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is ironic, however, is that it was her own party, the 
Progressive Conservative Party, which decided, when it formed 
the government, to index the child tax benefit only when 
inflation exceeded 3%.  The Liberals, who so vigorously opposed 
this measure when they were in opposition, maintained it when 
they won office, and have stuck with it since. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result of this Conservative and Liberal policy is that, since 
1992, the child tax benefit has not been indexed.  During this 
time, inflation is driving up the cost of living of families, who 
see their buying power being slowly eroded.  Collectively, 
families have lost over $800 million.  They are distinctly worse 
off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague, the member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, moved an 
amendment to this motion asking the government to review the 
possibility of fully indexing the child benefit. 
I am in complete agreement with my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now, the poverty of children and families is serious.  It 
is obvious that the child benefit must be fully indexed.  Large 
amounts should also be reinvested quickly, not just to increase 
the tax benefit, but also to reinvest in social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at a few statistics, which will give us an idea of 
what poverty means in this country.   According to Campaign 
2000, the changes that have occurred since the federal 
government's commitment in 1989 to eliminate poverty among 
children are as follows: the number of poor children has 
increased by 46%; poverty in two-parent households has increased 
by 39%; the number of single-parent families has increased by 58%; 
the number of children living in families where unemployment is 
chronic has risen by 44%; the number of children in families 
receiving social assistance has increased by 6%; finally, the 
number of children living in unaffordable accommodation has 
increased by 60%.  These figures speak for themselves.  The 
problem is extremely serious.  Poor children today number 1.5 
million, one child in five. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past 20 years, the number of double-income couples, the 
number of working mothers with young children and the number of 
single-parent families have increased relentlessly.  The parents 
of young families are better educated, but their jobs are not 
stable and are often part time.  Most of the time they do not 
provide benefits.  In 1990, in 70% of couples with school age 
children, both parents work, whereas the figure was 30% in 1950. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years, the average family income has stagnated, and in 
low income families, it has even dropped.  In its December 1997 
report, Statistics Canada indicated that low income families, 
which make up 20% of the population, had seen their family income 
decrease by 3% because of the drop in incomes, but especially 
because of the drop in government transfers, which account for 
59% of their income.  Under the Liberals, the poor have become 
poorer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to face the facts: Canada's performance in providing 
support for families and children is pretty weak, in the words 
of the Canadian Council on Social Development.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The council explains that, in a comparison between Canada and 
nine similar countries, Canada ranks second behind the United 
States in child poverty, according to market income, and third 
in total income, behind the United States and Australia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Faced with such figures, what have the Liberals done since they 
became the government?  Instead of vigorously attacking the 
problem of worsening poverty, they have reduced transfers to the 
provinces for social assistance and are proposing that families 
be given the bare minimum for survival. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is going so far as to suggest that they seek charity.  Yet, in 
the first Liberal red book, in 1993, Jean Chrétien wrote 
“Government must be judged by its effectiveness in promoting 
human dignity, justice, fairness and opportunity”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to his own criteria, then, the Prime Minister's 
government is not a good one, for it allows millions of children 
to languish in poverty, jeopardizing their health and 
development, to the great despair of their parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of equipping themselves with a true social development 
policy, the Liberals are settling for managing poverty by 
throwing a few crumbs from time to time so that people can keep 
their heads above water and to make the government look good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1997 budget, the Minister of Finance suddenly discovered 
the serious problem of child poverty in Canada. 
He described it as the most urgent problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year's budget announces a $425 million increase in the child 
tax credit effective July 1999, with another $425 million to 
follow in July 2000.  For July 1998 there is nothing more than 
has been announced ad nauseam for the past two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois campaign platform called for an extra $1.15 
billion to be invested immediately in the child tax credit.  The 
minister had the necessary financial leeway to do so, since he 
shows no reticence about invading as sacrosanct an area of 
provincial jurisdiction as education with his millennium 
scholarships, to the tune of $2.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not, therefore, any lack of money that is keeping the 
Liberal government from fighting poverty, because when 
visibility is at stake, it can easily find $2.5 billion in its 
coffers. 
The real problem with this government is its lack of political 
choices.  Poor children do not vote, but university students do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say that child poverty is not an isolated phenomenon 
and any fight against it must provide support for families 
through employment, social security and community support 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Institute of Child Health last year considered that 
the best way to improve the standard of living of children was to 
establish a national job creation strategy for adults with family 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance claims to be helping poor families by 
increasing the maximum deduction for child care from $5,000 to 
$7,000 or from $3,000 to $4,000, according to the age of the 
child.  This measure is totally unfair, because, for the same 
$1,000 of child care, a high income family gets a lot more than 
does a low income one. 
Poor families whose income is so low that they do not pay any 
taxes do not benefit in any way from this change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, the Bloc Quebecois proposed that the child care 
deduction be replaced by a refundable tax credit, which would 
have resulted in poor families receiving a cash payment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government may be able to keep on ignoring the 
public's suffering, and refusing to reinvest in social programs 
to improve the lot of the most disadvantaged, but it could at 
least agree to full indexation of the child tax benefit so that 
they do not sink even deeper into poverty.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker,  I 
am very pleased to speak today in support of the motion of the 
hon. member for Shefford which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should review 
the level at which the child benefit is indexed. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP has already gone on the record in speaking to the motion 
as fully supporting it.  We also support the amendment put 
forward by the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin my remarks by saying the year 2000 is very close.  I 
begin in that way because the year 2000 has very special 
significance in the House of Commons, not just because it is a 
new millennium but because back in 1989 members of the House 
unanimously passed a motion sponsored by Mr. Ed Broadbent, the 
then leader of the New Democratic Party, that by the year 2000 
child poverty would be eliminated in this country.  It is now 
1998, nine years later, and the situation has not only not 
improved.  It is appallingly worse than it was nine years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very happy the motion is before us because it addresses in 
a very small way one thing that could be done to ensure the child 
tax benefit, put forward and agreed to by the provinces, would be 
fully indexed.  Campaign 2000, a non-governmental organization 
made up of many supporting groups, has vigorously campaigned on 
the issue of child poverty and holding the House of Commons 
accountable for the motion that was passed in 1989.  Much work 
has been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are today still talking, not about fully eliminating 
child poverty but about one very small piece of it.  In fact the 
child tax benefit is only partially indexed.  What that says to 
all of us is that we have not come very far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I looked in <I>Hansard</I> to find out what government members 
had to say about the motion during its first and second hours of 
debate.  Frankly I assumed that government members would support 
something so modest that would bring us a bit closer to making 
sure the benefit was accessible and meaningful to low income and 
poor families.  Regrettably that is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the Liberal members who spoke to the motion in the first 
round of debate said “Let us not forget that with an inflation 
rate of 1.6% per year restoring full indexation of the child tax 
benefit would cost the government about $160 million per year”. 
He went on to say that such revenue losses could threaten the 
government's programs to restore fiscal balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the threat to Canada's poor children?  What about the 
threat to poor families suffering from the impact of years and 
years of slash and burn approach by this government?  What about 
the threat to kids who are still living in a world where they 
cannot access programs, where they do not have adequate housing 
and where government programs are being cut back?  Now we are 
living in an environment of increasing poor bashing.   What does 
the government member have to say to those kids, the 1.4 million 
children in Canada who are living in poverty? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is astounding because this is the same government that claims 
it wants to stop poverty for children and deal with poverty in 
Canada.  This is the same government where the Minister of Human 
Resources Development said in a committee meeting late last year 
that the child tax benefit was the greatest social policy since 
the 1960s.  If that is true, why cannot government members find a 
measly $170 million to protect poor families from inflation by 
fully indexing this benefit? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read further from <I>Hansard</I> the comments of other 
government members who spoke to the issue and who were trying to 
explain and rationalize why they could not deal with it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 5, 1998 one member said “Second, there is a 
trigger.  The Income Tax Act states that the child tax benefit 
will be indexed each year by the amount which the annual change 
in the consumer price index exceeds 3%.  This policy of partial 
indexation is consistent with the treatment of most other 
parameters of the personal tax system and is respectful of the 
fiscal problems which are facing the federal government.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have another government member who is trying to defend 
what is really an appalling record by saying that the kids of 
Canada and poor families have to be respectful of the problems 
the government created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Canada, groups like Campaign 2000 and other 
anti-poverty groups like the National Anti-Poverty Organization 
are simply appalled at the government's record.  The kids of 
Canada and their parents who are facing unemployment and massive 
EI cutbacks will be delighted to hear that they need to be 
respectful of the government's problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that the child tax benefit is being used as a 
political shield by the government.  The government wants to hide 
behind the reality of poverty in Canada.  The political 
grandstanding that has gone on in this issue by government 
members is simply disgusting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The child tax benefit has now been announced four times.  It is 
obvious the government will not provide adequate funds to index 
the fund.  There was no announcement in the budget we just dealt 
with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier today when we were debating Bill C-28, the income tax 
amendments, there was reference to the so-called increase in the 
Canada health and social transfer from $11 billion to $12.5 
billion.  We know that it is not an increase at all.  There is 
not one new dime, not even a penny, going back to the provinces 
in terms of transfers.  It is simply a shell game being conducted 
by the Liberal government. It is the same kind of shell game that 
has gone on with the child tax benefit.  This so-called new 
increase is a recycled announcement that the latest cuts will not 
come into effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing is clear.  Poverty among Canadian children and 
families will not be eliminated by the kinds of measures that 
have been put forward by the government.  What we need to see is 
a recommitment to national standards.  What we need to see is 
full indexation of the child tax benefit.  What we need to see is 
an increase in the child tax benefit to poor children living in 
one parent families so that the benefit will not be lower than 
what they would have received under the 1996 federal budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to ensure that all poor families receive the child tax 
benefit, including families on social assistance.  Under the 
government's program those families, the poorest of the poor, 
will be excluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to pressure the federal government to commit to a 
new national child care program, an early education plan and 
150,000 new child care spaces by the year 2000.  What happened to 
the promise from this Liberal government and the former Liberal 
government to create a national child care program?  That too has 
evaporated.  As my hon. colleague says, the election is over and 
it is back to the same old dirty business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the NDP are committed to holding the government 
accountable.  We are committed to working with organizations in 
Canada to ensure that the government is held accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is real disappointment about the performance on the child 
tax benefit.  In fact government members—and there are the empty 
rows here today—are not even listening to the debate.  The 
motion was an opportunity for the government to come forward and 
say that it would ensure full indexation at least on this small 
basis.  Unfortunately that has not been the case. There is real 
disappointment over this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to pressure the government to ensure there is 
full indexation of the child tax benefit.  I thank the member for 
bringing forward the motion.  It has been good to hear support 
from other parties.  We have to keep the pressure up on the 
government to come through and say, if it is truly committed to 
eliminating child poverty by the year 2000 as members voted in 
1989, that it has to take this one very small step.  We have to 
take other steps as well, but this one in a very minimal way that 
will at least ensure full indexation and that poor families will 
not be losing pace with inflation.

</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
December 11, 1997, I asked a question to the minister of defence 
concerning the process taken for the rescue of survivors of the 
Little Grand Rapids tragic crash.  I asked the minister to 
explain why his department had failed to enlist locally available 
helicopters in this rescue, as was the case with the Red River 
flood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The twenty hour wait for a rescue plane endured by the Little 
Grand Rapids plane crash victims was a result of what I believe 
is botched decision making by search and rescue operations. 
Officials had access to helicopters at the Canadian forces flying 
training school in Portage, la Prairie.  However, they chose 
instead to try to use a plane to rescue survivors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those same helicopters were used during the Red River flood. 
They could have helped this time too.  Instead of using those 
nearby helicopters, the military sent helicopters from Cold Lake, 
Alberta which never made it to the crash site. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The end of 1997 did not go quietly.  Another plane crash 
occurred in Fredericton, New Brunswick.  It was a miracle that no 
one died in that crash.  This incident has made people aware of 
how cuts and downsizing may be affecting airport safety.  But let 
us go back to the Little Grand Rapids crash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have questioned the minister on the process of this rescue but 
that crash worries me in relation to other issues.  There is no 
question that this fatal plane crash demonstrates the importance 
of having better landing facilities in isolated areas.  When air 
is the only mode of transportation in and out of a community, it 
is an absolute must that the landing facilities be in the best 
conditions possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The landing strip in Little Grand Rapids had been described as 
the worst in northern Manitoba long before the crash.  It is well 
known that its surface is uneven and gives pilots the impression 
that their angle of approach is too steep.  The crash on December 
9 was the third fatal plane crash to happen in Little Grand 
Rapids.  The limited services to response measures in remote 
communities make it even more important to have a safe 
infrastructure. The plane was carrying one doctor and four social 
service workers who were travelling north to provide treatment 
for northern residents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was annoyed when the Reform Party suggested that a private 
helicopter went in to save the injured.  It went in for one 
reason.  He was taking in reporters to get a story.  Had the 
intent been to help the injured, medical help should have gone 
with him, not a reporter.  However, once they were there it only 
made sense to send out the most injured, and he is to be 
commended on that note. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did search and rescue workers not avail themselves of those 
local resources?  Do they not have that flexibility?  Lately we 
have received an alarming report concerning the rescue in Little 
Grand Rapids.  The report states that the hercules rescue plane 
dumped more than 10,000 gallons of fuel at less than 600 feet 
within three miles of the runway.  I understand the normal 
procedure is to dump it at no less than 5,000 feet.  This is to 
allow for dispersion of the fuel and to decrease the risk of 
ignition.  The fuel would be less concentrated on the ground or 
wherever it landed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister mentioned in the House that this was done to save 
lives and that the weather conditions were not good enough to 
follow the guidelines.  Nevertheless, when the dumping occurred 
the hercules had gone below the fog.  It had cleared somewhat. 
The crew knew the ceiling had lifted and that the most critically 
injured had already been flown out. Was the option of taking the 
time to fly to the height requirement ever considered?  Was the 
community informed that this was not the usual procedure? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most critically injured were flown out by a private 
helicopter which landed before the hercules.  The helicopters 
nearby could have landed as well and the injured would not have 
had to wait 20 hours to be rescued.  Was the best option used 
during this rescue?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the incident that 
occurred last December in Little Grand Rapids was tragic.

<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that despite the difficulties that were encountered 
as a result of the bad weather at the time lives were saved. 
Everyone who contributed to the rescue, including the RCMP, the 
Canadian forces and the local community of Little Grand Rapids, 
should be applauded for their efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the hon. member has asked why the Canadian forces did not 
hire a civilian aircraft to assist with the rescue.  As the hon. 
member knows, poor weather conditions were a key factor in this 
rescue.  Immediately after the Canadian forces were notified of 
the accident a hercules aircraft from Winnipeg and a Labrador 
helicopter from Trenton were tasked to proceed to the site of the 
accident.  The hercules aircraft was airborne with nine search 
and rescue technicians on board but poor weather hampered its 
ability to land immediately in Little Grand Rapids. 
Nevertheless, it circled the area in the hope that the weather 
would clear and it could land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the poor weather the Canadian forces did manage to 
deliver much needed medical supplies by parachute which offered 
some relief to those involved in the rescue.  Due to time, 
distance and weather conditions, the Labrador helicopter in 
Trenton was stood down and two griffon helicopters from Cold Lake 
were tasked to proceed to the site.  Unfortunately they were 
unable to make it due to bad weather. A Labrador helicopter and a 
second hercules aircraft remained on standby in Trenton ready for 
immediate take off if needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian forces did what they could to assist with the 
rescue.  The Canadian forces decided not to hire a civilian 
aircraft to assist with the rescue because the crew of the 
hercules had advised that the weather conditions at Little Grand 
Rapids were severe and that a helicopter would have extreme 
difficulty flying into the site.  In other words, the Canadian 
forces determined that to send a civilian helicopter into the 
area would have placed the helicopter and its crew at undue risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end, under the circumstances Canadian forces search and 
rescue personnel did everything they could in order to save 
lives.

<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in the budget of 1996 this government proposed changes 
to the old age security, the guaranteed income supplement, as 
well as the elimination of the retirement income tax credit and 
the seniors tax credit based on age.  These proposed changes 
were, for reasons known only to Liberal spin doctors, called the 
seniors benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many seniors quickly realized that they would not benefit at 
all.  Instead they would be heavily taxed on their retirement 
savings.  Marginal tax rates on retirement savings could reach 
75%, far higher than the maximum marginal tax rates imposed on 
working Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members can well imagine the anxiety and consternation this 
proposal has created among Canadian seniors as well as those 
trying to make sensible decisions about saving for retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite numerous questions in this House from the official 
opposition as well as other parties, the government has done 
nothing to relieve or diminish the concerns of Canadians about 
their retirement security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On February 23, I asked the minister to provide some assurance 
to Canadians that this government will abandon its proposed 
clawbacks and taxes on Canadians' retirement savings of as much 
as 75%.  The response from the parliamentary secretary was “wait 
for the budget”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members and the Canadian public know, there was nothing 
in the budget the next day about the seniors benefit that would 
reassure seniors or those planning for retirement.  The 
parliamentary secretary would have been well aware of that 
omission when he evaded my question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was over a month ago; one more month with Canadians left in 
limbo, left totally in the dark about what this government might 
or might not do to finalize its announced cuts to seniors 
programs and clawbacks of retirement savings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is simply this.  When will the government end this 
terrible uncertainty? 
<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am most pleased 
to respond to the member for Calgary—Nose Hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member could not be farther off base when she says this 
government has done nothing.  This government has done much and 
is continuing to do more.  As she will see in my answer, this is 
what we intend to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed seniors benefit will slow the future growth in 
public pension costs by targeting benefits to the low and middle 
income seniors who need the benefits the most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last fall we took time to consult extensively with seniors 
groups, social groups and pension industry experts on the 
proposed seniors benefit.  Meetings were held from Halifax to 
Vancouver.  We listened carefully to the issues that were raised 
and the concerns that were expressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is currently reviewing the 1996 proposal in light 
of those consultations in order to ensure that the best possible 
policy is brought forward.  We expect to bring forward 
legislation in the coming months. When legislation is introduced 
in the House, there will be further opportunity for public input 
during parliamentary committee hearings.

benefit.  It is vital that we ensure public pensions are there

<P><A NAME="LINK255"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, a 
short time ago I asked a question regarding the concept of job 
creation through energy conservation and the energy retrofitting 
of the federal government's some 50,000 publicly owned buildings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea is based on the concept that we can benefit in many 
ways from the demand side management of our energy resources and 
the increased commitment to the concept that we should be doing 
everything we can to embrace this concept for any number of 
reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first obvious reason is that the federal government could in 
fact save as much as 30% to 50% in operating costs.  All the 
evidence shows that huge gains are possible in streamlining our 
energy use in our federally owned buildings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second reason is that we can reduce the wasteful use of 
energy.  We can also reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions 
which obviously should be of some concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third benefit, the most obvious one and the reason I raised 
the question, is that we have the opportunity to create thousands 
and thousands of jobs in the building trades, in engineering and 
in the manufacturing of all the technology that goes into high 
tech and state of the art energy efficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The study we conducted with the carpenters union shows that 
there are between three to seven times the number of person years 
of employment in energy retrofitting as there are in new 
construction.  This should be of great interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last point is that every time we undertake a comprehensive 
energy retrofit of a building, the ambient indoor air quality 
benefits to such a degree and all the evidence shows that there 
are fewer days of sick time, people are more productive and they 
feel healthier.  The best and most graphic example of this is my 
own staff who suffer because of the air quality in the Wellington 
building.  It is one of those old, dated federal government 
buildings that could benefit from an energy retrofit program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I raise this now and the reason I am hoping the 
federal government will embrace this idea is that all of the 
above can be achieved at no upfront cost to the taxpayer.  Many 
private sector financiers are anxious and willing to finance the 
upfront costs of this energy retrofit at 100%. The property 
owner, in this case the government, then pays the financiers back 
slowly out of the energy savings, and only if there are energy 
savings. It is an idea whose time has come and it is too good to 
ignore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason we should be showing the world how to live in a 
harsh northern climate in the most effective way possible is the 
unbelievable benefit in terms of the engineering and technology 
associated with energy retrofitting. We could be marketing it 
around the world and exporting our expertise in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A unit of energy harvested from the existing system is 
indistinguishable from a unit of energy produced at a generating 
station, except we can preclude the need to build more generating 
stations at a huge cost.  We could harvest these units of energy 
and resell them to other customers or export that energy to the 
United States or to wherever we want to sell that energy. This is 
another good reason environmentally why we should be doing 
everything we can to use our energy resources in a better way.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's answer to my question was that there already 
was a federal building initiative which was undertaking to try to 
energy retrofit federal government buildings.  My problem with 
the federal building initiative is that it has been ponderously 
slow.  It has only affected a handful of buildings.  The red tape 
or bureaucracy involved is such that many of those investors have 
found it impossible to participate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking the federal government to release a block of 
buildings of 100 or 1,000 at a time, to get this thing under way 
and to put some people to work.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased for the 
opportunity to speak about energy efficiency in federal 
government buildings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must rest assured that the FBI program will not be cancelled. 
It has met with such success that NRCan is working to expand it 
in co-operation with the provinces, municipalities and the 
private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this week I participated in an FBI announcement in Place 
Vincent Massey in Hull, Quebec, with three of my colleagues.  The 
federal government is committed to a 20% reduction from 1990 
levels of greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2005 within its 
own facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal departments are delivering on this commitment through a 
number of energy efficiency programs administered by the office 
of energy efficiency.  The FBI program is one of these.  The FBI 
is an initiative developed by NRCan to assist government 
departments and agencies to improve the energy efficiency of 
their facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is estimated that once fully implemented in all government 
facilities the FBI will result in the creation of 20,000 jobs, 
the reduction of energy costs by $160 million annually, 
investments in the order of $1 billion, and untold market 
opportunities and environmental benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, we are hoping to use energy efficiency programs such 
as the FBI as catalysts for a more vibrant economy.
